the DLLCA.

(d) The officers of Buyer holding office immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the officers of Buyer as the Surviving Company immediately
after the Effective Time. The officers of Buyer immediately prior to the

any, between the Estimated Net Working Capital and Net Working Capital
Target; and

(v) _plus (minus)_ the positive (or negative) value of the difference, if
any, between the Company Indebtedness and Company Indebtedness Target (such
sum, the " _Closing Cash Consideration_ ").

(c) _Payment of Closing Consideration, Escrow Shares, Company Indebtedness and
Transaction Expenses_. On the Closing Date, Buyer shall make the following
payments and deliveries:

Shares), which Stock Consideration shall be issued under a valid private
placement pursuant to Section 4(2) promulgated under the Securities Act;

(iii) Buyer shall contribute on behalf of Seller the Escrow Shares to the
Escrow Agent to hold subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), which Escrow
Shares shall be issued under a valid private placement pursuant to Section
4(2) promulgated under the Securities Act;

(iv) Buyer shall, in its sole discretion, (A) assume in all respects, or (B)
pay, or cause to be paid, on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the
amounts of Company Indebtedness indicated on _Schedule 2.01(f)(xi)_ , such
payment to be made as determined in the payoff letters delivered pursuant to
_Section 2.01(f)(xi)_ by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
Persons or bank accounts specified in such payoff letters; and

 

(v) Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, on behalf of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, the Estimated Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, which shall

Business Days prior to the Closing Date, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the Persons or bank accounts specified on the Closing
Certificate.

 



-3-  (d) _Estimated Net Working Capital and Net Working Capital Target_. Between
the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Company shall keep Buyer reasonably
informed regarding its preparation of the calculation of Estimated Net Working
Capital and Net Working Capital Target pursuant to this _Section 1.02(d)_,
and shall consider in good faith any comments made by Buyer with respect
thereto.

(e) _Closing Certificate_. Within five (5) Business Days, but in no event
less than three (3) Business Days, prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Buyer and Parent a certificate, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer (the " _Closing Certificate_ ") setting
forth: (A) the Net Working Capital Target, (B) the Company Indebtedness and
(C) the Companys reasonable good faith estimate as of the Closing Date of (i)
the Company Transaction Expenses that remain unpaid (the " _Estimated Unpaid
Company Transaction Expenses_ "), and (ii) the Estimated Net Working Capital,
together with a schedule setting forth the Companys calculation of the
Estimated Net Working Capital and Net Working Capital Target.

(f) _Post-Closing Adjustments_.

 

(i) As promptly as possible, but in any event within ninety (90) days after
the Closing Date, Buyer, at its sole expense, will deliver to Seller: (A) an
unaudited, consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ") and (B) schedules
setting forth (i) a calculation of Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date
in the same manner as the calculation of the Estimated Net Working Capital and
the amount, if any, by which the Net Working Capital is less than or greater
than the Estimated Net Working Capital, (ii) a calculation of Company
Indebtedness and the amount, if any, by which the Company Indebtedness is less
than or is greater than the Company Indebtedness Target, and (iii) a
calculation of the Company Transaction Expenses that remained unpaid as of
the Closing (the " _Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses_ ") and the amount, if
any, by which the Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses are less than or greater
than the Estimated Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, in each case duly
certified by Buyer as setting forth Buyers good faith determination of the
information set forth therein, and together, in each case, with reasonable
supporting documentation (together, the " _Closing Statement_ "). The Closing
Statement shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the definition of the
term "Net Working Capital" set forth in this Agreement and under GAAP, as
applicable, and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, applied on a
basis consistent with that employed in the preparation of the audited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of December
31, 2011. The Closing Statement shall disregard: (x) any financing or
refinancing arrangements entered into at any time by Buyer or any other
transaction entered into by Buyer in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; and (y) any of the plans, transactions or
changes which Buyer intends to initiate or make, or cause to be initiated or
made, after the Closing with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries or
their respective businesses or assets, or any facts or circumstances that are
unique or particular to Buyer or any of its assets or liabilities.

(ii) Buyer, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries shall grant Seller and
his authorized representatives reasonable access to all such papers and
documents and all such personnel as it or its representatives may reasonably
request, and Seller shall have up to sixty (60) days after receiving the
Closing Statement to review the Closing Statement (the " _Review Period_ ");
_provided_ that, in the event Buyer, the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries
do not provide, in all material respects, any papers or documents or access to
personnel reasonably requested by Seller or any of his authorized
representatives within five (5) Business Days of request therefor (or such
shorter period as may remain in the Review Period), the Review Period shall be
extended by five (5) Business Days plus one (1) Business Day for each
additional day required for Buyer, the Company or its Subsidiaries to so
respond to such request.

 



-4-  (iii) To the extent that Seller confirms his acceptance of the
Closing Statement within the Review Period or has not objected in writing to
the calculation of Net Working Capital, Company Indebtedness and/or Unpaid
Company Transaction Expenses on the Closing Statement prior to the end of the
Review Period, the Closing Statement and the calculations of Net Working
Capital, Company Indebtedness and Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses thereon
as prepared by Buyer shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the Parties
hereto.

 

(iv) If Seller has any objections to the Closing Statement, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer a statement (an " _Objections Statement_ ") describing in
reasonable detail those items and amounts to which Seller objects (the "
_Disputed Items_ ") prior to the end of the Review Period. Seller and Buyer
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the Disputed Items, but if they do
not reach a final resolution within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the
Objections Statement to Buyer, Seller and Buyer shall submit any unresolved
Disputed Items to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP;  _provided_ that, if
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is unable or unwilling to serve in such capacity,
Seller and Buyer shall submit any unresolved Disputed Items to an alternative
mutually agreed upon independent accounting or valuation firm of national
reputation (PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or such alternative firm, the " _Firm_
"). Each party may furnish to the Firm such information and documents as it
deems relevant, with copies of such submission and all such documents and
information being concurrently given to the other party. Seller and Buyer
shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Firm
to resolve such unresolved Disputed Items and notify them in writing of such
resolution as soon as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days
after the date on which the Firm is first retained. In resolving any disputed
item, the Firm shall resolve each item of disagreement based solely on the
supporting material provided by Buyer and Seller and not pursuant to an
independent review, and may not assign a value to any particular item greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by either Party or less than the
lowest value for such item claimed by either Party, in each case presented to
the Firm. The decision of the Firm regarding each of the Disputed Items shall
be final, binding and non-appealable by the Parties hereto. Each party shall
bear its own costs and expenses in connection with the resolution of such
dispute by the Firm. The fees and expenses of the Firm shall be borne on a
proportionate basis by Buyer and Seller based on the inverse proportion of the
respective percentages of the dollar value of Disputed Items determined
in favor of Buyer and Seller, respectively. Seller, on the one hand, and
Buyer, the Surviving Company, and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand shall,
cooperate fully with the Firm and respond on a timely basis to all requests
for information or access to documents or personnel made by the Firm, all
with the intent to fairly and in good faith resolve all Disputed Items as
promptly as reasonably practicable. Once all Disputed Items are resolved, the
calculation of the Net Working Capital, Company Indebtedness and/or Unpaid
Company Transaction Expenses on the Closing Statement, as the case may be,
shall be adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect (A) any resolution of Disputed
Items as agreed between Buyer and Seller; and/or (B) any determination of
Disputed Items by the Firm, and the Closing Statement and the calculation of
the Net Working Capital, Company Indebtedness and/or Unpaid Company
Transaction Expenses thereon, as the case may be (in each case, as so
adjusted) shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the Parties hereto.

(v) Within ten (10) Business Days after the final determination of the Net
Working Capital, Company Indebtedness and Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses
and the Closing Statement or the failure of Seller to timely file an
Objections Statement pursuant to the provisions of this  _Section 1.02(f)_,
(i) the Net Increase in the Closing Cash Consideration, if any,

 



-5-   shall be paid by Parent to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available
funds or (ii) if there is a Net Decrease in the Closing Cash Consideration,
the amount of such Net Decrease in the Closing Cash Consideration shall be
paid by Seller to Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

 

(vi) All payments required pursuant to this _Section 1.02(f)_ shall be deemed
to be adjustments, for Tax purposes, to the aggregate Merger Consideration
paid by Buyer for the Company Unit purchased by it pursuant to this Agreement.

(vii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Parties
hereby agree that any amounts collected after the Closing Date with respect to
accounts receivable on the Closing Date Balance Sheet that are aged ninety
(90) days or more from date of invoice shall be delivered to Seller by wire
transfer in immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller.

 

1.03 _The Closing_. The closing of the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the
offices of Reed Smith LLP, located at 225 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania 15222, on the third (3rd) Business Day following satisfaction or
waiver of all of the closing conditions set forth in _ARTICLE 2_  hereof
(other than those which by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing),
or on such other date as is mutually agreeable to Buyer and Seller. The date
of the Closing is herein referred to as the " _Closing Date_." The

recent Form 5500 Annual Reports for each Plan (including attached schedules
and audit report, as applicable). Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.13(b)_ ,

or the Code.

 



-23-  (c) Each Plan has been operated and administered, funded and maintained, in
form and operation, in all material respects in compliance with its terms and
all applicable requirements of ERISA and the Code and applicable Law. With
respect to each Plan, no Person has entered into any nonexempt "prohibited
transaction," as such term is defined in ERISA or the Code, and there has not
occurred any reportable event (within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA,

could be reasonably expected to have any liability with respect to any
employee benefit plan, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent,
which (i) is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of
ERISA, or (ii) is subject to the funding requirements of Section 412 of the
Code or Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA. No material liability under Title IV

Company or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring or being subject (whether
primarily, jointly or secondarily) to a material liability thereunder, and
none of the assets of Company or any ERISA Affiliate is, or may reasonably be

than the Company that, together with the Company or any Subsidiary, is
considered under common control and treated as a single employer under Section
414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code. No Plan provides or other Contract

Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or Section 4980B of the Code or under a
similar applicable state law).

Financial Statements in compliance with GAAP.

claims (other than routine claims for benefits uncontested by third parties),
suits, actions, disputes, audits or investigations with respect to any Plan.
Each of the Plans is subject only to the Laws of the United States or a
political subdivision thereof.

amount of, or result in the forfeiture of compensation or benefits under any
Plan, (ii) none of the Plans obligates the Company or any Subsidiary to pay
separation, severance, termination or other benefits solely or partially as
a result of any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement does not
obligate Company or any Subsidiary to make any payment, accelerate or
otherwise provide any benefit as a result of a "change in control", in each
case such that the payment, acceleration or provision of the benefit could be
characterized as an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of such term
under Section 280G of the Code.

-44-  6.08 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_. The Parties agree as follows:

 

(a) Seller and each of Sellers Affiliates (together, the " _Restricted
Parties_ ") agree, for a period of three (3) years after the Closing Date
(the " _Non-Competition Period_ "), that they shall not, directly or
indirectly, either for himself or for any other Person, own, operate, manage,
control, engage in, participate in, invest in, permit its name to be used by,
act as consultant or advisor to, render services for (alone or in association
with any Person) or otherwise assist in any manner, any Person that engages in
or owns, invests in, operates, manages or controls any venture or enterprise
which directly or indirectly engages or proposes to engage in any product or
service of the Company as of the Closing Date. Nothing herein shall prohibit
the Restricted Parties from: (i) being a passive owner of not less than five
percent (5%) of the outstanding stock of any class of securities of a publicly
traded corporation engaged in such business, so long as Seller has no active
participation in the business of such corporation; or (ii) performing
any services for Parent, Buyer or the Surviving Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries post-Closing.

(b) During the Non-Competition Period, the Restricted Parties shall not
directly or indirectly through another Person: (i) induce or attempt to induce

the Company or any such Subsidiary, or in any way interfere with the
relationship between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any employee
thereof; (ii) be involved in hiring or hire or employ any person who is or was
an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (iii) call on, solicit
or service any customer, supplier, licensee, licensor, franchisee or other

or indirectly acquire or attempt to acquire any business which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has identified to Seller as a potential acquisition
target (an " _Acquisition Target_ "), or take any action to induce or attempt
to induce any Acquisition Target to consummate any acquisition, investment or
other similar transaction with any Person other than Parent, Buyer or the
Company post-Closing. Nothing herein shall prohibit the Restricted Parties
from performing any services for Parent, Buyer or the Surviving Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries post-Closing.

 

(c) If, at the time of enforcement of this _Section 6.08_, a court shall hold
that the duration, scope, geographic area or other restrictions stated herein
are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the Parties agree that the
maximum duration, scope, geographic area or other restrictions deemed
reasonable under such circumstances by such court shall be substituted for
the stated duration, scope, geographic area or other restrictions.

(d) Each Restricted Party recognizes and affirms that in the event of breach
by it of any of the provisions of this _Section 6.08_ money damages would be
inadequate and Parent, Buyer and post-Closing, the Surviving Company, would
have no adequate remedy at Law. Accordingly, each Restricted Party agrees
that Parent, Buyer and post-Closing, the Surviving Company shall have the
right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in their favor,
to enforce their rights and each Restricted Partys obligations under this
Section not only by an action or actions for damages, but also by an action or
actions for specific performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief in
order to enforce or prevent any violations (whether anticipatory, continuing
or future) of the provisions of this Section (including, without limitation,
the extension of the Non-Competition Period by a period equal to: (i) the
length of the violation of this _Section 6.08_; _plus_ (ii) the length of any
court proceedings necessary to stop such violation). In the event of a breach
or violation by any Seller of any of the provisions of this _Section 6.08_
the running of the Non-Competition Period (but not of such Sellers
obligations under this Section) shall be tolled with respect to such Seller
during the continuance of any actual breach or violation.

(e) Each Restricted Party acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the restrictions
contained in this _Section 6.08_ are reasonable in all respects (including,
without limitation, with respect to the subject matter, time period and
geographical area) and are necessary to protect the value of capital stock or
other

 



-45-   equity interests of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries (including,
without limitation, the goodwill related thereto) being acquired hereunder;
(ii) the Restricted Parties are responsible through their prior efforts for
the creation of such value and goodwill as of the Closing Date; and (iii)
Parent and Buyer would not have consummated the transactions contemplated
hereby without the restrictions contained in this  _Section 6.08_.

(f) The Parties hereto acknowledge that the covenant not to compete described
in this  _Section 6.08_ is incidental to, and protective of, the Companys
goodwill acquired by Buyer and Parent pursuant to this Agreement and thus the
Parties hereto have allocated no portion of the Closing Consideration to such
covenant and further agree to report the allocation described in this
_Section 6.08_ consistently to the IRS.

the terms of any such proposal and the identity of the maker thereof).

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Closing, Parent
may, directly or indirectly through its authorized representatives, (i)
furnish information and access, to any Person making an Acquisition Proposal
to Parent which was not solicited, initiated, knowingly encouraged or
knowingly facilitated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, Affiliates or
representatives and (ii) may participate in discussions and negotiate with
such Person concerning any such unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, if and only
to the extent all of the following conditions are met: (A) Buyer and Parent
have not breached this _Section 7.09(b)_ in any respect with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal, and (B) the Parent Board determines in good faith, after
receipt of advice from outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal (defined below).

(c) At any time prior to the Closing, and subject to Parents compliance at
all times with the provisions of this _Section 7.09_, Parent may terminate
this Agreement and enter into an agreement, understanding or arrangement
providing for an Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent all of
the following conditions are met: (A) the Acquisition Proposal has not been
withdrawn, (B) the Parent Board determines in good faith, after receipt of
advice from outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal,
(C) the Parent Board determines in good faith, after receipt of advice from
outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably
likely to result in a breach of fiduciary duties to the shareholders of
Parent under applicable Law, and (D) only upon the concurrent payment of the
applicable termination fee to the Company in accordance with _Section
8.01(e)_.

 

(d) In addition to the obligations of Parent set forth in _Section 7.09(a)_
and _7.09(b)_ , Parent shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after
receipt thereof) advise the Company orally and in writing of any Acquisition
Proposal received by Parent or any inquiry with respect to or that would
reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, including the
material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry
(including any changes thereto). Parent shall (i) keep the Company reasonably
informed of the status and details (including any change to the terms
thereof) of any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and (ii) provide to the
Company as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof with copies
of all correspondence and other written material sent or provided to Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries from any Person that describes any of the terms or
conditions of any Acquisition Proposal.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal made by any Person to Parent, which, if
consummated, would result in such Person (or its shareholders) owning,
directly or indirectly, at least fifty (50%) of the shares of the Parent
Common Stock then outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a merger or the
direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or all or
substantially all the assets of Parent, which the Parent Board determines in
good faith, after receipt of advice from a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and outside counsel, to be (A) more favorable to the
shareholders of Parent from a financial 

 



-49-   point of view than the Merger, assuming for this purpose that both the
Acquisition Proposal and Merger would not be consummated and taking into
account all the terms and conditions of such proposal, the Person making such
proposal and this Agreement and (B) reasonably likely to be completed on the
terms proposed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other
aspects of such proposal.

 

7.10 _Updated Disclosures_. From the date hereof until the Closing Date,
Parent shall disclose to the Company in writing promptly upon discovery
thereof: (i) (in the form of updated Schedules) any material variances from
the representations and warranties contained in _ARTICLE 5_ (the " _Parent
Updated Disclosures_ "); (ii) if the employment of any key employee, or group
of employees, of Parent or its Subsidiaries is terminated for any reason,
whether by Parent or by such key employee, or group of employees; (iii) of any
written notice or other communication from any third party relating to a
default or event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a
default, received subsequent to the date of this Agreement, under any Parent
Material Contract to which Parent or any Subsidiary is a party or is subject;
or (iv) of any written notice or other communication from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required with respect to a Parent
Material Contract in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, that, such disclosure shall not limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to Seller or the Company, or the
representations or warranties contained in _ARTICLE 5_ , or the conditions to
the obligation of Seller or the Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except with respect to any Parent Updated
Disclosures that disclose underlying events that occurred or circumstances
that arose exclusively between the day after the date of this Agreement and
the Closing which are delivered to the Company in no event later than three
(3) Business Days prior to the Closing (a " _Parent Qualifying Updated
Disclosure_ "), which Parent Qualifying Updated Disclosure will be treated as
included in Parents disclosure schedules solely for the purpose of
determining whether an indemnification obligation exists under _ARTICLE 9_ ,
but such Parent Qualifying Updated Disclosure will not be treated as though it
had been included in Parents disclosure schedules for the determination of
whether the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE 2_ have been satisfied; provided,
however, if Seller and the Company decide to consummate the Merger after
receiving a Parent Qualifying Updated Disclosure, the conditions set forth in
_ARTICLE 2_ shall be deemed to have been satisfied.

 

7.11 _Financing_. Each of Parent and Buyer shall, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
Financing Commitment and the related Financing. Parent shall keep the Company
informed on a reasonable basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its
efforts to obtain the Financing Commitment and arrange the Financing
(including providing the Company with copies of all proposed Financing
Commitments and definitive agreements and other documents related to the
Financing). Parent shall give the Company notice as promptly as reasonably
practicable upon becoming aware of any breach by any party of either of the
Financing Commitment or any termination of the Financing Commitment. Parent
shall provide the Company, as promptly as reasonably practicable upon receipt
thereof, copies of all proposed Financing Commitments and, once the final
Financing Commitment is executed, amendments, modifications, supplements or
waivers to the Financing Commitment.

 

7.12 _Release of Guarantees_. Buyer and Parent will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the holders of Company Indebtedness to release
and discharge Seller from any personal guarantees with respect to any Company
Indebtedness unpaid and assumed by Buyer or Parent, as the case may be, as of
the Closing.

 

7.13 _Seller Tax Reimbursement_. As promptly as practicable, but in any event
within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer will prepare and
deliver to Seller a statement of income (the " _Income Statement_ ") for the
period from January 1, 2012 up to the Closing Date (the " _Adjustment Period_
") prepared in a manner consistent with that employed in the preparation of
the Closing Date

 



-50-   Balance Sheet provided in _Section 1.02(f)(i)_, including a calculation of
the amount by which the earnings of the Company and its Subsidiaries before
interest, Taxes, depreciation and amortization during the Adjustment Period
exceeds One Hundred Fifty Million Dollars ($150,000,000). In case of such
excess, within ten (10) Business Days after Sellers receipt of the Income
Statement, Seller will provide Buyer with a calculation of the difference
between: (a) Sellers income tax liability for the Adjustment Period, taking
into account all income in the Income Statement, and (b) Sellers income tax
liability for the Adjustment Period, taking into account only so much of the
gross income in the Income Statement as includes the earnings of the Company
and its Subsidiaries before interest, Taxes, depreciation and amortization
during the Adjustment Period up to One Hundred Fifty Million Dollars
($150,000,000) (such difference in tax liability shall be the " _Tax
Reimbursement_ "). Within ten (10) Business Days after Buyers receipt of
Sellers calculation of the Tax Reimbursement, Buyer will pay such
Tax Reimbursement by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an
account designated by Seller. Review of the Income Statement and any dispute
relating to the Income Statement, the calculation of the Tax Reimbursement,
and resolution of any thereof shall be conducted in a manner consistent with
the provisions of _Section 1.02(f)_. Any additional payment made to Seller
pursuant to the terms this Section 7.13 shall be deemed to be adjustments, for
Tax purposes, to the aggregate Merger Consideration.

ARTICLE 8

-51-   occurring prior to the time of such termination, or (y) in the case of a
termination by either party if, prior to such termination, all of the
conditions set forth in  _Section 2.01_ or _2.02_ , as applicable, had been
satisfied, Seller or Buyer, as applicable, had indicated in writing to the

shall automatically be amended to be extended until the end of such two-year
period).

 

ARTICLE 9 __

 

 _ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS_

9.01 _Survival_.

(a) With respect to any claim or claims for breaches of the representations
and warranties contained in _ARTICLE 3_ , _ARTICLE 4_ and _ARTICLE 5_ (except
for the Fundamental Representations, Company Tax Representations and Company
Environmental Representations), no indemnifying party shall be liable with
respect to any breach of such representations and warranties in _ARTICLE 3_ ,
_ARTICLE 4_ or _ARTICLE 5_ unless written notice of a claim for
indemnification with respect to such breach is given by the indemnified party
to Buyer, Parent or Seller, as applicable, on or before the date that is
fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date (such date, as applicable, the "
_Survival Date_ "), it being understood that so long as such claim
for indemnification arises and such written notice is given on or prior to
the Survival Date, such representations and warranties shall continue to
survive with respect to such claim for indemnification until such claim is
resolved.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing _Section 9.01(a)_, the time limitation
within which to bring any claim for breach of any of the Fundamental
Representations, Company Tax Representations or Company Environmental
Representations or any breach by any Party of the covenants or agreements made
by such Party contained in this Agreement shall be on or before the date that
is three (3) years after the Closing Date.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 9.01_ to the contrary, in the
event that any breach of any representation or warranty by any of the Company
or Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer or Parent, on the other hand, results
from criminal activity of any such Party or constitutes fraud or
intentional misrepresentation, the representation or warranty shall survive
the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and
continue in full force and effect without any time limitation with respect to
such breach.

 



-52-  9.02 _Indemnification of Buyer_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, subject to the provisions of this _ARTICLE 9_
, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Surviving Company), and their respective
officers, directors, employees and agents (the " _Buyer Indemnitees_ "), from
and against any and all liabilities, obligations, Taxes,
deficiencies, demands, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, assessments,
fines, forfeitures, civil penalties, losses, costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) (hereinafter individually a " _Loss_ " and
collectively " _Losses_ ") suffered or incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees to
the extent such Losses result from or arise out of: (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty of Seller or the Company contained in _ARTICLE 3_
or  _ARTICLE 4_ of this Agreement, or any certificate delivered pursuant to
_Section 2.01(f)_ hereof (disregarding all materiality or Material Adverse
Effect for calculating the amount of such Losses); (ii) any breach of any
covenant or agreement by Seller or (prior to Closing) by the Company; (iii)
any and all Pre-Closing Taxes; (iv) any Indebtedness in excess of the Company
Indebtedness Target or any Company Transaction Expenses, in each case that are
not taken into account in the calculation of the Closing Consideration; or
(v) any fraud or intentional misrepresentation of Seller or (prior to
Closing), the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, even
if a Buyer Indemnitee would otherwise be entitled to indemnification for a
Loss pursuant to this Agreement, the Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled
to indemnification for such Loss pursuant to _Section 9.02(a)(i)_ (other than
in respect of Fundamental Representations, or the representation in _Section
4.25_ (Net Working Capital) for which the Deductible Amount shall not apply),
_Section 9.02(a)(ii)_ (other than the covenants under _Sections 1.02(f)_
(Post-Closing Adjustments), _Section 6.01(d)_ (Conduct of the Business), and
the last sentence of  _Section 9.10(h)_ (Refunds), to which the Deductible
Amount shall not apply), until the aggregate amount of all Losses eligible for
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement exceeds on a cumulative basis an
amount equal to One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000) (the "
_Deductible Amount_ "), and then only to the extent such Losses suffered by
Buyer Indemnitees are in excess of the Deductible Amount. All payments under
this _Section 9.02_ shall be treated by the Parties as an adjustment to the
Merger Consideration received by Seller pursuant to _ARTICLE 1_.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, any
indemnification of the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to  _Section 9.02(a)_
(other than in respect of Fundamental Representations, Company Tax
Representations and other than the covenants under _Sections 1.02(f)_ (Post-
Closing Adjustments) and the last sentence of _Section 9.10(h)_ (Refunds))
(such claims other than claims in respect of Fundamental Representations and
Company Tax Representations, Post-Closing Adjustments and the last sentence of
_Section 9.10(h)_, collectively, the " _Limited Claims_ ") shall be effected
solely by a payment made from the Escrow Shares, in accordance with the terms
of the Escrow Agreement, and such payments shall not exceed the Escrow Shares
available on any given payment date. If and to the extent that the
Escrow Shares are insufficient to cover the Limited Claims, the Buyer
Indemnitees right to indemnification for the uncovered portion thereof is
extinguished. Any indemnification of the Buyer Indemnitees by Seller in
respect of Fundamental Representations and Company Tax Representations shall
not exceed the Merger Consideration, and shall be payable first from Escrow
Shares, to the extent that there are any remaining Escrow Shares available for
indemnification, but not limited thereby. Any payment required to be made by
Seller to Buyer under _Sections 1.02(f)_ (Post-Closing Adjustments) or the
last sentence of _Section 9.10(h)_ (Refunds) shall not be required to come
from the Escrow Shares but shall be the direct financial obligation of
Seller.

9.03 _Indemnification of Seller_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, subject to the provisions of this _ARTICLE 9_
, Buyer and Parent shall jointly and severally indemnify Seller and his
Affiliates, employees and agents (the

 



-53-   " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") against and hold them harmless from any Losses
suffered or incurred by Seller Indemnitees to the extent such Losses arise
from or relating to: (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of
Buyer or Parent contained in this Agreement, or any certificate delivered
pursuant to _Section 2.02(f)_ hereof, (disregarding all materiality or
Material Adverse Effect qualifications for calculating the amount of such
Loss); (ii) a breach of any covenant or agreement by Buyer or Parent contained
in this Agreement requiring performance by Buyer or Parent prior to the
Closing or by Buyer, Parent or the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries
after the Closing; (iii) any claim relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries based on events and transactions occurring after the Closing;
(iv) Company Indebtedness with respect to any claims made based on events
and transactions occurring after the Closing; or (v) any fraud or intentional
misrepresentation of Parent or Buyer or (subsequent to Closing), the Surviving
Company. All payments under this _Section 9.03_ shall be treated by the
Parties as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration received by Seller
pursuant to _ARTICLE 1_ and shall be the direct financial obligation of
Parent, and shall be made promptly to Seller in cash by wire transfer in
immediately available funds. 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, even
if a Seller Indemnitee would otherwise be entitled to indemnification for a
Loss pursuant to this Agreement, the Seller Indemnitees shall not be entitled
to indemnification for such Loss pursuant to _Section 9.03(a)(i)_, or
_Section 9.03(a)(ii)_ (other than the covenant under _Section 1.02(f)_
(Post-Closing Adjustments), to which the Deductible Amount shall not apply),
until the aggregate amount of all Losses eligible for indemnification pursuant
to this Agreement exceeds on a cumulative basis the Deductible Amount, and
then only to the extent such Losses suffered by Seller Indemnitees are in
excess of the Deductible Amount.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, any
indemnification of the Seller Indemnitees by Buyer pursuant to _Section
9.03(a)_ shall not exceed the Merger Consideration.

9.04 _Escrow_.

(a) On the Closing Date, the Escrow Shares shall be delivered to the Escrow
Agent to be held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to satisfy claims related to
Losses suffered by Buyer Indemnitees.

 

(b) At the time any payment is due for Losses suffered by Buyer Indemnitees,
the amount of Escrow Shares subject to release to Buyer Indemnities from the
Escrow Account to cover any Losses suffered by the Buyer Indemnitees shall be
satisfied by releasing a number of Escrow Shares to Buyer determined by
dividing the amount of such Losses by the Closing Date Stock Price. 

9.05 _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_.

(a) In order for a party to be entitled to seek any indemnification provided
for under this Agreement (such party, the " _Claiming Party_ "), in respect of
a claim or demand made against the Claiming Party by any Person who is not a
party to this Agreement or an Affiliate thereof (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "),
such Claiming Party must notify the party to this Agreement that is or may be
required to provide indemnification hereunder with respect to such Third-
Party Claim (the " _Defending Party_ ") in writing, and in reasonable detail,
of the Third-Party Claim as promptly as reasonably possible but in any event
within fifteen (15) days after receipt by such Claiming Party of notice of
the Third-Party Claim (or within such shorter time as may be necessary to give
the Defending Party a reasonable opportunity to respond to and defend such
Third-Party Claim); _provided_ that any delay or failure in giving such
notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to
the extent the Defending

 



-54-   Party shall have been prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter,
the Claiming Party shall deliver to the Defending Party, within five (5)
Business Days after the Claiming Partys receipt thereof, copies of all
notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Claiming Party
relating to the Third-Party Claim.

(b) The Defending Party shall have the right upon written notice to the
Claiming Party within fifteen (15) days after receipt from the Claiming Party
of notice of such claim, to conduct at the sole cost and expense of the
Defending Party the defense against such claim; _provided_ that before the
Defending Party assumes control of such defense it must first agree and
acknowledge in such notice that the Defending Party is fully
responsible (subject to the limitations of _Section 9.02_) for all Losses
relating to such Third-Party Claim (a " _Control Notice_ "); _provided_
_further_ that the Defending Party shall not have the right to assume control
of such defense if the Third-Party Claim: (i) seeks non-monetary relief
(except where non-monetary relief is merely incidental to a primary claim or
claims for monetary damages); (ii) involves criminal allegations; (iii) is one
in which the Defending Party is also a party and joint representation would,
as determined in each case by the Claiming Party based on advice of outside
counsel, be inappropriate or there may be legal defenses available to the
Claiming Party which are different from or additional to those available to
the Defending Party; (iv) involves a claim which, upon petition by the
Claiming Party, the appropriate court rules that the Defending Party failed or
is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend; or (v) or is with respect to
Taxes (which shall be governed by _Section 9.10(g)_). In the event that the
Defending Party validly delivers a Control Notice, the Claiming Party will
reasonably cooperate, at the sole cost and expenses of the Defending Party,
with and make reasonably available to the Defending Party such assistance and
materials as may be reasonably requested by it, and the Claiming Party shall
have the right at its expense to participate in the defense assisted by
counsel of its own choosing. Whether or not the Defending Party shall have
assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Claiming Party shall not admit
any liability with respect to, and shall not have the right to compromise,
settle, discharge or consent to entry of judgment with respect to, such
Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Defending Party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Without the prior written consent of the Claiming Party, the Defending Party
will not enter into any settlement of any Third-Party Claim or consent to
entry of judgment with respect to such claim, if pursuant to or as a result of
such settlement or consent, (x) injunctive or other equitable relief would be
imposed against the Claiming Party, or (y) such settlement or consent would
lead to liability or create any financial obligation on the part of the
Claiming Party for which the Claiming Party is not entitled
to indemnification hereunder (other than to the extent of the Deductible
Amount). If an offer is made to settle a Third-Party Claim, which offer the
Defending Party is permitted to settle under this _Section 9.05(b)_ only upon
the prior written consent of the Claiming Party, and the Defending Party
desires to accept and agree to such offer, the Defending Party will give
prompt written notice to the Claiming Party to that effect. If the Claiming
Party does not consent to such firm offer within twenty (20) calendar days
after its receipt of such notice, the Claiming Party may continue to contest
or defend such Third-Party Claim and, in such event, the maximum liability of
the Defending Party as to such Third-Party Claim will not exceed the amount
of such settlement offer, plus costs and expenses paid or incurred by the
Claiming Party through the date such settlement offer is given to the Claiming
Party to the extent such amount is otherwise indemnifiable hereunder. 

9.06 _Mitigation_. The Indemnified Parties shall take all actions required by
applicable Law to mitigate their Losses which are Indemnifiable hereunder. In
the event that a Defending Party makes any payment to a Claiming Party for
indemnification for which the Claiming Party could have collected on a claim
against a third party (including under any contract and any insurance
claims), the Defending Party shall be entitled to pursue claims and conduct
litigation on behalf of the Claiming Party and any of its successors to pursue
and collect on any indemnification or other remedy available to the Claiming
Party thereunder with respect to such claim and generally to be subrogated to
the rights of the Claiming Party. Except pursuant to a settlement agreed to by
the Defending Party (which agreement shall 

 



-55-   not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), the Claiming Party shall not
voluntarily waive or release any contractual right to recover from a third
party any loss subject to indemnification hereby without the prior written
consent of the Defending Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. The Claiming Party shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiary, if applicable)
to, cooperate with the Defending Party, at the Defending Partys expense,
with respect to any such effort to pursue and collect with respect thereto.

9.07 _Determination of Loss Amount_.

(a) Losses for breaches of representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement shall be net of any insurance proceeds or third-party payments
actually received by and paid to the Claiming Party in each case net of costs
and expenses incurred in procuring such recovery and any retro premium
adjustments, increases in premium, deductibles or other costs.

(b) Absent fraud or intentional misrepresentation, in no event shall any
Party be entitled to recover or make a claim for any amounts in respect of
consequential, incidental or indirect damages, or punitive damages, except to
the extent such damages are awarded against the indemnified party in a Third
Party Claim.

(c) No Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to any indemnification under this 
_ARTICLE 9_ to the extent: (i) such matter was specifically taken into account
in determining the Closing Consideration or the Net Working Capital pursuant
to _Section 1.02_; or (ii) that there is included in the Closing Statement a
specific liability or reserve relating to such matter.

9.08 _Tax Benefits_. To the extent that a Claiming Party actually received
Tax Benefits as a result of any Loss for which an indemnification payment has
been made, such party shall pay the amount of such Tax Benefits (but not in
excess of the indemnification payment or payments actually received from the
Defending Party with respect to such Loss) to the Defending Party as such Tax
Benefits are actually received by the Claiming Party. For purposes of the
foregoing, "Tax Benefit" means any refund of Taxes paid or any reduction
in the amount of Taxes which otherwise would have been paid, in each case in
the taxable year of such Loss, calculated on a with and without basis.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Tax Benefit
shall be required to be paid by an indemnified party to an indemnitor pursuant
to this _Section 9.08(b)_ to the extent such Tax Benefit has not been
actually realized prior to the tenth (10th) taxable year following the taxable
year that the deduction or loss relating to the Loss that gave rise to
indemnification hereunder was generated.

 

9.09 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 9.09_
the provisions of this _ARTICLE 9_  constitute the sole and exclusive
remedies for recovery of Losses or other claims relating to or arising from
this Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. The
provisions of this _Section 9.09 _shall not, however, prevent or limit a
cause of action hereunder with respect to (i) fraud or intentional
misrepresentation; (ii) disputes under _Section 1.02(f)_ (Post-Closing
Adjustments) (which disputes under _Section 1.02(f)_ will be resolved in
accordance with the dispute resolution mechanisms set forth therein); (iii)
amounts payable by Parent to Seller, or Seller to Parent, as applicable,
pursuant to _Section 1.02(f)_ (Post-Closing Adjustments) (which Seller or
Parent shall enforce pursuant to _Section 1.02(f)_); (iv) amounts payable
from Seller to Parent pursuant to the last sentence of _Section 9.10(h)_
(Refunds); or (v) to obtain an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement, to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof or
to obtain other equitable remedies with respect hereto.

 



-56-  9.10 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Conduct of Business with Respect to Taxes_. During the period from the
date hereof to the Closing Date, without the consent of Buyer, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld:

(i) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall make, revoke or
amend any Tax election; change any annual accounting period; adopt or change
any method of accounting or reverse of any accruals (except as required by a
change in Law or GAAP); file any amended Tax Returns; sign or enter into any
closing agreement or settlement agreement with respect to any, or compromise
any, claim or assessment of Tax liability; surrender any right to claim a
refund, offset or other reduction in liability; consent to any extension or
waiver of the limitations period applicable to any claim or assessment, in
each case, with respect to Taxes; or act or omit to act where such action or
omission to act could reasonably be expected to have the effect of increasing
any present or future Tax liability or decreasing any present or future Tax
Benefit for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Buyer or its Affiliates;

(ii) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has taken (or failed to
take) or allowed to be taken any action that could result in the failure of
the Company to qualify as an S corporation (or, as applicable, a qualified S
Corporation subsidiary within the meaning of Section 1361(b)(3)(B of the Code)
pursuant to Code Section 1361 (or applicable provisions of state or local
Law); and

 

(iii) each of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall: (A) timely file all Tax
Returns required to be filed by it and all such Tax Returns shall be prepared
in a manner consistent with past practice; (B) timely pay all Taxes due and
payable; and (C) promptly notify Buyer of any income, franchise or similar (or

11.04 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or delegated by any party hereto without the prior written consent of
the other Parties hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may assign
this Agreement to any Subsidiary of Buyer or of Parent, or to any lender to
Buyer or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof as security for obligations to
such lender in respect of any financing arrangements entered into in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and any refinancings,
extensions, refunds or renewals thereof, provided that no assignment to any
such Subsidiary or lender shall in any way affect Buyers obligations or
liabilities under this Agreement.

11.05 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
prohibited by or invalid under applicable Law, such provision shall be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Agreement.

11.06 _No Strict Construction; Disclosure Schedules_. The language used in
this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties hereto
to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be
applied against any Person. The disclosure schedules attached to this
Agreement have been arranged for purposes of convenience in separately titled
and numbered sections and subsections corresponding to the titled
and numbered sections and subsections contained in _ARTICLE 3_ , _ARTICLE 4_
and _ARTICLE 5_ of this Agreement, and which disclosure in any section or
paragraph of the relevant disclosure schedule shall qualify the corresponding
section or subsection in _ARTICLE 3_ , _ARTICLE 4_ and _ARTICLE 5_ , as
applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that each section of the disclosure
schedules shall be deemed to incorporate by reference information disclosed in
any other section of the disclosure schedules to the extent that the
application thereof is reasonably apparent on its face that such disclosure is
relevant to such section. Capitalized terms used in the disclosure schedules
to _ARTICLE 3_ , _ARTICLE 4_ and _ARTICLE 5_ and not otherwise defined
therein have the meanings given to them in this Agreement. The specification
of any dollar amount or the inclusion of any item in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or the disclosure schedules attached
hereto is not intended to imply that the amounts, or higher or lower amounts,
or the items so included, or other items, are or are not required to be
disclosed (including, without limitation, whether such amounts or items are
required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or are within or outside
of the ordinary course of business, and no party shall use the fact of the
setting of the amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any item in this
Agreement or the disclosure schedules in any dispute or controversy between
the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described or
included in this Agreement or in any disclosure schedule is or is not required
to be disclosed (including, without limitation, whether such amounts or items
are required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or is within or
outside of the ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement. The
information contained in this Agreement and in the disclosure schedules
hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information
contained herein or therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any party
hereto to any third party of any matter whatsoever (including,
without limitation, any violation of Law or breach of contract).

 



-77-  11.07 _Amendment and Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement or the
disclosure schedules or Exhibits hereto may be amended only in a writing
signed by Buyer, the Company and Seller. No waiver by any party of any
provision of this Agreement or any default, misrepresentation or breach
hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be valid unless the same shall
be in writing and signed by the party making such waiver, and no such waiver
shall extend to or affect in any way any other provision or prior or
subsequent breach, misrepresentation or default.

 

11.08 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement, including the disclosure schedules
and Exhibits hereto, the Escrow Agreement and the other documents referred to
herein (including the Nondisclosure Agreement) contain the complete agreement
between the Parties hereto and supersede any prior understandings, agreements
or representations by or between the Parties, written or oral, which may have
related to the subject matter hereof in any way.

11.09 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts
(including by means of telecopied signature pages), any one of which need not
contain the signatures of more than one party, but all such counterparts taken
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 

11.10 _Governing Law_. All matters relating to the interpretation,
construction, validity and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

11.11 _Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process_. The Parties to this
Agreement submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts located in
the State of Delaware or the courts of the United States located in Delaware
in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this
Agreement and any related agreement, certificate or other document delivered
in connection herewith and by this Agreement waive, and agree not to assert,
any defense, in any action for the interpretation or enforcement of
this Agreement and any related agreement, certificate or other document
delivered in connection herewith, that they are not subject thereto or that
such action may not be brought or is not maintainable in such courts or that
this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such courts or that their
property is exempt or immune from execution, that the action is brought in an
inconvenient forum, or that the venue of the action is improper. Service of
process with respect thereto may be made upon any party by mailing a copy
thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to such party at its
address as provided in _Section 11.03_.

11.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto hereby acknowledges and agrees
that any controversy which may arise under this Agreement is likely to involve
complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each such party hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a
trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each party certifies and acknowledges that (i) no representative,
agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise,
that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce
the foregoing waiver, (ii) such party understands and has considered the
implications of this waiver, (iii) such party makes this waiver voluntarily,
and (iv) such party has been induced to enter into this Agreement by,
among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section
11.12_.

 



-78-  11.13 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. No Person other than the Parties hereto
shall have any rights, remedies, or benefits under any provision of this
Agreement, other than _Sections 9.02_ and _9.03_ (to the extent provided
therein).

11.14 _Conflict Between Transaction Documents_. The Parties hereto agree and
acknowledge that, to the extent any terms and provisions of this Agreement are
in any way inconsistent with or in conflict with any term, condition or
provision of any other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby,
this Agreement shall govern and control.

11.15 _Release_. Effective upon the Closing, except with respect to a claim
(i) arising out of this Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby;
or (ii) for indemnification under the Companys Organizational Documents, so
long as such claim for indemnification does not arise out of any matter
indemnified under _ARTICLE 9_ of this Agreement, Seller hereby unconditionally
and irrevocably waives, releases and forever discharges each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and each of their respective past and present directors,
officers, employees, agents, predecessors, successors, assigns, equityholders,
partners, insurers, and Affiliates (other than Seller) from any and all
liabilities of any kind or nature whatsoever arising prior to the Closing
Date, in each case whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated,
known or unknown, and Seller shall not seek to recover any amounts in
connection therewith or thereunder from the Company or its Subsidiaries. Such
released liabilities shall include, without limitation, any right to recover
against the Company or its Subsidiaries for any indemnification claims made
against or paid directly or indirectly by Seller pursuant to _ARTICLE 9_.
Seller understands that this is a full and final release of all claims,
demands, causes of action and liabilities arising prior to the Closing Date of
any nature whatsoever, whether or not known, suspected or claimed, that could
have been asserted in any legal or equitable proceeding against the Company or
its Subsidiaries, except as expressly set forth in this _Section 11.15_. To
the extent permitted by Law, Seller expressly waives all rights afforded by
any statute which limits the effect of a release with respect to unknown
claims in connection with the release expressly granted by this _Section
11.15_. Seller understands the significance of its release of unknown claims
and its waiver of statutory protection against a release of unknown claims.
