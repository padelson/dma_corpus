(collectively, " _DHL_ ") may assert that the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement and the related merger of
Acquisition into CHI (the " _Merger_ ") results in DHL having the right to

Agreement, contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, each of the Companies and each of the Buyers are entering into a
Securities Purchase Agreement (the " _Securities Purchase Agreement_ "),

satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Securities Purchase
Agreement and in this Escrow Agreement) severally and not jointly agreed to
purchase from the Companies, and the Companies have agreed to issue and sell
to the Buyers, certain securities of the Companies described in the Securities
Purchase Agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $61,000,000 (the "

Companies in the event that, prior to the Funding Deadline (as defined below),
ABX Air receives from DHL a written demand for prepayment of all of the
outstanding principal and accrued interest under the DHL Note.

 D. The Companies and the Buyers have agreed to deposit the Purchase Price, the
Securities and certain other documents into an escrow account to facilitate
the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Securities Purchase
Agreement if the conditions to closing set forth in the Securities Purchase
Agreement and this Escrow Agreement are satisfied.

E. Capitalized terms used herein but not defined shall have the meanings given
to them in the Securities Purchase Agreement.

directly caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow

the indemnification provided in Section 3.1 and shall survive the resignation
or removal of the Escrow Agent and the termination of this Escrow Agreement.

and expenses which the Escrow Agent may suffer or incur by reason of any
action, claim or proceeding brought against the Escrow Agent, arising out of
or relating in any way to this Escrow Agreement or any transaction to which
this Escrow Agreement relates, unless such loss, liability, cost, damage

provisions of this Section 3.1 shall survive the resignation or removal of the
Escrow Agent and the termination of this Escrow Agreement.

however, that in the event that the conditions for the disbursement of funds
under this Escrow Agreement are not fulfilled, or the Escrow Agent renders any
service not contemplated in this Escrow Agreement, or there is any assignment
of interest in the subject matter of this Escrow Agreement, or there is any
material modification hereof, or any material controversy arises hereunder, or
the Escrow Agent is made a party to any litigation pertaining to this Escrow
Agreement or the subject matter hereof, then the Escrow Agent shall be

entities and is hereby granted the right to set off and deduct any unpaid
fees, non-reimbursed expenses and unsatisfied indemnification rights from the
Escrow Property.

which the Escrow Agent may be converted or merged, or with which it may be
consolidated, or to which it may sell or transfer all or substantially all of
its corporate trust business and assets as a whole or substantially as a

sale, merger, consolidation or transfer to which the Escrow Agent is a party,
shall be and become the successor escrow agent under this Escrow Agreement and
shall have and succeed to the rights, powers, duties, immunities and
privileges as its predecessor, without the execution or filing of any
instrument or paper or the performance of any further act.

by an order of a court, or any order, judgment or decree shall be made or
entered by any court order affecting the Escrow Property, the Escrow Agent is
