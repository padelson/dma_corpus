Regulatory Commission (" _FERC_ ") under the Interstate Commerce Act. No
approval or consent by any federal or state regulatory authority is required
in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent
that any failure to obtain such approval, either individually or in the

System was operated by SPLC in compliance with the nondiscriminatory open
access transportation requirements under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands
Act, as amended (" _OCSLA_ "). Since the Effective Time, Pecten or SPLC, on

expiration, provided that in the case of each representation and warranty
that shall terminate and expire as provided in this _Section 8.4_, no claim

pursuant to this Agreement to be performed after the Closing shall survive
the Closing.

Section 8.5 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) The indemnified party hereunder agrees that within a reasonable period of
time after it becomes aware of facts giving rise to a claim
for indemnification under this _Article VIII_ , it will provide notice
thereof in writing to the indemnifying party, specifying the nature of and
specific basis for such claim.

 

(b) The indemnifying party shall have the right to control all aspects of the
defense of (and any counterclaims with respect to) any claims brought against
the indemnified party that are covered by the indemnification under this
_Article VIII_ , including the selection of counsel, determination of whether
to appeal any decision of any court and the settling of any such claim 

 



29  or any matter or any issues relating thereto; provided, however, that no
such settlement for only the payment of money shall be entered into without
the consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless it includes a full release of the
indemnified party from such claim; provided further, that no such settlement
containing any form of injunctive or similar relief shall be entered into
without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld.

(c) The indemnified party agrees to cooperate in good faith and in a
commercially reasonably manner with the indemnifying party, with respect to
all aspects of the defense of and pursuit of any counterclaims with respect to
any claims covered by the indemnification under this _Article VIII_ ,
including the prompt furnishing to the indemnifying party of any
correspondence or other notice relating thereto that the indemnified party may
receive, permitting the name of the indemnified party to be utilized in
connection with such defense and counterclaims, the making available to the
indemnifying party of any files, records or other information of the
indemnified party that the indemnifying party considers relevant to such
defense and counterclaims, the making available to the indemnifying party of
any employees of the indemnified person and the granting to the indemnifying
party of reasonable access rights to the properties and facilities of the
indemnified party; provided, however, that in connection therewith the
indemnifying party agrees to use reasonable efforts to minimize the impact
thereof on the operations of the indemnified party and further agrees to
maintain the confidentiality of all files, records, and other information
furnished by the indemnified party pursuant to this _Section 8.4_. The
obligation of the indemnified party to cooperate with the indemnifying party
as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence shall not be construed as
imposing upon the indemnified party an obligation to hire and pay for counsel
in connection with the defense of and pursuit of any counterclaims with
respect to any claims covered by the indemnification set forth in this
_Article VIII_ , provided, however, that the indemnified party may, at its
own option, cost and expense, hire and pay for counsel in connection with any
such defense and counterclaims. The indemnifying party agrees to keep any such
counsel hired by the indemnified party informed as to the status of any such
defense or counterclaim, but the indemnifying party shall have the right to
retain sole control over such defense and counterclaims so long as the
indemnified party is still seeking indemnification hereunder.

(d) In determining the amount of any Damages for which the indemnified party
is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the gross amount of the
indemnification will be reduced by (i) any insurance proceeds realized by the
indemnified person in respect of such Damages from third party insurers, and
such correlative insurance benefit shall be net of any expenses related to
the receipt of such proceeds, including any premium adjustments that become
due and payable by the indemnified party as a result of such claim, and (ii)
all amounts recovered by the indemnified party in respect of such Damages
under contractual indemnities from third persons.

Section 8.6 _Direct Claim_.

 

Any claim by an indemnified party with respect to any Damages which do not
result from a claim for indemnity involving a third party (a " _Direct Claim_
") will be asserted by giving the indemnifying party reasonably prompt written
notice thereof, stating the nature of such claim in reasonable detail and
indicating the estimated amount, if practicable. The indemnifying party will
have a period of ninety (90) days from receipt of such Direct Claim within
which to respond

 



30  to such Direct Claim. If the indemnifying party does not respond within such
ninety (90) day period, the indemnifying party will be deemed to have accepted
such Direct Claim. If the indemnifying party rejects such Direct Claim, the
indemnified party will be free to seek enforcement of its rights to
indemnification under this Agreement.

 

Section 8.7 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a) To the extent that SHLX Indemnified Parties would otherwise be entitled to
indemnification for Damages pursuant to  _Section 8.1(a)_, SPLC shall be
liable only if (i) the Damages with respect to any individual claim exceed One
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) (the " _Minimum Claim Amount_ ") and (ii)
the Damages for all claims that exceed the Minimum Claim Amount exceed, in
the aggregate, One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (the " _Deductible Amount_ "),
and then SPLC shall be liable only for Damages to the extent of any excess
over the Deductible Amount. In no event shall SPLCs aggregate liability to
SHLX Indemnified Parties under _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.3_ exceed 20% of
the Consideration (the " _Ceiling Amount_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Deductible Amount and the Ceiling Amount shall not apply to breaches or
inaccuracies of representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.1_
(Organization), _Section 3.2_ (Authority and Approval), _Section
3.4_ (Capitalization; Title to Subject Interests), _Section 3.9_ (Taxes),
_Section 3.16_ (Brokerage Arrangements) and _Section 3.17_ (Books and
Records) or breaches of the covenants in _Section 2.4_ (Purchase
Price Adjustment), provided, that SPLCs aggregate liability for all claims
under this Agreement, including for breaches or inaccuracies of
representations and warranties contained in such sections and for breaches of
covenants, shall not exceed the Consideration.

(b) For purposes of determining the amount of Damages, with respect to any
asserted claim for indemnification by a SHLX Indemnified Party, such
determination shall be made without regard to any qualifier as to "material,"
"materiality" or SPLC Material Adverse Effect expressly contained in _Article
III_ (except in the case of the term Material Contract); provided that this
_Section 8.7(b)_ shall not so modify the representations and warranties for
purposes of first determining whether a breach of any representation or
warranty has occurred.

 

(c) Additionally, neither SPLC, on the one hand, nor SHLX and Operating, on
the other hand, will be liable as an indemnitor under this Agreement for any
consequential, incidental, special, indirect or exemplary damages suffered or
incurred by the indemnified party or parties except to the extent resulting
pursuant to third party indemnity claims.

 

Section 8.8 _Sole Remedy_.

No party shall have liability under this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby except as is provided in _Article VI_ or this _Article
VIII_ (other than claims or causes of action arising from fraud or willful
misconduct).

agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. Each party to
this Agreement agrees that no other party to this Agreement (including its
agents and representatives) has made any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement to or with such party relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, other than those expressly set forth herein
and in the other Transaction Documents.

(b) No supplement, modification or waiver of this Agreement shall be binding
unless executed in writing by each party to be bound thereby. No waiver of
any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a
waiver of any other provision hereof (regardless of whether similar), nor

otherwise expressly provided.

Section 9.9 _Conflicting Provisions_.

 

This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, read as a whole, set forth
the parties rights, responsibilities and liabilities with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In this Agreement and the

hereto without the prior written consent of each other party; provided that
SHLX and Operating may assign their right to receive the Subject Interests
hereunder to a wholly-owned subsidiary without the written consent of SPLC
provided that SHLX and Operating shall not be relieved of any obligations or
liabilities hereunder as a result of any such assignment. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any person or entity

remain in full force and effect.

 



35 Section 9.12 _Interpretation_.

 

It is expressly agreed by the parties that this Agreement shall not be
construed against any party, and no consideration shall be given or
presumption made, on the basis of who drafted this Agreement or any provision
hereof or who supplied the form of this Agreement. Each party agrees that this
Agreement has been purposefully drawn and correctly reflects its understanding
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, therefore, waives the
application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing
that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against
the party drafting such agreement or document. 

Section 9.13 _Headings and Disclosure Letter_.

 

The headings of the several Articles and Sections herein are inserted for
convenience of reference only and are not intended to be a part of or to

the Disclosure Letter and such Exhibits are incorporated in the definition of
"Agreement."
