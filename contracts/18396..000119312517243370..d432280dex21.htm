_Section_ __ _ 6.02_) and shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 to holders of
Shares. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company all

set forth in the Schedule 14D-9 and provide such other assistance with the
preparation of the Schedule 14D-9 as may be reasonably requested by the
Company. Prior to a Change in Recommendation, if any, (i) Parent shall be
given reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Schedule 14D-9 and

SEC or dissemination of such documents to the stockholders of the Company and
the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any

respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments

and comment upon the responses to any such comments and a copy of any

such responses. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to
the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend
or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended
or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Law.

 

(b) _Stockholder Lists_. In connection with the Offer, the Company shall
cause its transfer agent to furnish Merger Sub promptly (and in any event
within four (4) Business Days after the date of this Agreement) with mailing
labels containing the names and addresses of the record holders of Shares as
of the most recent practicable date and of those persons becoming record
holders subsequent to such date, together with copies of all lists of
stockholders, security position listings, computer files and all other
information in the Companys possession or control containing information
about the beneficial owners of the Shares as may be reasonably requested by
Merger Sub for the purpose of communicating the Offer to such beneficial

16 CONFIDENTIAL



 

Shares in accordance with applicable Law (the date of the list used to
determine the Persons to whom the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 are
first disseminated, the " _Stockholder List Date_ "). Subject to applicable
Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to communicate the Offer to
the holders of Shares, Parent and Merger Sub and their Representatives (i)
shall hold in confidence such lists, files and information and will use such
information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and (ii)
following a termination of this Agreement, shall promptly either deliver to
the Company or destroy, and shall cause their Representatives to deliver to
the Company or destroy, all copies and any extracts or summaries of such
information then in their possession or control and notify the Company that
all such material has been so returned or destroyed.

 

Section 2.03. _Top-Up Option_.

 

(a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the "
_Top-Up Option_"), exercisable only on the terms and conditions set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 2.03_, to purchase at a price per share equal to the
Offer Price paid in the Offer that number of newly issued, fully paid an
nonassessable Shares (the " _Top-Up Shares_") equal to the lowest number of
Shares that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub
and any of their respective Subsidiaries at the time of exercise of the Top-Up
Option, shall constitute one share more than 80% of the outstanding Shares
immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Shares on a fully-diluted basis
(which assumes conversion or exercise of all derivative securities regardless
of the conversion or exercise price, the vesting schedule or other terms and
conditions thereof). Upon Parents request, the Company shall use its best
efforts to cause its transfer agent to certify in writing to Parent the number
of Shares issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the exercise of
the Top-Up Option and after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up
Shares. The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable only once, in whole but not in
part, at any time following the consummation of the Offer and prior to the
earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms.

 

(b) If there shall have not been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
that number of Shares which, when added to the Shares owned by Parent and its
Affiliates, would represent at least one share more than 80% of the Shares on
a fully-diluted basis (which assumes conversion or exercise of all derivative
securities regardless of the conversion or exercise price, the vesting
schedule or other terms and conditions thereof) upon the consummation of the
Offer, Merger Sub shall be deemed to have exercised the Top-Up Option and on
such date shall deliver to the Company written notice (the " _Top-Up
Notice_"), specifying the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock owned by
Parent, Merger Sub and any of their respective Subsidiaries at the time of
such notice (giving effect to the consummation of the Offer). The Company
shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of the Top-Up Notice (and in
any event no later than the consummation of the Offer), deliver written
notice to Merger Sub specifying, based on the information provided by Merger
Sub in its notice, the number of Top-Up Shares to be purchased by Merger Sub.
At the closing of the purchase of Top-Up Shares, which shall take place at the
location of the Closing specified in _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ and shall take
place simultaneously with the consummation of the Offer, the aggregate
purchase price owed by Merger Sub to the Company for the Top-Up Shares shall
be paid to the Company by (A) paying in cash by wire transfer of same-day
funds an amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of the Top-Up
Shares and (B) issuing to the Company a promissory note having a principal
amount equal to the

 



17 CONFIDENTIAL



 

aggregate purchase price pursuant to the Top-Up Option less the amount paid in
cash pursuant to the preceding clause (A) (the " _Promissory Note_ "). The
Promissory Note (i) shall bear simple interest at a rate of five percent (5%)
per annum, payable in arrears at maturity, (ii) shall mature on the first
anniversary of the date of execution of the Promissory Note, (iii) shall be
full recourse to Parent and Merger Sub, (iv) may be prepaid, at any time, in
whole or in part, without premium or penalty and (v) shall have no other
material terms. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares or as
promptly as practicable thereafter, the Company shall cause to be issued to
Merger Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up Shares or the applicable
number of book-entry Shares. Such certificates or book-entry Shares may
include any legends that are required by federal or state securities Laws. The
parties hereto agree to use their best efforts to cause the closing of
the purchase of the Top-Up Shares to occur on the same day that the Top-Up
Notice is deemed received by the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.01_,
and if not so consummated on such day, as promptly thereafter as possible.

(c) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that no Top-Up Shares issued upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option will be registered under the Securities Act and
that all such shares will be issued in reliance upon an applicable exemption
from registration under the Securities Act. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
hereby represents and warrants to the Company that Merger Sub is, and will be,
upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an "accredited investor," as defined
in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that
the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the
Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of
investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any
distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act) in violation
of the Securities Act.

(d) Any dilutive impact on the value of the shares of Company Common Stock
as a result of the issuance of the Top-Up Shares shall not be taken into
account in any determination of the fair value of any Dissenting Shares
pursuant to Subchapter D of Chapter 15 of the PBCL as contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 2.08_.

(e) Without the prior written consent of the Company, the right to
exercise the Top-Up Option granted pursuant to this Agreement may not be
assigned by Merger Sub other than to Parent or a direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent, including by operation of law or otherwise, and
any attempted assignment in violation of this _Section_ __ _ 2.03_ _.(_ _e)_
will be null and void.

 

Section 2.04. _The Closing_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take
place at 9:00 a.m., Eastern time, as promptly as possible following
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions
set forth in _Article 7_ (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
(to the extent permitted hereunder) of such conditions), unless this Agreement
has been terminated pursuant to its terms or unless another time and/or date
is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The Closing shall be held at
the offices of Dechert LLP, 2929 Arch Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.

 



18 CONFIDENTIAL



 

Section 2.05. _The Merger_.

 

(a) _Effecting the Merger_. At the Closing, the Parties shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by filing a statement of merger (the " _Statement of
Merger_ ") with the Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
in such form as required by and executed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the PBCL.

 

(b) _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective on such date and
at such time as when the Statement of Merger has been received for filing by
the Secretary of the Commonwealth of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or at
such later time and date as may be agreed by the parties hereto in writing and
specified in the Statement of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

(c) _Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall
be merged with and into the Company in accordance with the PBCL, whereupon
the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), and
the separate corporate existence of the Company, with all its rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by
the Merger.

 

(d) _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
in the applicable provisions of Section 336 of the PBCL, this Agreement and
the Statement of Merger.

Section 2.06. _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, the stockholders thereof or any other Person:

 

(a) except as otherwise provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.06_ _.(_ _a)_ , 
_Section_ __ _ 2.08_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.09_, each Share outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive the Offer Price without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ ") and holders of such Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
therefore in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; 

(b) each Share owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (including Shares
held by the Company as treasury stock) or held by any Subsidiary thereof
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and cease to exist,
and no payment shall be made with respect thereto, and each holder of a
Certificate representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto; and

(c) each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid,
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation, which shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.07. _Surrender and Payment_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent and Payment Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall appoint a nationally recognized paying agent reasonably acceptable to
the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging for the
Merger Consideration certificates representing Shares (the " _Certificates_ ";
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that any references herein to "Certificates" are
deemed to include references to effective affidavits of loss in accordance to
_Section_ __ _ 2.13_ or to

 



19 CONFIDENTIAL



 

book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of Shares). As
promptly as possible following the Effective Time, Parent shall have, or shall
have taken all necessary steps to enable and cause the Surviving Corporation
to have, deposited with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to
be held in trust for the benefit of the holders entitled to receive Merger
Consideration (which, for the avoidance of doubt, may exclude amounts for
Dissenting Shares) and paid in respect of the Certificates (the " _Payment
Fund_ "). Any investment of the Payment Fund shall in all events be limited to
direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed
as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such
bank that are then publicly available). No such investment or loss thereon
shall affect the amounts payable to the former holder of Shares pursuant to
this _ARTICLE 2_. Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event no later
than the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Effective Time, Parent shall send,
or shall cause the Paying Agent to send, to each record holder of Shares at
the Effective Time, in each case whose Shares were converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.06.(a)_, a
letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper
delivery or transfer of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company agree prior
to the consummation of the Offer) for use in such payment.

(b) _Surrender of Shares_. Each holder of Shares that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares
represented by a Certificate promptly upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent
of a Certificate, together with a duly completed and validly executed letter
of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the
Paying Agent or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or
such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably
request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Shares. Until so surrendered
or transferred, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time
for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. No
interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or
transfer of such Certificate.

 

(c) _Unregistered Transferees_. If any portion of the Merger Consideration
is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i)
either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall
pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid
or is not payable.

(d) _No Other Rights_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender
of Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have
been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate and, from and after the Effective Time, there
shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying
Agent for transfer, the 

 



20 CONFIDENTIAL



 

holder of such Certificates shall be given a copy of a letter of transmittal
and instructed to comply with the instructions therein in order to receive
the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to the
Merger.

(e) _Termination of the Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund
that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares six (6) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand,
and any such holder who has not exchanged Shares for the Merger Consideration
in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.07_ prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation as general creditors thereof
for payment of the Merger Consideration.

 

Section 2.08. _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Shares cancelled in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.06.(a)_ and held by a
holder who is legally entitled to exercise, and who has properly exercised,
dissenters rights (if applicable) with respect to such Shares in accordance
with Subchapter D of Chapter 15 of the PBCL (such Shares being referred to
collectively as the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into a
right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled to
only such rights as are granted by Subchapter D of Chapter 15 of the PBCL;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails
to perfect, withdraws or loses such holders dissenters rights pursuant to
Subchapter D of Chapter 15 of the PBCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction
determines that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by
Subchapter D of Chapter 15 of the PBCL, such Shares shall immediately cease
to be Dissenting Shares and be treated as if they had been Shares converted as
of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the
right to receive, the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Article 2_ ,
without interest thereon. If any demand for fair value is made of Dissenting
Shares and the Top-Up Option was exercised prior to the Effective Time, then
for purposes of determining the fair value of any Dissenting Shares, the cash
received or value of the promissory note issued to the Company pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.03.(a)_, as applicable, in payment of the exercise price of
the Top-Up Option shall be treated as if it had not been paid to or received
by the Company and the Top-Up Shares issued shall be treated as if they were
not issued or outstanding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in _Section_ __ _ 2.06_ _.(_ _a)_ , if the Merger is rescinded or abandoned
prior to the Effective Time, then the right of any shareholder to be paid the
fair value of such shareholders Dissenting Shares pursuant to Subchapter D
of Chapter 15 of the PBCL shall cease.

 

(b) The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, any withdrawal of any such
demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company
prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the PBCL that relates to such demand,
and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demands. Any portion of the
Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent in respect of any
Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent, upon demand.

 



21 CONFIDENTIAL



 

Section 2.09. _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company TVDS_. At the Effective Time, each award of
Company TVDS outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
whether vested or unvested, automatically and without any action required on
the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled in exchange for the right of the
holder thereof to receive (without interest) an amount in cash equal to (i)
the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common
Stock underlying such Company TVDS award immediately prior to the Effective
Time, plus (ii) the accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents on such award as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, less applicable Taxes withheld
with respect to such payment pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.11_ (the " _Company
TVDS Payment_ "). The Company TVDS Payment relating to the portion of a
Company TVDS award that is vested as of the Effective Time (after giving
effect to the Transactions) shall be paid to the holder thereof as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within three (3) Business Days) following
the Effective Time through the Surviving Corporations payroll system. With
respect to the portion of a Company TVDS award that is not vested as of the
Effective Time (after giving effect to the Transactions), if and when a
portion of any such Company TVDS award would have become vested in accordance
with its terms, the Company TVDS Payment allocable to such portion shall be
paid to the holder thereof not more than three (3) Business Days after such
vesting through the Surviving Corporations payroll system. If any portion of
a Company TVDS award that is not vested as of the Effective Time (after giving
effect to the Transactions) does not become vested after the Effective Time in
accordance with its terms, the portion of the Company TVDS Payment relating
thereto shall be immediately forfeited and shall not be paid to the holder
thereof).

 

(b) _Treatment of Company Options and Company SARs_. At the Effective
Time, each Company Option and Company SAR, whether vested or unvested, that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically
and without any action required on the part of the holder thereof, be
cancelled. Since each Company Option and Company SAR has a per-share exercise
price or per share base price (as applicable) equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration, each Company Option and Company SAR shall be canceled
with no payment due the holder thereof.

 

(c) _Company Performance Units_. At the Effective Time, each Company
Performance Unit that, by its terms and after giving effect to the
Transactions, is vested based on actual performance through the Effective Time
shall be cancelled in exchange for the right of the holder thereof to receive
(without interest) an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying the vested portion of the
Company Performance Unit award immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, which amount shall be paid to the
holder thereof as promptly as practicable (and in any event within three (3)
Business Days) following the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, each
Company Performance Unit award that, by its terms and after giving effect to
the Transactions, is not vested shall be cancelled with no payment due the
holder thereof.

 

(d) _Corporate Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all actions which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 2.09.(a)_ through _Section_ __ _ 2.09.(c)_, it being
understood and agreed that from and after the Effective Time, no Company
Equity Award holder shall have any right with respect to any Company Equity
Award other than to receive the payment, if any, provided for in this
_Section_ __ _ 2.09_.

 



22 CONFIDENTIAL



 

Section 2.10. _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company shall occur (other than the issuance of Top-Up
Shares, the issuance of Shares in connection with the exercise or settlement
of Company TVDS, Company SARs, Company Performance Units and Company
Options), including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split (including reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment
of shares, or any stock dividend, all references herein to specified numbers
of shares affected thereby, and any calculations that are based upon such
numbers of shares affected thereby, including the Offer Price, the Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement, shall
be appropriately adjusted.

Section 2.11. _Withholding Rights_ _._ Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold from such
payment under any provision of any applicable Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted and withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, such amounts shall be (i) paid in full to the
appropriate Taxing Authority by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent for crediting to the account of the Person from whom such
amounts were deducted and withheld and (ii) treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent made such deduction
and withholding.

 

Section 2.12. _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to and in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar applicable Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered
immediately prior to such date on which any amounts payable pursuant to this
_Article 2_ would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, any such amounts shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

Section 2.13. _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the
delivery to Parent and the Paying Agent of a written indemnity agreement in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Paying Agent and,
if reasonably required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such
Person of a bond, in such customary amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue, in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be
paid in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated under this _Article 2_. 

 



23 CONFIDENTIAL



 

Section 2.14. _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of Shares
shall thereafter be made.

Equity Commitment Letter to be satisfied by it are satisfied. As of the date

any time prior to the consummation of the Offer, in the event a material
development, event, fact, occurrence or material change in circumstances
(other than an Acquisition Proposal) occurs or arises after the date of this
Agreement that was not known or reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as
of the date of this Agreement, the Company Board may make a Change in
Recommendation if the Company Board determines, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Company has provided Parent four (4)
Business Days prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to take
such action and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons for such action.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
but subject to  _Section_ __ _ 6.02.(e)_, at any time prior to the
consummation of the Offer if, in response to an unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that did not result
from a material breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.02_, the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel

Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure to approve or recommend such Superior
Proposal would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company
Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company may make a Change
in Recommendation and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.01.(d)(_ _i_ _)_ and this _Section_ __ _ 6.02.(d)_ to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01.(d)(_ _i_ _)_ and this _Section_ __ _
6.02.(d)_ unless (y) the Company has complied in all material respects with
its 

 



55 CONFIDENTIAL



 

obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_, including to its obligations set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.02.(e)_, and (z) the Company pays, or causes to be
paid, to Parent, the Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.04.(b)_ concurrently with such termination.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the Company Board shall not make a Change in Recommendation pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 6.02.(d)_ and the Company shall not be entitled to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01.(d)(_ _i_ _)_ and  _Section_
__ _ 6.02.(d)_ unless (x) the Company shall have provided to Parent four (4)
Business Days prior written notice (the " _Superior Proposal Notice_ ")
advising Parent that the Company intends to take such action (and specifying,
in reasonable detail, the material terms and conditions of any such Superior
Proposal and, if applicable and not prohibited by the terms of any
confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement to which the Company is a party
as of the date hereof, providing a copy of the relevant proposed transaction
agreement (it being understood that, in the event of any change in the
per share consideration or form of consideration offered under, or any other
material amendment or modification of any Acquisition Proposal, the time
periods in this _Section_ __ _ 6.02.(e)_ shall be extended by two (2)
additional Business Days) and (y):

(i) during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the
Company shall have engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent regarding
changes to the terms of this Agreement intended to cause such Acquisition
Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and

 

(ii) the Company Board shall have considered any adjustments to this
Agreement (including a change to the price terms hereof), the Equity
Commitment Letter and any other adjustments that may be irrevocably proposed
in writing by Parent (the most recent such adjustments, the " _Proposed
Changed Terms_ ") no later than 5:00 p.m., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania time,
on the on the fourth (4th) Business Day of such four (4) Business Day period
and shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisor) that the Superior Proposal
would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if the Proposed Changed
Terms were to be given effect.

For the avoidance of doubt, if Parent, within four (4) Business Days
following its receipt of a Superior Proposal Notice, makes an irrevocable
written offer that, as determined in good faith by the Company Board (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) results in
the applicable Acquisition Proposal no longer being a Superior Proposal, then
the Company Board shall have no right to make a Change in Recommendation
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.02.(d)_ and the Company shall have no right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01.(d)(_ _i_ _)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 6.02.(d)_ as a result of such Acquisition Proposal, unless
such Acquisition Proposal is subsequently determined by the Company Board
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) to
be a Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.02.(d)_, in which
case  _Section_ __ _ 6.02.(e)_ shall apply to such determination.

(f) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) advise
Parent in writing in the event that the Company receives any Acquisition
Proposal, and in connection with such notice, if applicable, provide to Parent
the material terms and conditions (including, unless prohibited by the terms
of any confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement existing as of the date of
this Agreement, the identity of the Person making any such Acquisition
Proposal) of any such 

 



56 CONFIDENTIAL



 

Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall (i) keep Parent reasonably informed on
a reasonably current basis of the status of any such Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent in
writing of any material change to the material terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal or any determination by the Company Board pursuant to  _Section_ __
_ 6.02.(b)_, (iii) promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent
in writing if, to the Companys Knowledge, such Third Party has advised the
Company in writing of its final decision not to pursue such Acquisition
Proposal and (iv) provide to Parent as soon as practicable (and in any event
within 24 hours) after receipt or delivery thereof of any written indication
of interest (or amendment thereto) or any written material that constitutes
an Acquisition Proposal (or amendment thereto) including copies of any
proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreements and any financing commitments
related thereto.

 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through their respective
Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing any position or disclosing any
information reasonably required under Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a
tender offer or exchange offer), (ii) making any "stop, look and listen"
communication to the Companys stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act, (iii) the accurate disclosure of factual

operations of the Company or (iv) the accurate disclosure of the fact that an
Acquisition Proposal has been made, the identity of the party making such

the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto; _provided_ , that in all
cases, no Change in Recommendation may be made unless the Company shall have
first complied with its obligations under  _Section_ __ _ 6.02.(c)_,
_Section_ __ _ 6.02.(d)_, and _Section_ __ _ 6.02.(e)_.

 

Section 6.03. _Stockholder Meeting; Preparation of Proxy Statement_.

required under applicable Law, the Company shall prepare and file with the

consummation of the Offer. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
each of Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) furnish to the Company the information
relating to it required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Proxy

SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Proxy Statement, and shall promptly
provide Parent and Merger Sub with copies of all correspondence between the
Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other
hand. The Company shall respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of
the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and shall cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the shareholders of the Company as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date the Proxy Statement is cleared by the
SEC (such date, the

 



57 CONFIDENTIAL



 

" _Proxy Clearance Date_ "). Prior to the filing of the Proxy Statement
(including any amendments or supplements thereto) with the SEC
or dissemination thereof to the shareholders of the Company, or responding to
any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall
provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such Proxy Statement or response, and the Company shall
give reasonable and good faith consideration to any such comments.

 

(b) If the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys shareholders is

at least 80% of outstanding Shares (determined on a fully-diluted
basis (which assumes conversion or exercise of all derivative securities
regardless of the conversion or exercise price, the vesting schedule or other
terms and conditions thereof), the Parties will take all necessary and
appropriate action, including with respect to the transfer to Merger Sub of
any Shares held by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, to cause the Merger to
become effective as soon as practicable after the consummation of the Offer
without the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Section
321(d)(1)(ii) of the PBCL.

(c) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall affirmatively vote at the Company
Stockholders Meeting or otherwise all Shares acquired in the Offer (if any),

in accordance with applicable Law.

officers, agents, properties, books, Contracts and records, and, with the
Companys consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), to the employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries;
and shall furnish Parent and Merger Sub all financial, operating and other
data and information (other than any new environmental testing or sampling
data or information) as Parent and Merger Sub through their officers,
employees or agents, may reasonably request. None of the Company, any Company
Subsidiary and any Representative of the Company shall be required to provide
such access to or to disclose such information where such access
or disclosure would (i) contravene any applicable Law, Contract of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or Order, (ii) would reasonably be

 



58 CONFIDENTIAL



 

expected to violate or result in a loss or impairment of any attorney-client,
work product privilege or Intellectual Property right or (iii) materially and
adversely interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries; _provided_ that, to the extent practicable, (A) the
Company, each Company Subsidiary and each of their Representatives have
taken commercially reasonable steps to provide access to or to disclose such
information on a basis that does not result in the effects described in
clauses (i) through (iii) and (B) in the case of clause (ii), such access and
information shall be granted or made available, as applicable, to external
counsel for Parent (subject to external counsel entering into a customary
common interest agreement with the Company, on terms mutually agreeable to
Parent and the Company).

 

(b) No information or knowledge obtained by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 6.02_, this _Section_ __ _ 6.03_ or otherwise shall
affect or be deemed to affect or modify any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement made by the Company contained herein, the conditions to the
obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger in accordance with the
terms and provisions hereof or otherwise prejudice in any way the rights and
remedies of Parent or Merger Sub hereunder, nor shall any such information,

Subs reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
made by the Company in this Agreement.

 

(c) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that all information
provided to it or any of its Representatives by the Company or any of its
Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions shall be deemed to be provided under, and shall be treated in

Transactions;

 

(b) any notice or other communication received by such party or any of its
Subsidiaries from any Governmental Authority in connection with the

59 CONFIDENTIAL

likely to result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in
_ARTICLE 7_ to be satisfied; _provided_ , that the failure to deliver any
notice pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ shall not be considered in
determining whether the conditions set forth in  _ARTICLE 7_ have been
satisfied; _provided_ , _further_ , that no notification given by any party
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ shall (A) limit or otherwise affect any
of the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or conditions

partys reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements

misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of covenant by such party.

Section 6.06. _Employee Benefit Plan Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to all employees of the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation at the
Effective Time (" _Continuing Employees_ "), Parent shall cause the service of
each such Continuing Employee with the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the
Company Subsidiaries, the Subsidiaries of the Surviving Corporation and all
of their respective predecessors to be recognized for purposes of eligibility
to participate, levels of benefits, vesting, and, with respect to paid time
off benefits only, benefit accrual (other than for any equity or equity-
based, deferred compensation or post-retirement welfare plans or for purposes
of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan) under each employee
benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Surviving Corporation, the Parent
or any of their respective Affiliates (collectively, the " _Parent Benefit
Plans_ ") in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to
participate to the same extent such service was recognized under the
corresponding Company Employee Plan, except to the extent such credit would
result in a duplication of benefits. Additionally, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to permit each Continuing Employee to be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
Parent Benefit Plans that are health and welfare plans to the extent coverage
under such Parent Benefit Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company
Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately
before the replacement and such waiting time requirement was met under such
Company Employee Plan.

(b) For a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the Closing
Date, Parent shall provide, or cause its Affiliates to provide each Continuing
Employee with (i) the base hourly wage or base salary and annual cash target
bonus opportunity for each Continuing Employee that, in each case, are no
less than those in effect for such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Closing Date and (ii) all other material benefits (other than
participation in any equity or equity-based, deferred compensation, post-
retirement medical, dental, vision or life insurance, or defined benefit
pension plan) that are substantially similar in the aggregate to such
Continuing Employee as those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Closing Date under the Company Employee Benefit Plans. In
addition to, and without limiting, the foregoing provisions of this _Section_
__ _ 6.06(b)_, in the event of the termination of employment of any
Continuing Employee during the twelve (12) month period immediately following
the Closing Date, Parent shall provide such Continuing Employee with severance
payments and benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the
severance payments

 



60 CONFIDENTIAL



 

and benefits to which such Continuing Employee would have been entitled under
the severance plan or policy of the Company or Company Subsidiary applicable
to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to Closing.

(c) Without limiting the generality of  _Section_ __ _ 6.06.(a)_, from
and after the Closing Date, with respect to each Parent Benefit Plan that is
an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA in
which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to participate, Parent
shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to use commercially reasonable efforts
to, (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, waiting periods,
actively-at-work requirements, and other conditions and exclusions with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable under such
Parent Benefit Plan for such Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents to the same extent that such conditions, waiting periods,
requirements and exclusions would not have applied or would have been
satisfied or waived under the corresponding Company Employee Plan in which
such Continuing Employee or eligible dependent was a participant immediately
prior to the Closing and (ii) in the plan year in which the Continuing
Employee ceases participation under the applicable Company Employee Plan and
such Continuing Employee commences participation in the corresponding Parent
Benefit Plan, credit all co-payments, deductibles and other expenses paid by
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under the corresponding
Company Employee Plan in such plan year for purposes of satisfying any
deductible, co-payment, co-insurance and maximum-out-of-pocket requirements
under such Parent Benefit Plan.

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions which
are necessary to freeze the Companys Deferred Compensation Plan, as amended
and restated effective January 1, 2011 with respect to new deferral elections.

 

(e) From and after the Closing Date, Parent will honor, and will cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their
terms as in effect on the Closing Date, all existing employment, retention,
incentive, change of control and severance agreements between the Company or
any Company Subsidiary and any Continuing Employee.

 

(f) Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation acknowledge and agree
that all provisions contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.06_ are included for
the sole benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and shall not
create any right in any other Person, including any right to continued
employment or service with Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Affiliates. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.06_ shall be deemed to (i)
establish or amend any Company Employee Plan, Parent Benefit Plan or any
other employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of any kind or (ii) limit
the right of the Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Affiliates to amend, merge or terminate any Company Employee
Plan or Parent Benefit Plan.

Section 6.07. _State Takeover Laws_. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations contained in _Section_ __ _ 5.09_, the Company shall, and
shall cause each Company Subsidiary to, take all actions necessary so that no
Anti-Takeover Statute becomes applicable to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. If any Anti-Takeover Statute becomes or is deemed to be
applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Offer, the Merger or any
other Transaction, then each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Boards of Directors shall use

 



61 CONFIDENTIAL



 

commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Offer, the Merger and any
other Transaction contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act
to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Anti-Takeover Statute on this
Agreement, the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the issuance of the Top-Up Shares,
the Merger and any other Transaction contemplated hereby.

 

Section 6.08. _Obligations of Parent_.

 

(a) Parent shall cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Offer and the Merger on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

(b) Parent shall not, and shall not permit Merger Sub to, adopt or
publicly propose a plan of complete or partial liquidation, restructuring,
recapitalization or other reorganization, or resolutions providing for or
authorizing such a liquidation, dissolution, restructuring, recapitalization
or other reorganization that would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede
or delay the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
Transactions.

 

(c) Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, (i)
enter, or agree or commit to entrance, into agreements with respect to, or
consummate, any mergers or business combinations, or any acquisition of any
other Person or business or (ii) make, or agree or commit to make, loans,
advances or capital contributions to, or investments in, any other Person, in
each case that would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay the
consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any of the Transactions.

 

(d) Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the parties hereto, Parent, as sole stockholder of Merger Sub, shall adopt
this Agreement and approve the Offer and the Merger, in accordance with the
PBCL, by written consent.

 

Section 6.09. _Director and Officer Liability_.

 

(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, maintain
officers and directors liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time covering each such person
currently covered by the Companys officers and directors liability
insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less
favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in satisfying its obligation under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.09.(a)_, the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to
pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid
in its last full fiscal year prior to the date of this Agreement (the "
_Current Premium_ ") and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time
exceed 300% of the Current Premium, then Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, cause to be
maintained policies of insurance that provide the maximum coverage available
at an annual premium equal to 300% of the Current Premium. The provisions of
the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies have been obtained by the Company prior
to the Effective Time, which policies provide such directors and officers with
coverage for an aggregate period of six (6) years with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that

 



62 CONFIDENTIAL



 

occurred on or before the Effective Time, including, in respect of the
Transactions, and which it is hereby acknowledged by Parent are permitted to
be obtained by the Company at any time prior to the Effective Time. If such
prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall,
maintain such policies in full force and effect for their full term, and
continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
(and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) fulfill and honor in all
respects the obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries pursuant
to (i) each indemnification, exculpation or expense reimbursement or advance
agreement in effect between the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and
any individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the
Effective Time was, a director or officer of, or serving as a director or
officer of another Person at the request of, the Company or a Company
Subsidiary (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ," and each such indemnification
agreement, a " _D andO Indemnification Agreement_"); and (ii) any
indemnification or expense reimbursement or advance provision and any
exculpation provision set forth in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
of the Company or other similar organizational documents of any Company
Subsidiary as in effect on the date of this Agreement. For a period of six (6)
years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving
Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries to contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to exculpation, indemnification and reimbursement and
advance of expenses of directors and officers of the Company for periods at
and prior to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the
Organizational Documents of the Company and such Company Subsidiaries. To the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the DandO Indemnification Agreements to continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms following the Effective Time.

 

(c) If either of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.09_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws or otherwise to consummate and make effective
the Transactions as promptly as practicable, including (i) the obtaining of
all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, clearances,
approvals, and expirations or terminations of waiting periods from
Governmental Authorities and the making of all necessary registrations and
filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval,
clearance or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Authority, including in connection with any Regulatory Law (all
of the foregoing, collectively, the " _Governmental Consents_ "), (ii) the
delivery of required notices to, and the obtaining of all necessary consents,
approvals or waivers from third parties and (iii) the defending of any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions; 
_provided_ , that in no event shall the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries be required to pay prior to the Closing any fee, penalty or other
consideration to any third party for any consent or approval required for the
consummation of the Transactions under any contract or agreement.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without
limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other
in (i) determining whether any filings are required to be made with, or
Governmental Consents are required to be obtained from, any Governmental
Authorities (including in any foreign jurisdiction in which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary are operating any business) and (ii) to the extent not
made prior to the date hereof, timely making or causing to be made all such
applications and filings as reasonably determined by Parent and the Company
as promptly as practicable, and in any event as of the date hereof with
respect to filings or submissions required under the HSR Act. Each party shall
supply as promptly as practicable such information, documentation, other
material or testimony that may be requested by any Governmental Authority,
including by complying at the earliest reasonably practicable date with any
request under or with respect to the HSR Act, any other Governmental Consent
and any such other applicable Laws for additional information, documents or
other materials received by Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries from the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice,
or any other Governmental Authority in connection with such applications or
filings or the Transactions.

 

(c) Without limiting any of its other obligations hereunder, Parent and
Merger Sub shall take all such further action as may be necessary to resolve
such objections, if any, as the United States Federal Trade Commission, the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, state antitrust
enforcement authorities, or competition authorities of any other nation or
other jurisdiction (including multinational or supranational), or any other
Person, may assert under any Regulatory Law with respect to the Transactions,
and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Regulatory
Law that may be asserted by any Person with respect to the Merger, in each
case so as to enable the Merger and the Transactions to occur as soon as
possible (and in any event no later than sixty (60) days from the date of this
Agreement), including by proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting,
by agreement, consent decree, hold separate order, trust or otherwise, (x) the
sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets, businesses, services,
products or product lines of Parent or the Company (or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates) or behavioral limitations, conduct

commitments with respect to any such assets, businesses, services, products or
product lines of Parent or the Company (or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates), (y) the creation or termination of
relationships, ventures, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or
Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates and (z) any other
actions that would limit the freedom of action of Parent, the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates with respect to, or its ability
to retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries (including the Companys or
the Surviving Corporations) or Affiliates assets, businesses, services,
products or product lines, in each case as may be required in order to obtain
all required Governmental Consents as promptly as practicable (including
expirations or terminations of waiting periods whether imposed by Law or
agreement) and to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order in any suit or
proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing
the consummation of the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or delaying any of the foregoing beyond the End Date (each of (x),
(y) and (z), a " _Divestiture Action_ "). Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiaries shall, without Parents prior written consent, and neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, without the Companys prior written
consent, discuss or commit to any extension of any waiting period under any
Regulatory Law or any agreement not to consummate the Merger or any of the
Transactions. None of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall be required to
take any action pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ unless it is expressly
conditioned on the effectiveness of the Merger.

(d) Without limiting the foregoing and subject to applicable legal
limitations and the instructions of any Governmental Authority, each of the
Company and Parent agrees (i) to cooperate and consult with each other in
connection with the making of all registrations, filings, notifications,
communications, submissions and any other material actions pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.10_, (ii) to furnish to the other such necessary information
and assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with its

with respect to the Transactions, (iv) to permit the other party to review and
to incorporate the other partys reasonable comments in any communication to
be given by it to any Governmental Authority with respect to obtaining the
necessary approvals for the Transactions and (v) not to participate in any
meeting or discussion in person or by telephone expected to
address substantive matters related to the transactions contemplated herein
with any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions unless, to
the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Authority, it gives the other
party reasonable notice thereof and the opportunity to attend and observe.
The parties shall take reasonable efforts to share information protected from
disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint
defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.10_ in a manner so as to preserve any applicable privilege. Parent and the
Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this _Section_
__ _ 6.10_ _.(_ _d)_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and
the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to

as the case may be) or its legal counsel.

opportunity to participate in the defense and settlement of, any Stockholder
Litigation. No compromise or settlement of any Stockholder Litigation shall
be agreed to by the Company without prior written consent of Parent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless such
compromise or settlement involves only the payment of reasonable
attorneys fees of the plaintiff not to exceed $1 million in the aggregate
for all such Stockholder Litigation and/or the modification of previous
disclosure, which modification shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent.

 

Section 6.12. _Public Announcements_. The parties hereto agree that the

release or announcement concerning the Transactions shall be issued by any
party or its Subsidiaries without the prior consent of the other party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as
may be required by applicable Laws or the rules or regulations of the NYSE
or any other regulatory or governmental body to which the relevant party is
subject or submits, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other party
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.12_ shall not apply to any release or announcement made or
proposed to be made by the Company in connection with a Superior Proposal or
a Change in Recommendation, each in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.02_.

 

Section 6.13. _Section_ __ _ 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause any dispositions of
equity securities of the Company (including any derivative securities with
respect to any equity securities of the Company) by each individual who is a
director or officer of the Company, and who would otherwise be subject to
Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, to be exempt under Exchange Act Rule 16b-3.

 

Section 6.14. _Rule 14d-10 Matters_ _._ Prior to the scheduled expiration
date of the Offer, the Company (acting through the Company Board and its
Compensation Committee) shall use reasonable efforts to take all such steps as
may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule 14d-10 promulgated under the
Exchange Act any then effective employment compensation, severance or other
employee benefit arrangement between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and any director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries who then holds shares of Company Common Stock. Promptly upon
Parent or any of its Affiliates entering into any such arrangement with any
such Person, Parent will provide to the Company any and all information
concerning such arrangements as may be needed by the Company to comply with
this _Section_ __ _ 6.14_.

 



66 CONFIDENTIAL



 

Section 6.15. _Stock_ _Exchange De-listing_. Prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable
Laws and rules and policies of the NYSE to cause the delisting of the Company
and of the Company Common Stock from the NYSE as promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time and the deregistration of the Company Common Stock under
the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting.

Section 6.16. _Director Resignations_ _._ At the Closing, the Company
shall deliver to Parent evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the
resignation of the directors of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(other than directors of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries whom Parent
determines shall continue to serve in such capacities following the Effective
Time), effective at the Effective Time.

 

Section 6.17. _Financing Cooperation_ _._

 

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of
the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, the Company will, and will cause each Company Subsidiary to and will
direct their respective management, officers and other representatives to, use
reasonable best efforts to provide cooperation and assistance reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement, syndication,
negotiation and receipt of any Debt Financing, including: (i) furnishing
Parent with reasonably available financial information (including historical

consummate the Closing.

 

(b) Parent shall, upon written request by the Company, promptly reimburse
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company and the Company

thereafter such Acquisition Transaction is consummated (whether or not such

within twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, any Acquisition
Transaction is consummated, then the Company shall pay Parent the Termination
Fee (less any Parent Expenses previously reimbursed pursuant to  _Section_ __
_ 9.04.(e)_) promptly, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days after

incurred by Parent and its Affiliates on or prior to the termination of this
Agreement in connection with the Transactions (the " _Parent Expenses_ "), by
wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts designated by Parent;
_provided_ , that the existence of circumstances which could require the

pay the Parent Expenses pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.04.(e)_; _provided_
, further, that the payment by the Company of Parent Expenses pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 9.04.(e)_ shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent

(less the Parent Expenses previously reimbursed).

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by the Company under this
_Section_ __ _ 9.04_ shall be payable only once with respect to this

payable under one or more provisions hereof.

(g) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this 
_Section_ __ _ 9.04_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that
without such provisions Parent and Merger Sub would not have entered into this
Agreement. Parent shall promptly provide to the Company upon request therefor
the wire transfer information required to make any payments pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 9.04_. If the Company fails to pay the Termination Fee or
Parent Expenses or any portion thereof and Parent or Merger Sub commences a
suit which results in an Order against the Company for the Termination Fee or
Parent Expenses or any portion thereof, the Company shall reimburse Parent and
Merger Sub for their reasonable and documented, out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) in
connection with such suit; _provided_ that if Parent commences such a suit
which does not result in an Order against the Company for the Termination Fee
or Parent Expenses or any portion thereof, Parent shall reimburse the Company
for its reasonable and documented, out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) in connection with
such suit.

 



74 CONFIDENTIAL

but subject to  _Section_ __ _ 9.09_ (which shall not be limited by
_Section_ __ _ 9.04.(a)_), in the event that the Termination Fee and/or the
Parent Expenses (as applicable) are paid by the Company as required by this 
_Section_ __ _ 9.04_, Parents right to receive payment from the Company of
the Termination Fee and/or the Parent Expenses (as applicable) pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 9.04_ shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates and Representatives against the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and any of their respective former,
current or future Representatives, general or limited partners,
stockholders, members, managers, employees, Affiliates or assignees
(collectively, the " _Company-Related Parties_ ") for all damages, costs,

contrary, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to
confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or their respective
successors, and permitted assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, except (i) the provisions

foregoing, the Company agrees to cause any Proceeding seeking an injunction,

77 CONFIDENTIAL



 

accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.04.(g)_) in excess of $12,600,690 in the
aggregate (the " _Monetary Damages Amount_ "). Other than the Monetary
Damages Remedy or reimbursement of expenses in accordance with _Section_ __ _
9.04.(g)_, in no event shall the Company or any of its respective former,
current and future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons,
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, members,
managers, general or limited partners or assignees have the right to seek or
obtain money damages or expense reimbursement (whether at law or in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) from Parent or Merger Sub or any
of their respective former, current and future direct or indirect equity
holders, controlling persons, stockholders, directors, officers, employees,
agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners or
assignees. The parties acknowledge and agree that the availability of the
Monetary Damages Remedy cannot and will not be used by Parent or Merger Sub as
a defense to a claim for specific performance as provided in clause (b)(i)
and (c) of this _Section_ __ _ 9.09_.

(c) _Acknowledgement Regarding Available Remedies_. Solely to the extent
that the right of specific performance is explicitly applicable under the
terms of this _Section_ __ _ 9.09_, the parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not
perform their obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate
the Merger and the other Transactions) in accordance with its specified terms
or otherwise breach such provisions. Solely to the extent that the right of
specific performance is explicitly applicable under the terms of this
_Section_ __ _ 9.09_, the parties acknowledge and agree that the parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described
in _Section_ __ _ 9.07_ without proof of damages or otherwise, and that such
explicit rights of specific enforcement are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without such rights, neither
the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Each of the
parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other
parties hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity to
the extent that the right of specific performance is explicitly applicable
under the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 9.09_. The parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement (to the extent that the right of specific
performance is explicitly applicable under the terms of this _Section_ __ _
9.09_) shall not be required to provide any bond or other security

remedies provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 9.09_ shall be the parties sole
and exclusive remedies for any breaches of this Agreement or any claims
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance of the
foregoing, each party hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, any and all other rights, claims and causes of action, known
or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future,
that such party may have against the other party or any of its directors,
officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
advisors or representatives arising under or based upon any federal, state or
local law (including any securities law, common law or otherwise) for any
breach of the representations and warranties or covenants contained in this
Agreement.

 



78 CONFIDENTIAL



 

Section 9.10. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way
be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the issuance of the Top-Up Shares,
the Merger and the other Transactions is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties agree
to negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner, in order that the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the issuance of the Top-Up
Shares, the Merger and the other Transactions be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Agreement, the exhibits to this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedules
and any documents delivered by the parties hereto in connection herewith

subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the parties with respect thereto.

Schedules against any party hereto that drafted or prepared such document is

hereto, and any controversy over interpretations of this Agreement shall be
decided without regards to events of drafting or preparation.

Section 9.13. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed
in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall
have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto,
it being understood and agreed that all parties hereto need not sign the same
counterpart. Until and unless each party hereto has received a counterpart
hereof signed by each other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect
and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue
of any other oral or written agreement or other communication). Signatures to
this Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in

exercise or vesting, as applicable, of all Company Options and Company TVDS
Awards (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ ");

 

(ii) at the Offer Expiration Time, any applicable waiting period under the
HSR Act shall not have expired or been terminated;

(iii) any of the following conditions shall exist at the time of Offer
Expiration Time:

 

(A) any Order issued by a Governmental Authority, or any applicable Law
shall be in effect that would (1) make the Offer, the Top-Up Option (if
applicable), the issuance of the Top-Up Shares (if applicable), the Merger or
the other Transactions illegal or (2) otherwise prevent or prohibit the
consummation thereof;

(B) any representation and warranty of the Company set forth (1) in
_Section_ __ _ 4.01_, _Section_ __ _ 4.03_, _Section_ __ _ 4.06_ (to the
extent such provisions in _Section_ __ _ 4.06_ do not impact the Aggregate
Consideration payable), _Section_ __ _ 4.23_ or _Section_ __ _ 4.25_ shall
not be true and correct in all material respects; (2) in _Section_ __ _ 4.06_

Consideration payable) of the Merger Agreement shall not be true and correct
in all respects, except to the extent that any inaccuracies would be de
minimis; (3) in  _Section_ __ _ 4.11(b)_ (No Company Material Adverse
Effect) of the Merger Agreement shall not be true and correct in all respects,
and/or (4) each other representation and warranty of the Company set forth in
the Merger Agreement shall not be true and correct in all respects (after
disregarding any qualifications that reference material, materiality or
Company Material Adverse Effect) except to the extent that any inaccuracies in
such representation or warranty would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, in the case of clauses (B)(1), (B)(2), (B)(3) and (B)(4), as if such
representations and warranties were made on and as of the Offer Expiration
Time (or, in the case of such representations and warranties made only as of
a specified time or date, on and as of such specified time or date);

(C) since the date of the Merger Agreement there shall have been a Company
Material Adverse Effect;

 



A-1 (D) the Company shall have failed to perform in any material respect
any obligation or to comply in any material respect with any agreement or
covenant of the Company to be performed or complied with by it under the
Merger Agreement prior to such time; or

 

(E) the Company shall have failed to deliver to Parent a certificate signed
by a senior executive officer of the Company dated the date on which the
Offer expires certifying that the conditions specified in clauses (B), (C) and
(D) of this paragraph (iii) do not exist; or

 

(iv) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its
terms (the " _Termination Condition_ ").

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and
may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and
from time to time and in the sole discretion of Parent or Merger Sub, subject
in each case to the terms of the Merger Agreement and applicable Law;
_provided_ that the foregoing conditions set forth in clauses (i) and (iv)
may not be waived without the prior written consent of the Company and Parent.
Any reference in this _Exhibit A_ or in the Merger Agreement to a condition or
requirement being satisfied shall be deemed met if such condition or
requirement is so waived. The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to,
and not a limitation of, the rights of Parent and Merger Sub to extend,
terminate and/or modify the Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement. The failure by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Affiliate of
Parent at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed
a waiver of any such right, and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing
right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

Capitalized terms used in this _Exhibit A_ but not defined herein shall have
the meanings set forth in the agreement to which it is attached, except that
the term " _Merger Agreement_ " shall be deemed to refer to the agreement to
which this _Exhibit A_ is attached.

that this Agreement shall apply to the Stockholder solely in the Stockholders
capacity as a stockholder of the Company and that any trustee who signs this
Agreement on behalf of the Stockholder is signing only in his or her
capacity as a trustee and not as an individual or in any other capacity). No
action (or inaction) taken by any trustee in their capacity as a director or
officer of the Company shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this
Agreement.

 

6\. _No Ownership Interest_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to vest in Parent or Merger Sub any direct or indirect ownership or
incidence of ownership of or with respect to any Subject Shares. All rights,
ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the Subject Shares shall
remain vested in and belong to the Stockholder, and neither Parent nor Merger
Sub shall have the authority by virtue of this Agreement or the transactions
to be consummated pursuant hereto to manage, direct, superintend, restrict,

such court (and, in the case of appeals, the appropriate appellate court
therefrom), in any such action or proceeding and irrevocably waive the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such action or
proceeding. The consents to jurisdiction set forth in this paragraph shall not
constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware
and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph
and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties
hereto. The parties agree that service of any court paper may be made in any
manner as may be provided under the applicable Laws or court rules governing
service of process in such court. The parties hereto agree that a final
judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other

WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT

seeking to enforce this Agreement against such nonperforming party under this
Agreement shall be entitled to specific performance and the issuance of
injunctive and other equitable relief. The parties hereto further agree to

obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in
whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise), without the prior
written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except that Merger
Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests
and obligations under this Agreement to any one or more direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent without the consent of the Stockholder,
but no such assignment shall relieve Merger Sub of any of its obligations
under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

(g) _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in
