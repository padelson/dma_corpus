certificates representing such Outstanding Shares, duly endorsed by the
Company Shareholder for transfer to Buyer, and upon the Shareholders
Representatives receipt of the portion of the Purchase Price at Closing as
provided in Section 2.03(b)(v), good and valid title to the such Outstanding
Shares will pass to Buyer, free and clear of any Liens, other than those
arising from acts of Buyer or its Affiliates or those arising under federal
or state securities laws. Other than this Agreement, the Outstanding Shares
listed as owned by the Company Shareholder in Annex A are not subject to any
voting trust agreement or other Contract, including any Contract restricting

formation. This Agreement has been (and each other Transaction Document to be
executed by the Company Shareholder at or prior to the Closing will be) duly
and validly executed and delivered by the Company Shareholder or the

and delivery by the other parties hereto and thereto, constitutes (and each
other Transaction Document to which the Company Shareholder is a party when
executed and delivered, and assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by the other parties hereto and thereto, will constitute) a valid and
binding obligation of the Company Shareholder, enforceable against the
Company Shareholder in accordance with its terms, except (i) as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, moratorium, receivership or other similar laws
affecting or relating to enforcement of creditors rights generally and (ii)

execution and delivery by the Company Shareholder of this Agreement and each
other Transaction Document to which the Company Shareholder is a party, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and
compliance by the Company Shareholder with the terms hereof and thereof does
not conflict with, or result in any violation of, any Law applicable to the
Company Shareholder or his respective properties or assets, other than any
such items that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect (a) on the ability
of the Company Shareholder to perform his respective obligations under this

actions taken pursuant to this Section 5.04.

 

Section 5.05 No Inconsistent Acts. Each of Buyer and the Company Shareholders
agree not to take any action that is inconsistent with its obligations under

parties will promptly notify each other of any event that occurs or
circumstance that arises that could prevent any party from being able to

44 Section 5.06 Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation and Confidentiality.

 

(a) No Principal Shareholder shall, individually or collectively, directly or
indirectly, acting alone, as a member of any partnership or other business
entity, as a holder of capital stock of any class or as an officer, director,
employee, consultant, agent or representative of any corporation or other
business entity other than Buyer or any Subsidiary of Buyer:

 

(i) during the five (5) year period commencing with the Closing Date, (A)
engage in the temperature-controlled trucking business, (B) divert or attempt
to divert any business or customers for such services, by direct or indirect
inducement, (C) otherwise do or perform, directly or indirectly, any other act
injurious or prejudicial to the sale of such services by Buyer, the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries, or (D) extend, or assist in arranging the
extension of, any credit to any Person for the purpose of establishing,
acquiring or otherwise conducting any such business or other activity
prohibited by clause (A) above; _provided_ , _however_ , that the restrictions
contained in this Section 5.06 shall not restrict the direct or indirect
acquisition by a Principal Shareholder, together with its Affiliates, of less
than two percent (2%) of the outstanding capital stock of any publicly traded
company engaged in the temperature-controlled trucking business or in the
provision of services of a type competitive with such business; or

 

(ii) during the five (5) year period commencing with the Closing Date, without
first obtaining the written consent of Buyer, employ or solicit for
employment any individual employed in the Business or acting as a vehicle
owner-operator or similar independent contractor for the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries during such period, or any former employee or vehicle
owner-operator or similar independent contractor who was employed in the
Business or who was engaged by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
at any time during the three (3) month period prior to the Closing Date;
_provided, however,_ that this Section 5.06 shall not prohibit any public
advertisement or general solicitation, or any hiring pursuant thereto of an
employee or independent contractor who responds to such public advertisement
or general solicitation, by Central Freight Lines, Inc. or any Subsidiary
thereof.

(b) No Principal Shareholder shall, individually or collectively, directly or
indirectly, disclose to any third parties any trade secrets or other
confidential information of Buyer, the Company or other Company Subsidiary or
otherwise relating to the Business or the temperature-controlled trucking
business. 

It is the desired intent of the Principal Shareholders and Buyer that the
foregoing provisions of this Section 5.06 shall be enforced to the fullest
extent permissible in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.
Accordingly, the Principal Shareholders and Buyer agree that if the covenants
set forth in this Section 5.06 are deemed by any court or arbitrator to be
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the court or arbitrator may
reduce the scope thereof or otherwise amend or reform the portion thus
adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, such reduction, amendment or
reformation to apply only with respect to the particular jurisdiction in
which such adjudication is made. The Principal Shareholders acknowledge that
Buyer has no adequate remedy at law for any breach or any threatened or
attempted breach by any Principal Shareholder of the covenants and agreements
set forth in this Section 5.06 and, accordingly, the Principal Shareholders
agree that Buyer shall, in addition to the other remedies that may be
available to it hereunder or at law, be entitled to commence proceedings in
equity and obtain an injunction temporarily or permanently enjoining any
Principal Shareholder from breaching or threatening or attempting any such
breach of such covenants and agreements and to require compliance by any
Principal Shareholder with such covenants and agreements. For purposes of any
such proceeding in equity, it shall be presumed that the remedies at Law
available to Buyer would be inadequate, and that Buyer would suffer
irreparable harm as a result of the violation of any provision of this
Section 5.06.

 



45 Section 5.07 Release by the Company Shareholders.

 

(a) Effective as of the Closing Date, each Company Shareholder hereby
absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably releases and discharges, fully,
finally and forever, Buyer, the Company, each Company Subsidiary, and their
respective past, present and future Affiliates, equity holders, employees,
managers, partners, directors, officers, agents, attorneys, plan
administrators, consultants, advisors, representatives and Subsidiaries and
the respective heirs, successors and assigns of each of the foregoing
(collectively, the " _Released Parties_ ") from any and all claims, demands,
rights, causes of action, proceedings, orders, remedies, obligations, damages
and liabilities of whatsoever kind or character arising as a result of any
event or condition, or action or inaction of the Released Parties, from the
beginning of time until the Closing Date, whether known or unknown, absolute
or contingent, both at Law and in equity, which each Company Shareholder ever
had, now has, or ever may have, against any Released Parties, including in
each Company Shareholders capacity as a stockholder of the Company and
pursuant to any contract between such Company Shareholder and a Released Party
(as to each Company Shareholder, such Company Shareholders " _Company
Shareholder s Claims_"); _provided_ , _however_ , that Company Shareholders
Claims shall not include (i) any claims related to or arising out of this
Agreement or any documents, agreements or certificates executed or entered
into by Buyer, the Company Shareholders or the Shareholders Representative
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) with respect to
any Company Shareholder that is a director, executive officer or employee of

Subsidiaries generally applicable requirements for reporting and
documenting such expenses); or (iii) any legal obligation of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary to indemnify and hold harmless any Company Shareholder
that is a current or former director or officer of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary from or against any liability arising from or in connection with
the discharge of such Company Shareholders duties in their capacities as an
officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 

(b) Each Company Shareholder represents that it has not filed, and covenants
that it will not file, any complaint or claim against Buyer, the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any other Released Party with any Governmental Entity or

the Closing Date in relation to any matter released hereunder. Each
Company Shareholder further represents that it has not assigned any Company
Shareholders Claim or authorized any other Person to assert any Company
Shareholders Claim on its behalf.

 



46 (c) Each Company Shareholder expressly acknowledges that the release provided
under this Section 5.07 is intended to include in its effect all claims
within the scope of this Section 5.07 that such Company Shareholder does not
know or suspect to exist in such Company Shareholders favor at the time of
execution hereof, and that this Section 5.07 contemplates the extinguishment
of any such claim or claims.

(d) The release provided under this Section 5.07 shall extend to and be
binding upon each Company Shareholder and its legal successors and assigns,
and shall inure to the benefit of Buyer, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries
and the other Released Parties.

 

(e) Each Company Shareholder acknowledges that it is aware that statutes exist
that render null and void or otherwise affect or may affect releases and
discharges of any claims, rights, demands, liabilities, actions and causes of
action which are unknown to the releasing or discharging party at the time of
execution of the release and discharge. Each Company Shareholder
hereby expressly waives, surrenders and agrees to forego any and all
protections, rights or benefits to which it otherwise would be entitled by
virtue of the existence of any such statute or the common law of any state or
jurisdiction with the same or similar effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such waiver, surrender and agreement to forego does not extend to claims
arising out of, based upon or relating to the breach by Buyer of any of the
provisions of this Agreement or any documents, agreements or certificates
executed or entered into by any party hereto in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.08 Employee Matters.

" _Company Option Plan_ ") shall be terminated and of no further force and
effect. The Shareholders Representative shall deliver evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer that all Options have been exercised or
terminated and all Company Option Plans have been terminated.

 

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to give any Person other than
the parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim
hereunder, nor any right to employment for any period of time.

 



47 Section 5.09 Certain Tax Matters

 

(a) _Preparation and Filing of Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns_. The
Shareholders Representative shall, with the assistance of Company personnel
and at no expense to the Shareholders Representative, prepare, or cause to be
prepared, all Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns required to be filed by or on
behalf of each of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. All such Pre-Closing
Period Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed in a manner that is consistent
with the prior practice of the applicable Company or Company Subsidiary,
except as required by applicable Law. The Shareholders Representative
shall deliver or cause to be delivered a draft of any such Pre-Closing Period
Tax Return to Buyer for its review at least thirty (30) days prior to the due
date of such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return. The filing of any Pre-Closing
Period Tax Return shall be subject to Buyers approval (which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If Buyer disputes any
item on such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return, it shall notify the Shareholders
Representative (by written notice within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such
draft of such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return) of such disputed item (or items)
and the basis for its objection. If Buyer does not object by written notice
within such period, such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return shall be deemed to be
accepted and agreed upon, and final and conclusive, for purposes of this
Section 5.09(a). Buyer and the Shareholders Representative shall act in good
faith to resolve any dispute prior to the due date of any such Pre-Closing
Period Tax Return. If Buyer and the Shareholders Representative cannot
resolve any disputed item, the item in question shall be resolved by a
nationally recognized accounting firm selected by Buyer and agreed to by the
Shareholders Representative as promptly as practicable, whose determination
shall be final and conclusive for purposes of this Section 5.09(a). Without
limitation, each of Buyer and the Shareholders Representative may submit to
such nationally recognized accounting firm any data and information as it
deems appropriate. The nationally recognized accounting firm shall be
instructed to use every reasonable effort to complete its services within
fifteen (15) calendar days after submission of the dispute to it and, in any
case, as soon as practicable after such submission and any fees and expenses
of such party shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent
(50%) by the Company Shareholders. The Shareholders Representative shall
timely file all Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns and timely pay any Tax shown as
due thereon; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any Pre-Closing Period Tax
Return of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is due after the Closing and
the Shareholders Representative is not authorized to execute and file such
Pre-Closing Period Tax Return under applicable Law, Buyer shall execute and
timely file (or cause to be executed and timely filed) such Pre-Closing
Period Tax Return (as finally determined pursuant to this Section 5.09(a))
with the appropriate Taxing Authority and timely pay any Tax shown as due
thereon. If any Pre-Closing Period Tax Return of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is due after the Closing and is to be filed (or caused to be filed)
by Buyer pursuant to this Section 5.09(a), the Company Shareholders shall pay
(in immediately available funds) to Buyer the amount of all Indemnified Taxes
due and payable with respect to such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return (determined
pursuant to this Section 5.09(a)), less amounts attributable to reserves,
working capital accruals, and estimated taxes already paid by the Company,
Company Subsidiaries, or Company Shareholders, no later than three (3)
Business Days prior to the earlier of the date such Pre-Closing Period Tax
Return is filed or the due date of such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return. Amounts
required to be paid by the Company Shareholders to Buyer pursuant to this
Section 5.09(a) that are not paid on or prior to the date specified herein
shall accrue interest at the simple rate of six percent (6%) per annum until
paid in full. In the event that such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return reflects
any refund, the provisions of Section 5.09(h) shall control.

 



48 (b) _Preparation and Filing of Straddle Period Tax Returns_. Buyer shall,
at Buyers cost and expense, prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared
and timely filed, all Straddle Period Tax Returns required to be filed by each
of the Company and any Company Subsidiary and shall timely pay any Tax shown
as due thereon. All Straddle Period Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed
in a manner consistent with the prior practice of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, as the case may be, except as required by applicable Law. Buyer
shall deliver or cause to be delivered drafts of all Straddle Period Tax
Returns to the Shareholders Representative for its review prior to the due
date of any such Straddle Period Tax Return and shall notify the Shareholders
Representative of Buyers calculation of the Company Shareholders share of
the Taxes of the Company or Company Subsidiary for such Straddle Period
(determined in accordance with Section 5.09(d)); _provided_ , _however_ , that
such drafts of any such Straddle Period Tax Returns and such calculations of
the Company Shareholders share of the Tax liability for such Straddle Period
(determined in accordance with Section 5.09(d)) shall be subject to the
Shareholders Representatives review and approval, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the Shareholders
Representative disputes any item on such Straddle Period Tax Return, it shall
notify Buyer (by written notice within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such
Straddle Period Tax Return and calculation) of such disputed item (or items)
and the basis for its objection. If the Shareholders Representative does not
object by written notice within such period, such draft of such Straddle
Period Tax Return and calculation of the Company Shareholders share of the
Taxes for such Straddle Period shall be deemed to have been accepted and
agreed upon, and final and conclusive, for purposes of this Section 5.09(b).
Buyer and the Shareholders Representative shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve any such dispute prior to the due date of such Straddle Period Tax
Return. If Buyer and the Shareholders Representative cannot resolve any
disputed item, the disputed item shall be resolved by a nationally recognized
accounting firm selected by Buyer and agreed to by the Shareholders
Representative as promptly as practicable, whose determination shall be final
and conclusive for purposes of this Section 5.09(b). Without limitation, each
of Buyer and the Shareholders Representative may submit to such nationally
recognized accounting firm any data and information as it deems appropriate.
The nationally recognized accounting firm shall be instructed to use every
reasonable effort to complete its services within fifteen (15) calendar days
after submission of the dispute to it and, in any case, as soon as practicable
after such submission and any fees and expenses of such party shall be paid
fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by the Company
Shareholders. No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the earlier of
the date a Straddle Period Tax Return of any of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is filed or the due date of such Straddle Period Tax Return, the
Company Shareholders shall pay (in immediately available funds) to Buyer the
amount of all Indemnified Taxes required to be paid with respect to such
Straddle Period Tax Return (determined pursuant to this Section 5.09(b)).
Amounts required to be paid by the Company Shareholders to Buyer pursuant to
this Section 5.09(b) that are not paid on or prior to the date specified
herein shall accrue interest at the simple rate of six percent (6%) per annum
until paid in full. In the event that such Straddle Period Tax Return reflects
any refund, the provisions of Section 5.09(h) shall control. 

(c) _Transfer Taxes_. The Company Shareholders shall pay one hundred percent
(100%) of all transfer, real property transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, duty, recording and similar Taxes (including any penalties, interest
and additions to Tax) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, other than net of gross income or capital
gain Taxes imposed on Company Shareholders, which shall be solely for the
account of such Company Shareholder (together, " _Transfer Taxes_ "). Buyer
shall be responsible for preparing and filing all Tax Returns or
other applicable documents in connection with all Transfer Taxes, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
Shareholders shall cooperate with Buyer in the preparation and filing of all
Tax Returns or other applicable documents for or with respect to Transfer
Taxes, including timely signing and delivering such Tax Returns, documents,
and certificates as may be necessary or appropriate to file such Tax Returns
or establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce) Transfer Taxes.

 



49 (d) _Computation of Taxes for Straddle Periods_. To the extent permitted or
required under applicable Law, the taxable year of each of the Company and
all Company Subsidiaries that includes the Closing Date shall close as of the
end of the Closing Date. Whenever it is necessary to determine the liability
for Taxes for a Straddle Period relating to:

(i) Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that are imposed on a
periodic basis (such as real property and other ad valorem Taxes), the
determination of Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date shall
be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the entire Straddle Period; and

 

(ii) Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary not described in Section
5.09(d)(i) (such as (A) Taxes based on the income or receipts of the Company
and any Company Subsidiary for a Straddle Period, (B) Taxes imposed in
connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property
(including all sales and use Taxes) for a Straddle Period other than Transfer
Taxes, and (C) withholding and employment Taxes relating to a Straddle
Period), the determination of the Taxes of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including, and
the portion of the Straddle Period beginning and ending after, the Closing
Date shall be calculated by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two
taxable periods, one which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the
other which began at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date and
items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary for the Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two taxable
years or periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary were closed at the close of the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including, but not limited
to, depreciation and amortization deductions) will be allocated between the
period ending on the Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date in
proportion to the number of days in each such period.

 



50 (e) The Company Shareholders, the Shareholders Representative and Buyer
shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates,
officers, employees, agents, auditors and representatives reasonably to
cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary relating to any Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period,
including maintaining and making available to each other all records necessary
in connection with Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary relating to
any Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period, and in resolving all Tax Contests
in accordance with Section 5.09(f) with respect to all such Pre-Closing
Periods and Straddle Periods. Buyer recognizes that the Company Shareholders
and the Shareholders Representative may need access, from time to time,
after the Closing Date, to certain accounting and Tax records and information
held by the Company or any Company Subsidiary to the extent such records and
information pertain to events occurring on or prior to the Closing Date;
therefore, Buyer agrees that from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall,
and shall cause the Company and any Company Subsidiary to, retain and maintain
such records and information until the later of (i) six (6) years following
the Closing Date and (ii) the applicable statute of limitations with respect
to the Tax for which such records or information relate (without regard to
extensions), and allow the Shareholders Representative (and its agents and
other representatives of the Shareholders) to inspect, review and make copies
of such records and information as the Shareholders Representative or other
agents and representatives of the Company Shareholders reasonably request from
time to time during normal business hours and after appropriate prior
notification. The Company Shareholders and the Shareholders Representative
recognize that Buyer may need access, from time to time, after the Closing
Date, to certain accounting and Tax records and information held by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to the extent such records and information
pertain to events occurring on or prior to the Closing Date; therefore, the
Company Shareholders and the Shareholders Representative agree that from
and after the Closing Date, the Company Shareholders and the Shareholders
Representative shall retain and maintain such records and information until
the later of (i) six (6) years following the Closing Date and (ii) the
applicable statute of limitations with respect to the Tax for which such
records or information relate (without regard to extensions), and allow Buyer
(and its agents) to inspect, review and make copies of such records and
information as Buyer or other agents of Buyer reasonably request from time to
time during normal business hours and after appropriate prior notification.

(f)  _Tax Contests_.

(i) Buyer shall deliver a written notice to the Shareholders Representative
in writing promptly following any demand, claim, or notice of commencement of
a claim, proposed adjustment, assessment, audit, examination or other
administrative or court proceeding with respect to Taxes of or relating to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary for which the Company Shareholders may be
liable (" _Tax Contest_ ") and shall describe in reasonable detail (to the
extent known by Buyer) the facts constituting the basis for such Tax Contest,
the nature of the relief sought, and the amount of the claimed liabilities
(including Taxes), if any; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure or delay
to so notify the Shareholders Representative shall not relieve the Company
Shareholders of any obligation or liability that the Company Shareholders may
have to Buyer, except to the extent that the Shareholders Representative
demonstrates that the Company Shareholders are adversely prejudiced thereby.

 

(ii) With respect to Tax Contests for Taxes of each of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing Period, such Tax Contests shall be
controlled by the Shareholders Representative; _provided_ , that (i) Buyer
also may participate in the Tax Contest (at its own expense), and (ii) the
Shareholders Representative shall not settle or compromise any such Tax
Contest without the prior written consent of Buyer (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). The Shareholders
Representative shall (x) keep Buyer reasonably informed of all
material developments and events relating to such Tax Contest (including
promptly forwarding copies to Buyer of any related correspondence), (y)
consult with Buyer in connection with the defense or prosecution of any such
Tax Contest and (z) provide such cooperation and information as Buyer shall
reasonably request.

 



51 (iii) In connection with any Tax Contest for Taxes of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary for any Straddle Period, such Tax Contest shall be
controlled by Buyer; _provided_ , that Buyer shall not settle or compromise
(or take such other actions described herein with respect to) any Tax Contest
without the prior written consent of the Shareholders Representative, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Buyer shall
(x) keep the Shareholders Representative reasonably informed of all material
developments and events relating to such Tax Contest (including promptly
forwarding copies to the Shareholders Representative of any related
correspondence and shall provide the Shareholders Representative with an
opportunity to review and comment on any material correspondence before Buyer
sends such correspondence to any Taxing Authority), (y) consult with the
Shareholders Representative in connection with the defense or prosecution of
any such Tax Contest and (z) provide such cooperation and information as the
Shareholders Representative shall reasonably request, and, at its own cost
and expense, the Shareholders Representative shall have the right to
participate in (but not control) the defense of such Tax Contest (including
participating in any discussions with the applicable Taxing Authorities
regarding such Tax Contests).

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
procedures for all Tax Contests shall be governed exclusively by this Section
5.09(f) (and not Section 8.04). 

(g) _Adjustments to the Purchase Price_. Buyer and the Company Shareholders
agree to treat any amounts payable after the Closing by the Company
Shareholders to Buyer (or by Buyer to the Company Shareholders) pursuant to
this Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless a final
determination by the appropriate Taxing Authority or court causes any
such payment not to be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes.

(h) _Tax Refunds of the Company_. Buyer may, at its option, cause any of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to elect, where permitted by applicable Law,
to carry forward or waive the carry back of any Tax attribute carryover that
would, absent such election, be carried back to a Pre-Closing Period or
Straddle Period. Buyer shall promptly notify the Shareholders Representative
of and pay (or cause to be paid) to the Company Shareholders the amount of (i)
any refund of (or credit with respect to) Taxes paid by any of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Period actually received (or, in
the case of a credit, utilized) by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii)
a portion of any refund of (or credit with respect to) Taxes paid by any of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary for any Straddle Period (such portion to
be allocated consistent with the principles set forth in Section 5.09(d))
actually received (or, in the case of a credit, utilized) by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, in each case, net of any Tax liabilities or increase
in Tax liabilities imposed on Buyer or any of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (or any of their respective Affiliates) resulting from such refund
or credit;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Shareholders shall not
be entitled to any amount under this Section 5.09(h) to the extent such amount
relates to a carryback of a Tax attribute arising in any Post-Closing Period.
Buyer shall pay (or cause to be paid) the amounts described in the second
sentence of this Section 5.09(h) within thirty (30) days after the actual
receipt of the Tax refund or utilization of the Tax credit giving rise to
Buyers obligation to make payment hereunder with respect thereto. If any
refund or credit subsequently is disallowed, the Company Shareholders must
return to Buyer the disallowed amount.

 



52 (i) _Company Subsidiary Conversions_. The Company Shareholders shall cause the
Company to take all actions necessary such that prior to the Closing, each of
the Company Subsidiaries (other than any Company Subsidiary which is already
treated as (i) a partnership or (ii) an entity disregarded as separate from
its owner for tax purposes) shall be converted to an entity disregarded as
separate from its owner for tax purposes.

Section 5.10 Insurance. Prior to the Closing, the Shareholders
Representative shall purchase the RandW Insurance Policy. The Shareholders
Representative covenants and agrees (i) to maintain the RandW Insurance Policy
in full force and effect throughout the coverage period referred to therein,
(ii) not to, directly or indirectly, sell, dispose of or otherwise transfer
any of its rights to recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy, or otherwise
subject the RandW Insurance Policy (or any interest therein or any proceeds
therefrom) to any Lien, and (iii) to make all claims against the RandW Insurance
Policy and use best efforts to recover any proceeds thereunder for any Buyer
Losses pursuant to Section 8.02, to the extent that such Buyer Losses are not
satisfied by payment from the Escrow Account pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.
The Shareholders Representative further agrees to assign to Buyer its entire
interest in all of the proceeds from each such claim made against the RandW
Insurance Policy as provided herein.

TERMINATION

 

Section 7.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and the Shareholders Representative on
behalf of the Company Shareholders;

 

(b) by the Shareholders Representative on behalf of the Company Shareholders,
if Buyer breaches its representations or warranties or defaults in the
performance of its covenants or other obligations contained in this Agreement,
which breach or default, individually or in the aggregate, would prevent any
condition to the obligations of the Company Shareholders in Section 6.02(a)
or 6.02(b) from being satisfied, and such breach or default is not curable, or
if curable, is not cured within the Cure Period, as long as the Company
Shareholders are not in breach or default of their
representations, warranties or obligations under this Agreement, which breach
or default, individually or in the aggregate, would prevent any condition to
the obligations of Buyer in Section 6.01(a) or 6.01(b) from being satisfied;

 

(c) by the Special Committee on behalf of Buyer, if the Company Shareholders
(or any one of them) breach their representations or warranties or default in
the performance of their covenants or other obligations contained in this
Agreement, which breach or default, individually or in the aggregate, would
prevent any condition to the obligations of Buyer in Section 6.01(a) or
6.01(b) from being satisfied, and such breach or default is not curable, or if
curable, is not cured within the Cure Period, as long as Buyer is not in
breach or default of its representations, warranties or obligations under this
Agreement, which breach or default, individually or in the aggregate, would
prevent any condition to the obligations of the Company Shareholders in
Section 6.02(a) or 6.02(b) from being satisfied;

 

(d) by the Special Committee on behalf of Buyer, upon the occurrence of a
Company Material Adverse Effect;

 

(e) by either the Shareholders Representative on behalf of the Company
Shareholders or Buyer, if the Closing shall not have occurred by August 30,
2013 (the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.01(e) shall not be available to
a party if the failure of the Closing to have occurred was principally caused
by such partys failure to act in good faith or a breach of or failure to
perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other obligations
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; or 

(f) by either the Shareholders Representative on behalf of the Company
Shareholders or Buyer in the event that any Law permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall become final and non-appealable, so long as any
action or omission of the party proposing to terminate is not the cause of
the issuance, existence, or effectiveness of such Law.

 



55 The party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01
(other than pursuant to Section 7.01(a)) shall give prompt written notice of
such termination to the other party. Each party shall give the other party
prompt written notice upon learning of any breach or default by the other
party under this Agreement or any other event that would lead to a condition
to the Closing of the notifying party not being satisfied. The term " _Cure
Period_ " as used herein means a period commencing on the date Buyer, on the
one hand, or the Shareholders Representative, on the other hand, receives

Days prior to the Termination Date.

Damages incurred or suffered by a party, to the extent such Damages were the
result of, or otherwise arose from, the fraud or intentional and material
breach by another party of any provision of this Agreement. Nothing in this
Article VII shall diminish the parties rights to specifically enforce
the terms of this Agreement in connection with the exercise of their
respective rights under Section 9.11.

ARTICLE VIII 

INDEMNIFICATION

Section 8.01 Survival of Representations, Etc.

(a) The representations and warranties made in Articles III and IV of this
Agreement survive the Closing and shall expire eighteen (18) months after the
Closing Date, except (i) the representations and warranties made by the
Company Shareholders in Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.03, 3.04 and 3.18 (such
representations and warranties, the " _Company Shareholders Fundamental
Representations_ "), which shall survive indefinitely, (ii) the
representations and warranties made by Buyer in Sections 4.01 and 4.02 (the "
_Buyer Fundamental Representations_ "), which shall survive indefinitely,
(iii) the representations and warranties made by the Company Shareholders in
Section 3.15, which shall expire on the sixth anniversary of the Closing
Date, and (iv) the representations and warranties made by the Company
Shareholders in Section 3.12 and Section 3.13, which shall survive until sixty
(60) days after the expiration date of the applicable statute of limitations.
The foregoing shall not limit any partys right to recover damages resulting
from fraud of another party.

 



56 (b) All covenants and obligations of the parties set forth in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing indefinitely except for (i) such covenants and
obligations which are to be performed in their entirety prior to the Closing,
which shall survive the Closing until the first anniversary of the Closing and
(ii) any specific covenants or obligations of a party set forth in this
Agreement where a specific sunset period is provided, in which case such
covenants or obligations shall survive the Closing for a period of thirty (30)
days following the date on which the performance of such covenants or
obligations is required to be completed.

(c) The obligations to indemnify and hold harmless a party hereto in respect
of a breach of a representation or warranty or a covenant shall terminate on
the applicable survival termination date (as set forth in this Section 8.01),
and in respect to any other Buyer Losses shall terminate eighteen (18) months
after the Closing Date (the " _Claims Period_ "), unless a Buyer Indemnified
Party shall have made a proper claim for indemnification pursuant to Section
8.03 prior to such termination date. If a Buyer Indemnified Party has made a
proper claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.03 prior to such
termination date, than such claim, if then unresolved, shall not be
extinguished by the passage of the deadlines set forth in this Section 8.01. 

Section 8.02 Indemnification Obligations of the Company Shareholders.

 

(a) Subject to the other terms of this Article VIII, from and after the
Closing Date, the Company Shareholders will, jointly and severally (except as
to representations made in Sections 3.01 and 3.02, and for breaches of
covenants, for which liability shall be several (and not joint) in proportion
to each Company Shareholders Ownership Percentage), indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Buyer, its Affiliates, and its Subsidiaries, including the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and each of their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents and representatives and each of the heirs,
executors, successors and permitted assigns of any of the foregoing
(collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") from, against and in
respect of any and all Losses arising out of or resulting from:

 

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by the
Company Shareholders in Article III or in any of the other Transaction
Documents to which the Company Shareholders are a party, whether such breach
or inaccuracy exists or is made on the date of this Agreement or as of the
Closing Date; _provided_ , that for purposes of determining whether any
representations and warranties have been breached or are inaccurate, all
Company Material Adverse Effect qualifications and other materiality
qualifications contained in such representations and warranties shall be
disregarded;

 

(ii) any breach of any covenant, agreement or undertaking made by the Company
Shareholders in this Agreement or in any of the other Transaction Documents
to which the Company Shareholders are a party that in each case is to be
performed on or before the Closing Date;

(iii) any and all liability for Indemnified Taxes;

 



57 (iv) any claim arising under Section 2.04 for amounts owed by a
Company Shareholder as a result of the adjustments to the Purchase Price
described therein; and

(v) any liability arising from the presence of petroleum hydrocarbons or
other substances that spilled or leaked, prior to the Closing Date, at or from
underground storage tanks or associated equipment located at the Companys
terminal located on Cedar Grove Road in Conley, Georgia.

(b) " _Losses_ " means any and all claims and Damages whenever arising or
incurred (including amounts paid in settlement, costs of investigation and
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
term "Losses" shall exclude any consequential, punitive, special, indirect
or exemplary damages, except to the extent that such damages are payable to a
party other than Buyer, any of its Subsidiaries, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or any Company Shareholder (or any Affiliate of any such party)
(such items excluded from Losses, collectively, the " _Excluded Losses_ ").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any indemnity payment due and
payable by the Indemnifying Party under this Agreement shall be reduced,
whether retroactively or otherwise, by an amount equal to any and all (i) Tax
benefits and credits that may be currently and actually realized by the
Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Loss, and
(ii) insurance proceeds received by any Indemnified Party in respect of such
Loss, whether such proceeds are received before or after indemnity payments
are made, less (A) any reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the
Indemnified Party to recover such insurance proceeds, less (B) any increase
in insurance premiums resulting from such Losses for insurance related to such
Losses. The Indemnified Party shall make a good faith effort to recover such
Loss against applicable insurance policies; provided, however, that such good
faith effort shall not require the Indemnified Party to initiate any
proceeding against any insurer and in no event shall the existence of a claim
by an Indemnified Party for monies from such Indemnified Partys insurer (i)
delay any payment determined to be due and owing by an Indemnifying Party or
(ii) relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations
pursuant to this Article VIII unless such claim was paid by such Indemnified
Partys insurer. Rather, the Indemnifying Party shall make payment in full of
the amount determined to be due and owing by it against an assignment by the
Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party of the entire claim of the
Indemnified Party for the insurance proceeds from such Indemnified Partys
insurer. Each Indemnified Party shall reasonably consult and cooperate with
each Indemnifying Party with a view toward mitigating Losses in connection
with any claims for which a party seeks indemnification, and each Indemnified
Party shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate its Losses upon and after
becoming aware of an event which, in the Indemnified Partys good faith
judgment, is reasonably likely to give rise to such Losses.

(c) The Losses of the Buyer Indemnified Parties described in this Section 8.02
as to which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification are
hereinafter collectively referred to as the " _Buyer Losses_."

 



58 (d) The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not assert a claim against the Company
Shareholders for indemnification under Section 8.02(a)(i) for Buyer Losses
(i) unless and only to the extent that the aggregate amount of all Buyer
Losses exceeds two million Dollars ($2,000,000) (the " _Basket_ "), it being
understood that the Basket is to serve as a "deductible" for indemnification
(for example, if the indemnity claims for which the Company Shareholders
would, but for the provisions of this Section 8.02(d), be liable aggregate
three million Dollars ($3,000,000), the Company Shareholders would then be
liable for only one million Dollars ($1,000,000)) and (ii) for any individual
items or group of related items underlying such claim where the Buyer Losses
relating thereto is less than ten thousand Dollars ($10,000) and such items
that are unrelated to each other shall not be aggregated for purposes of
Section 8.02 nor counted against the Basket. The aggregate liability of the
Company Shareholders arising out of or relating to this Section 8.02 shall
not exceed (x) for all Company Shareholders other than the Principal
Shareholders, their respective Ownership Percentage of the Cash Escrow Amount,
and (y) for the Principal Shareholders, an amount equal to forty million
Dollars ($40,000,000) (the " _Cap_ "). Notwithstanding the preceding, none of
the limitations on the indemnification obligations set forth in this Section
8.02(d) shall apply: (x) in the case of the Principal Shareholders, to Buyer
Losses resulting from (A) fraud or intentional misconduct, (B) any breach or
inaccuracy of the Company Shareholders Fundamental Representations, or (C)
claims under Section 8.02(a)(ii), Section 8.02(a)(iii), Section 8.02(a)(iv)
and Section 8.02(a)(v); and (y) in the case of a Company Shareholder other
than the Principal Shareholders, to Buyer Losses resulting from (A) fraud or
intentional misconduct on the part of such Company Shareholder; (B) any
breach or inaccuracy by such Company Shareholder of the Company Shareholders
Fundamental Representations made under Sections 3.01, 3.02 and 3.18; and (C)
claims under Section 8.02(a)(iv) arising out of such Company Shareholders
failure to pay its proportionate share of the Negative Adjustment Amount
pursuant to Section 2.04(d).

Section 8.03 Indemnification Obligations of Buyer.

(a) Subject to the other terms of this Article VIII, from and after Closing
Date, Buyer will indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Company Shareholder
and its Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents and representatives and each of the heirs, executors,
successors and permitted assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, the "
_Company Shareholder Indemnified Parties_ ") from, against and in respect of
any and all Losses arising out of or resulting from: 

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by Buyer
in Article IV or in any Transaction Document to which Buyer is party, whether
such breach or inaccuracy exists or is made on the date of this Agreement or
as of the Closing Date; or

(ii) any breach of any covenant, agreement or undertaking made by Buyer in
this Agreement or in any Transaction Document to which Buyer is party that is
to be performed on or before the Closing Date. 

(b) The Losses of the Company Shareholder Indemnified Parties described in
this Section 8.03 as to which the Company Shareholder Indemnified Parties are
entitled to indemnification are hereinafter collectively referred to as "
_Company Shareholder Losses_."

 



59 Section 8.04 Indemnification Procedure.

 

(a) Promptly after receipt by a Buyer Indemnified Party or a Company
Shareholder Indemnified Party (hereinafter collectively referred to as an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") of notice by a third party (including any Governmental
Authority) of any actions or the commencement of any audit with respect to
which such Indemnified Party may be entitled to receive payment hereunder for
any Buyer Losses or any Company Shareholder Losses (as the case may be), such
Indemnified Party will notify Buyer or the Shareholders Representative, as
the case may be (in such capacity, Buyer or the Shareholders Representative
is hereinafter referred to as an " _Indemnifying Party_ "), of such action or
audit (for purposes of this Section 8.04, references to "action" shall include
any such audit); _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability under
this Agreement with respect to such action only if, and only to the extent
that, such failure to notify the Indemnifying Party results in the forfeiture
by the Indemnifying Party of rights and defenses otherwise available to the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such action. Unless (i) the Indemnifying
Party is also a party to such action and the Indemnified Partys counsel shall
have advised the Indemnified Party that a conflict of interest exists that
would make joint representation inappropriate or (ii) the Indemnifying Party
fails to provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Party of its
financial capacity to defend such action, the Indemnifying Party will have
the right, at its sole expense, upon written notice delivered to the
Indemnified Party within ten calendar days after receiving such notice of the
action, to assume the defense of such action with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party;
_provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall have acknowledged in writing to
the Indemnified Party its unqualified obligation to fully indemnify the
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article VIII. In the event, however, that
the Indemnifying Party (A) declines or fails to (1) assume the defense of the
action on the terms provided above, (2) provide reasonable assurance to
the Indemnified Party of its financial capacity to defend such action and
provide indemnification with respect to such action or (3) employ counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, in any case within such ten-
day period, or (B) the Indemnifying Party is also a party to such action and
the Indemnified Partys counsel shall have advised the Indemnified Party that
a conflict of interest exists that would make joint representation
inappropriate, then such Indemnified Party may employ counsel to represent or
defend it in any such action and the Indemnifying Party will pay the
reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel as incurred; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnifying Party will not be required to pay the fees
and disbursements of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction in any single action. For avoidance of doubt, the fees and
disbursements of counsel of any Buyer Indemnified Party in connection with a
Buyer Loss shall be satisfied first by receiving from the Escrow Agent an
amount from the Escrow Account equal to the amount of such fees, and then to
the extent that there are insufficient funds in the Escrow Account to pay
such fees and disbursements of counsel, such amounts shall be paid by the
Principal Shareholders. In any action with respect to which indemnification is
being sought hereunder, the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party,
whichever is not assuming the defense of such action, will have the right to
participate in such matter and to retain its own counsel at such Partys own
expense. The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be,
will at all times use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the
Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, reasonably
apprised of the status of the defense of any action the defense of which they
are maintaining and to cooperate in good faith with each other with respect
to the defense of any such action.

 



60 (b) No Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any claim or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought
hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, unless
(i) the Indemnifying Party fails to assume and maintain the defense of such
claim pursuant to Section 8.04(a) or (ii) such settlement, compromise or
consent includes an unconditional release of the Indemnifying Party from all
liability arising out of such claim. An Indemnifying Party may not, without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any
claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to which
indemnification is being sought hereunder unless (i) such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such claim, (ii) does not contain any
admission or statement suggesting any wrongdoing or liability on behalf of the
Indemnified Party and (iii) does not contain any equitable order, judgment or
term which in any manner affects, restrains or interferes with the business of
the Indemnified Party or any of the Indemnified Partys Affiliates.

(c) A claim for indemnification by an Indemnified Party for any matter not
involving an action by a third party may be asserted by written notice to the
Indemnifying Party from whom indemnification is sought. Such notice will
specify with reasonable specificity the basis for such claim. As promptly as
possible after the Indemnified Party has given such notice, such Indemnified
Party and the appropriate Indemnifying Party will establish the merits and
amount of such claim (by mutual agreement, litigation, arbitration or
otherwise) and, within ten (10) Business Days of the final determination of
the merits and amount of such claim, subject to Section 8.06, the Indemnifying
Party will pay to the Indemnified Party immediately available funds (or, if
the Indemnified Party is a Buyer Indemnified Party, in accordance with this
Article VIII) in an amount equal to such claim as determined hereunder.

 

Section 8.05 Limits of Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
elsewhere in this Agreement, no party shall, in any event, be liable to any
other Person for any Excluded Loss except to the extent that an Indemnified
Party becomes obligated to pay such damages to a third party that is not an
Affiliate of the Indemnified Party.

 

Section 8.06 Sole and Exclusive Remedy; Recourse Against Escrowed Funds.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, except in the case of fraud or intentional
misconduct, the remedies set forth in this Article VIII and the specific
performance remedy referenced in Section 9.11 shall provide the sole and
exclusive remedies arising out of, in connection with, relating to or arising
under this Agreement and the Transaction Documents and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, whether based on contract, tort, strict
liability, other laws or otherwise, including any breach or alleged breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made herein or any other
document contemplated herein or delivered pursuant hereto. In the event this
Agreement is terminated without the occurrence of the Closing, the sole and
exclusive remedies of the parties shall be as set forth in Section 7.02.
Except in the case of fraud or intentional misconduct, the parties
acknowledge and agree that the remedies available in this Section 8.06
supersede (and each party waives and releases) any other remedies available at
law or in equity including rights of rescission, rights of contribution and
claims arising under applicable statutes.

 



61 (b) Buyer shall cause the Working Capital Escrow Amount and the Cash Escrow
Amount to be deposited on the Closing Date in the accounts designated by the
Escrow Agent to be held in trust pursuant to the terms hereof and the terms of
the Escrow Agreement. The Principal Shareholders shall cause the Stock Escrow
and related stock powers to be deposited on the Closing Date in the account
designated by the Escrow Agent to be held in trust pursuant to the terms
hereof and the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(c) If a Buyer Indemnified Party asserts an indemnity claim under this Article
VIII during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the date
that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date (the " _Escrow Period_
"), the Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification by the
Indemnifying Party in accordance with this Article VIII by receiving from the
Escrow Agent payment from the Escrow Account in an amount equal to the amount
of such indemnity claim, until such time as the funds contained in the Escrow
Account are exhausted or released. From and after such time as the funds
contained in the Escrow Account are exhausted or released, all further
indemnity obligations of the Company Shareholders under Section 8.02 in
respect of Buyer Losses (other than, in the case of each Company Shareholder,
Buyer Losses resulting from (i) such Company Shareholders fraud
or intentional misconduct, (ii) a breach by such Company Shareholder of any
of the Company Shareholders Fundamental Representations in Sections 3.01, 3.02
and 3.18, and (iii) such Company Shareholders failure to pay its
proportionate share of the Negative Adjustment Amount pursuant to Section
2.04(d)) shall be solely the joint and several responsibility of the Principal
Shareholders.

(d) All claims asserted by a Buyer Indemnified Party during the Escrow Period
that are not resolved and satisfied (including the obligation to pay any such
indemnity claim) shall be deemed to be " _Pending Claims_." The dollar amount
of all Losses claimed in good faith in respect of Pending Claims arising under
Section 8.02(a) are hereinafter referred to as the " _Pending Claim Amount_."
On the first Business Day following the last day of the Escrow Period (the "
_Release Date_ "), Buyer and the Shareholders Representative shall jointly
execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent written instructions instructing the
Escrow Agent to release and deliver to the Shareholders Representative in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and in the manner set forth
in such instructions, the amount (if any) by which the aggregate amount of
funds (which shall include the amount of the Cash Escrow Amount and the value
of the Stock Escrow) remaining in the General Escrow Account on the Release
Date (the " _Remaining Escrow Funds_ ") exceeds the Pending Claim Amount, it
being understood that the cash portion of the released funds shall be
distributed by the Shareholders Representative to the Company Shareholders
pro-rata in accordance with their Ownership Percentage, subject to adjustment
for breach of several (but not joint) obligations. All funds or shares
remaining in the Escrow Account following such release (if any) to the
Shareholders Representative shall continue to be held by the Escrow Agent
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement until such claim or claims
have been fully resolved and the Escrow Agreement shall be deemed to be
extended accordingly.

(e) The fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent with respect to services in
connection with the Escrow Agreement shall be borne one-half by the Company
Shareholders and one-half by Buyer.

Section 9.03 Descriptive Headings; Interpretation. The descriptive headings
are for convenience of reference only and shall not control or affect the
meaning or construction of any provision of this Agreement. When a reference
is made in this Agreement to Sections, such reference shall be to a Section
of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. As used in this Agreement, the
terms "include," "includes" and "including" are deemed to be followed by
"without limitation" whether or not they are in fact followed by such words
or words of like import. Words (including defined terms) in the singular shall
be held to include the plural and vice versa, and words of one gender shall be
held to include the other gender as the context requires. The terms "hereof,"
"herein", "herewith" and "hereunder" and words of similar import shall, unless
otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole
(including the Shareholder Disclosure Schedules) and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement unless otherwise specified. The word "day" shall
mean calendar day unless specifically described as a Business Day. Where a
word or phrase is defined herein, each of its other grammatical forms shall
have a corresponding meaning. The word "if" means "if and only if." The word
"or" is not exclusive and means "and/or", unless the context in which such
phrase is used shall dictate otherwise. The word "extent" in the phrase "to
the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends,
and such phrase shall not mean simply "if" unless the context in which such
phrase is used shall dictate otherwise. Any matter disclosed in any
provision, subprovision, section or subsection of the Shareholders Disclosure
Schedules shall be deemed disclosed for all purposes of any other provision,
subprovision, section or subsection of the Shareholders Disclosure Schedules
to the extent such matter is disclosed in such a way as to make its relevance
to the information called for by such other provision, subprovision, section
or subsection reasonably apparent; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such
disclosure shall not be deemed to be an admission or representation as to the
materiality of the item so disclosed.

 



64 Section 9.04 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement (which
provisions are incorporated into this Section 9.04), whether or not the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, all expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses.

Section 9.05 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, and each such counterpart shall be deemed to be an original
instrument, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one
agreement. This Agreement shall become effective when one or more counterparts
have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties,
it being understood that the parties need not sign the same counterpart.
Facsimile or portable document format (PDF) signatures shall be treated as
original signatures for all purposes hereunder. 

Section 9.06 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Transaction Documents
contain the entire agreement between Buyer and the Company Shareholders with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, and supersede all prior
arrangements or understandings with respect to the subject matter hereof. This
Agreement is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

Section 9.07 GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND ANY MATTER ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY, WHETHER FRAMED IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW.

 

Section 9.08 Submission to Jurisdiction; Venue. Each of the parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (or in the event (but
only in the event) that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction
over such action or proceeding, in the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware) in any action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the matters contemplated hereby. Each of the parties
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally
and effectively do so, any objection it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any action arising out of or relating to this Agreement in
any such court. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of such action in any such court. Each of the parties agrees
not to bring any action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of
the matters contemplated hereby other than in any such court.

Section 9.09 Jury Trial Waiver. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE SUCH WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY, AND ( _IV_ ) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS CONTAINED IN THIS
SECTION 9.09.

 



65 Section 9.10 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the transactions be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 9.11 Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each party
hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable
remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement by such party, and to specifically enforce the
terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
such party under this Agreement. Any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

Section 9.12 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
(whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other parties hereto, and any attempt to make any such assignment
without such consent shall be null and void; provided, however, that Buyer may
assign its right to acquire all of the Outstanding Shares of the Company to
any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

Section 9.13 No Other Representations or Warranties. The representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents constitute all the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements of the parties hereto, and the Company Shareholders,
on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, each acknowledge and agree that
they are not relying upon, and the other party shall not be liable for, any
express or implied, oral or written, information, promise, representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement, statement, or opinion of any nature whatsoever,
whether by or on behalf of the parties hereto or otherwise, and whether
framed in contract, tort or otherwise, pertaining to the transactions
contemplated herein, except as is expressly set forth in this Agreement.

 



66 Section 9.14 Shareholders Representative.

 

(a) The Company Shareholders hereby irrevocably constitute and appoint Mr.
Jerry Moyes (the " _Shareholders  Representative_") as the true and lawful
agent and attorney-in-fact of the Company Shareholders, with full powers of
substitution to act individually in the name, place and stead of the Company
Shareholders with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents, as the same may be from time to time
amended, and to individually do or refrain from doing all such further acts
and things, and to execute all such documents, as he shall deem necessary or
appropriate in connection with any of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Shareholders
Representative shall have the full and exclusive authority to (i) agree with
Buyer with respect to any matter or thing required or deemed necessary by the
Shareholders Representative in connection with the provisions of this
Agreement calling for the agreement of the Company Shareholders, give and
receive notices on behalf of the Company Shareholders, and act on behalf of
the Company Shareholders in connection with any matter as to which the Company
Shareholders or Principal Shareholders are or may be obligated under this
Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents, all in the absolute
discretion of the Shareholders Representative, (ii) execute the Escrow
Agreement on behalf of the Company Shareholders, (iii) in general, do all
things and perform all acts, including executing and delivering all
agreements, certificates, receipts, consents, elections, instructions, and
other instruments or documents contemplated by, or deemed by the Shareholders
Representative to be necessary or advisable in connection with,
this Agreement or any Transaction Document, including any amendments hereto
or thereto and (iv) take all actions necessary or desirable in connection with
the defense or settlement of any indemnification claims pursuant to Article
VIII (including the selection of counsel) and performance of obligations of
the Company Shareholders or the Shareholders Representative, including to
withhold funds for satisfaction of expenses or other liabilities or
obligations or to withhold funds for potential indemnification claims made
hereunder. All decisions by the Shareholders Representative shall be binding
upon all the Company Shareholders, and no Company Shareholder shall have the
right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. The
Shareholders Representative may communicate with any Company Shareholder or
any other Person concerning his responsibilities hereunder, but is not
required to do so. The Shareholders Representative has a duty to serve in
good faith the interests of the Company Shareholders as appropriate, and to
perform his designated role under this Agreement, but, except as specifically
provided herein, the Shareholders Representative shall have no
financial liability whatsoever to any other Company Shareholder relating to
his service hereunder (including any action taken or omitted to be taken),
except that he shall be liable for harm which he directly causes by an act of
willful misconduct. Buyer shall be entitled to rely exclusively upon any
communication given by the Shareholders Representative and shall not be
liable in any manner whatsoever for any action taken or not taken in reliance
upon the Shareholders Representative. Any payments made, at the
Shareholders Representatives request and instruction, by Buyer to the
Shareholders Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall
fully discharge Buyer from any liability to the Company Shareholders in
connection with such payment, as fully and completely as if such payment had
been made directly to the Company Shareholders. Buyer hereby agrees to accept
and rely on the actions of the Shareholders Representative as if it were the
action of a Company Shareholder or the Company Shareholders.

 



67 (b) The Shareholders Representative will not be entitled to receive any
compensation from Buyer or the Company Shareholders in connection with
performing his functions as the Shareholders Representative under this
Agreement. Any out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the
Shareholders Representative in connection with actions taken pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement will be paid by the Company Shareholders as agreed to
by them.

Section 9.15 Approval of Special Committee. Any decisions by Buyer pursuant to
or in respect of this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
decision to waive compliance with any provision of this Agreement, extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Buyer, or
amend or voluntarily terminate this Agreement) shall be approved in advance by
the Special Committee.

 

Section 9.16 No Presumption Against Drafting Party. Each party acknowledges
that each party has been represented by counsel in connection with this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, and the transactions
contemplated herein and therein. Accordingly, any rule of applicable Law or
any legal decision that would require interpretation of any claimed
ambiguities in this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents against the
drafting party has no application and is expressly waived.

 



68 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties has caused this Agreement to be
executed as of the date first written above by their respective officers
thereunto duly authorized.
