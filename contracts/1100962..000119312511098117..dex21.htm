representing such Shares in accordance with _Article II_. At the Effective
Time all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be

ARTICLE II

DISSENTING SHARES; PAYMENT FOR SHARES; OPTIONS

Section 2.01 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and that are held by stockholders properly demanding
appraisal rights available under Section 262 of the Corporation Law (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, but shall be

 



3  converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined
to be due to the holders of such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of
the Corporation Law, unless and until such holders shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal
under the Corporation Law. Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance
with Section 262 of the Corporation Law. If any such holder shall have failed
to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right to
appraisal, such holders Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have converted
into, as of the Effective Time, and become exchangeable only for the right to
receive, as of the later of the Effective Time and the time that such right to
appraisal shall have been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent
and Merger Sub (a) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any
Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant
to the Corporation Law and received by the Company relating to rights provided
in Section 262 of the Corporation Law and (b) the opportunity to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
under the Corporation Law. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make or agree to make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisals of capital stock of the Company, offer
to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such
demands.

 

Section 2.02 _Payment for Shares_.

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to deposit, or cause to be deposited, with a bank or
trust company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") sufficient funds to make the payments due pursuant to
_Section 1.06_ on a timely basis to holders of Shares that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such amounts being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, make the payments provided for in the
preceding sentence out of the Payment Fund. Such funds may be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation; provided,
that (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger
Consideration payable to the holders of Shares, and following any losses
or events that result in the Payment Fund becoming not immediately available
or that result in the amount of funds in the Payment Fund being insufficient
to promptly pay the portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration that remains
unpaid, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent
for the benefit of the holders of Shares to the extent of such insufficiency
and (ii) such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the
United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A1 or P1 or
better by Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose, except
as provided in this Agreement.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within five (5)
Business Days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who, as of the Effective Time, was the
record holder of Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to receive
Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section 1.06_: (A) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the certificates that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented Shares (the 

 



4  " _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (B) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
non-certificated Shares formerly represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry
Shares_ ") in exchange for the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number
of Shares evidenced by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable.
Following surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of
transmittal duly executed, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares shall be paid in exchange therefor cash in an amount (subject to any
applicable withholding Tax) equal to the product of the number of Shares
represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares multiplied by the Merger Consideration, and such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will
be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of the Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares. If payment is to be made to a Person (as defined below)
other than the Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered is registered,
it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall
be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer. From and after
the Effective Time and until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of
this _Section 2.02_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall represent
for all purposes solely the right to receive, in accordance with the terms
hereof, the Merger Consideration in cash multiplied by the number of Shares
evidenced by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, without any interest
thereon.

 

(c) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such customary and reasonable amount
as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly
represented thereby. 

(d) Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any investments
thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company for
one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation. Any former stockholders of the Company who have not complied with
this _Section 2.02_ prior to the end of such one-year period shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) but only as general creditors thereof
for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to any holder of Shares for any amounts (whether in respect of such
Shares or otherwise) delivered from the Payment Fund or otherwise to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws.

Section 2.03 _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer
of Shares shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
transfer, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration
as provided in this Article II.

 



5 Section 2.04 _Company Options and Restricted Share Awards_.

 

(a) Each option to purchase Shares (a " _Company Option_ ") granted under any
stock option plan of the Company, including the American Medical Systems
Holdings, Inc. 2000 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, and the American
Medical Systems Holdings, Inc. 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and
restated, or any other plan, agreement or arrangement (together, the "
_Company Stock Plans_ ") other than the American Medical Systems Holdings,
Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (the " _ESPP_ ") which is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which is vested and
exercisable (or per the terms of the applicable award agreement, employment
agreement or other agreement providing for vesting and exercisability
conditions, would become vested and exercisable as of the Effective Time)
(each, a " _Vested Stock Option_ ") shall be canceled as of the Effective
Time and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash
payable at the time of cancellation of such Company Option equal to the
product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration minus (B)
the per share exercise price of such Company Option, multiplied by (ii) the
number of Shares subject to such Company Option (less any income tax or
employment tax withholding required under the Code in accordance with
_Section 1.08_).

(b) Each Company Option which is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time that is not a Vested Stock Option (each, an " _Unvested
Stock Option_ ") shall be adjusted as necessary to provide that, as of the
Effective Time, each Unvested Stock Option shall be converted into an option
(each, an " _Adjusted Option_ ") to acquire, on the same terms and conditions
as were applicable under such Unvested Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the number of shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01, of
Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") (rounded down to the nearest whole
share) equal to (i) the number of Shares subject to such Unvested Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Equity Exchange
Ratio. The exercise price per share of any such Adjusted Option will be an
amount (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price
per share of the Unvested Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
divided by (B) the Equity Exchange Ratio.

(c) Each outstanding Share subject to vesting conditions or other restrictions
as of the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Restricted Share Awards_ ")
granted under any Company Stock Plan which is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and which would become vested prior to the one year
anniversary of the Effective Time (determined as of the Effective Time) per
the terms of the applicable award agreement, employment agreement or other
agreement providing for vesting conditions (each, a " _Vested Share Award_ "),
shall be canceled as of the Effective Time and the holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive an amount in cash payable at the time of cancellation of
such Vested Share Award equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration
_multiplied_ by (ii) the number of Shares subject to the Vested Share Award
(less any income tax or employment tax withholding required under the Code in
accordance with _Section 1.08_).

 



6 (d) Each Restricted Share Award that is not a Vested Share Award outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, an " _Unvested Share Award_ ")
shall be adjusted as necessary to provide that, as of the Effective Time, each
Unvested Share Award shall be converted into a restricted share award (each,
an " _Adjusted Share Award_ "), as applicable, payable in Parent Common
Stock, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Unvested
Share Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Adjusted Share Award shall equal
(i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Unvested Share
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Equity
Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share).

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all corporate
actions necessary to effectuate the treatment of Company Options and
Restricted Share Awards contemplated by this _Section 2.04_, (including,
without limitation, the adoption of any required plan amendments, obtaining
any required approval of the Board of Directors of the Company or a committee
thereof, and/or obtaining any required employee consents) and to ensure that
neither any holder of Company Options and Restricted Share Awards, nor any
other participant in any Company Stock Plan shall, from and after the
Effective Time, have any right thereunder to acquire any securities of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, or Parent, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or to receive any payment or benefit with respect to any award
previously granted under the Company Stock Plans, except as provided in this
_Section 2.04_. All amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 2.04_ shall be
paid without interest.

 

Section 2.05 _Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Unless this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with  _Section 7.01_, after the date hereof, no
future offering periods shall be commenced under the ESPP. The current
offering period in effect on the date hereof under the ESPP will continue in
accordance with its terms, and options under the current offering period will
be exercisable at the normally scheduled time in accordance with the terms of
the ESPP; provided, however, that in all events the expiration of such
offering period and the final exercise under the ESPP shall occur no later
than the last Business Day prior to the Effective Time, and the Company shall
take all actions necessary to amend the ESPP to so provide. The Company shall
terminate the ESPP effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except (i) as disclosed in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended January 1, 2011 or in any Company SEC Report filed
subsequent to such Form 10-K but prior to the date of this Agreement, but
excluding any disclosures set forth in any risk factor section and any general
statements which, in each case, are cautionary, predictive or forward-looking
in nature, or (ii) as set forth in the section of the disclosure letter dated
the date hereof and delivered by the Company to Parent with respect to this
Agreement prior to the date hereof (the " _Disclosure Letter_ ") that
specifically corresponds to such Section (or in any other section of the
Disclosure Letter if the applicability

 



7  of such disclosure to such Section is reasonably apparent on its face), the
Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that the following
are true and correct:

 

Section 3.01 _Organization and Qualification_. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is a duly organized and validly existing entity in good standing
(to the extent such concepts are recognized in the applicable jurisdiction)
under the Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, with all corporate power
and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as currently
conducted, except for such failures to be so qualified, in good standing or
have such power that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each of
its Subsidiaries is duly qualified and in good standing as a foreign
corporation authorized to do business in each of the jurisdictions in which
the character of the properties owned or held under lease by it or the nature
of the business transacted by it makes such qualification necessary, except
for such failures to be so qualified and in good standing that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore made available to Parent true,
correct and complete copies of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws (or
similar governing documents) as in effect on the date hereof for the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, owns any interest in any Person
other than the Companys Subsidiaries.

Section 3.02 _Capitalization_.

of Shares subject thereto, the holders thereof and the vesting schedules
thereof. Each outstanding Company Option and Restricted Share Award shall be

under the ESPP, there are on the date hereof no outstanding (A) securities of
the Company convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock or
voting securities or ownership interests in the Company, (B) options,

Section 3.05 _Reports; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Since January 1, 2008, the Company has timely filed or furnished all
reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to be
filed or furnished by it with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
_SEC_ "), all of which have complied as of their respective filing dates or,
if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing, as of the date of the last
such amendment or superseding filing made at least two (2) Business Days prior

of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ") and, in each case, the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder. No executive officer of the
Company has failed in any respect to make the certifications required of him
or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to any

or schedules included or incorporated by reference therein, at the time filed
or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing, as of the date of the
last such amendment or superseding filing made at least two (2) Business Days
prior to the date hereof,

 



11  contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or
unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC staff with
respect to the Company SEC Reports. None of the Companys Subsidiaries is
required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act.

(b) The audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements (including
the related notes thereto) of the Company included (or incorporated by
reference) in the Company SEC Reports have been prepared in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except
as may be indicated in the notes thereto) applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods involved and fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
their respective dates, and the consolidated income, stockholders equity,
results of operations and changes in consolidated financial position or cash
flows for the periods presented therein (subject, in the case of
the unaudited financial statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments).

(c) The Company and its Subsidiaries have implemented and maintain a system
of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Companys management
has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal
controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended January 1, 2011 and
the description of such assessment set forth in the Companys Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2011 is accurate in all

Section is reasonably apparent on its face), Parent and Merger Sub represent
and warrant to the Company as follows:

Section 4.01 _Organization and Qualification_. Except as would not,

of any Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective assets may be bound, or (d) violate any order, writ,
injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) or by which any of their respective
assets are bound, except that in each of _clauses (b)_ , _(c)_ or _(d)_
where any failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or
permits, any failure to make such filings or any such violations, conflicts,
breaches or defaults would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise affect
Parents or Merger Subs ability to satisfy its obligations hereunder.

 

Section 4.05 _Litigation_. There is no Litigation pending or, to the Knowledge
of Parent, threatened against or relating to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise affect
Parents or Merger Subs ability to satisfy its obligations hereunder.
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding
order, writ, injunction or decree, except as would not, individually or in the

affect Parents or Merger Subs ability to satisfy its obligations hereunder.

 

Section 4.06 _Interested Stockholder_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any
of their respective "affiliates" or "associates" is, or has been at any time

Section 203 of the Corporation Law.

Section 4.07 _Sufficient Funds_.

 

(a) The aggregate proceeds from the Financing, together with Parents current
cash on hand, will provide Parent with sufficient funds at the Effective Time
to consummate the Merger and to pay all costs, fees and expenses incurred by
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any refinancing
or repayment of indebtedness of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company required in
connection therewith).

(b) Parent has delivered to the Company true, complete and correct copies of
executed commitment letters, dated as of the date hereof, from Morgan Stanley
Senior Funding, Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated and
Bank of America, N.A. (the " _Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to which
the Debt Financing Sources parties thereto have agreed, subject only to the
conditions precedent set forth in the fourteenth paragraph of the Financing
Commitment letter; the Certain Funds Provision (as defined in the Financing
Commitments) therein and, solely with respect to the senior secured facilities
described in the Financing Commitments, the other conditions set forth in Part
IV of the Senior Term Sheet (as defined in the Financing Commitments) under
the heading "Initial Conditions" and the conditions set forth in clause (a) of
Part IV of the Senior Term Sheet under the heading "Ongoing Conditions"; and,
solely with respect to the bridge facility described in the Financing
Commitments, the other conditions set forth in Section 4 of the Bridge Term
Sheet (as defined in the Financing Commitments) under the heading "Initial
Conditions" (collectively, the " _Financing Conditions_ "), to provide the
debt financing set forth therein for the purposes of financing the
transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Financing_ "). The Financing
Commitments are in full force and effect as of the date of this Agreement and
are legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto. As of the date of this
Agreement, none of the Financing Commitments has been amended, supplemented
or modified in any respect, the respective commitments contained in the
Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn, terminated, repudiated or
rescinded in any respect. None of the Financing Commitments will be amended,
supplemented, modified or waived in any respect at any time thereafter except
as expressly permitted by _Section 5.13(b)_. As of the date of this
Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger
Sub under any term, or a failure of any condition, of any Financing Commitment
and neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe that (i) it or any
other party thereto will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term of,
or condition set forth in, the Financing Commitments on or prior to the
Closing or (ii) the Financing will not be made available to Parent and Merger
Sub on the Closing. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies
related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing other than the
Financing Conditions, and the only conditions precedent or other contingencies
relating to the funding of the Financing on the Closing that will be included
in the definitive documentation with respect to the Financing shall be the
Financing Conditions. There are no side letters or other agreements, Contracts
or arrangements related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing
or the financing of any of the transactions

 



35  contemplated by this Agreement other than as expressly set forth in the
Financing Commitments, the fee letters, dated as of the date hereof, from
Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith
Incorporated and Bank of America, N.A. relating to the Financing Commitments,
a true, complete and correct copy of which Parent has delivered to the Company
in a redacted form removing only the fees payable on the Closing to the Debt
Financing Sources party thereto, and the engagement letter, dated as of the
date hereof, from Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated and
Morgan Stanley and Co. Incorporated relating to the Financing, a true, complete
and correct copy of which Parent has delivered to the Company in a redacted
form removing only the fees payable on the Closing. Parent has fully paid (or
caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees and other amounts that are due
and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with the
Financing, and Parent represents that any other fees that are due under the
Financing Commitments are required to be paid no earlier than the Closing. 

Section 4.08 _Brokers_. The Company will not be responsible for any brokerage,
finders, financial advisors or other fee or commission payable to any
broker, finder or investment banker in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by and on behalf
of Parent and Merger Sub.

 

Section 4.09 _Solvency_. As of the Effective Time, assuming (a) satisfaction
of the conditions to the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate
the Merger as set forth herein, or the waiver of such conditions, and (b) the
accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
_Article III_ hereof, immediately after giving effect to all of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation,
the Financing and the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration and the
consideration in respect of the Company Options, Company Stock Awards and
awards issued pursuant to the ESPP pursuant to _Section 2.04_ and any other
repayment or refinancing of debt that may be contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letters or otherwise, and payment of all related fees and expenses,
the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent. For purposes of this _Section
4.09_, the term " _Solvent_ " with respect to the Surviving Corporation means
that, as of any date of determination, (x) the amount of the fair saleable
value of the assets of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, exceeds, as of such date, the sum of (i) the value of all
liabilities of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, including contingent and other liabilities, as of such date, as such
quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with the applicable
federal Laws governing determinations of the solvency of debtors, and (ii) the
amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole on its existing debts
(including contingent liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured;
(y) the Surviving Corporation will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably
small amount of capital for the operation of the business in which it is
engaged or proposed to be engaged by Parent following such date; and (z) the
Surviving Corporation will be able to pay its liabilities, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature.

Section 4.10 _Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties_. Parent
and Merger Sub each acknowledges and agrees that, except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in Article III of this
Agreement, (a) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries makes, or has
made, any representations or warranties relating to itself or its

 



36 business or otherwise in connection with the Merger, (b) Parent and Merger Sub
are not relying on any other representations or warranties, and (c) any
estimates, projections, predictions, data, financial information, memoranda,
presentations or any other materials or information provided or addressed to
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their representatives are not and shall not be
deemed to be or include representations or warranties unless any such
materials or information is the subject of any express representation or
warranty set forth in Article III of this Agreement.

Section 5.02 _No Solicitation_.

(a) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall
direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, knowingly
encourage, enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below), or
provide any information to, or afford any access to the properties, books or
records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, or otherwise take any
action (including by approving any transaction, or approving any Person
becoming an "interested stockholder," for purposes of Section 203 of the
Corporation Law) to assist or knowingly facilitate, or that would reasonably
be expected to assist or facilitate, any Person or group in respect of, any
Acquisition Proposal, or propose, agree or publicly announce an intention to
take any of the foregoing actions or any other action which would reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing
and subject to the prior execution by such Person or group of a
confidentiality agreement with terms at least as restrictive in all material
respects on such Person or group as the Confidentiality Agreement is on Parent
(including the "standstill" provisions thereof), which confidentiality
agreement shall not prohibit the Company from complying with the terms of
this _Section 5.02_, the Company may, at any time prior to the adoption of
this Agreement by the requisite vote of the holders of Shares, furnish
information (so long as all such information has previously been made
available to Parent or Merger Sub or is made available to Parent or Merger Sub
prior to or concurrently with the time such information is made available to
such Person or group) to or enter into discussions or negotiations with any
Person or group that has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal after the date hereof and not resulting from a breach of this
_Section 5.02_ if, and only if, a majority of the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, that (i) such
unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to result in, a Superior Proposal, and (ii) it is necessary for the
Board of Directors of the Company to furnish such information or enter into
such discussions or negotiations in order to comply with its fiduciary duties
to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this _Section 5.02_ by any

 



40  Representative or Affiliate of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.02_ by the Company.

 

(b) The Company will promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours
after the Company has Knowledge thereof) (i) notify Parent in writing if any
such information referred to in _Section 5.02(a)_ is requested or any such
negotiations or discussions referred to in _Section 5.02(a)_ are sought to be
initiated, and (ii) communicate the material terms of, and the identity of
the Person making, such request, inquiry or Acquisition Proposal. The Company
will keep Parent promptly informed of the status and material details of any
such request, inquiry or Acquisition Proposal (including any modifications to
the financial or other material terms of any request, inquiry or Acquisition
Proposal) and will provide to Parent promptly after receipt or delivery
thereof copies of all correspondence and other written material sent or
provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives from any Person that describes any of the terms or conditions
of any inquiry, request or Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company shall promptly notify Parent if the
Company determines to begin providing information to any third party related
to an Acquisition Proposal or determines to begin discussions with a third
party related to an Acquisition Proposal. In addition, during the period from
the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, the Company shall not
terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality,
"standstill" or similar agreement entered into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the date of this Agreement. Without derogating from the
preceding sentence, if a majority of the Companys Board of Directors
determines that it is necessary, in order to comply with the fiduciary duties
owed by the Company Board of Directors to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law, to permit a third party to commence a tender or exchange
offer, then the Company may waive any "standstill" provision applicable to
such third party contained in a confidentiality agreement entered into in
accordance with _Section 5.02(a)_ after the date of this Agreement to permit
the commencement of such tender or exchange offer if and only if such tender
or exchange offer (i) is for all of the outstanding voting securities of the
Company and (ii) in connection therewith the Board of Directors of the Company
or any committee thereof shall have made a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change. Subject to the preceding sentence, during the period from the date of
this Agreement through the Effective Time, the Company shall enforce, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the provisions of any and
all confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreements to which it is a
party, including by obtaining injunctions to prevent any breaches of such
agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof in any
court of the United States of America or of any state having jurisdiction.

(c) The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective officers, directors, employees to, immediately cease, and the
Company will use reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives and
Affiliates to cease, any existing activities, discussions, or negotiations
with any Persons other than Parent and Merger Sub conducted prior to the date
hereof with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal and shall request the prompt return or destruction of any
nonpublic information provided to any such Person in connection with any such
activities, discussions or negotiations.

 



41 (d) Except as permitted by _Section 5.02(e)_, neither the Company, nor the
Board of Directors of the Company, nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or
qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval of this
Agreement, the agreement of merger contained herein or the Merger or its
recommendation that the Companys stockholders adopt this Agreement, (ii)
approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal, (any action described in the foregoing clauses (i) and
(ii), a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (iii) adopt, approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or propose to adopt, approve, recommend or
declare advisable, or allow the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to
execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to or is reasonably
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in _Section 5.02(a)_ pursuant to and in accordance
with the limitations set forth therein).

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company, or
any committee thereof, may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (i)
if a development or a change in circumstances occurs or arises after the date
of this Agreement that was not known by the Company Board as of the date of
this Agreement and a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure to take such action would reasonably be likely to constitute a breach
of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable
Law, or (ii) if (A) the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a violation of this _Section 5.02_, (B) a
majority of the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith,
after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel, that such bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and that it intends to accept or
recommend such Acquisition Proposal as a Superior Proposal, (C) a majority of
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action
would reasonably be likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to
the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, (D) the Company provides
Parent prior written notice of its intent to make any such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change at least five (5) days prior to taking such action,
including all of the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, (a "
_Notice of Superior Proposal_ "), (E) during such five (5) day period, the
Company negotiates in good faith with Parent (to the extent that Parent
wishes to negotiate) to enable Parent to make an offer that is at least as
favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such Acquisition Proposal, (F)
Parent does not, within such five (5) day period, make an offer that a
majority of the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, to be an offer such that the Acquisition Proposal no longer
constitutes a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , that, in the event of any
amendment to the financial (including form of consideration) or other material
terms of such Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall deliver to Parent a new
written Notice of Superior Proposal and shall comply with the requirements of
this _Section 5.02(e)_ with respect to such new Notice of Superior Proposal,
and (G) the Companys Board of Directors, after taking into account any
modifications to the terms of this Agreement

 



42  and the Merger agreed to by Parent and Merger Sub after receipt of such
notice, continues to believe that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.02_ shall prohibit the Company or
its Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the Companys
stockholders a position with respect to a tender offer by a third party
pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act if, in
the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) failure to do so would
reasonably be likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to
stockholders under applicable Law, or otherwise violate its obligations under
applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such action or disclosure
may have any of the effects set forth in _Section 5.02(d)_ or _Section
5.02(e)_ unless the Company shall have first complied with its obligations in
_Section 5.02(e)_. 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Board of Directors
of the Company from complying with its disclosure obligations under
applicable Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_
, that no such action or disclosure may have any of the effects set forth in
_Section 5.02(d)_ or  _Section 5.02(e)_ unless the Company shall have first
complied with its obligations in _Section 5.02(e)_.

 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement: " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any
inquiry, proposal or offer (whether in writing or otherwise) from any Person
(other than Parent or Merger Sub) relating to, or that is reasonably expected
to lead to, any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction
or a series of transactions, of any assets or businesses that constitute 15%
or more of the revenues, net income, EBITDA (earnings before interest expense,
taxes, depreciation and amortization) or assets of the Company and the
Companys Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 15% or more of any class of
equity securities of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, any tender
offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person
beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, or any merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint
venture, binding share exchange or similar transaction involving the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company pursuant to which any Person or the
stockholders of any Person would own 10% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or of any resulting
parent company of the Company, other than the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and " _Superior Proposal_ "
means a bona fide proposal or offer constituting a Acquisition Proposal that,
if consummated, would result in the Person making such proposal or offer
acquiring, directly or indirectly, a majority of the Companys outstanding
equity securities (or a majority of the outstanding equity securities of the
surviving entity in a merger of the Company or the direct or indirect parent
of the surviving entity in such a merger), or all or substantially all of the
assets of the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which
the Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) to be (A) more favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a
financial point of view than the Merger, taking into account all relevant
factors (including all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this
Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent in response to such offer or

 



43  otherwise)) and (B) reasonably capable of being completed, taking into
account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.

 

Section 5.03 _Access to Information_.

(a) Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and applicable Law, the Company
shall (i) give Parent and Merger Sub and their Representatives reasonable
access (during regular business hours upon reasonable notice) to such
employees, plants, offices, warehouses and other facilities at reasonable
times and to such books, contracts, commitments and records (including Tax
Returns) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request
and instruct the Companys and its Subsidiaries independent public
accountants to provide access to their work papers and such other information
as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request, (ii) permit Parent and
Merger Sub to make such inspections as they may reasonably require, (iii)
cause its officers and those of its Subsidiaries to furnish Parent and Merger
Sub with such financial and operating data and other information with respect
to the business, properties, litigation matters, personnel and environmental
compliance of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent or Merger Sub may
from time to time reasonably request (including any final revenue summary and
final summary monthly financial reporting package that is provided to the
Companys senior executive managers and a monthly discussion of such materials
with the Companys senior executive managers), and (iv) furnish promptly to
Parent and Merger Sub a copy of each report, schedule and other document
filed or received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries during such period
pursuant to the requirements of the federal or state securities Laws. The
Company shall: (i) keep Parent promptly informed of (A) any material
communication (written or oral) with or from the FDA and any other Regulatory
Authority and (B) any material communications (written or oral) received from
any Person challenging the validity or ownership the Intellectual Property of
the Company and (ii) not make any written submissions relating to product
approvals or any other material submissions to the FDA or any other Regulatory
Authority without prior disclosure to Parent of the details of
such submissions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be
obligated to provide such access, inspections, data or other information to
the extent that to do so (x) may cause a waiver of an attorney-client
privilege, loss of attorney work product protection or loss or waiver of any
other legal privilege, or (y) would violate a confidentiality or other
contractual obligation to any Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any required consents
to provide such access, inspections, data or other information and take such
other action (such as the redaction of identifying or confidential
information, entry into a joint defense agreement or other agreement or by
providing such access, inspections, data or other information solely to
outside counsel to avoid the loss of attorney client privilege) as is
necessary to provide such access, inspections, data or other information to
Parent and Merger Sub in compliance with applicable Law. In addition, the
Company and its officers and employees shall reasonably cooperate with Parent
in Parents efforts to comply with the rules and regulations affecting public
companies, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. No review pursuant to this
_Section 5.03(a)_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty contained herein, the covenants or agreements of the parties hereto
or the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto under this
Agreement.

(b) Information obtained by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to  _Section
5.03(a)_ shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



44 Section 5.04 _Stockholder Approval_. The Company shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, establish a
record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders (the " _Special Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause such meeting to occur as soon as reasonably practicable. Except as
specifically permitted by paragraphs _(d)_ and _(e)_ of _Section 5.02_, the
Board of Directors of the Company shall continue to recommend that the
Companys stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from its stockholders
the Company Stockholder Approval, including the solicitation of proxies in
compliance with applicable Law, the applicable rules of the Nasdaq Global
Select Market and the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. Unless
this Agreement shall have been earlier terminated in accordance with _Section
7.01_ (including, for the avoidance of doubt, _Section 7.01(g)_), the Company
shall submit this Agreement to its stockholders for adoption without regard to
(i) the making, commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of any
Superior Proposal or other Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change. The Company may adjourn, postpone or cancel (or propose
to adjourn, postpone or cancel) the Special Meeting (i) to the extent
necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement is provided to its stockholders in advance of a vote on this
Agreement or (ii) if, as of the time for which the Special Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement), there are
insufficient Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of such Special Meeting or there are
insufficient votes to approve the adoption of this Agreement, but in the case
of this clause (ii), only to the extent necessary to obtain the requisite
approval of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders.

 

Section 5.05 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including _Section
5.05(d)_, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to be consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable on the
terms and subject to the conditions hereof. Without limiting the foregoing,
(i) each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best
efforts: (A) to file promptly, and in no event later than ten (10) Business
Days after the date of this Agreement, a Notification and Report Form under
the HSR Act, (B) to promptly make any required submissions under Foreign
Antitrust Laws that are set forth on Section 6.01(c) of the Disclosure Letter,
(C) to furnish information required in connection with such submissions under
the HSR Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law, (D) to keep the other parties
reasonably informed with respect to the status of any such filings or
submissions under the HSR Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law, including with
respect to: (1) the receipt of any non-action, action, clearance,
consent, approval or waiver, (2) the expiration or termination of any waiting
period, (3) the commencement or proposed or threatened commencement of any
Litigation or other proceeding under the HSR Act, FTC Act, Clayton Act,
Sherman Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law and (4) the nature and status of any
objections raised or proposed or threatened to be raised under the HSR Act,
FTC Act, Clayton Act, Sherman Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law with respect to
this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby and
(E) to obtain all necessary waiting period expirations or terminations,
actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, clearances and approvals from any
Governmental Entity; and (ii) Parent, Merger Sub

 



45  and the Company shall cooperate with one another: (A) in promptly
determining whether any filings are required to be made or consents,
approvals, permits or authorizations are required to be obtained under any
supranational, national, federal, state, foreign or local Law or regulation or
whether any consents, approvals or waivers are required to be or should be
obtained from other parties to loan agreements or other Contracts
or instruments material to the Companys business in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger or the consummation of the other transactions
contemplated hereby and (B) in promptly making any such filings, furnishing
information required in connection therewith and seeking to obtain timely the
expiration or termination of any waiting period and any required consents,
permits, authorizations, approvals or waivers.

(b) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall: (i) promptly notify the
others of, and if in writing, furnish the others with copies of (or, in the
case of oral communications, advise the others of the contents of) any
communication to such Person from a Governmental Entity and permit the others
to review and discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith any comments
made by the others in relation to) any proposed written communication to a
Governmental Entity and (ii) keep the others reasonably informed of any
developments, meetings or discussions with any Governmental Entity in respect
of any filings, submissions, investigation, or inquiry concerning the Merger.

(c) Subject to _Section 5.05(f)_, in furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree to use its
reasonable best efforts to take promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid
or eliminate each and every impediment and obtain all consents under the HSR
Act, FTC Act, Clayton Act, Sherman Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law that may
be required to enable the parties to close the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as promptly as practicable and no later than the Outside Date,
including committing to or effecting by consent decree, hold separate order,
trust, or otherwise the sale or disposition of assets or businesses, and
agreeing to operational, conduct, financial and ownership restrictions, to
avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or vacate or lift, any
order, decree or ruling that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or
materially delaying the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Further, and for the avoidance of doubt,
Parent will take any and all actions necessary in order to ensure the absence
of any (x) requirement for any non-action, consent or approval of any state
attorney general or other Governmental Entity, (y) decree, judgment,
injunction, temporary restraining order or any other order in any suit or
proceeding, and (z) other matter relating to any antitrust or competition Law
which would preclude consummation of the Merger by the Outside Date; provided,
however, that Parent shall not be required to take any action set forth in
this paragraph that would result in a Restraint.

(d) In the event that any litigation, administrative or judicial action or
other proceeding is commenced challenging any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with each
other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist
any such litigation, action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by the Outside Date.

 



46 (e) Neither Parent nor the Company shall, nor shall they permit their
respective Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire any business, Person
or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets
(except in each case pursuant to any agreement in effect on the date hereof),
if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to or the
consummation of such acquisition, would reasonably be likely to materially
increase the risk of delaying, impeding or not obtaining by the Outside Date
any applicable waiting period termination or expiration, clearance, approval
or waiver under the HSR Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.05_, Parent
shall not be required to sell, divest, hold separate, license or agree to any
other structural or conduct remedy with respect to any Subsidiary, operation,
division, business, product line, customer, asset or relationship of Parent or
Company or any of their Affiliates or Subsidiaries other than such sale,
divestiture, hold separate, license or structural or conduct remedy with
respect to operations, divisions, businesses, product lines or assets that
would represent an amount of annual revenues of $50,000,000 or less (any such
action that is not required to be taken pursuant to this subsection  _(f)_ a
" _Restraint_ ").

Section 5.06 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses existing in favor of the current or
former directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any other Persons serving at the request of the Company in
such capacity or any other capacity with another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise (each an " _Indemnified Person_ ")
as provided in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, or the
articles of organization, bylaws or similar constituent documents of any of
the Companys Subsidiaries, or under any agreement filed as an exhibit to a
Company SEC Document filed at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date
hereof or listed on Section 3.17 of the Disclosure Letter, as in effect as of
the date hereof with respect to matters occurring prior to or at the
Effective Time shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect for a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time and until
the final disposition of any action, suit or proceeding commenced during such
period.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be maintained in effect for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time, in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to or at the
Effective Time, policies of directors and officers liability insurance
(which may take the form of an extended reporting period, endorsement or
policy) covering the Persons currently covered by the Companys existing
directors and officers liability insurance policies in an amount and
scope at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an
annual premium for such policies in excess of 200% of the last annual premium
paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximu_ _m
Premium_ "). If the Surviving Corporations existing directors and officers
insurance policy expires or is cancelled prior to the sixth anniversary
of the Effective Time or if the premium for such policies exceeds the Maximum
Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall obtain, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to obtain, as much 

 



47  directors and officers liability insurance coverage as can be obtained for
the remainder of such six-year period for an annualized premium not in excess
of the Maximum Premium, on terms and conditions no less favorable to the
Indemnified Persons as the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance policies as of the date of this Agreement. Prior to the Effective
Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and in lieu
of the foregoing coverage, the Company may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid
policy on the directors and officers liability insurance policies on terms
and conditions no less advantageous than the directors and officers
liability insurance policies, provided that the amount paid by the Company for
such "tail" policy shall not exceed $1,200,000. In the event that the Company
purchases such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain such "tail" policy in full force and
effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu
of all other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the
first sentence of this _Section 5.06(b)_ for so long as such "tail" policy
shall be maintained in full force and effect.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Indemnified Person
notifies the Surviving Corporation on or prior to the sixth anniversary of
the Effective Time that a claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
(whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) has been made against
such Indemnified Person, the provisions of this _Section 5.06_ shall
continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation.

(d) This  _Section 5.06_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified Persons and
their respective heirs and legal representatives.

 

(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers of conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.06_. In addition, the Surviving
Corporation shall not distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any
of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render the
Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its obligations under this _Section
5.06_.

 

Section 5.07 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, except as set forth below, the Company will,
and will cause its Subsidiaries to, and from and after the Effective Time,
Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation (or any Subsidiary
thereof) to, honor all Company Benefit Agreements, in accordance with the
terms of such agreements, including without limitation any provision providing
for the termination or expiration of such agreements following a "change in
control" (as such term is defined therein) or otherwise providing for
termination or amendment. From the Effective Time through December 31, 2012,
officers and employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall remain
eligible to participate in the Companys severance plan, as set forth in
_Section 5.07(a)_ of the Disclosure Letter. From and after December 31, 2012,
such officers and employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall
become eligible to

 



48  participate in Parents then-current severance policy (if any), as may be in
effect from time to time, to the same extent as similarly situated officers
and employees of Parent. In addition, Parent agrees to cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain, without amendment, any bonus plans that are in effect
at the Effective Time until the last day of the calendar year in which the
Effective Time occurs; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not prevent
adjustments to financial performance metrics applicable under any such plan to
reflect the effect of the Merger on the financial performance of the Company
as long as such adjustments are not materially disadvantageous to
the employees of the Company.

(b) Parent hereby agrees that, from the Effective Time through December 31,
2012, it shall, or it shall cause the Surviving Corporation (or any
Subsidiary thereof) to, (i) provide each employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation (or any Subsidiary thereof) as of the Effective Time (each, a "
_Continuing Employee_ ") with at least the same level of base salary or hourly
wage, as the case may be, and incentive compensation targets that were
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and (ii) provide the Continuing Employee with employee benefits, perquisites
and fringe benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than, those
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time,
in each case, subject to _Section 5.07(a)_.

(c) Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation (or any Subsidiary
thereof) to, cause service rendered by each Continuing Employee to the Company
or its predecessors prior to the Effective Time to be credited for all
purposes (other than for purposes of determining an accrued benefit under any
defined benefit pension plan) under the employee benefit plans, programs,
policies and arrangements maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation or
any Subsidiary thereof (collectively, the " _Parent Benefit Plans_ "), to the
same extent as such service was taken into account under a corresponding
Company Benefit Plan as of the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no such credit shall be required to the extent that it would result in a
duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

(d) Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary
thereof (or use its reasonable best efforts to cause its insurance carriers)
to cause the group health plan maintained by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation (or any Subsidiary thereof), to the extent such group health plan
is made available to the Continuing Employees after the Effective Time, to
(i) waive any evidence of insurability requirements, waiting periods, and any
limitations as to preexisting medical conditions under the group health plan
applicable to the Continuing Employees and their spouses and eligible
dependents (but only to the extent that such preexisting condition limitations
did not apply or were satisfied under the applicable Company Benefit Plan
prior to the Effective Time) and (ii) provide the Continuing Employees
with credit, for the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs, for
the amount of any out-of pocket expenses and copayments or deductible expenses
that were covered by the applicable Company Benefit Plan and are incurred by
them during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs under a
group health plan maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or any
Subsidiary thereof).

 



49 (e) Prior to the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
shall comply in all material respects with any and all notice, consultation,
effects bargaining or other bargaining obligations to any labor union, labor
organization, works council or group of employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement.

(f) Other than _Section 5.06_, no provision of this Agreement shall (i)
create any third-party beneficiary or other rights in any current or former
employee, director or other service provider of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, including rights in respect of any benefits that may be
provided, directly or indirectly, under any Company Benefit Plan, Company
Benefit Agreement or Parent Benefit Plan or rights to continued employment or
service with the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any Affiliate
of any of the foregoing, (ii) be construed as an amendment, waiver or
creation of or limitation on the ability to terminate any Company Benefit
Plan, Company Benefit Agreement or Parent Benefit Plan, or (iii) limit the
ability of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any Affiliate of
the foregoing to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee.

Section 5.08 _Takeover Laws_. The Company shall take all reasonable steps to
exclude the applicability of, or to assist in any challenge by Parent or
Merger Sub to the validity or applicability to the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement of, any Takeover Laws.

Section 5.09 _Proxy Statement_. The Company shall prepare and file with the
SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, a
preliminary Proxy Statement (the " _Preliminary Proxy Statement_ ") relating
to the Merger as required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish to the Company the
information relating to it required by the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder to be included in the Preliminary Proxy Statement. The
Company shall obtain and furnish the information required to be included in
the Preliminary Proxy Statement, shall provide Parent with, and consult with
Parent regarding, any comments that may be received from the SEC or its staff
with respect thereto, shall respond promptly to any such comments made by the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Preliminary Proxy Statement, shall cause
the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders at the earliest
reasonably practicable date and shall use its reasonable best
efforts (subject to _Section 5.02_) to obtain the necessary approval of the
Merger by its stockholders. If, at any time prior to the Special Meeting, any
information relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, any of their
respective Affiliates, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Merger), should be discovered by the Company or Parent which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so
that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed
with the SEC and to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company. Except as _Section 5.02_ expressly permits, the
Proxy Statement shall include the recommendation of the Board of Directors of
the Company that the stockholders adopt the agreement of merger set forth in
this Agreement. The Company shall give

 



50  Parent reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Preliminary
Proxy Statement, the Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereon
and the Company shall give due consideration to any of Parents comments
thereto.

Section 5.10 _Securityholder Litigation_. In the event that
any securityholder Litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby is brought against the Company and/or
its directors, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of such Litigation and
shall keep Parent informed on a current basis with respect to the status
thereof. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate subject
to a customary joint defense agreement in, but not control, the defense of any
such securityholder Litigation against the Company and/or its directors;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no settlement of any such securityholder
Litigation shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed, except
that Parent shall not be obligated to consent to any settlement which does not
include full release of Parent and its Affiliates or which imposes an
injunction or other equitable relief upon Parent or any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation).

Section 5.11 _Press Releases_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior written
consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may
be required by Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States
or non-U.S. securities exchange or regulatory or governmental body to which
the relevant party is subject or submits, in which case the party required to
make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to
allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance, it being understood that the final
form and content of any such release or announcement, to the extent so
required, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party. The
parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore
agreed to by the parties.

Section 5.12 _Rule 16b-3_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be permitted to take such steps
as may be reasonably necessary or advisable hereto to cause disposition of
Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a
director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act in accordance with that certain No-Action Letter dated
January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding such matters.

Section 5.13 _Financing_.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Financing at or prior
to the Effective Time, including using reasonable best efforts to (i)
maintain in effect the Financing and the Financing Commitments, (ii) enter
into definitive financing agreements with respect to the Financing and
Financing Commitments, so that such agreements are in effect as promptly
as practicable but in any event

 



51  no later than the Effective Time, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all
Financing Conditions and (iv) in the event that the Financing Conditions have
been, or upon funding would be, satisfied, cause the Debt Financing Sources
to fund the full amount of the Financing. Parent and Merger Sub shall deliver
to the Company true, complete and correct copies of the Financing Commitments
and shall keep the Company fully informed of material developments in respect
of the financing process relating thereto as reasonably requested by the
Company from time to time. Prior to the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub shall
not agree to, or permit, any amendment or modification of, or waiver under,
or any supplement, assignment, substitution or replacement of the Financing
Commitments or other documentation relating to the Financing, except as
expressly permitted under _Section 5.13(b)_ or 
  _Section 5.13(c)_, in each case, without the prior written consent of the
Company.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent and
Merger Sub shall have the right from time to time to amend, supplement or
otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights under, the Financing Commitments
or any definitive agreements with respect to the Financing; _provided_ that
any such amendment, supplement or other modification to, or waiver of, any
provision of or remedy under the Financing Commitments or such definitive
agreements shall not (i) include any conditions that are in addition to, or
in the aggregate more onerous than, the Financing Conditions or otherwise
expand, amend or modify any of the Financing Conditions in a manner adverse to
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, (ii) cause or be reasonably expected
to cause a delay in the ability of, or hinder or prevent or adversely impact
the ability of, Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or enforce its rights against the
Debt Financing Sources with respect to the Financing Commitments, (iii)
reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing or (iv) release, repudiate,
withdraw, consent to or otherwise result in the termination of the obligations
of the Debt Financing Sources under the Financing Commitments (except for the
replacement of the lenders in respect of the bridge facility described therein
for up to 20% of the aggregate commitments in respect thereof as expressly
contemplated by the Financing Commitments). In such event, the new commitment
letters entered into in accordance with this _Section 5.13(b)_ shall be
deemed to be a part of the "Financing" and the commitment with respect thereto
shall be deemed to be a part of the "Financing Commitments" for all purposes
of this Agreement).

(c) If, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by Parent and
Merger Sub to satisfy its obligations under _Section 5.13(a)_, any of the
Financing or the Financing Commitments (or any definitive financing agreement
relating thereto) expire or are terminated prior to the Closing, in whole or
in part, for any reason, or all or any portion of the Financing shall
otherwise become unavailable (or it shall become reasonably foreseeable that
all or any portion of the Financing shall otherwise become available,
including as a result of a breach or repudiation, or threatened or
anticipated breach or repudiation, by any party to the Financing Commitments)
Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) promptly notify the Company of such
expiration, termination or other event and the reasons therefor, (ii) use
reasonable best efforts to arrange for alternative financing (an "
_Alternative Financing_ ") on terms and conditions that are not less favorable
to Parent and Merger Sub in the aggregate than the terms and conditions set
forth in the Financing Commitments (which, together with other financial
resources available to the Company, shall be in an amount sufficient to pay
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including any refinancing or repayment of indebtedness of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company required in connection

 



52  therewith) and which does not include any conditions that are in addition
to, or in the aggregate more onerous than, the Financing Conditions) to
replace the financing contemplated by such original commitments or agreements
and (iii) use reasonable best efforts to obtain a new financing commitment
that provides for such Alternative Financing and, promptly after execution
thereof, deliver to the Company true, complete and correct copies of the
commitment letter and fee letter (in redacted form removing only the fees
payable on the Closing to a financing source) and related definitive financing
documents related to such Alternative Financing relating to such commitment,
in each case, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event (and in any event no later than the Closing). Upon obtaining any
commitment for any such Alternative Financing, such financing shall be deemed
to be a part of the "Financing" and the commitment with respect thereto shall
be deemed to be a part of the "Financing Commitments" for all purposes of this
Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company with prompt notice
of any breach by any party to the Financing Commitments of which Parent or
Merger Sub becomes aware or any withdrawal, repudiation or termination of the
Financing Commitments and, at the Companys request, keep the Company informed
on a current basis of the status of their efforts to obtain any Alternative
Financing. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub agree to
notify the Company promptly, and in any event within three (3) Business Days,
if at any time (A) any of the Financing Commitments shall expire, be
withdrawn or be terminated for any reason, (B) any Debt Financing Source party
to any of the Financing Commitments notifies Parent or Merger Sub that it no
longer intends to provide financing on the terms set forth therein or (C) to
the knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, any party to any of the Financing
Commitments is or is alleged to be in breach or default thereunder.

(d) [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]

(e) In the period between the date hereof and the Closing, upon reasonable
request of Parent and Merger Sub, the Company shall, and shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause its Subsidiaries, Affiliates and Representatives to,
reasonably cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub in connection with
the Financing (for purposes of this _Section 5.13(e)_, the "Financing" shall
include any financing to be issued or incurred in lieu of the debt facilities
described in the Financing Commitments and any registration by the
Parent and/or its Subsidiaries under the Securities Act effected pursuant to
the registration rights agreement, dated November 23, 2010, by and among
Parent, certain Subsidiaries of Parent as guarantors, and J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC, as representative of the Initial Purchasers (as defined
therein)), including without limitation, in each case, at the reasonable
request of Parent and Merger Sub, (i) preparation of all required financial
statements relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries and provision of data
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to allow Parent to prepare any
required pro forma financial information in connection with the Financing;
(ii) reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts related to the
Financing, including using reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to be available, during normal working hours and upon

Commitments and other prospective lenders and/or underwriters in a reasonable
number of meetings, presentations, road shows, drafting sessions, due
diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies; (iii) the provision of
pertinent information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries relevant
to the Financing reasonably requested by Parent and Merger Sub; (iv)
reasonably assisting in the preparation of (A) customary offering documents,
bank information memoranda, prospectuses 

 



53  and similar marketing documents, which contain all financial statements and
other data relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries required to be
included therein (which, in the case of financial information relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, if required by applicable rules or regulations
of the SEC or by the underwriters for any securities offering, shall have been
reviewed by the independent accountants for the Company as provided in the
procedures specified by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in AU
722) and all appropriate pro forma financial information of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (which pro forma financial statements shall be prepared
by Parent or its Representatives) in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP
and prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, and
all other data (including selected financial data) relating to the Company and
its Subsidiaries that the SEC would require in a registered debt offering on
Form S-1 under the Securities Act or that would be necessary for an investment
bank to receive customary "comfort" (including "negative assurance" comfort)
from independent accountants in connection with a registered debt offering on
Form S-1 under the Securities Act and (B) materials for rating agency
presentations; (v) using commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
independent accountants, consistent with their customary practice, to provide
reasonable assistance and cooperation to Parent, including accounting due
diligence sessions, and providing consent to Parent to use their audit reports
relating to the Company and reasonable assistance in facilitating the
provision of customary "comfort" (including "negative assurance" comfort) by
such independent accountants, in each case on customary terms and consistent
with their customary practice in connection with financings similar to the
Financing; (vi) reasonably cooperating with Parent and Merger Sub in providing
customary information with respect to its property and assets reasonably
required in connection with the Financing Conditions and reasonably
facilitating the pledging of collateral and providing of guarantees with
respect to the Financing Commitments upon Closing consistent with the terms of
this Agreement and, subject to the occurrence of the Closing, taking corporate
actions necessary to permit the consummation of the Financing; (vii)
assisting Parent as requested thereby in seeking to obtain ratings from

the Financing and the senior secured facilities described in the Financing
Commitments to be provided in connection therewith; and (viii) delivering to
Parent for further distribution to the lenders under the Financing
Commitments all documentation and other information required by bank
regulatory authorities under applicable "know-your-customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the U.S.A. PATRIOT ACT (Title III
of Pub. L. 107 56 (signed into law October 26, 2011)). Parent and Merger Sub
shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company, its affiliates or
its representatives in connection with such cooperation. The effectiveness of
any definitive financing documentation executed by the Company, its affiliates
or its representatives in connection with such cooperation shall be subject to
the consummation of the Closing.

(f) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that the Company and
its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall not, prior to the
Closing, have any responsibility for, or incur any liability to any Person
under, the Financing, any Alternative Financing or any other financing that
Parent and Merger Sub may raise in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any cooperation provided pursuant to this
_Section 5.13_. Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several basis,
indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives from and against

 



54  any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest,
awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred in connection with any
Transaction Financing or other securities offering of Parent and/or its
Subsidiaries or any assistance or activities provided in connection therewith;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply in the Companys
or its Subsidiaries or other representatives willful misconduct or gross
negligence.

Section 5.14 _Payoff Letter_.

least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver
a notice of prepayment in accordance with the prepayment provisions of the
Credit Agreement to the administrative agent (or similar person) under the
Credit Agreement (the " _Credit Agreement Agent_ ").

 

(b) If there are any amounts then outstanding under the Credit Agreement, at
least one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent a payoff letter in customary and
substantially final form (the " _Payoff Letter_ ") from the lenders, or the
Credit Agreement Agent on behalf of the lenders, under the Credit Agreement
which (i) confirms the aggregate outstanding amount required to be paid to
fully satisfy all principal, interest, prepayment premiums, penalties,
breakage costs or any other outstanding and unpaid Obligations (as defined in
the Credit Agreement) under the Credit Agreement as of the anticipated
Closing (and the daily accrual of interest thereafter) (the " _Payoff Amount_
") and (ii) provides for the release of Liens and guarantees granted in
connection with the Credit Agreement. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to (i) obtain customary documents, terminations and releases
(including with respect to outstanding mortgages), as are reasonably necessary
to release all Liens and all guarantees granted in connection with the Credit
Agreement substantially concurrently with the Closing, subject to the receipt
by such lenders of the applicable Payoff Amount and the replacement (or cash
collateralization or backstopping) of any then outstanding letters of credit
of the Company under the Credit Agreement, and (ii) terminate the Credit
Documents or Loan Documents, as applicable (as defined in the Credit
Agreement) and all other related agreements and instruments in accordance
with and to the extent allowed by their terms.

right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.01(c)_ shall

any covenants and agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement has
caused or resulted in a failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before
the Outside Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 7.01(c)_ shall not be available to
Parent if (i) any court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity

occurring prior to the Outside Date; (ii) the actions in clause (i) were
related to securityholder Litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby; and (iii) Parent was provided an

of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set
forth in this Agreement on the part of the Company, in the case of a

disclosing that the Company Board recommends rejection of such tender or

party with the intent of causing a breach of this Agreement.

Section 7.03  _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) Whether or not the Merger is consummated, except as otherwise specifically
provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this

Costs_ ") shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses.

 

(b) The Company shall pay to Parent the Fee (or such lesser amount as
specified below) by wire transfer of same-day funds if this Agreement is
terminated as follows:

(i) if (A) either party shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section

7.01(d)_) or prior to the termination of this Agreement (in the case of a
termination pursuant to _Section 7.01(h)_) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal
shall have been made public, and (C) within twelve (12) months after the date
of such termination, an Alternative Transaction is consummated, or an
agreement in principle, letter of intent, acquisition agreement or other
similar agreement with respect to an Alternative Transaction is entered into,
then the Company shall pay Parent (x) up to $45 million of Parents reasonable
and documented Transaction Costs upon such termination and (y) the Fee less
any amount paid under the immediately preceding clause (x) on the date of
entry into such agreement or, if earlier, consummation of such Alternative
Transaction;

(ii) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.01(f)_,

the termination.

For purposes of this _Section 7.03(b)_, (i) an " _Alternative Transaction_ "
means any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a
series of transactions, of any assets or businesses that constitute 50% or
more of the revenues, net income, EBITDA (earnings before interest expense,
taxes, depreciation and amortization) or assets of the Company and the
Companys Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 50% or more of any class of
equity securities of the Company, any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 50% or more of any
class of equity securities of the Company, or any merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint
venture, binding share exchange or similar

 



60  transaction involving the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company pursuant
to which any Person or the stockholders of any Person would own 50% or more of
any class of equity securities of the Company or of any resulting parent
company of the Company, other than the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
7.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and that, without these
agreements, the parties would not have entered into this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay the Fee
on more than one occasion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Parents right to receive payment of the Fee from the Company
shall, solely in circumstances where the Fee has been paid, be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and
its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future
officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, affiliates or
agents for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be
consummated, and upon payment of the Fee, none of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future officers,
directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, affiliates or agents
shall have any liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 7.04 _Amendment_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, at any time
before or after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company
but, after any such stockholder approval, no amendment shall be made which
under applicable Law requires the approval of the Companys stockholders
without the approval of the stockholders of the Company. This Agreement may
not be amended, changed, supplemented or otherwise modified except by
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of all of the parties.

Section 7.05 _Extension; Waiver; Remedies_. To the extent permitted by

or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in
any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees that service of any process, summons,
notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective addresses set
forth in _Section 8.05_ shall be effective service of process for any
proceeding arising out of, relating to or in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger. Each
