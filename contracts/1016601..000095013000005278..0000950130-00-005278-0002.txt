          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION, dated as of October
1, 2000 (this "Agreement"), by and among Vialog Corporation, a Massachusetts
               ---------
corporation (the "Company"), Genesys SA, a corporation (societe anonym)
                  -------                               ------- ------
organized under the laws of France ("Parent"), and ABCD Merger Corp., a
                                     ------
Massachusetts corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent

("Merger Sub").
------------

                               W I T N E S S E T H

          WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and the respective Boards
of Directors thereof deem it advisable and in the best interests of their
respective corporations and the stockholders thereof to merge Merger Sub with
and into the Company pursuant to the provisions of the Business Corporation Law
of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the "Massachusetts BCL");
                                           -----------------

          WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company, and Parent as sole shareholder of Merger Sub, have each approved
this Agreement and the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, and in accordance with the
Massachusetts BCL, whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock,
par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock") (other than shares
                                               ------------
of Common Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company or by Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.1(b) hereof)),
will, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth
herein, be converted into a fraction of a Parent American Depositary Share
(collectively, the "ADSs"), each of which ADS represents one-half of a share,
                    ----
nominal value 30 French francs per share,
<PAGE>

of Parent (the "Parent Shares") in accordance with the provisions of Article I
                -------------
of this Agreement;

          WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Parent's and Merger Sub's
entering into this Agreement and incurring the obligations set forth herein,
concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent is
entering into a Voting Agreement with certain shareholders of the Company, dated
the date hereof (the "Voting Agreement"), pursuant to which, among other things,
                      ----------------
such shareholders have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions contained
therein, to vote all shares of Common Stock then owned by such shareholders to
approve and adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and
have granted to Parent a proxy coupled with an interest to vote their shares of
Common Stock upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein; and

          WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Merger (as defined
in Section 1.1(a) hereof) is intended to qualify as a "reorganization" under the
provisions of Section 368(a) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "Code").
                 ----

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants, agreements and conditions set forth herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I
                                   THE MERGER
     SECTION 1.1   THE MERGER.

          (a)  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
and in accordance with the Massachusetts BCL, at the Effective Time (as defined
in Section 1.1(b) hereof), Merger Sub shall be merged (the "Merger") with and
                                                            ------
into the Company, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease,
and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the

"Surviving Corporation") and shall continue to be governed by the laws of the
----------------------
Commonwealth of Massachusetts and shall continue under the name "Patriot
Corporation."

          (b)  Concurrently with the Closing (as defined in Section 1.7 hereof),
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing, as soon as practicable after the Closing, this Agreement or articles of
merger (the "Articles of Merger") with the State Secretary of the Commonwealth
             ------------------
of Massachusetts (the "Secretary of State") in accordance with the relevant
                       ------------------
provisions of the Massachusetts BCL. The Merger shall become effective on the
date and time at which this Agreement or the Articles of Merger have been duly
filed with the Secretary of State or at such other date and time as is agreed in
writing between the parties and specified in the Articles of Merger, and such
date and time is hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time."
                                                 --------------

     SECTION 1.2   EFFECT ON COMMON STOCK.

          (a)  CANCELLATION OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK.  At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders
thereof, each share of Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock and
each share of Common Stock owned by Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and cease to exist,
and no consideration or payment shall be delivered therefor or in respect
thereto. All shares of Common Stock to be converted into ADSs pursuant to this
Section 1.2 shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holders thereof, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled and retired and cease
to exist, and each holder of a certificate (representing prior to the Effective
Time any such shares of Common Stock) shall thereafter cease to have any rights
with respect to such shares of Common Stock, except the right to receive (i) the
ADSs representing Parent Shares into which such shares of Common Stock have been
converted, (ii) any dividend and other distributions in accordance with Section
1.3(c) hereof and (iii) any cash, without interest, to be paid in lieu of any
fraction of an ADS in accordance with Section 1.3(d) hereof.

        (b)  CAPITAL STOCK OF MERGER SUB.  At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each share
of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into 140,000 shares of common stock, par value
$.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and such shares shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  (c)  CONVERSION OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK.  At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, subject
to Section 1.3(d) hereof, each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of

                                       4
<PAGE>

Common Stock referred to in the first sentence of Section 1.2(a) hereof and
Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 1.2(d)) shall, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the
right to receive 0.5126 ADSs (the "Exchange Ratio")(which, together with any
                                   --------------
cash in lieu of a fractional ADS paid pursuant to Section 1.3(d) hereof, shall
be the "Merger Consideration"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if the
        --------------------
"Effective Time Parent Share Price" (as hereafter defined) shall be greater than
$59.5092, the Exchange Ratio shall be 1.15 multiplied by one over the fraction
representing the number of Parent Shares per ADS, multiplied by the amount
determined by dividing $13.2616 by the Effective Time Parent Share Price, and
(ii) if the Effective Time Parent Share Price shall be less than $43.9851, the
Exchange Ratio shall be 0.85 multiplied by one over the fraction representing
the number of Parent Shares per ADS, multiplied by the amount determined by
dividing $13.2616 by the Effective Time Parent Share Price; provided that (x) if
                                                            -------------
the Effective Time Parent Share Price is less than $33.6356, the Exchange Ratio
shall be 0.6703; and (y) if the Effective Time Parent Share Price is greater
than $69.8587, the Exchange Ratio shall be 0.4366. In any case, the Exchange
Ratio shall be rounded to the nearest 1/10,000 of a share.

For purposes of this Agreement, the "Signing Date Parent Share Price Equivalent"
                                     ------------------------------------------
shall be the U.S. dollar equivalent (based on the spot exchange rate between the
U.S. dollar and the euro for each relevant date, as published in the Wall Street
                                                                     -----------
Journal) of the volume-weighted average (as mutually determined by Parent and
-------
the Company) of the closing share prices (expressed in euros) of the Parent
Shares on the Nouveau Marche of the Paris BourseSBF S.A. (the "Nouveau Marche")
based on the closing share prices and trading volumes reported by Reuters (or,
if not so reported, as reported by any other authoritative source mutually
agreed upon by Parent and the Company) on the ten (10) consecutive trading days
ending on the second trading day immediately prior to the earlier of (i) the
execution of this

                                       5
<PAGE>

Agreement and (ii) the first public announcement of the Merger by any of the
parties to this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the "Effective Time
Parent Share Price" shall be the U.S. dollar equivalent (based on the spot
exchange rate between the dollar and the euro for each relevant date as
published in the Wall Street Journal) of the volume-weighted average (as
                 -------------------
mutually determined by Parent and the Company) of the closing prices of the
Parent Shares on the Nouveau Marche for the ten (10) consecutive trading days
ending on the second trading day prior to the date of the Special Meeting (so
long as the Closing Date occurs within five business days of the Special Meeting
or, if the Closing Date is more than five business days after the Special
Meeting, the Closing Date), based on the closing share prices and trading
volumes reported by Reuters (or, if not so reported, as reported by any other
authoritative source mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Company). All ADSs
issued as part of the Merger Consideration shall be validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable.

        (d)  DISSENTING SHARES.  (i)  Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Common Stock held by a holder who has
demanded and perfected dissenters' rights for such shares in accordance with the
Massachusetts BCL and who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively
withdrawn or lost such dissenters' rights ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be
                                            -----------------
converted into or represent a right to receive ADSs pursuant to Section 1.2(c),
but the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are granted by
the Massachusetts BCL, and any such payments for such Dissenting Shares shall be
made by the Company with its own funds.

       (ii)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (i) above,

if any holder of shares of Common Stock who demands purchase of such shares
under the Massachusetts BCL shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure
to perfect or otherwise) such holder's dissenters' rights, then, as

of the later of (A) the Effective Time or (B) the occurrence of such event, such
holder's shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only

                                       6
<PAGE>

the right to receive ADSs and cash in lieu of any fractional ADSs as provided
herein, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate formerly
representing such shares.

             (iii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of its
receipt of any written demands for purchase of any shares of Common Stock,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments relating to the Merger
served pursuant to the Massachusetts BCL and received by the Company and (B) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for purchase of any shares of Common Stock under the Massachusetts BCL.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent or as may
be required under applicable laws (in which case Company shall provide prior

                                   -------------
Exchange Agent will

                                       7
<PAGE>

requisition from the depositary for the ADSs (the "Depositary"), from time to
                                                   -----------
time, such number of ADSs as are issuable in exchange for shares of Common Stock

instrumentality thereof.

          (b)  As of or promptly following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail (and to make available for
collection by hand delivery) to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) (the

"Certificates"), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
-------------
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate or Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificate or Certificates to the
Exchange Agent in the form and with such other provisions as Parent and the
Company may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for a certificate or certificates
representing ADRs evidencing that number of whole ADSs, if any, into which the
number of shares of Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate
shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement (which instructions shall
provide that at the election of the surrendering holder, Certificates may be
surrendered, and ADRs evidencing the ADSs in exchange therefor collected, by
hand delivery). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or
Certificates shall be entitled to receive, in exchange therefor, ADRs evidencing
the number of

                                       8
<PAGE>

whole ADSs for each share of Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate or Certificates, and such ADRs shall be mailed (or made available
for collection by hand delivery if so elected by the surrendering holder) within
fifteen business days of receipt of the Certificate or Certificates (but in no
case prior to the Effective Time), and the Certificate or Certificates so
surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such
Certificate or Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be paid
or accrued, for the benefit of holders of the Certificates, on the cash payable
pursuant to subsections (c) and (d) below upon the surrender of the
Certificates.

          (c)  Until such Certificate is surrendered in accordance with this
Article I, no dividends or other distributions that are payable to holders of
Parent Shares with a record date on or after the Effective Time shall be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the ADSs represented
thereby by reason of the conversion of shares of Common Stock pursuant to
Sections 1.2(c) hereof and no cash payment in lieu of fractional ADSs shall be
paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 1.3(d) hereof.  Subject to the
effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there
shall be paid, without interest, to the person in whose name the ADSs
representing such securities are registered (i) at the time of such surrender,
the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional ADSs to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 1.3(d) hereof and the proportionate amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to ADSs, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date
or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the proportionate amount of dividends

<PAGE>

          (d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no
fraction of an ADS will be issued and no dividend or other distribution, stock
split or interest with respect to Parent Shares shall relate to any fractional
ADS, and any such fractional interest shall not entitle the owner thereof to
vote or to any rights as a security holder of the ADSs. In lieu of any such
fractional security, each holder of shares of Common Stock otherwise entitled to
a fraction of an ADS will be entitled to receive in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 1.3 from the Exchange Agent a cash payment equal to
the product obtained by multiplying such fraction of an ADS by the Effective
Time Parent Share Price and the fraction representing the number of Parent
Shares per ADS; provided, however, that all fractional share amounts held by a
                --------  -------
holder of Common Stock shall be aggregated and cash payments made hereunder for
fractional shares shall only be made for the fractional share amount remaining
after such aggregation.

          (e)  Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to
the holders of the Certificate or Certificates for one year after the Effective
Time shall be delivered, upon demand, to a depositary or another agent in the
United States designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company and
any holders of shares of Common Stock prior to the Merger who have not
theretofore complied with this Article I shall thereafter look for payment of
their claim, only to such depositary or agent for their claim for ADSs, any cash
(without interest) to be paid in lieu of any fractional ADSs, and any dividends
or other distributions with respect to ADSs to which such holders may be
entitled.

          (f)  None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any ADSs held in the Exchange Fund
(and any cash, dividends or other distributions payable in respect thereof)
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law. If any Certificate or Certificates shall not have been
surrendered prior to one year after the

                                       10
<PAGE>

Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which (i) any ADSs,
(ii) any cash in lieu of fractional ADSs or (iii) any dividends or distributions
with respect to ADSs in respect of such Certificate or Certificates would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity (as
defined in Section 3.3(b) hereof), any such ADSs, cash, dividends or
distributions in respect of such Certificate or Certificates shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

     SECTION 1.4   TRANSFER TAXES; WITHHOLDING.  If any certificate for an ADS
is to be issued to, or cash is to be remitted to, a Person (other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered), it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Certificate or
Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes (as defined in Section 3.11(b)
hereof) required by reason of the issuance of the ADSs (or cash in lieu of
fractional ADSs) to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
or Certificates so surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.  Parent
or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the ADSs (or
cash in lieu of fractional ADSs) otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder of shares of Common Stock such amounts as Parent or the Exchange
Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment.

     SECTION 1.5   STOCK OPTIONS; WARRANTS.

          (a) Each option granted to a Company employee, consultant or
director of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to acquire shares of
Common Stock, which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
("Option") shall remain outstanding and continue to be effective in accordance
  ------
with its terms. Upon exercise of any such Option, the Person entitled to receive
shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to automatically offer to exchange such
Common Stock for a number of ADSs, determined by multiplying (i) the number of
shares of Common Stock to be received upon such exercise by (ii) the Exchange
Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole ADS), provided, however, that in the
                                               --------  -------
case of an Option that is intended to qualify as an incentive stock option under
Section 422 of the Code, the conversion formula shall be adjusted if necessary
to conform with Section 424(a) of the Code. The aggregate exercise price payable
by any Person who holds an Option immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be reduced by an amount equal to the product of (w) the fractional number of
ADSs not delivered as a result of the rounding-down required by clause (ii) of
the preceding sentence, (x) the Exchange Ratio and (y) the average of the
closing prices of the Parent Shares on the Nouveau Marche during the period of
ten trading days ending two trading days prior to the Closing Date and (z) the
fraction of a Parent Share represented by an ADS.

          (b) Each of the warrants of the Company expiring November 15, 2001 to
purchase 10.0886 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $.01 per share
(the "Warrants"), which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall remain outstanding and continue to be effective in accordance with its
terms and the terms of the supplemental warrant agreement that is required to be
entered into with respect to the Warrants prior to the Effective Time pursuant
to Section 5.01 of the Warrant Agreement dated as of November 12, 1997 (the
"Company Warrant Agreement") between the Company and State Street Bank and Trust
Company, as Warrant Agent. Following the

                                       12
<PAGE>

Effective Time, each Warrant shall represent the right to acquire Parent ADSs in
accordance with the Company Warrant Agreement and the supplemental warrant
agreement.

          (c) Parent shall take such corporate action as may be necessary or
appropriate to, as soon as practicable, but in no event more than five business
days following the Effective Time, file a registration statement on Form F-1 (or
any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the ADSs deliverable
upon the exchange of Common Stock received upon exercise of an Option or Warrant
to the extent such registration is required under applicable law in order for
such ADSs to be sold without restriction in the United States, and Parent shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement for so long as any Option or Warrant remains outstanding.

     SECTION 1.6   LOST CERTIFICATES.  If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such  certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the ADSs to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this
Article I.

     SECTION 1.7   MERGER CLOSING.  Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VI hereof, the closing of the Merger (the

"Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on a date to be
--------
specified by the parties hereto, and no later than the second business day after
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof, at
the offices of Breslow & Walker, LLP, 767 Third Avenue, New York,

                                       13

N.Y. 10017, unless another time, date or place is agreed to by the parties
hereto (such date, the "Closing Date").
                        ------------

     SECTION 1.8   STOCK TRANSFER BOOKS.  At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Common Stock thereafter on the records of
the Company, except upon the exercise of Options in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
shall cease to have any rights with respect to shares of Common Stock, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable law. If, after the
Effective Time, shares of Common Stock are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for cash or certificates
representing ADSs, in accordance with the procedures set forth herein.

     SECTION 1.9   RESTRICTED STOCK.  Any unvested shares of restricted stock
existing at the Effective Time shall be converted into ADSs pursuant to Section
1.2(c) hereof and shall continue to vest upon the same terms and conditions as
under the applicable Plan and/or restricted stock agreement.

     SECTION 1.10   ANTIDILUTION PROTECTION FOR EXCHANGE RATIO.  If, between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Parent Shares or
shares of Common Stock of the Company shall have been changed into a different
number of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, combination or exchange of shares or if a stock
dividend or dividend payable in any other securities of the Company or Parent
shall be declared with a record date within such period, or if any similar event
shall have occurred, the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to
provide to the holders of Common Stock of the

                                       14

Company the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event.

                                  ARTICLE III
                 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

     The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

     SECTION 3.1   CORPORATE EXISTENCE AND POWER.  The Company is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and has all corporate powers and all governmental
licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals (collectively, "Licenses")
                                                                 --------
required to conduct its business as now conducted except for failures to have
any such License which would not, in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect (as defined below). The Company is duly qualified to do business
as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in those jurisdictions
specified in Schedule 3.1 to this Agreement, which are the only jurisdictions
where the character of the property owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except in such
jurisdictions where failures to be so qualified would not reasonably be expected
to, in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. As used herein,
the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" means a material adverse effect on
          -------------------------------
the financial condition, business, assets, prospects or results of operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided, however, that in
                                                    --------  -------
no event shall any effect that results from (x) the public announcement or

                                       16
<PAGE>

pendency of the transactions contemplated hereby or any actions taken in
compliance with this Agreement, (y) changes affecting the audio, video and
internet teleconferencing industries generally and which do not
disproportionately materially affect the Company or (z) changes affecting the
United States economy generally, constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Company has heretofore furnished to Parent true and complete copies of the
Articles of Organization and the by-laws of the Company as in effect on the date
hereof. The Company's Articles of Organization and bylaws are in full force and
effect. The Company is not in violation of any of the provisions of the
Company's Articles of Organization or its bylaws.

     SECTION 3.2   CORPORATE AUTHORIZATION.  The Company has all requisite
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and, subject
to approval of the Company's shareholders, as set forth in Section 3.19 hereof
and as contemplated by Section 5.3 hereof, to perform its obligations hereunder
and consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereunder. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance of its obligations
hereunder and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized, and this Agreement
has been approved, by the Board of Directors of the Company and no approvals,
authorizations or other corporate proceedings, on the part of the Company, other
than the approval of the Company's shareholders, are necessary to authorize the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, upon the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, will constitute a valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance
with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,

                                       17
<PAGE>

insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or
affecting the rights of creditors generally.

     SECTION 3.3   CONSENTS AND APPROVALS; NO VIOLATIONS.

          (a)  Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder will (i) conflict with
or result in any breach of any provision of the Articles of Organization or the
by-laws of the Company; (ii) except as set forth in Schedule 3.3(a) to this
Agreement, result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without
due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration or obligation to repurchase, repay,
redeem or acquire or any similar right or obligation) under any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any note, mortgage, letter of credit, other evidence
of indebtedness, guarantee, license, lease or agreement or similar instrument or
obligation to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by
which any of them or any of their respective assets may be bound (except that
the Company will be required to repay its outstanding $75,000,000 12 3/4% Series
B Senior Notes due November 15, 2001 (the "High Yield Notes") upon consummation

of the Merger if the Company does not satisfy the debt incurrence test contained
in Section 4.04(b) of the Indenture under which the High-Yield Notes were issued
(the "Company Indenture") or, if the Company does satisfy such test, will be
required to offer to purchase the High-Yield Notes not later than 60 days
following the Effective Time) or (iii) assuming that the filings, registrations,
notifications, authorizations, consents and approvals referred to in subsection
(b) below have been obtained or made, as the case may be, violate any order,
injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, excluding from the
foregoing clauses (ii) and (iii) such requirements, defaults, breaches, rights
or violations that would not, in the

                                       18
<PAGE>

aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect
(without giving effect to clause (x) of the definition of Company Material
Adverse Effect) and would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on, or materially delay, the ability of the Company to perform its
obligations hereunder.

          (b) No filing or registration with, notification to, or authorization,
consent or approval of, any government or any agency, court, tribunal,
commission, board, bureau, department, political subdivision or other
instrumentality of any government (including any regulatory or administrative
agency), whether federal, state, multinational (including, but not limited to,
the European Community), provincial, municipal, domestic or foreign (each, a

"Governmental Entity") is required in connection with the execution and delivery
--------------------
of this Agreement by the Company or the performance by the Company of its
obligations hereunder, except (i) the filing of the Articles of Merger in
accordance with the Massachusetts BCL and filings to maintain the good standing
of the Surviving Corporation; (ii) compliance with any applicable requirements
of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the
rules and regulations thereunder (the "HSR Act"), the EC Merger Regulations (as
                                       -------
defined below) or any foreign laws regulating competition, antitrust, investment
or exchange controls; (iii) compliance with any applicable requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder
(the "Securities Act"), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and
      --------------
the rules and regulations thereunder (the "Exchange Act"); (iv) compliance with
                                           ------------
any applicable requirements of state blue sky or takeover laws and (v) such
other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, notifications, registrations,
declarations and filings, the failure of which to be obtained or made (A) would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect and (B) would not have a material adverse effect on, or
materially delay, the ability of the Company to perform its

                                       19
<PAGE>

obligations hereunder. For purposes of this Agreement, "EC Merger Regulations"

consists of 30,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the "Preferred Stock"). As of

duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and were
not issued in violation of any preemptive rights. As of September 29, 2000,
there were outstanding Options to purchase 2,411,136 shares of Common Stock. The
Company has provided to Parent schedules detailing each outstanding Option, the
name of the holder of such Option, the number of shares of Common Stock subject
to such Option, the exercise price of such Option and the vesting schedule of
such Option, including the extent vested to date and whether the exercisability
of such Option will be accelerated and become exercisable by the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Except as set forth in this Section 3.4 and
except for changes since September 29, 2000 resulting from the exercise of
Options outstanding on such date, there are outstanding (i) no shares of capital
stock or other voting securities of the Company, (ii) no securities of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company convertible into or

(iii) no options or other rights to acquire from the Company, and no obligation
of the Company to issue, any capital stock, voting securities or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock or voting securities of the
Company (the items in the preceding clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) being referred
to collectively as the "Company Securities"). At the date of this Agreement, the
                        ------------------
number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding or deemed to be issued
and outstanding on a "fully-diluted" basis, after giving effect to the assumed

which a favorable determination letter has not yet been received, the applicable
remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code has not expired and
such a letter will be timely applied for.  To the knowledge of the Company,
there are no circumstances and no events have

                                       33

requirement has not been waived has occurred, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not result in the occurrence of
any such reportable event; (iii) all premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation ("PBGC") have been timely paid in full; (iv) no liability (other
              ----
than for premiums to the PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected
to be incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and (v) the PBGC has
not instituted proceedings to terminate any such Plan and, to the Company's
knowledge, no condition exists that presents a risk that such proceedings will
be instituted or which would constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for
the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to administer, any such
Plan.

          (i) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.12(i) to this Agreement, no Plan

service, other than (i) coverage mandated by applicable law, (ii) death benefits
under any "pension plan," or (iii) benefits the full cost of which is borne by
the current or former employee (or his or her beneficiary), dependent or other
covered person.  The Company has never represented or contracted (whether in
oral or written form) to any employee (either individually or to employees as a
group) that such employee(s) would be provided with life insurance, medical or
other employee welfare benefits

                                       34
<PAGE>

required by statute.

execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with

Parent Material Adverse Effect.

pending or threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or against any
Person whose liability for any Environmental Claim Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries has or may have retained or assumed, either contractually or by

Effect.

          (iii) To the knowledge of Parent, there are no present or past
actions, activities, circumstances, conditions, events or incidents, including,
without limitation, the Release or presence of any Hazardous Material that could
form the basis of any Environmental Claim against Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or against any Person whose liability for any Environmental Claim
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has or may have retained or assumed, either
contractually or by operation of law, that in either case, individually or in

          (d)   None of the real property owned or leased by Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent is listed or, to the knowledge of Parent, proposed for
listing on the "National Priorities List" under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, or any similar
list of sites in the United States or any other jurisdiction requiring

result in a liability to Parent that would have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

     SECTION 4.17  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

          (a) Parent and its Subsidiaries own or have the right to use all

question the validity of, or Parent's or its Subsidiaries' rights in and to, any
Intellectual Property owned by Parent in any respect that would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Parent has not received notice of any pending or threatened suit, action
or adversarial proceeding that seeks to limit, cancel or question the validity
of, or Parent's or its Subsidiaries' rights in and to, any Intellectual Property
owned or licensed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, which would reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

     SECTION 4.18  MERGER SUB'S OPERATIONS.  Merger Sub has not incurred,
directly or indirectly, any liabilities or obligations, and has acquired no
assets of any kind, except those incurred or acquired in connection with its
incorporation or with the negotiation of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.  Merger Sub has been formed solely to
facilitate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and has not engaged,
directly or indirectly, in any business or activity of any type of kind, or
entered into any Agreement or arrangement with any person or entity, and is not
subject to or bound by any obligation or undertaking, that is not contemplated
by or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

     SECTION 4.19  TAX TREATMENT.  Neither Parent nor any of its affiliates has
taken or agreed to take any action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or
other circumstance that could (i) prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
"reorganization" under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code or (ii)
prevent the exchange of shares of Common Stock from meeting the requirements of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(1).

     SECTION 4.20   BROKERS OR FINDERS.  Except for CIBC World Markets Corp. and

has incurred any obligation or liability, contingent or otherwise, for brokers'

     SECTION 4.21   AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS.  Except as set forth in Parent
Public Documents filed prior to the date hereof or in Schedule 4.21 to this
Agreement, to the knowledge of Parent, there are no material contracts,
commitments, agreements, arrangements or other transactions between Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any (i) officer or director of

                                       66
<PAGE>

Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) any affiliate (as such term is defined
in Regulation 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of any such officer or
director, on the other hand.

     SECTION 4.22    CUSTOMERS.  Prior to the date hereof, Parent has provided
the Company a true and correct list of the top thirty (30) customers (as defined
by Parent) of Parent and its Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended December 31,
1999 and the six months ended June 30, 2000 and the total dollar amount of
services billed to such customers during such periods.  Except as set forth in
Schedule 4.21 to this Agreement, no customer included on the list provided as
set forth in the previous sentence has given written or oral notification to
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of its intent to cancel, terminate,
significantly reduce or otherwise suspend such relationship.

     SECTION 4.23  INVESTMENT COMPANY.  Neither Parent nor any of its
subsidiaries is an "investment company" as defined under the Investment Company
Act of 1940 and neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors any person
that is such an investment company.

     SECTION 4.24  STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING.  Based solely on the published
listing rules and standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market and the Nouveau Marche,
respectively, as of the date of this Agreement Parent does not know of any
reason why the ADSs to be issued in the Merger would not be approved for listing
on the Nasdaq Stock Market or why the underlying Parent Shares would not be
listed on the Nouveau Marche.

     SECTION 4.25    FORM F-4.  The Parent is a "foreign private issuer" as that
term is defined in Rule 3b-4 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is
qualified to use Form F-4 to register the offering of securities

                                       67
<PAGE>

contemplated hereunder. Based solely on the Securities Act and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC as of the date of this Agreement, and with
reference solely to the information required to be included or incorporated by
reference in the Form F-4 with regard to Parent and Merger Sub, Parent, after
consulting with its professional and financial advisors, has no reason to
believe that Parent cannot file the Form F-4 in conformity with the Securities
Act or that the Form F-4 could not be declared effective within six months of
the date of execution of this Agreement.

     SECTION 4.26    OWNERSHIP OF CAPITAL STOCK.  To the knowledge of Parent,
neither Parent nor any of its affiliates beneficially owns, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock of the Company or is a party to any agreement,
arrangement or understanding or the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or
disposing or any capital stock of the Company.

                            COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

     SECTION 5.1   CONDUCT OF THE BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY.  From the date hereof
until the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall conduct their
businesses in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and shall use
all reasonable efforts to preserve intact their business organizations and
relationships with third parties and to keep available the services of their
present officers and employees. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, from the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Company will not
(and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to) take any action or omit to take
any action that would (i) make any of its representations and warranties
contained herein false to an extent that would cause the condition set forth in
Section 6.3(b) not to be satisfied or (ii) make the representation and warranty
set forth in Section 3.10 false.

                                       68
<PAGE>

Furthermore, for the avoidance of doubt, from the date of this Agreement until
the Effective Time, the Company will not take any of the actions specified in
Section 3.10 (as modified by the schedules to this Agreement that are applicable
to the Company) without the prior consent of Parent. Unless it has already done
so prior to the date hereof, as soon as practicable after the execution of this
Agreement the Company shall terminate its exchange offer for its outstanding
High Yield Notes.

     SECTION 5.2 CONDUCT OF THE BUSINESS OF PARENT.  From the date hereof until
the Closing Date, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall conduct their businesses in
the ordinary course consistent with past practice and shall use all reasonable
efforts to preserve intact their business organizations and relationships with
third parties and keep available the services of their present officers and
employees.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from the date
hereof until the Closing Date, Parent will not (and will not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to) take any action or omit to take any action that would make any
of its representations and warranties contained herein false to an extent that
would cause the condition set forth in Section 6.2(b) not to be satisfied.
Furthermore, for the avoidance of doubt, from the date of this Agreement until
the Effective Time, Parent will not take any of the actions specified in Section
4.09 (as modified by the schedules to this Agreement that are applicable to
Parent) without the prior consent of the Company, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

     SECTION 5.3  SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING; PROXY MATERIAL.

          (a) Subject to the last sentence of this Section 5.3(a), the Company
shall, in accordance with applicable law and the Articles of Organization and
the by-laws of the Company, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the "Special Meeting") as
                                  ---------------

                                       69
<PAGE>

promptly as practicable after the effective date of the Form F-4 for the purpose
of considering and taking action upon this Agreement and the Merger. The
Company's Special meeting shall be scheduled and, if necessary, adjourned as
appropriate so that the vote of the Company's stockholders necessary to approve
this Agreement and the Merger occurs as nearly as may be practicable
concurrently with the vote by Parent's shareholders referred to in Section
5.14(a) hereof. The Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend approval
and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the Company's stockholders;
provided, however, that the Board of Directors of the Company may withdraw,
--------  -------
modify or change such recommendation if but only if prior to approval of the
Merger by the stockholders of the Company (i) the Board of Directors believes in
good faith that a Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 5.5 hereof) has been
made that was not solicited or encouraged in violation of this Agreement, (ii)
it has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel
(who may be its regularly engaged outside counsel), that the failure to
withdraw, modify or change such recommendation is likely to constitute a breach
of its fiduciary duties under applicable law and (iii) the Company gives Parent
three business days' prior written notice of its intention to do so. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies
in favor of the approval of this Agreement and to take all other action
necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of stockholders required by
the Massachusetts BCL to obtain such approval, except to the extent that the
Board of Directors of the Company has changed its recommendation to the
stockholders of the Company with respect to the Merger and this Agreement in
accordance with this Section 5.3(a).

          (b)  The Proxy Statement shall include the recommendation of the Board
of Directors of the Company to the stockholders of the Company in favor of
approval of the Merger and this Agreement; provided, however, that the Board of
                                           --------  -------
Directors of the Company may, prior to the Effective Time, withdraw,

                                       70
<PAGE>

modify or change any such recommendation to the extent that the Board of
Directors of the Company has changed its recommendation to the shareholders of
the Company with respect to the Merger and this Agreement in accordance with
Section 5.3(a).

          (c) Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall
prepare a proxy statement relating to the adoption of this Agreement and the
approval of the Merger by the Company's stockholders (the "Proxy Statement").
                                                           ---------------
Parent shall also file the Parent Listing Prospectus with the COB with a view to
having the Parent Shares underlying the ADSs to be issued in the Merger listed
as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date.  Parent and the Company
shall cooperate (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to cooperate)
with each other in connection with the preparation of the foregoing documents
and shall furnish all information concerning such party as the other party may
reasonably request in connection with the preparation of such documents.  Parent
and the Company shall file the Proxy Statement, in preliminary form on a
confidential basis, if possible, with the SEC as promptly as reasonably
practicable and Parent shall file the Form F-4 with the SEC as soon as
reasonably practicable after any SEC comments with respect to the preliminary
Proxy Statement are resolved.  If permitted by the rules and regulations of the
SEC, and if the Company shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants are
currently registered or required to be registered, the Form F-4 will register
the Parent ADSs to be issued upon exercise of any Warrants after the Effective
Time or, if such rules and regulations do not so permit, Parent shall,
concurrently with filing the Form F-4 or as soon thereafter as is practicable,
file a separate registration statement with the SEC on Form F-1 or such other
form as may be available for this purpose to register such underlying Parent
ADSs.  In the event that Parent is required to file such separate registration
statement, all the provisions of this Agreement that apply to the Form F-4
(including this Section 5.3(c)) shall also apply to the separate registration
statement to

                                       71
<PAGE>

the greatest extent possible. Each of Parent and the Company shall use all
reasonable efforts to have the Form F-4 declared effective under the Securities
Act as promptly as practicable after such filing. The Company shall use all
reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's
stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Form F-4 is declared effective
under the Securities Act. Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain the
visa of the COB on the Parent Listing Prospectus as soon as practicable.

    (d) Each of Parent and the Company shall as promptly as practicable notify
the other of (i) the effectiveness of the Form F-4, (ii) the filing of any
amendment or supplement thereto, (iii) the receipt of any comments from the SEC
relating to the Form F-4 or the Proxy Statement, (iv) any request by the SEC or
the COB for any amendment to the Form F-4 or for additional information, (v) the
issuance of any "stop order" or (vi) any suspension of the qualification of the
ADSs.  All filings by Parent and the Company with the SEC in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Proxy Statement, the Form F-4
and any amendment or supplement thereto, shall be subject to the prior review of
the other, and all mailings to the Company's stockholders in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be subject to the prior review
of Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form F-4 or the
Company Proxy Statement shall be made by Parent or Merger Sub without providing
the Company with the opportunity to review and comment thereon.

     (e) Each of Parent and the Company agree that if it should become aware
prior to the Effective Time of any information furnished by it that would cause
any of the statements in the Proxy Statement or the Form F-4 to be false or
misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to
promptly inform the other party thereof and to take the necessary steps to
correct the Proxy Statement or the Form F-4.

date of this Agreement) shall be held in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect pursuant to the terms

inquires with respect thereto) or has advised the Company that it is interested
in making an Acquisition Proposal or (c) enter into any agreement, arrangement
or understanding requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that,
                                                                 -------------
the foregoing shall not prohibit the Company, prior to the approval of the
Merger by the Company's stockholders, (a) from complying with Rule 14e-2 and
Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act with regard to a bona fide tender offer or
exchange offer or (b) from providing information in response to an Acquisition
Proposal from any Person that did not arise or result from a breach of this
Section 5.5 by the Company and conducting negotiations regarding such
Acquisition Proposal, if and only if (i) the Company's Board of Directors
determines in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal
(as defined hereafter) and (ii)

                                       74
<PAGE>

the Company's Board of Directors determines in good faith that the failure to
engage in such negotiations or provide such information is likely to result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, provided further that the
                                                     ---------------------
Company will not disclose any information to such Person without (i) first

or other business combination involving the Company or the acquisition or
purchase of 25% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company, or any

would result in any Person beneficially owning 25% or more of any class of
equity securities of the Company, or 25% or more of the assets of, the Company
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether as a result of a single
transaction or a series of related transactions, or any solicitation in

                                       75
<PAGE>

reasonably likely to result in a transaction that is more favorable to the
Company's stockholders than those provided pursuant to this Agreement (including
any adjustment to the terms and conditions proposed by Parent and Merger Sub in
response to such Acquisition Proposal), and (ii) is reasonably capable of being
financed by the Person making such Proposal on a timely basis. Nothing contained
in this Section 5.5 shall prohibit the Company or the Company's Board of
Directors from making any disclosure required by applicable law. The Company
immediately shall cease and cause to be ceased all existing activities,
discussions and negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal and request the return of all confidential
information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries provided to such party
prior to the date hereof. The Company agrees not to release any third party
from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to
which it is a party unless such third party has made a Superior Proposal.

(whether or not service of process has been made on an Indemnitee within such
three year period, all rights to indemnification shall continue until such claim
is disposed of or all judgments, orders, decrees or other rulings in connection
with such claim are fully satisfied.

          (c) For three years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall provide officers' and directors' liability insurance in
respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each
such Person currently covered by the Company's officers' and directors'

favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; provided,
                                                                  --------
however, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend
-------
more than an amount per year equal to 150% of current annual premiums paid by
the Company for such insurance (the "Maximum Amount") to maintain or procure
                                     --------------
insurance coverage pursuant hereto; provided, further, that if the amount of the
                                    --------  -------
annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds
the Maximum Amount, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain or procure, for
such three-year period, the most advantageous policies of directors' and
officers' insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum
Amount.

          (d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
Section 5.6 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.6 applies without the consent of
such affected Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom
this Section 5.6 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section
5.6).

     SECTION 5.7   COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS.  Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions of this Agreement, each party hereto shall use all reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or

                                       77
<PAGE>

cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
laws and regulations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

     SECTION 5.8  CERTAIN FILINGS.

          (b) The Company and Parent shall each use all reasonable efforts to
resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the Merger
or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law
(as defined below). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
none of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, shall be
required (and the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, agree, but shall, if so directed by Parent, agree) to hold separate or
divest any of their respective assets or operations or enter into any consent
decree or licensing or other arrangement with respect to any of their assets or
operations.

          (c) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly inform the other

               -------------
Act, as amended, EC Merger Regulations and all other federal, state and foreign
statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and judicial
doctrines, and other laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or
regulate competition or actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization
or restraint of trade.

release or other public announcement with respect to the Merger, this Agreement
or the other transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consent of the
other party, except that public disclosure may be made as may be required by law
or by any listing agreement with, or the policies of, a national securities
exchange following prior consultation with the other

                                       79

     SECTION 5.10  CERTAIN CONSENTS.  The Company shall obtain the consent of
any third party whose consent is required in connection with the Merger in order
to avoid the termination, cancellation or acceleration of any contract, license,
lease, agreement or similar instrument or obligation, except where the failure
to obtain such consent would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 5.11 EMPLOYEE MATTERS.

     (a) For a period of one year immediately following the date of the Closing,
Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to all active
employees of the Company who continue to be employed by the Company as of the
Effective Time ("Continuing Employees") coverage by benefit plans or
                 --------------------
arrangements that are, in the aggregate, substantially equivalent to (including,
with respect to eligibility requirements, exclusions and the employee portion of
the cost of such benefit plans or arrangements) those generally provided to the
employees of the U.S. Subsidiaries of Parent immediately prior to the date of
the Closing.  Parent shall take (or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
take) all steps necessary to ensure (to the extent permitted by law and by the
terms of such plans and arrangements) that Continuing Employees shall receive
credit, for all purposes under all such plans and arrangements, for their
service with the Company and, in the case of health and dental benefit plans,
for claims and expenses incurred by

                                       80
<PAGE>

them prior to the Closing Date that are properly taken into account under
similar existing Company plans.

          (b) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, honor in accordance with their terms all agreements, contracts,
arrangements, commitments and understandings described in Schedule 3.12(a) to
this Agreement, except as such agreements, contracts, arrangements, commitments
and understandings may be amended or waived with the consent of the applicable
employee.

          (c) The holders of Options have been or will be given by the Company,
or shall have properly waived, any required notice prior to the Merger and all
such rights to notice will be terminated at or prior to the Effective Time.
From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Company shall not (except
pursuant to binding agreements entered into in good faith prior to July 27,
2000) accelerate the vesting of any unvested options.

     SECTION 5.12 TAX-FREE REORGANIZATION TREATMENT.  Each of Parent and the
Company shall take all reasonable actions necessary to cause the Merger to
qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of section 368(a) of the Code,
the Parent and the Company each to be a party to the reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code, and the exchange of shares of Common
Stock pursuant to the Merger to meet the requirements of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(1) and to obtain the opinion of counsel referred to in
Section 6.2(d) hereof, and neither party will take any action inconsistent
therewith.  For the purposes of the tax opinion described in Section 6.2(d)
hereof, Parent and the Company shall provide representation letters
substantially in the form of Exhibits C and D, respectively, each dated and
executed on or about the date that is two business days prior to the date the
Proxy Statement is mailed to the stockholders of the Company and dated and
executed on the Closing Date.  Each of Parent and the Company and each of their
respective affiliates shall not take any action, shall not fail

                                       81
<PAGE>

to take any action, cause any action to be taken or not taken, or suffer to
exist any condition, which action or failure to take action or condition would
prevent, or would be reasonably likely to prevent, the Merger from qualifying as
a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

     SECTION 5.13  SUPPLEMENTAL WARRANT AGREEMENT.  On or before the Closing
Date, Parent and Merger Sub shall (as provided in Section 5.1(b) of the Warrant
Agreement) enter into an agreement supplemental to the Warrant Agreement,
complying with the requirements of Section 5.01(b) of the Warrant Agreement in
connection with the Merger.

     SECTION 5.14  PARENT SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING.

          (a) Subject to the last sentence of this Section 5.14(a), Parent
shall, in accordance with applicable law and the bylaws (statuts) of Parent,
                                                         -------
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold an extraordinary general meeting of
its shareholders (the "EGM") for the purpose of approving the issuance of the
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger as
promptly as practicable after the effective date of the Form F-4.  The Board of
Directors of Parent shall recommend approval of such issuance by the Parent's
shareholders; provided, however, that the Board of Directors of Parent may
              --------  -------
withdraw, modify or change such recommendation if but only if the Parent's Board
of Directors believes in good faith, based on such matters as it deems relevant,
that it is more likely than not that the Company will fail to satisfy one of the
conditions to the Parent's obligations set forth in Section 6.1 or 6.3 of this
Agreement.  Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain the vote or
consent of its shareholders in favor of the approval of such issuance and to
take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of
shareholders required under French law and its constituent instruments to obtain
such approval, except to the extent

                                       82
<PAGE>

that the Board of Directors of Parent has changed its recommendation to the
shareholders of Parent in accordance with this Section 5.14(a).

     (b) Promptly following the date of this Agreement, Parent shall prepare a
report of its Board of Directors to be submitted to the EGM. Parent and the
Company shall cooperate with each other in connection with the preparation of
such report and shall furnish all information concerning such party as the other
party may reasonably request in connection with the preparation thereof.  Parent
shall use all reasonable efforts to cause such report to be made available to
its shareholders within the periods required by the French Commercial Code.

     SECTION 5.15  LISTING.  Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to (i)
obtain approval for listing and trading of Parent's ADSs on the Nasdaq Stock
Market (subject to approval of issuance of the underlying Parent Shares by the
shareholders of Parent as provided in Section 5.14 hereof and subject to notice
of official issuance thereof) simultaneously with the Form F-4 being declared
effective by the SEC, (ii) cause the ADSs to be issued in the Merger to be
listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, subject to notice of official issuance
thereof, prior to the Closing Date, and (iii) cause the underlying Parent Shares
to be listed on the Nouveau Marche as soon as practicable after the Closing
Date.  In connection with the establishment of its ADS program and the issuance
of Parent's ADRs as provided herein, Parent shall enter into a depositary
agreement providing for a "Level III" depositary program (not involving a
concurrent offering of equity securities for cash consideration) with an ADR
depositary who shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, it being
understood that any of Bank of New York, Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New
York and Citibank, N.A. are acceptable to the Company for this purpose.

     SECTION 5.16  STATE TAKEOVER LAWS.  If any "fair price," "business
combination" or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute or
regulation is or may become applicable to the Merger, the Company and Parent
shall each use all reasonable efforts to permit the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of
any such statute or regulation on the Merger.

     SECTION 5.17   CERTAIN NOTIFICATIONS.  Between the date hereof and the
Effective Time, each party shall promptly notify the other party hereto in
writing after becoming aware of the occurrence of any event which will, or is
reasonably likely to, result in the failure to satisfy any of the conditions
specified in Article VI.

     SECTION 5.18 POOLING.  From and after the date of this Agreement and until
the Effective Time, neither Parent nor the Company, nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries or other affiliates, shall knowingly take any action, or knowingly
fail to take any action, that is reasonably likely to jeopardize the treatment
of the Merger as a "pooling of interests" for either French or U.S. accounting
purposes. Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, Parent and
the Company each shall use their reasonable efforts to cause the
characterization of the Merger as a "pooling of interests" for both French and
U.S. accounting purposes if such a characterization were jeopardized by action
taken by Parent or the Company, respectively, prior to the Effective Time;
provided, however, that in connection therewith, neither Parent nor the Company
--------  -------
shall be obligated to pay any consideration to, or assume any liability of, any
third party as to whom such efforts may be addressed.

judgment, is or is reasonably likely to be deemed, at the time of the Special
Meeting, to be an "affiliate" of the Company (each, a "Company Affiliate"), as
that term is used in Rule 145 under the Securities Act or SEC Accounting Series
Releases 130 and 135; and (ii) Parent shall deliver to the Company a list
setting forth the names and addresses of each Person who, in Parent's reasonable
judgment, is or is reasonably likely to be deemed, at the time of the Special
Meeting, to be an "affiliate" of Parent (each, a "Parent Affiliate"), as that
term is used in Rule 145 under the Securities Act or SEC Accounting Series
Releases 130 and 135. The Company and Parent each shall furnish such information
and documents as the other may reasonable request for the purpose of reviewing
such list.  Each of the Company and Parent shall use its respective reasonable
best efforts to cause each person who is identified as a Company Affiliate or a
Parent Affiliate, as the case may be, on each of their respective lists to
execute and deliver to the Company and Parent a written agreement in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and Parent (collectively, the
"Affiliate Agreements") on or before the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement.

     SECTION 5.20 LETTERS OF ACCOUNTANTS.

          (a) Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered

     Section 5.21  VOTING AGREEMENTS.  Promptly following the date of this
Agreement, the Company, at the request of Parent and to the extent it may
lawfully do so, will solicit each director and executive officer of the Company
and each of its Material Stockholders (as defined hereafter) who is not
concurrently entering into a Voting Agreement to execute and deliver to the
Parent a Voting Agreement in the form of Exhibit E hereto with respect to all
shares of Common Stock which such person currently owns or has the right or
power to vote; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to
               --------  -------
undertake any such solicitation, if such solicitation would require the making
of any filings with the SEC prior to the date that the Form F-4 which is filed
with the SEC with respect to the Merger is declared effective by the SEC.  For
purposes of this Agreement, "Material Stockholder" means (a) John Hassett and
                             --------------------
each other Person or "group" of Persons (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3)

than five business days prior to the Special Meeting.

     SECTION 5.24  POST-CLOSING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  Within 45 days after the

               --------------

share of Common Stock shall be equal to the average of the Current Market Value

          (A) except as set forth in paragraph (B) below, if Parent has
     terminated the Agreement in one of the circumstances described in Section
     7.3(a)(i), on the third trading day after the payment obligation arises;

          (B) if Parent has terminated the Agreement pursuant to Section
     7.3(a)(i) after the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect
     to a Competing Company Transaction and such definitive agreement is
     thereafter terminated, on the third trading day following the date of such
     termination; and

          (C) if the Agreement has been terminated in one of the circumstances
     described in Section 7.3(a)(ii), on the third trading day following the
     expiration of twelve (12) months after the date of the Special Meeting or
     the date specified in Section 7.1(b), as the case may be; and

(ii) the "Current Market Value" of a share of Common Stock shall mean (A) if the
          --------------------
Common Stock is then traded on the AmEx, the closing price, regular way, of such
shares at the close of regular trading on such exchange on the relevant date;
(B) if the Common Stock is not then traded on the AmEx but has been traded on
another national securities exchange in the United States or on the Nasdaq
National Market for at least ten business days, the closing price, regular way,
of such shares at the close of regular trading on the principal exchange on
which such shares are then trading; (C) if the Common Stock is not so listed or
traded but has been quoted on a national over-the-counter market for at least
ten business days, the closing bid price of the Common Stock in such market; or
(D) otherwise, the value of the Common Stock as most recently determined as of a
date within the six months preceding the date of determination by the Board of
Directors of the Company, acting in good faith.

          On the date specified in the Company Notice as the Delivery Date, the
Company shall (i) deliver to Parent, free and clear of all Liens, a

                                       99

certificate or certificates, registered in the name of Parent (or such other
name or names as Parent may theretofore have specified by notice to the
Company), representing in the aggregate the number of shares of Common Stock
having a Deemed Value equal to the amount of the Termination Fee that the
Company has elected to pay by delivery of shares and (ii) enter into and deliver
to Parent a registration rights agreement with respect to such shares in
customary form undertaking to register such shares for public sale under the
Securities Act at the earliest practicable date. The Company shall make such
delivery at a location in New York City specified by Parent or, if none is
specified, at the offices of Parent's counsel specified in Section 8.1.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company elects to satisfy its
obligation to pay a Termination Fee in part but not in whole by delivery of
shares of Common Stock, it shall pay the portion of the Termination Fee payable
in immediately available funds on the date required by Section 7.3(b).

          (d) Except as provided otherwise in this Section 7.3, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses.

the executive officers of the Company or Parent, as the case may be.  Whenever

     SECTION 8.4  AMENDMENTS, MODIFICATION AND WAIVER.

Closing Date if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed,

waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided, that
                                                                 --------
after the adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company, no such
amendment shall be made except as allowed under applicable law.

          (b)  No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power
or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein
provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies
provided by law.

     SECTION 8.5  SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.  The provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns; provided that neither the Company nor Parent

may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
under this Agreement without the consent of the other parties hereto.

     SECTION 8.6  SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE.  The parties acknowledge and agree that
any breach of the terms of this Agreement would give rise to irreparable harm
for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy and accordingly the
parties agree that, in addition to any other remedies, each shall be entitled to
enforce the terms of this Agreement by a decree of specific

                                      103
<PAGE>

performance without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as
a remedy.

     SECTION 8.7  GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION.  (a) Except for the
approval, validity and effect of the Articles of Merger and the Merger provided
for herein, which shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance
with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, this Agreement shall be
governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State
of New York (regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflicts of laws of the State of New York) as to all matters,
including, but not limited to, matters of validity, construction, effect,
performance and remedies.

          (b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal
action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or for recognition and
enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof brought by the other party hereto
or its successors or assigns shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or any
New York State court sitting in New York City (and of the appropriate appellate
courts of each such court), and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect
to its property, generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the aforesaid courts.  Each of the parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees
not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any proceeding
relating to this Agreement (a) any claim that is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for any reason other than the failure to
lawfully serve process subject to this Section 8.7, (b) that it or its property
is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal
process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment
prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of
judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the

                                      104
<PAGE>

fullest extent permitted by applicable law, that (i) the suit, action or
proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue
of such suit, action or proceeding is improper and (iii) this Agreement, or the
subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Process in any
suit, action or proceeding may be served within or without the jurisdiction of
any of the aforesaid courts. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees
that service of process on it by notice as provided in Section 8.1 shall be
deemed effective service of process.

     SECTION 8.8  SEVERABILITY.  If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by a
court of competent jurisdiction, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated herein are not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable
of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner.

     SECTION 8.9  THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES.  This Agreement is solely for the
benefit of the Company and its successors and permitted assigns, with respect to
the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement, and for the
benefit of Parent and Merger Sub, and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, with respect to the obligations of the Company under this Agreement,
and this Agreement shall not, except to the extent necessary to enforce the
provisions of Article I and Section 5.6 hereof, be deemed to confer upon or give
to any other third party any remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of
action or other right.

                                      105

between the parties or any of them with respect to the subject matter hereof.

     SECTION 8.11 COUNTERPARTS; EFFECTIVENESS.  This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, with the

instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall
