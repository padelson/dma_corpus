 **ARTICLE III**

  

 **CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES**

  

 _Section 3.01. Consideration_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Main Street Stock and subject to Sections 3.04(c) and 3.05, the shares of
Main Street Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, with respect to each holder of record of such shares, will be
converted into the right to receive:  (a) 1.55 fully paid and nonassessable
shares of First Busey Common Stock (the _"Exchange Ratio"_ ), multiplied
by (b) the number of shares of Main Street Common Stock held by such
holder of record (such product, the _"Merger Consideration"_ ).

  

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 3.01 to the contrary, at the
Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger, each share of Main Street Common
Stock beneficially owned by First Busey (other than shares held in a trust,
fiduciary, or nominee capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted)
or held in Main Streets treasury will be canceled and no shares of First
Busey Stock or other consideration will be issued or paid in exchange
therefor.

  

 _Section 3.02. Cancellation of Shares_. At the Effective Time, the
shares of Main Street Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and
will automatically be canceled and will cease to exist. Certificates that
represented Main Street Common Stock before the Effective Time will be deemed
for all purposes to represent the number of shares of First Busey Common
Stock or cash into which they were converted pursuant to this Article III.

  



     

   



  

 _Section 3.03. Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers_. At the
Effective Time, holders of Main Street Common Stock will cease to be, and
will have no rights as, shareholders of Main Street, other than rights to (a)
receive any then unpaid dividend or other distribution with respect to such
Main Street Common Stock having a record date before the Effective Time and
(b) receive the Merger Consideration provided under this Article III. After
the Effective Time, there will be no transfers of shares of Main Street
Common Stock on the stock transfer books of Main Street or the Surviving
Corporation, and shares of Main Street Common Stock presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason will be canceled and exchanged in
accordance with this Article III.

  

 _Section 3.04. Exchange Procedures_. (a) As of the Effective Time and
as mutually agreed by First Busey and Main Street, First Busey will deposit
with First Busey, acting as its own transfer agent, or with a depository or
trust institution of recognized standing mutually selected by First Busey and
Main Street (in such capacity, the _"Exchange Agent"_ ), for the benefit of
the holders of certificates formerly representing shares of Main Street
Common Stock ( _"Old Certificates"_ ), (1) certificates or, at First Buseys
option, evidence of shares in book entry form, representing the number of
shares of First Busey Common Stock ( _"New Certificates"_ ) issuable to
holders of Old Certificates under this Article III and (2) cash payable
pursuant to Section 3.05 (the _"Exchange Fund"_ ).

  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, First Busey will send or cause to be
sent to each person who was a recordholder of Main Street Common Stock
immediately before the Effective Time transmittal materials, in form
reasonably acceptable to Main Street, for exchanging Old Certificates. Upon
surrender of an Old Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent
together with the transmittal materials, duly executed, and such other
documents as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require (including customary
indemnity if any of such certificates are lost, stolen, or destroyed), the
holder of such Old Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a certificate or other evidence representing that number of New
Certificates which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Old
Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article III
(after taking into account all shares of Main Street Common Stock then held
by such holder) and any check in respect of the dividends and for any
fractional shares that the shareholder will be entitled to receive, and the
Old Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest
will be paid on any such cash or other consideration deliverable pursuant to
this Article III.

  

(c) None of First Busey, Main Street or the Exchange Agent will be liable to
any former holder of Main Street Common Stock for any shares of First Busey
Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash
from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

  

(d) Each of First Busey and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder
of Main Street Common Stock such amounts as it may be required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by First Busey, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent,
as the case may be,

  



     

   



  

the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holders of Main Street Common Stock in respect of
which the deduction and withholding was made by First Busey, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

  

 _Section 3.05. Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision
hereof, no fractional shares of First Busey Common Stock and no certificates
or scrip therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in
the Merger; instead, First Busey will pay to each holder of Main Street
Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of First
Busey Common Stock (after taking into account all Old Certificates delivered
by such holder) an amount in cash (without interest) determined
by multiplying such fraction of a share of First Busey Common Stock by the
Market Price.

  

 _Section 3.06. Anti-Dilution Adjustments_. If First Busey changes (or
the First Busey Board sets a related record date that will occur before
the Effective Time for a change in) the number or kind of shares of First
Busey Common Stock outstanding by way of a stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization or similar
transaction, then the Exchange Ratio will be adjusted proportionately to
account for such change.

  

 _Section 3.07. Dissenting Shareholders_. Each Dissenting Share shall
not be converted into or represent a right to receive Merger Consideration
hereunder, and the holder thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as
are granted by Section 5/11.65 of the IBCA. Main Street shall give First Busey
prompt notice upon receipt by Main Street of any demand for payment pursuant
to Section 5/11.70 of the IBCA and of withdrawals of such notice and
any other instruments provided pursuant to applicable law (any shareholder
duly making such demand being hereinafter called a
_"Dissenting Shareholder"_ ), and First Busey shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demands. Any payments made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by
First Busey. If any Dissenting Shareholder shall effectively withdraw or lose
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) his or her right to dissent under
Section 5/11.65 of the IBCA, such holders shares of Main Street Common Stock
shall be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement.

  

 _Section 3.08. Effect on First Busey Stock_. Each share of First Busey
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will
remain outstanding.

  

 _Section 3.09. Stock Options_. (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of
any outstanding option to purchase shares of Main Street Common Stock under
the Main Street Stock Plans and any other Benefit Arrangement, whether vested
or unvested, exercisable or unexercisable (each, a _"Main Street Stock
Option"_ ), each Main Street Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior thereto shall be deemed to constitute an option (a _"New
Option"_ ) to purchase, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under the terms of the Main Street Stock Plan under which the Main Street
Stock Option was granted and the applicable award agreement thereunder,
taking into account the amendments to the Main Street Stock Options as
Previously Disclosed, such number of shares of First Busey Common Stock and
at such an exercise price per share determined as follows:

  



     

   



  

(1) _Number of Shares_. The number of shares of First Busey Common Stock
subject to a New Option shall be equal to the product of (A) the number of
shares of Main Street Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of the Main
Street Stock Option and (B) the Exchange Ratio, the product being rounded up
to the nearest whole share; and

  

(2) _Exercise Price_. The exercise price per share of First Busey Common
Stock purchasable upon exercise of a New Option shall be equal to (A) the
exercise price per share of Main Street Common Stock under the Main Street
Stock Option divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio, the quotient being rounded
down to the nearest cent.

  

For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing adjustments shall be effected in a
manner consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code.

  

(b) Before the Effective Time, Main Street, or the Main Street Board or an
appropriate committee thereof, shall take all action necessary on its part to
give effect to the provisions of Section 3.09(a) and shall take such other
actions reasonably requested by First Busey to give effect to the foregoing.
 Before the Effective Time, First Busey shall take all corporate
action necessary to reserve for future issuance a sufficient additional
number of shares of First Busey Common Stock to provide for the satisfaction
of its obligations with respect to the New Options.  As soon as practicable,
but in no event later than the Effective Time, First Busey shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate
form) with respect to the First Busey Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
the New Options and shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
contained therein) for so long as such New Options remain outstanding.

  

(c) Main Street and First Busey hereby agree that First Busey shall have the
right, at the Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger, to accelerate the
vesting and exercisability of each First Busey Stock Option that is
outstanding and unvested or unexercisable immediately prior thereto. Prior to
the Effective Time, First Busey, or the First Busey Board or an appropriate
committee thereof, may take all action necessary on its part to give effect
to the acceleration of vesting and exercisability of First Busey Stock
Options pursuant to this Section 3.09(c), including providing for any
amendments to documents or agreements entered into pursuant to any First
Busey Stock Plan.

litigation (other than routine claims for benefits in the Ordinary Course of
Business) relating to its Benefit Arrangements. Neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any of its Benefit
Arrangements that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as
of the date hereof, could subject it or any of its Subsidiaries to a Tax or
penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i)
of ERISA. Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or reasonably
expects to incur a Tax or penalty imposed by Section 4980F of the Code or

reasonably expected to be incurred by it or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan," within
the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained
by any of them, or the single-employer plan of any entity which is considered
one employer with it under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code
(an _"ERISA Affiliate"_ ). None of it, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its
ERISA Affiliates has contributed to a "multiemployer plan," within
the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA, at any time within the last
six years. No notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning of Section
4043 of ERISA for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived,
other than pursuant to Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation Reg. Section
4043.66, has been required to be filed for any of its Pension Plans or by any
of its ERISA Affiliates within the 12-month period ending on the date hereof.
No notices have been required to be sent to participants and beneficiaries or
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation under Section 302 or 4011 of ERISA
or Section 412 of the Code.

  

(4) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any of its
Benefit Arrangements have been timely made or if not required to be made as
of the date of this Agreement, have been reflected on its consolidated
financial statements included

  



     

   

in its Regulatory Filings. None of its Pension Plans or any single-employer
plan of any of its ERISA Affiliates has an "accumulated funding deficiency"
(whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or
Section 302 of ERISA and none of its ERISA Affiliates has an outstanding
funding waiver. Neither any Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of any
of its ERISA Affiliates has been required to file information pursuant to
Section 4010 of ERISA for the current or most recently completed plan year.
It is not reasonably anticipated that required minimum contributions to any
Pension Plan under Section 412 of the Code will be increased by application
of Section 412(l) of the Code. Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has
provided, or is required to provide, security to any of its Pension Plans or
to any single-employer plan of any of its ERISA Affiliates pursuant to
Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.

  

(5) Under each Pension Plan which is a single-employer plan, as of the last
day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the
actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities," within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the
actuarial assumptions contained in such Pension Plans most recent actuarial
valuation), did not exceed the then current value of the assets of such
Pension Plan, and there has been no change in the financial condition of such
Pension Plan since the last day of the most recent plan year.

  

(6) Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for retiree
health and life benefits under any Benefit Arrangement or collective
bargaining agreement. Either it or its Subsidiaries may amend or terminate
any such plan at any time without incurring any liability thereunder other
than in respect of claims incurred prior to such amendment or termination.

  

(7) There has been no amendment to, announcement by it or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, any Benefit Arrangement which would increase the expense of
maintaining such Benefit Arrangement above the level of the expense incurred
therefor for the most recent fiscal year. Except as Previously Disclosed,
neither its execution of this Agreement, the performance of its obligations
hereunder, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
termination of the employment of any of its employees within a specified time
of the Effective Time nor shareholder approval of the transactions covered by
this Agreement, will (A) limit its right, in its sole discretion,
to administer or amend in any respect or terminate any of its Benefit
Arrangements or any related trust, (B) entitle any of its employees or any
employees of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in severance
pay, or (C) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment
or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or
benefits under, including the acceleration of vesting or exercisability of
any Rights, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material
obligation pursuant to, any of its Benefit Arrangements. Without limiting
the foregoing, as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including as a result of the termination of
the employment of any of its employees within a specified time of the
Effective Time), neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries will be obligated to
make a payment to an individual that would be a "parachute payment" to a
"disqualified individual" as those terms are

  



     

   



  

defined in Section 280G of the Code, without regard to whether such payment
is reasonable compensation for personal services performed or to be performed
in the future.

  

(8) No additional Tax under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code has been or
is reasonably expected to be incurred by a participant in a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan (within the meaning of Section 409(A)(d)(1) of the
Code) of it or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

(n) _Taxes_. (1) All Tax Returns that are required to be filed (taking into
account any extensions of time within which to file) by or with respect to it
and its Subsidiaries have been duly, timely and accurately filed, (2) all
Taxes shown to be due on the Tax Returns referred to in clause (1) have been
paid in full, except with respect to matters contested in good faith and for
which adequate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP
(consistently applied in connection with the preparation of the audited
financial statements of First Busey and Main Street, as the case may be), (3)
all Taxes that it or any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to withhold from
amounts owing to any employee, creditor or third party have been paid over to
the proper Governmental Authority in a timely manner, to the extent due and
payable, and (4) no extensions or waivers of statutes of limitation have been
given by or requested in writing with respect to any of its U.S. federal
income taxes or those of its Subsidiaries. It has made provision in
accordance with GAAP (consistently applied in connection with the preparation
of the audited financial statements of First Busey and Main Street, as the
case may be), in the financial statements included in the Regulatory Filings
filed before the date hereof, for all Taxes that accrued on or before the end
of the most recent period covered by its Regulatory Filings filed before the
date hereof. As of the date hereof, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries
has any reason to believe that any conditions exist that could reasonably be
expected to prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. No Liens for Taxes exist
with respect to any of its assets or properties or those of its Subsidiaries,
except for statutory Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable or that are
being contested in good faith and reserved for in accordance with GAAP
(consistently applied in connection with the preparation of the
audited financial statements of First Busey and Main Street, as the case may
be). Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a party to any
distribution occurring during the two-year period prior to the date of this
Agreement in which the parties to such distribution treated the distribution
as one to which Section 355 of the Code applied, except for distributions
occurring among members of the same group of affiliated corporations filing a
consolidated federal income tax return.

  

(o) _Books and Records_.  Its books and records and those of its
Subsidiaries have been fully, properly and accurately maintained in all
material respects, and there are no material inaccuracies or discrepancies of
any kind contained or reflected therein.

  

(p) _Takeover Laws and Provisions_. It has taken all action required to be
taken by it in order to exempt this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby from, and this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby are exempt from, the

  



     

   



  

requirements of any "moratorium," "control share," "fair price," "affiliate
transaction," "business combination" or other antitakeover laws and
regulations of any state (collectively, _"Takeover Laws"_ ). It has taken all
action required to be taken by it in order to make this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby comply with, and this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby do comply with, the requirements of
any Articles, Sections or provisions of its Constituent Documents concerning
"business combination," "fair price," "voting requirement," "constituency
requirement" or other related provisions (collectively, _"Takeover
Provisions"_ ).

  

(q) _Financial Advisors_. None of it, its Subsidiaries or any of their
officers, directors or employees has employed any broker or finder or
incurred any liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finders fees
in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, except that, in
connection with this Agreement, First Busey has retained Keefe, Bruyette and
Woods, Inc. as its financial advisor and Main Street has retained Sandler
ONeill and Partners, L.P. as its financial advisor, the arrangements with each
of which have been disclosed to First Busey and Main Street prior to the date
hereof.

  

(r) _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_. It is in compliance with the provisions,
including Section 404, of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the certifications
provided and to be provided pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 thereof are
accurate.

  

(s) _Labor Matters_. Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to,
or is bound by, any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other
agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor is
it or any of its Subsidiaries the subject of a proceeding asserting that it
or any such subsidiary has committed an unfair labor practice (within the
meaning of the National Labor Relations Act) or seeking to compel it or such
Subsidiary to bargain with any labor organization as to wages and conditions
of employment, nor is there any strike or other labor dispute involving it or
any of its Subsidiaries, pending or, to the best of its knowledge,
threatened, nor it is aware, as of the date of this Agreement, of any
activity involving it or any of its Subsidiaries employees seeking
to certify a collective bargaining unit or engaging in any other
organization activity.

  

(t) _Environmental Matters_. There are no proceedings, claims, actions, or
investigations of any kind, pending or threatened, in any court, agency, or
other governmental authority or in any arbitral body, arising under any
Environmental Law; there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding,
claim, action or investigation; there are no agreements, orders, judgments or
decrees by or with any Governmental Authority, imposing liability or
obligation under or in respect of any Environmental Law; there are and have
been no Materials of Environmental Concern or other conditions at any
property (owned, operated, or otherwise used by, or the subject of a security
interest on behalf of, it or any of its subsidiaries); and there are no
reasonably anticipated future events, conditions, circumstances, practices,
plans, or legal requirements that could give rise to obligations
or liabilities under any Environmental Law.

 **ARTICLE VI**

  

 **COVENANTS**

  

 _Section 6.01. Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, First Busey and Main Street will use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, in good faith, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
desirable, or advisable under applicable laws, so as to permit consummation
of the Merger as promptly as practicable and otherwise to enable consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, and each will cooperate fully with,
and furnish information to, the other party to that end.

  

 _Section 6.02. Shareholder Approvals_. (a) The Main Street Board
approved this Agreement and the plan of merger it contains and
the transactions contemplated hereby, and adopted resolutions recommending as
of the date hereof to Main Streets shareholders approval and adoption of the
plan of merger contained in this Agreement and any other matters required to
be approved or adopted in order to effect the Merger and other
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(b) The First Busey Board approved this Agreement and the plan of merger it
contains and the transactions contemplated hereby, and adopted resolutions
recommending as of the date hereof to First Buseys shareholders the approval
and adoption of the plan of merger contained in this Agreement, the issuance
of shares of First Busey Common Stock necessary to effect the Merger and any
other matters required to be approved or adopted in order to effect the
Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(c) The First Busey Board and Main Street Board each will submit to its
shareholders all matters required to be approved or adopted by shareholders
in order to carry out the intentions of this Agreement.  In furtherance of
that obligation, First Busey and Main Street each will take, in accordance
with applicable law and its respective Constituent Documents, all action
necessary to convene a meeting of its shareholders (including any adjournment
or postponement, the _"First Busey Meeting"_ and the _"Main Street Meeting,"_
 respectively), as promptly as practicable, to consider and vote upon
such matters. The First Busey Board and Main Street Board each will use all
reasonable best efforts to obtain from their respective shareholders a vote
approving the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including a
recommendation that its respective shareholders vote in favor of the approval
and adoption of this Agreement and the plan of merger contained herein and,
in the case of First Busey, approval of the issuance of the First Busey
Common Stock required for consummation of the Merger. However, if either of
the First Busey Board or the Main Street Board, after consultation with
outside counsel, determines in good faith that, because of the receipt after
the date of this Agreement of an Acquisition Proposal that either of the
First Busey Board or the Main Street Board, as applicable, concludes in good
faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, it would result in a violation of its
respective fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend the
plan of merger set forth in this Agreement, then in submitting the plan of
merger to the applicable First Busey Meeting or Main Street Meeting, such
board may submit the plan of merger to its shareholders without
recommendation (although the resolutions adopting this Agreement as of the
date hereof, described in Section 6.02, may not be rescinded or amended), in
which event the First Busey Board or Main Street Board, as applicable, may
communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to the

  



     

   



  

shareholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or
supplement thereto to the extent required by law; _provided_ that no party may
take any actions under this sentence until after giving the other party at
First Busey 5 business days to respond to any such Acquisition Proposal (and
after giving the other party notice of the latest material terms, conditions
and third party in the Acquisition Proposal) and then taking into account any
amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by the other party.

  

 _Section 6.03. SEC Filings_. (a) First Busey and Main Street will
cooperate in ensuring that all filings required under SEC Rules 165, 425
and 14a-12 are timely and properly made.  First Busey and Main Street also
will jointly prepare a registration statement on Form S-4 or other applicable
form (the _"Registration Statement"_ ) to be filed by First Busey with the
SEC in connection with the issuance of First Busey Common Stock in
the Merger, and the parties will jointly prepare the joint proxy statement
and prospectus and other proxy solicitation materials of First Busey and
Main Street constituting a part thereof (the _"Joint Proxy Statement"_ ) and
all related documents. Each party will cooperate, and will cause its
Subsidiaries to cooperate, with the other party, its counsel and its
accountants, in the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Joint
Proxy Statement, and, _provided_  that both parties and their respective
Subsidiaries have cooperated as required above, First Busey and Main Street
agree to file the Registration Statement, including the Joint Proxy Statement
in preliminary form, with the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable.
Each of First Busey and Main Street will use all reasonable best efforts to
cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after filing thereof and
to maintain the effectiveness of such Registration Statement until the
Effective Time. Each party shall cooperate and provide the other party with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement
to the Joint Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement prior to filing
such with the SEC, and each party will provide the other party with a copy of
all such filings with the SEC. First Busey also agrees to use reasonable best
efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky"
permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated
hereby. Each party agrees to furnish for inclusion in the Registration
Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement all information concerning it, its
Subsidiaries, officers, directors and shareholders as may be required by
applicable law in connection with the foregoing.

  

(b) First Busey and Main Street each agrees, as to itself and its
Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (1) the Registration Statement
will, at the time the Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement
thereto, if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading and (2) the Joint Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement
thereto will, at the date of mailing to shareholders and at the time of the
First Busey Meeting or the Main Street Meeting, as the case may be, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which such statement was made, not
misleading. First Busey and Main Street each further agrees that if it
becomes aware that any information furnished by it would cause any of the
statements in the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement to be
false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state
any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not

  



     

   



  

false or misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof and to take
appropriate steps to correct the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration
Statement.

  

(c) First Busey will advise Main Street, promptly after First Busey receives
notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become
effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of
any stop order or the suspension of the qualification of First Busey Common
Stock for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat
of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the
amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or for additional
information.

  

 _Section 6.04. Press Releases_. First Busey and Main Street will
consult with each other before issuing any press release, written
and broadly disseminated employee communication or other written
shareholder communication with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and will not issue any such communication
or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other
party, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ that
a party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after
prior consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances), issue
such communication or make such public statement as may be required by
applicable law or securities exchange rules. First Busey and Main Street
will cooperate to develop all public communications and make appropriate
members of management available at presentations related to the transactions
contemplated hereby as reasonably requested by the other party.

  

 _Section 6.05. Access; Information_. (a) Each of First Busey and Main
Street agrees that upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable
laws relating to the exchange of information, it will (and will cause
its Subsidiaries to) afford the other party, and the other partys
officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized
Representatives, such access during normal business hours throughout the
period before the Effective Time to the books, records (including Tax Returns
and work papers of independent auditors), properties, personnel and to such
other information as the other party may reasonably request and, during such
period, it will furnish promptly to the other party (1) a copy of each
report, schedule and other document filed by it pursuant to the requirements
of federal or state securities or banking laws, and (2) all other information
concerning the business, properties and personnel of it as the other may
reasonably request. Neither First Busey nor Main Street will be required to
afford access or disclose information that would jeopardize attorney-client
privilege or contravene any binding agreement with any third party. The
parties will make appropriate substitute arrangements in circumstances where
the previous sentence applies.

  

(b) Each party will hold any information which is nonpublic and confidential
to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the Confidentiality
Agreement between First Busey and Main Street (the _"Confidentiality
Agreement"_ ).

  

(c) No investigation by one party of the business and affairs of the other,
pursuant to this Section 6.05 or otherwise, will affect or be deemed to
modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this
Agreement, or the conditions to such other partys obligation to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



     

   



  

 _Section 6.06. Acquisition Proposals_. (a) Each of First Busey and Main
Street agrees that it will not, and will cause its respective Subsidiaries
and its and its Subsidiaries officers, directors, agents, advisors and
affiliates not to, initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate
inquiries or proposals with respect to, or engage in any negotiations
concerning, or provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to,
or have any discussions with, any person relating to, any Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_  that, in the event First Busey or Main Street receives
an unsolicited _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal, from a person other
than First Busey, Main Street, as applicable, or an Other Person (as defined
below), after the execution of this Agreement, and the applicable First Busey
Board or Main Street Board concludes in good faith that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be likely to
result in a Superior Proposal and, after considering the advice of outside
counsel, that failure to take such actions would result in a violation of the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable law, First Busey or Main Street,
as applicable, may, and may permit its respective Subsidiaries and its
respective Subsidiaries Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished
nonpublic information and participate in such negotiations or discussions;
_provided_ that prior to providing any nonpublic information permitted to be
provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, it shall have entered into a
confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to
it than the Confidentiality Agreement. Each party will immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted
before the date of this Agreement with any persons other than First Busey or
Main Street, as applicable ( _"Other Persons"_ ) with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any
confidentiality or similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal.
Each party will within one business day advise the other party following
receipt of any Acquisition Proposal and the substance thereof (including the
identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal), and will keep the
other party apprised of any related developments, discussions and
negotiations (including the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition
Proposal) on a current basis.

  

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Main Street or the Main
Street Board or First Busey or the First Busey Board from complying with Rule
14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal, _provided_  that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the
effect that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this
Agreement.

  

 _Section 6.07. Affiliate Agreements_. Not later than the 15th
day before the mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement, Main Street will deliver
to First Busey a schedule of each person that, to the best of its knowledge,
is or is reasonably likely to be, as of the date of the Main Street Meeting,
deemed to be an "affiliate" of Main Street (each, a _"Main
Street Affiliate"_ ) as that term is used in Rule 145 under the Securities
Act. Main Street will use its reasonable best efforts to cause each person
who may be deemed to be a Main Street Affiliate to execute and deliver to
First Busey and Main Street on or before the date of mailing of the Joint
Proxy Statement an agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as
Annex 3.

  

 _Section 6.08. Takeover Laws and Provisions_. No party will take any
action that would cause the transactions contemplated hereby to be subject
to requirements imposed by any Takeover Law and each of them will take all
necessary steps within its control to exempt (or

  



     

   



  

ensure the continued exemption of) those transactions from, or if necessary
challenge the validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law, as
now or hereafter in effect. No party will take any action that would cause
the transactions contemplated hereby not to comply with any
Takeover Provisions and each of them will take all necessary steps within its
control to make those transactions comply with (or continue to comply with)
the Takeover Provisions.

  

 _Section 6.09. Exchange Listing_. First Busey will use all reasonable
best efforts to cause the shares of First Busey Common Stock to be issued in
the Merger and shares reserved for issuance pursuant to Section 3.07 hereof
to be approved for listing on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance,
as promptly as practicable, and in any event before the Effective Time.

  

 _Section 6.10. Regulatory Applications_. (a) First Busey and
Main Street and their respective Subsidiaries will cooperate and
use reasonable best efforts to prepare as promptly as possible all
documentation, to effect all filings and to obtain all permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Authorities necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Bank Merger (the  _"Requisite Regulatory Approvals"_ ),
and will make all necessary filings in respect of those Requisite
Regulatory Approvals as soon as practicable. Each of First Busey and Main
Street will have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult with the other, in each case subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, with respect to
all written information submitted to any third party or any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Requisite Regulatory Approvals. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties will act reasonably and
as promptly as practicable. Each party agrees that it will consult with the
other party with respect to obtaining all material permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and each party will keep the other party apprised of the
status of material matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

(b) First Busey and Main Street will, upon request, furnish the other party
with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such other party or any of its Subsidiaries with or to any third
party or Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

 _Section 6.11. Indemnification_. (a) Following the Effective Time,
First Busey will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former
directors, officers and employees of Main Street and its Subsidiaries (each,
an _"Indemnified Party"_ ) against all costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and settlement amounts (collectively, _"Costs"_ ) as incurred, in
connection with any claim, action (whether threatened, pending or
contemplated), suit, proceeding or investigation, whether arising before or
after the Effective Time and whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or actions or
omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated hereby), (and shall advance expenses as incurred to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable law provided the Indemnified
Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not
entitled to indemnification) to the same extent as

  



     

   

such persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses
pursuant to the Constituent Documents and indemnification agreements, if any,
in effect on the date of this Agreement with Main Street and its
Subsidiaries.

  

(b) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, First Busey will
obtain and maintain directors and officers liability insurance that serves
to reimburse, and covers, the present and former officers and directors of
Main Street or any of their respective Subsidiaries (determined as of the
Effective Time) (as opposed to Main Street or such Subsidiary) with respect
to claims against such directors and officers arising from facts or events
occurring before the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated
hereby), which insurance will contain at least the same coverage and amounts,
and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified
Party, as that coverage provided under the directors and officers liability
insurance that Main Street currently maintains for such directors and
officers; _provided_ that officers and directors of Main Street or any
Subsidiary may be required to make application and provide customary
representations and warranties to First Buseys insurance carrier for the
purpose of obtaining such insurance. Notwithstanding any other provision
contained in this Section 6.11(b), in no event shall First Busey be obligated
to expend, in order to maintain or provide insurance coverage pursuant to
this Section 6.11(b), any aggregate amount in excess of 200% of the amount of
the most recent annual premium paid as the date of this Agreement by Main
Street for such insurance (the _"Maximum Amount"_ ). If the amount of the
aggregate premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance
coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, First Busey shall use all reasonable
efforts to maintain the most advantageous policies of directors and
officers insurance obtainable for an aggregate premium equal to the Maximum
Amount.

  

(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
6.11(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation described above, will promptly notify First Busey; _provided_
that failure so to notify will not affect the obligations of First Busey
under Section 6.11(a) unless and only to the extent that First Busey is
actually and materially prejudiced as a consequence.

  

(d) If First Busey or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or
merges into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of
such consolidation or merger or transfers all or substantially all of its
assets to any other entity, then and in each case, First Busey will cause
proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of First Busey
will assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.11.

  

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.11 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and Representatives.

  

 _Section 6.12. Employee Matters_. (a) From the Effective Time through
the date that First Busey determines to generally combine First Buseys
and Main Streets Benefit Arrangements into the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries (such date being referred to herein as the
_"Benefits Transition Date"_ ), First Busey shall provide the employees of
First Busey and its Subsidiaries as of

  



     

   



  

the Effective Time and the employees of Main Street and its Subsidiaries as
of the Effective Time (collectively the _"Covered Employees"_ ) with employee
benefits and compensation plans, programs and arrangements that are
substantially similar, in the aggregate, (1) with respect to First Busey
employees, to the employee benefits and compensation plans, programs and
arrangements provided by First Busey or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
to such employees immediately prior to the Effective Time and (2) with
respect to Main Street employees, to the employee benefits and compensation
plans, programs and arrangements provided by Main Street or its Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, to such employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time.  From and after the Benefits Transition Date, First Busey shall
provide the Covered Employees with the same employee benefits and
compensation plans, programs and arrangements, in all material respects.

  

(b) From and after the Benefits Transition Date, First Busey shall (1)
provide all Covered Employees with service credit for purposes of
eligibility, participation, vesting and levels of benefits (but not for
benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan), under any employee
benefit or compensation plan, program or arrangement adopted, maintained or
contributed to by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries in

 **FORM OF MAIN STREET AFFILIATE LETTER**

  

_________, 2006

  

First Busey Corporation 
 201 Main Street Main Street 
 Urbana, Illinois 61801

  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  

I have been advised that I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Main
Street Trust, Inc. (" _Main Street_ "), as that term is defined for purposes
of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 promulgated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the " _Securities Act_ "). I understand that pursuant to the terms
of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September __, 2006 (as
amended or modified from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_ "), between
First Busey Corporation ( _"First Busey")_ and Main Street, Main Street plans
to merge with and into First Busey (the " _Merger_ "). Capitalized terms used
herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings assigned to them in
the Merger Agreement.

  

I further understand that as a result of the Merger, I may receive common
stock of First Busey (such shares received by the undersigned as a result of
the Merger are herein after referred to as the " _First Busey Common Stock_
") in exchange for shares of common stock of Main Street (the " _Main Street
Common Stock_ ").

  

I have carefully read this letter and reviewed the Merger Agreement and
discussed their requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability
to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of First Busey Common Stock and Main
Street Common Stock, to the extent I felt necessary, with my counsel or
counsel for Main Street.

  

I represent, warrant and covenant with and to First Busey that in the event
I receive any First Busey Common Stock as a result of the Merger:

  

1. I will not make any sale, transfer, or other disposition of such First Busey Common Stock unless (a) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Securities Act, (b) such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 under the Securities Act, or (c) in the opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to First Busey, or under a "no-action" letter obtained by me from the staff of the SEC, such sale, transfer or other disposition will not violate or is otherwise exempt from registration under the Securities Act.

  

2. I understand that First Busey is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of shares of First Busey Common Stock by me or on my behalf under the Securities Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make 

    

   



  

compliance with an exemption from such registration available, except the
obligation to file reports pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as more fully described below.

  

3. I understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to First Buseys transfer agent with respect to the shares of First Busey Common Stock issued to me as a result of the Merger and that there will be placed on the certificates for such shares, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:

  

"The shares represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction to
which Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, applies. The
shares represented by this certificate may be transferred only in accordance
with the terms of a letter agreement dated ________, 2006 between the
registered holder hereof and First Busey, a copy of which agreement is on
file at the principal offices of First Busey."

  

4. I understand that, unless transfer by me of the First Busey Common Stock issued to me as a result of the Merger has been registered under the Securities Act or such transfer is made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d) under the Securities Act, First Busey reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to place the following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee:

  

"The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under
the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who received such
shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 under the Securities Act of
1933 applies. The shares have been acquired by the holder not with a view
to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within the
meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be offered, sold, pledged
or otherwise transferred except in accordance with an exemption from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933."

  

I understand and agree that the legends set forth in paragraph 3 or 4
above, as the case may be, will be removed by delivery of substitute
certificates without such legend if I deliver to First Busey (a) a copy of a
"no-action" letter from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion of counsel in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to First Busey, to the effect that
such legend is not required for purposes of the Securities Act, or (b)
evidence or representations reasonably satisfactory to First Busey that First
Busey Common Stock represented by such certificates is being or has been sold
in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d) under the Securities Act
or pursuant to an effective registration under the Securities Act.

  

By its acceptance hereof, First Busey agrees, to the extent required by
applicable law, for a period of two years after the Effective Time, that it,
as the Surviving Corporation, will file on a timely basis all reports
required to be filed by it pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

  



     

   



  

By signing this letter agreement, without limiting or abrogating the
agreements that I have made as set forth above, I do not admit that I am an
"affiliate" of Main Street within the meaning of the Securities Act or the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and I do not waive any right
that I may have to object to any assertion that I am an affiliate.

  

For the convenience of the parties hereto, this Agreement may be executed in
one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all
of which together shall constitute one and the same document. This Agreement
shall be enforceable by, and shall inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon, the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.
As used herein, the term "successors and assigns" shall mean, where the
context so permits, heirs, executors, administrators, trustees and successor
trustees, and personal and other representatives. This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of Illinois. If a court of competent jurisdiction
determines that any provision of this Agreement is not enforceable or
enforceable only if limited in time and/or scope, this Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect with such provision stricken or so limited.
This Agreement shall not be modified or amended, or any right hereunder
waived or any obligation excused, except by a written agreement signed by
both parties.

  

This letter agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of Illinois. This letter agreement shall terminate if
and when the Merger Agreement is terminated according to its terms.

  

Accepted this ___ day of _________, 2006
