 **ARTICLE III 
 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER**

  

Section 3.1 _Effects of the Merger on Company Securities_.

  

At the Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the Company or the holders of any capital stock of the Company
(other than the requisite approval of the Merger by the shareholders of the
Company in accordance with the WBCA):

  

(a) Each Company Common Share that is owned by Parent or MergerCo immediately
prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired and shall
cease to exist, without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution
shall be made with respect thereto.

  

(b) Each Company Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Merger Effective Time (other than Company Common Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 3.1(a)), shall be converted and exchanged
automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $14.38 per
Company Common Share (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") payable to the holder
thereof in accordance with Section 3.3. The Company Common Shares that are
to be so converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration are
referred to herein as the " _Merger Shares_."

  

(c) Immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, each outstanding
qualified or nonqualified option to purchase Company Common Shares ("
_Company Stock Options_ ") under any employee or director share option or
compensation plan or arrangement of the Company (collectively, " _Incentive
Plans_ ") shall become fully vested and exercisable or payable, as the case
may be (whether or not then vested or subject to any performance condition
that has not been satisfied, and regardless of the exercise price thereof).
At the Merger Effective Time, each Company Stock Option not theretofore
exercised shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive an amount
in cash equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the Merger Consideration over
(ii) the exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option, multiplied by
the total number of Company Common Shares subject to such Company Stock
Option (the " _Company Option Consideration_ ") without interest and less any
applicable Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with Section 3.4 with
respect to such payment. Payment of the Company Option Consideration shall be
made as soon as practicable after the Merger Effective Time.

  

(d) All restricted share awards, whether time-based or performance-based ("
_Company Restricted Shares_ ") granted pursuant to the Incentive Plans or
otherwise that remain unvested, automatically shall become fully vested and
free of any forfeiture or holding restrictions or performance or other
conditions immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, and each Company
Restricted Share shall be considered an outstanding Company Common Share for
all purposes of this Agreement, including the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.

  

(e) At the Merger Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or
accrued, to receive Company Common Shares or benefits measured in whole or in
part by the value of a number of Company Common Shares granted under the
Incentive Plans or otherwise (including performance shares, restricted stock,
restricted stock units, phantom units, deferred stock units

       

and dividend equivalents) other than Company Stock Options and Company
Restricted Shares (each, other than Company Restricted Shares and Company
Stock Options, " _Company Stock-Based Awards_ "), whether vested or unvested,
which is outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall
cease to represent a right or award with respect to Company Common Shares,
shall become fully vested and free of any forfeiture or holding restrictions
or performance or other conditions and shall entitle the holder thereof to
receive, at the Merger Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the Merger
Consideration in respect of each Company Common Share underlying a particular
Company Stock-Based Award less such amounts as are required to be withheld or
deducted under the Code or any provision of U.S. state or local tax law with
respect to the making of such payment and less any payments required to be
made by the holder pursuant to the terms of such Company Stock-Based Award.

  

(f) Without in any way limiting the covenants set forth in Article 6 below,
if at any time between the date of this Agreement and the Merger Effective
Time any change in the number of outstanding shares of Company Shares shall
occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
stock distribution with a record date during such period, the amount of the
Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.1(a) shall be equitably
adjusted to reflect such change.

  

Section 3.2 _Effects of the Merger on MergerCo Securities_.

  

At the Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
by the MergerCo or Parent, as the holder of all outstanding capital stock of
MergerCo (other than the requisite approval by Parent as a shareholder of
MergerCo in accordance with the WBCA, which approval has been obtained), each
outstanding common share, no par value, of MergerCo issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be converted into and
become one fully paid and nonassessable common share, no par value, of the
Surviving Corporation.

  

Section 3.3 _Payment of Merger Consideration; Stock Transfer Books_.

  

(a) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall appoint as paying agent
a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "
_Company Paying Agent_ "). Immediately following completion of the Merger and
the cancellation of the Company Stock Options, Parent shall deposit or cause
the Surviving Corporation to deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Company Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Merger Shares,
Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares, and Company Stock-Based
Awards, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration required to be paid (such cash being hereinafter referred to as
the " _Surviving Corporation Fund_ ") and to cause the Company Paying Agent
to make, and the Company Paying Agent shall make, payments of the Merger
Consideration out of the Surviving Corporation Fund to the holders of Merger
Shares, Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares, and Company Stock-
Based Awards in accordance with this Agreement. The Surviving Corporation
Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent in (i) direct obligations of the
United States of America, (ii) obligations for which the full faith and
credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for payment of
all principal and interest or (iii) commercial paper obligations receiving
the highest rating from either Moodys

       

Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors, a division of The McGraw Hill
Companies, or a combination thereof, as directed by and for the benefit of
the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that no gain or loss
thereon shall affect the amounts payable to the holders of Merger Shares,
Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares, and Company Stock-Based
Awards following completion of the Merger pursuant to this Article III. Any
and all interest and other income earned on the Surviving Corporation Fund
shall promptly be paid to the Surviving Corporation.

  

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Merger Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Company Paying Agent to mail to
each person who was, as of immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, a
holder of record of the Merger Shares: (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the certificates representing the Merger Shares
(the " _Company Common Share Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Company Common Share Certificates to the Company Paying
Agent) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Company
Common Share Certificates or any uncertificated Company Common Shares ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ ") in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender to the Company Paying Agent of Company Common Share Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Company Common Share Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, in cash, the
Merger Consideration in respect thereof, and the Company Common Share
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Merger Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger
Consideration in respect of the applicable Merger Shares may be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the Company Common
Share Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered are registered if
such Company Common Share Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect thereof or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 3.3, each Company Common Share Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed at all times after the Merger Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable
to holders of Company Common Share Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant
to the provisions of this Article III.

  

(c) Any portion of the Surviving Corporation Fund that remains undistributed
to the holders of Merger Shares for one year after the Merger Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holders
of Merger Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article III
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for, and the
Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for the
Merger Consideration.

       

(d) If any Company Common Share Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Company Common Share Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Company Common Share Certificate, the Company Paying Agent
shall pay in respect of Merger Shares to which such lost, stolen or destroyed
Company Common Share Certificate relate the Merger Consideration to which the
holder thereof is entitled.

  

(e) At the Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Merger Shares thereafter on the records of the Company.  From and after the
Merger Effective Time, the holders of Company Common Share Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares representing Merger Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, or by Law.

  

Section 3.4 _Withholding Rights_.

  

The Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Company Paying Agent, as
applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common
Shares, Company Stock Options and Company Stock-Based Awards, such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Company, the Surviving Corporation, or the
Company Paying Agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
Company Common Shares, Company Stock Options or Company Stock-Based Awards,
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or the Company Paying Agent, as applicable.

  

Section 3.5 _Dissenting Shares_.

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no
Company Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time, the holder of which (A) has not voted in favor of the Merger
or consented thereto in writing, (B) has demanded its rights to appraisal in
accordance with RCW 25B.13, and (C) has not effectively withdrawn or lost its
rights to appraisal (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall be converted into
or represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 3.1(b). By virtue of the Merger, all Dissenting Shares shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist and shall represent the right to receive
only those rights provided under the WBCA. From and after the Merger Effective
Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to exercise any of
the voting rights or other rights of a shareholder, member or equity owner of
the Surviving Corporation. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made
available to the Company Paying Agent pursuant to Section 3.3 to pay for
Company Common Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be
returned to Parent upon demand.

       

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 3.5, if any holder of
Company Common Shares who demands dissenters rights shall effectively
withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to
dissent or its rights of appraisal, then, as of the later of the Merger
Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holders Company Common
Shares shall no longer be Dissenting Shares and shall automatically be
converted into and represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon and less any
required withholding.

  

(c) The Company shall give Parent (A) notice of any written demands for
dissenters rights of Company Common Shares, withdrawals of such demands, and
any other instruments served pursuant to the WBCA and received by the Company
which relate to any such demand for dissenters rights and (B) the
opportunity reasonably to direct all negotiations and proceedings (subject to
the Companys right to object to any actions or positions taken by Parent
that it deems, in its sole discretion, unreasonable) with respect to demands
for dissenters rights under the WBCA. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any
demands for dissenters rights or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

properties owned, leased or operated by it or the conduct or nature of its
business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for

or Permits applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or by which
any property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound, and,

not, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the
Company, take or cause to be taken any action, or propose, announce an
intention, enter into any agreement or otherwise make a commitment to take
any action, that (a) could be expected to materially delay or impair the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (b) would
cause any of the representations or

       

warranties of the Buyer Parties contained herein to become inaccurate in any
material respect or any of the covenants of the Buyer Parties to be breached
in any material respect or result in the failure to be satisfied of any of
the conditions set forth in Section 8.3.

assets; provided that (i) no such pledge or grant shall be effective until

commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability or obligation in

 **ARTICLE VII 
 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS**

  

Section 7.1 _Company Proxy Statement; Other Filings; Shareholders  Meeting_.

  

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall prepare and, after consultation with Parent, file with the SEC
the preliminary Proxy Statement and each of the Company and Parent shall, or
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, prepare and, after consultation
with each other, file with the SEC all Other Filings that are required to be
filed by such party in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
Each

       

of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning itself and
its Affiliates that is required to be included in the Proxy Statement or, to
the extent applicable, the Other Filings, or that is customarily included in
proxy statements prepared in connection with transactions of the type
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its
reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of
the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Other Filings, and the
Company shall use its reasonable efforts to cause the definitive Proxy
Statement to be cleared by the SEC and mailed to the Companys shareholders
as promptly as reasonably practicable following clearance from the SEC. The
Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from
the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments
or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Other Filings and shall promptly
provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other
hand, relating to the Proxy Statement or the Other Filings. If at any time
prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, any information relating to the
Company or the Buyer Parties or any of their respective Affiliates, officers,
members or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent, which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or
the Other Filings, so that the Proxy Statement or the Other Filings shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the
Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to
filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or filing the Other Filings (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC
with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and will in
good faith consider such comments, and to the extent practicable, the Company
will provide Parent with the opportunity to participate in any substantive
calls between the Company, or any of its representatives, and the SEC
concerning the Proxy Statement.

  

(b) The Company shall duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting
of its shareholders (the " _Company Shareholders  Meeting_") as promptly
as practicable after the date of this Agreement, for the purpose of voting
upon the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with Section 23B.11.030 of
the WBCA. Subject to the following sentence, (i) the Company Board shall
recommend to holders of the Company Common Shares (and not withdraw or
modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify its recommendation) that
they adopt this Agreement (the " _Company Recommendation_ ") and (ii) the
Company will use reasonable efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and to obtain the Company
Shareholder Approval.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, prior to the Shareholders of the Company having approved the Merger
at the Company Shareholders Meeting, the Company Board may determine (1) not
to make or to withdraw, modify or change such recommendation (a " _Company
Change in Recommendation_ ") and (2) not to use such efforts to solicit
proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement if, in the case of both
clauses (1) and (2), it (A) has received an unsolicited Company Superior
Proposal which it has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial

       

advisor, that the failure to act on would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, (B) provides to Parent at least three (3)
Business Days prior written notice that it intends (or may intend) to take
any such action, and (C) provides written notice to Parent that it has taken
such action. The Company agrees that until immediately after the third
Business Day following Parents receipt of such written notice, the Company
and its Representatives shall (if Parent so requests) negotiate in good faith
with Parent and its Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent. In
determining whether to make a Company Change in Recommendation, the Company
Board shall take into account any amendment to this Agreement entered into,
or to which Parent irrevocably covenants to enter into, and for which all
internal approvals of Parent have been obtained. The Company may, if
it receives an unsolicited Company Acquisition Proposal, delay the mailing of
the Proxy Statement or the holding of the Company Shareholders Meeting, in
each case for such reasonable period but in no event beyond ten (10) Business
Days, as would provide a reasonable opportunity for the Company Board to
consider such Company Acquisition Proposal and to determine the effect, if
any, on the Company Recommendation.

  

Section 7.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

  

(a) Subject to applicable Law and confidentiality agreements, from the date
hereof until the Merger Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause
the Company Subsidiaries and the officers, directors, employees, auditors and
agents of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to, afford Parent and
Parents officers, directors, employees, accountants, legal counsel and
financial advisors (collectively " _Representatives_ ") following notice from
Parent to the Company in accordance with this Section 7.2, reasonable access
during normal business hours to the officers, employees, agents, properties,
offices, plants and other facilities, books and records of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, and all other financial, operating, Tax related and
other data and information as Parent may reasonably request. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither Parent nor any of its Representatives shall (i)
contact or have any discussions with any of the Companys or the Company
Subsidiaries employees, agents, or representatives, unless in each case
Parent obtains the prior consent of the Companys Chief Executive Officer,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, (ii) contact or have any
discussions with any licensees or franchisees of the Company or their
respective subsidiaries, unless in each case Parent obtains the prior consent
of the Companys Chief Executive Officer, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, (iii) damage any property or any portion thereof, or (iv) collect
or analyze any environmental samples (including building materials, indoor
and outdoor air, surface and ground water, and surface and subsurface soils).
Parent shall schedule and coordinate all inspections with the Company and
shall give the Company at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice
thereof, setting forth the inspection or materials that Parent or its
Representatives intend to conduct or review, as applicable. The Company shall
be entitled to have representatives present at all times during any
such inspection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any
of its respective subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of the Company or any of its respective
subsidiaries or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to
the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that the parties shall cooperate in
good faith to create ways in which to maximize the amount of information
which can be disclosed to Parent or its Representatives without such effect,
and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall

       

use their commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent in
assisting Parent with its transition and integration planning.

  

(b) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, all information obtained by Parent
pursuant to this Section 7.2 shall be kept confidential in accordance with
the confidentiality provisions of that letter agreement dated December 16,
2006 between Parent and Kurt Salmon Associates Capital Advisors, Inc. (the
"Confidentiality Agreement").

  

Section 7.3 _No Solicitation of Transactions by the Company_.

  

(a) During the term of this Agreement, none of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary shall, nor shall it authorize or knowingly permit, directly or
indirectly, any officer, trustee, director, employee, investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, broker, finder or other agent, representative or
Affiliate of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to, (i) initiate, solicit
or knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing
nonpublic information or assistance) any inquiries or the making of any
proposal or other action that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into discussions or
negotiate with any Person in furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain a
Company Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) enter into an agreement (other than a
confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement) with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, prior to obtaining the Company Shareholders Approval, following the
receipt by the Company or any Company Subsidiary of a Company Acquisition
Proposal (that was not solicited, encouraged or facilitated in violation of
this Section 7.3(a)), the Company Board may (directly or through advisors or
representatives) after providing Parent not less than 24 hours notice of its
intention to take such actions, (x) contact such Person and its advisors
solely for the purpose of clarifying the proposal and any material terms
thereof and the conditions to and likelihood of consummation, so as to
determine whether such proposal is, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a
Company Superior Proposal and (y) if (A) the Company Board determines in good
faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation that such Company Acquisition
Proposal is, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Company Superior Proposal
and (B) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company
Board may (1) furnish non-public information with respect to the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries to the Person who made such proposal; ( _provided_
 that the Company has previously or concurrently furnished such information
to Parent) and; _provided_ , _further_ , that, prior to furnishing
such information, the Company shall have received from the Person to whom
such information is being furnished an executed confidentiality agreement on
terms at least as restrictive as the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement,
and which confidentiality agreement does not provide for any exclusive right
to negotiate with the Company and does not restrict the Company from
complying with this Section 7.3, (2) participate in negotiations regarding
such proposal and (3) following receipt of a Company Acquisition Proposal
that constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement
pursuant to, and subject to compliance with, Section 9.1(h) and the payment
of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.4; _provided_ that, in the
case of clauses (1) and (2) above, the Company gives Parent notice prior to
taking the actions set forth

       

therein. The Company shall provide Parent with a correct and complete copy of
any such confidentiality agreement entered into pursuant to this Section
7.3(a) within 24 hours after execution thereof.

  

(b) Subject to Section 7.3(a), the Company shall take, and shall cause the
Company Subsidiaries to take, all actions reasonably necessary to cause
their respective officers, trustees, directors, employees, investment
bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, brokers, finders and any other
agents, representatives or Affiliates to immediately cease any
discussions, negotiations or communications with any party or parties with
respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal.

  

(c) The Company shall notify Parent (in no event less than 24 hours following
the Companys initial receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal) of the
relevant details relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal (including the
identity of the parties and all material terms thereof) which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or any such officer, trustee, director, employee,
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, broker, finder or other
agent, representative or Affiliate may receive after the date hereof, and
shall keep Parent informed on a prompt basis as to the status of and any
material developments regarding any such proposal, including any changes in
material terms or conditions thereto.

  

(d) Nothing in this Section 7.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prevent
the Company Board from disclosing any information required to be disclosed
under applicable Law or from complying with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to a Company Acquisition
Proposal. In addition, nothing in this Section 7.3 or this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company from taking any action that any court of competent
jurisdiction orders the Company to take.

  

Section 7.4 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

  

(a) From and after the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall honor and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all benefit plans and compensation
arrangements and agreements and employment agreements in accordance with
their terms as in effect immediately before the Merger Effective Time;
_provided_ that nothing herein shall preclude Parent from amending or
terminating any such agreement or arrangement in accordance with the terms
thereof. For a period of one year following the Merger Effective Time (the "
_Benefits Continuation Period_ ") Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be
provided, to each current employee of the Company and its subsidiaries who
remain employed by the Surviving Corporation after the Merger Effective Time
other than such employees covered by collective bargaining agreements ("
_Company Employees_ ") (i) compensation (including, without limitation,
incentive compensation other than equity-based incentive compensation) no
less favorable than the compensation provided to Company Employees (including
without limitation incentive compensation other than equity-based incentive
compensation) immediately before the Merger Effective Time and (ii) benefits
that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the benefits provided to
Company Employees immediately before the Merger Effective Time. However,
nothing in this Section shall prevent Parent or the Surviving Corporation
from terminating a Company Employees employment, or reducing or otherwise
modifying any term or condition of employment, in a manner consistent with
the Companys past practices based upon employee performance, or changes in
business

       

circumstances or conditions. During the Benefits Continuation Period, Parent
shall honor, fulfill and discharge the Companys and the Company
Subsidiaries obligations under, the severance plans listed on Section 7.4(a)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule without any amendment or change that is
adverse to the Company Employees. During the Benefits Continuation
Period, severance benefits offered to Company Employees shall be determined
without taking into account any reduction after the Merger Effective Time
in compensation paid to Company Employees and used to determine
severance benefits.

  

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and its subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the
Merger Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ ") each Company Employee shall
subject to applicable Law and applicable tax qualification requirements be
credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Merger Effective
Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the
Merger Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company
employee benefit plan in which such Company Employee participated or was
eligible to participate immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time;
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee
shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in
any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is
comparable to a Company Benefit Plan in which such Company
Employee participated immediately before the consummation of the Merger (such
plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ ") and (ii) for purposes of each New
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any
Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such
Company Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions
would not have been waived under the comparable plans of the Company or its
subsidiaries in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to
the Merger Effective Time and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the
portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance
and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or
her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had
been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

  

(c) All annual bonus plans for Company Employees for the Companys fiscal
year ending April 30, 2007 will be paid in accordance with their terms to the
extent earned by such Company Employees, including the effect, if any, of
this Agreement or the Merger; _provided_ that the amounts payable with
respect to bonus plans for such fiscal year shall be calculated without
taking into account any expenses or costs associated with or arising as a
result of transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any expenses
or costs related to actions undertaken in anticipation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) or any non-recurring charges that would not
reasonably be expected to have been incurred had the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement not been anticipated or occurred, and bonus
amounts for the Companys fiscal year ending April 30, 2007 shall not be
subject to negative discretion by the administrator for the bonus plans. In
addition, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide and
maintain

       

in effect for Company Employees the Companys fiscal year ending April 30,
2008 bonus plans which provide Company Employees with aggregate compensation
opportunities at levels at least as beneficial as those opportunities
provided to Company Employees immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time.

  

(d) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company Board, or an appropriate
committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution
consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the disposition
by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered person of the
Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_ ") of Company Common Shares or Company
Stock Options to acquire Company Common Shares (or Company Common Shares
acquired upon the vesting of any Company Stock-Based Awards or Company
Restricted Shares) pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger shall be an
exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16.

  

Section 7.5 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

  

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer,
trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment or
indemnification agreement or under the Company Articles, Company Bylaws or
this Agreement or, if applicable, similar organizational documents or
agreements of any of the Company Subsidiaries, from and after the Merger
Effective Time, Parent shall and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person who is at the date hereof or
during the period from the date hereof through the Closing Date serving as a
director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary of the Company or
Company Subsidiaries or as a fiduciary under or with respect to any employee
benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) (collectively, the
" _Indemnified Parties_ ") to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by
applicable law, as now or hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim
and any judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including
all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection
with or in respect of such judgments, fines, penalties or, with the consent
of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
amounts paid in settlement) resulting therefrom; and (ii) promptly pay on
behalf of or, within thirty (30) days after any request for advancement,
advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, to the fullest extent authorized
or permitted by applicable law, as now or hereafter in effect, any Expenses
incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise
participating in any Claim in advance of the final disposition of such Claim,
including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any
Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any
rights with respect to such indemnification or advancement, in each case
without the requirement of any bond or other security; _provided_ that all
advancement of expenses pursuant to the foregoing shall be subject to an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Person is not entitled to such indemnification. The indemnification and
advancement obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation pursuant to
this Section 7.5(a) shall extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before
the Merger Effective Time and any Claim relating thereto (including with
respect to any acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the consideration and approval thereof and the

       

process undertaken in connection therewith and any Claim relating thereto),
and all rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall
continue as to a person who continues to be or who has ceased to be a
director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary of the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries after the date hereof and shall inure to the benefit
of such persons heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives. As
used in this Section 7.5(a): (A) the term " _Claim_ " means any
threatened, asserted, pending or completed Action, suit or proceeding, or any
inquiry or investigation, whether instituted by any party hereto, any
Governmental Authority or any other party, that any Indemnified Party in good
faith believes might lead to the institution of any such Action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other,
including any arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution mechanism,
arising out of or pertaining to matters that relate to such Indemnified
Partys duties or service as a director, officer, trustee, employee, agent,
or fiduciary of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries, or any employee
benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) maintained by any
of the foregoing or any other person at or prior to the Merger Effective Time
at the request of the Company or any of Company Subsidiaries; and (B) the
term " _Expenses_ " means reasonable attorneys fees and all other reasonable
costs, expenses and obligations (including, without limitation, experts
fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating,
printing and binding costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and
courier charges) paid or incurred in connection with investigating,
defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or
preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in or participate in, any
Claim for which indemnification is authorized pursuant to this Section
7.5(a), including any Action relating to a claim for indemnification or
advancement brought by an Indemnified Party. Neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
in any actual or threatened claim, demand, Action, suit, proceeding, inquiry
or investigation in respect of which indemnification has been or could be
sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder unless such settlement, compromise
or judgment includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from
all liability arising out of such claim, demand, Action, suit, proceeding,
inquiry or investigation or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents
thereto.

  

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and MergerCo agree that all rights
to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Merger Effective Time now existing in
favor of the current or former directors, officers, trustees, employees,
agents, or fiduciaries of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as
provided in the Company Articles and Company Bylaws (or, as applicable, the
articles, bylaws, partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement,
or other organizational documents of any of the Subsidiaries) and
indemnification agreements of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
identified on Section 7.5(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
honored by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action,
at the Merger Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall continue
in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

  

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Merger Effective Time, the
organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification than are set
forth in the Company Articles and Company Bylaws, which provisions shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years

       

from the Merger Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the
rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Merger Effective
Time, were directors, officers, trustees, employees, agents, or fiduciaries
of the Company or any of Company Subsidiaries, unless such modification shall
be required by Law and then only to the minimum extent required by Law.

  

(d) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain for a period of at least six (6)
years the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Merger Effective
Time, including, without limitation, in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that (i) (A) that the Company
may obtain such extended reporting period coverage under the Companys
existing DandO insurance (to be effective as of the Merger Effective Time) or
(B) that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at
least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which
are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured; _provided_ that
such substitution shall not result in gaps or lapses of coverage with respect
to matters occurring before the Merger Effective Time; (ii) in no event shall
the Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to this Section
7.5(d) more than an amount per year of coverage equal to two hundred percent
(200%) of the current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance.
In the event that, but for the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence,
the Surviving Corporation would be required to expend more than two hundred
percent (200%) of the current annual premiums paid by the Company, the
Surviving Corporation shall obtain the maximum amount of such insurance
obtainable by payment of annual premiums equal to two hundred percent (200%)
of the current annual premiums paid by the Company.  Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation or its successors or assigns to, maintain
such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor all obligations
thereunder.

  

(e) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving limited liability company,
partnership or other entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers
or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.5.

  

(f) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Section 7.5 and the
parties acknowledge and agree that Parent guarantees the payment and
performance of the Surviving Corporations obligations pursuant to this
Section 7.5.

  

(g) This Section 7.5 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant
third party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of the Company, Parent and the Surviving Corporation.
Each of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce the covenants
contained in this Section 7.5.

       

Section 7.6 _Further Action; Best Efforts_.

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use its best efforts (subject to, and in accordance
with, applicable Law) to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of
all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from
Governmental Authorities and the making of all necessary registrations and

or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental
Authority, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers
from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement

the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall (i) promptly, but in no event
later than fifteen (15) days after the date hereof (unless extended by mutual
agreement of the parties) make their respective filings and thereafter make
any other required submissions under the HSR Act, (ii) use best efforts to
cooperate with each other in (A) determining whether any filings are required
to be made with, or consents, permits, authorizations, waivers or approvals
are required to be obtained from, any third parties or other Governmental
Authorities in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (B) timely
making all such filings and timely seeking all such consents, permits,
authorizations or approvals, (iii) use best efforts to offer to take, or
cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby, including taking all such further action as
reasonably may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the United
States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition
authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction or any other person may
assert under Regulatory Law (as hereinafter defined) with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority
with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
expeditiously possible (and in any event shall use best efforts to cause the
Closing to occur prior to the Outside Date), including, without limitation
(A) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree,
hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of
such assets or businesses of Parent or its subsidiaries or Affiliates or of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries and (B) otherwise taking or
committing to take actions that after the Closing Date would limit the
freedom of Parent or its subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporations) or Affiliates freedom of action with respect to, or
its ability to retain, one or more of its or its subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporations) businesses, product lines or assets, in each case as
may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit
or proceeding which would otherwise have

   

45  

   

the effect of preventing or materially delaying the Closing and (iv) subject
to applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any Governmental
Authority, keep each other apprised of the status of matters relating to the
completion of the transactions contemplated thereby, including promptly
furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications between
the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their respective
subsidiaries, and any third party or any Governmental Authority with respect
to such transactions. The Company and Parent shall permit counsel for the
other party reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good
faith the views of the other party in connection with, any proposed written
communication to any Governmental Authority. Each of the Company and Parent
agrees not to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion, either in
person or by telephone, with any Governmental Authority in connection with
the proposed transactions unless it consults with the other party in advance
and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Authority, gives the
other party the opportunity to attend and participate.

  

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 7.6, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Regulatory Law (as hereinafter defined), each
of the Company and Parent shall cooperate in all respects with each other and
shall use their respective best efforts to contest and resist any such action
or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Section 7.6 shall limit a partys right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(b) or 9.1(c) so long as such party has,
prior to such termination, complied with its obligations under this Section
7.6.

  

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Regulatory Law_ " means the Sherman
Act of 1890, the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, the HSR Act, the Federal
Trade Commission Act of 1914 and all other federal, state or foreign
statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and judicial
doctrines and other Laws, including without limitation any antitrust,
competition or trade regulation Laws, that are designed or intended to (i)
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening competition through merger
or acquisition, (ii) preserve or promote diversity of media ownership or
(iii) protect the national security or the national economy of any nation.

  

Section 7.7 _Public Announcements_.

  

The parties hereto agree that no public release or announcement concerning
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger shall be issued
by a party without the prior consent of the other parties (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld), except as such release or announcement
may be required by Law or the rules or regulations of any securities
exchange, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall use its reasonable efforts to allow the other parties
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance. The parties have agreed upon the form of a joint press release
announcing the Merger and the execution of this Agreement.

        

Section 7.8 _Notification_.

  

Each of the Company and Parent, as the case may be, shall act in good faith
to reasonably promptly notify the other party upon becoming aware of any
occurrence or event that is reasonably likely to cause any of the conditions
to closing set forth in Article VIII not to be satisfied.

  

Section 7.9 _Shareholder Litigation_.

  

The Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of any
shareholder litigation against the Company or its directors relating to this
Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
shall keep Parent fully informed regarding any such shareholder litigation.
The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company
regarding the defense or settlement of any such shareholder litigation, shall
give consideration to Parents advice with respect to such shareholder
litigation and, prior to the termination of this Agreement, shall not settle
any such litigation without Parents prior written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(c) No Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,

date shall be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of the
Closing, as though made on and as of the Closing, and (ii) are made as of a

4.3 and 4.4 shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the date
of this Agreement and as of the Closing, as though made on and as of the

to Section 7.6.

  

 **ARTICLE IX 
 TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER**

  

Section 9.1 _Termination_.

  

This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time
prior to the Merger Effective Time by action taken or authorized by the
Company Board, or members of the terminating party or parties,
notwithstanding any requisite approval of the Merger by the shareholders of
the Company, and whether before or after the shareholders of the Company have
approved the Merger at the Company Shareholders Meeting, as follows (the
date of any such termination, the " _Termination Date_ "):

  

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

  

(b) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger Effective Time shall not
have occurred on or before July 31, 2007 (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_
, _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
9.1(b) shall not be available to a party whose failure to fulfill any
obligation under this Agreement materially contributed to the failure of the
Merger Effective Time to occur on or before such date;

  

(c) by either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Authority shall have
enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any injunction, order,
decree or ruling or taken any other action (including the failure to have
taken an action) which, in either such case, has become final and non-
appealable and has the effect of making consummation of the Merger illegal or
otherwise preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Merger ("
_Governmental Order_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the passage of such
period shall be tolled for any part thereof during which any party shall be
subject to a non-final order, decree, ruling or action restraining, enjoining
or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger, and; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the terms of this Section 9.1(c) shall not be available to
any party unless such party shall have used its reasonable efforts to oppose
any such Governmental Order or to have such Governmental Order vacated or
made inapplicable to the Merger;

  

(d) by Parent if each of it and MergerCo is not in material breach of its
obligations under this Agreement, and if (i) any of the representations and
warranties of the Company herein are or become untrue or incorrect such that
the condition set forth in Section 8.2(a) would be incapable of being
satisfied by the Outside Date, or (ii) there has been a breach on the part of
the Company of its covenants or agreements herein such that the condition set
forth in Section 8.2(b) would be incapable of being satisfied by the Outside
Date; or (iii) the conditions set forth in

        

Section 8.1 and Section 8.3 have been satisfied (other than those conditions
that are not satisfied due to the Companys failure to satisfy its
obligations under this Agreement) but the Company fails to consummate the
Merger as contemplated by Section 2.4;

  

(e) by the Company if it is not in material breach of its obligations under
this Agreement, and if (i) any of the representations and warranties of
Parent and MergerCo herein are or become untrue or inaccurate such that the
condition set forth in Section 8.3(a) would be incapable of being satisfied
by the Outside Date; (ii) there has been a breach on the part of Parent or
MergerCo of any of their respective covenants or agreements herein such that
the conditions set forth in Section 8.3(b) would be incapable of being
satisfied by the Outside Date; or (iii) the conditions set forth in Section
8.1 and Section 8.2 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that are
not satisfied due to Parents or MergerCos failure to satisfy its
obligations under this Agreement) but Parent fails to consummate the Merger
as contemplated by Section 2.4;

  

(f) by the Company or Parent if the Company Shareholder Approval is not
obtained at the Company Shareholders Meeting (including any adjournments and
postponements thereof); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 9.1(f) shall not be available to the
Company where the failure to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval is
caused by any action or failure to act of the Company that constitutes a
material breach of this Agreement;

  

(g) by Parent if the Company Board shall have (1) effected a Company Change
in Recommendation or (2) elected not to use reasonable efforts to obtain the
Company Shareholder Approval, or (3) publicly recommended or approved any
Company Acquisition Proposal; or

  

(h) by the Company, if the Company Board has approved, or authorized the
Company to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to, a Company
Superior Proposal, but only so long as (i) the Company Shareholder Approval
has not yet been obtained, (ii) the Company is in compliance in all material
respects with Section 7.3, (iii) the Company shall have first given Parent at
least 2 Business Days notice of its intent to terminate pursuant to this
subsection, (iv) after taking into account any amendment to this Agreement
entered into, or to which Parent irrevocably covenants to enter into, within
such 2-Business Day period and for which all internal approvals of Parent
have been obtained since receipt of such notice, such Company Superior
Proposal continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal (taking into
account any amendment to this Agreement or any amendment to this Agreement
agreed in writing by Parent), and (v) the Company intends, simultaneously or
substantially simultaneously with such termination, to enter into a
definitive acquisition, merger or other agreement to enter into the
transaction contemplated by the Company Superior Proposal.

  

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement shall give written notice of
such termination to the other parties, including a description of the reasons
for desiring to terminate this Agreement and the Sections under which such
termination is made.

        

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_.

  

In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void, and there shall be no liability
under this Agreement on the part of any party hereto except that the
provisions of Sections 7.2(b), this Section 9.2, Section 9.3 and Article IX
shall survive any such termination); _provided_ , _however_ , nothing herein
shall relieve any party hereto from liability for (i) any breach of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement prior to such termination, or (ii) any fraud or willful
breach of this Agreement.

  

Section 9.3 _Expenses_.

  

All expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the
party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

  

Section 9.4 _Termination Fee_

  

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1(g) or Section 9.1(h),
then the Company shall pay to Parent (by wire transfer of immediately
available funds) a fee in an amount equal to $4,000,000 (the " _Termination
Fee"_ ), with such payment to be made by the Company within two Business Days
after such termination. If the Company fails to pay the Termination Fee in
accordance with this section and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent makes a claim that results in a judgment for such amount, the Company
shall pay to Parent its reasonable attorneys fees and related expenses
incurred with such claim. Payment of the Termination Fee shall not be in
lieu of damages incurred in the event of an intentional or willful breach of
this Agreement.

  

Section 9.5 _Waiver_.

  

At any time prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company, on the one hand,
and Parent and MergerCo, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any obligation or other act of the other party, (b) waive any
inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance
with any agreement of the other party or any condition to its own obligations
contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed by the Company or Parent (on behalf of
Parent and MergerCo).  The failure of any party to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those
rights.

  

 **ARTICLE X

Section 10.3 _Severability_.

  

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy or the
application of this Agreement to any person or circumstance is invalid or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. To such end, the provisions of this
Agreement are agreed to be severable. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

  

Section 10.4 _Amendment_.

  

This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by action taken by their
respective board of directors (or similar governing body or entity) at any
time prior to the Merger Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after
approval of the Merger by the shareholders of the Company, no amendment may
be made without further shareholder approval which, by Law or in accordance
with the rules of the Nasdaq, requires further approval by such shareholders.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed
by the parties hereto.

  

Section 10.5 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_.

  

This Agreement, together with the Confidentiality Agreement and the
Disclosure Schedules, constitute the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned
(whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of law or otherwise).

  

Section 10.6 _Performance Guaranty_.

  

Parent hereby guarantees the due, prompt and faithful performance and
discharge by, and compliance with, all of the obligations covenants, terms,
conditions and undertakings of each of

        

the Buyer Parties under this agreement in accordance with the terms hereof
including any such obligations, covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings
that are required to be performed discharged or complied with following the
Merger Effective Time.

  

Section 10.7 _Specific Performance_.

  

Subject to Section 7.3(a), the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with the terms hereof and that money damages would not be a
sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement, and accordingly, the
parties hereto shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof,
in addition to any other remedy at law or equity.

  

Section 10.8 _Parties in Interest_.

  

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each
party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than following
the consummation of the Merger, the provisions of Article II and Section 7.5
(which are intended to be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby or
the persons entitled to payment thereunder and may be enforced by such
persons).

  

Section 10.9 _Governing Law; Forum_.

  

(a) All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington without regard to its
rules of conflict of laws.

  

(b) Except as set out below, each of the Company, Parent and MergerCo hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the sole and exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Washington or any court of the
United States located in the State of Washington (the "Washington Courts")
for any litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any litigation relating
thereto except in such courts), waives any objection to the laying of venue
of any such litigation in the Washington Courts and agrees not to plead or
claim in any Washington Court that such litigation brought therein has been
brought in any inconvenient forum. Each of the parties hereto agrees, (i) to
the extent such party is not otherwise subject to service of process in the
State of Washington, to appoint and maintain an agent in the State of
Washington as such partys agent for acceptance of legal process, and (ii)
that service of process may also be made on such party by prepaid certified
mail with a proof of mailing receipt validated by the United States Postal
Service constituting evidence of valid service. Service made pursuant to (i)
or (ii) above shall have the same legal force and effect as if served upon
such party personally within the State of Washington. For purposes of
implementing the parties agreement to appoint and maintain an agent for
service of process in the State of Washington, Parent does hereby appoint
Corporation Service Company, 6500 Harbour Heights Parkway, Suite 400,
Mukilteo, Washington 98275, as such agent.

        

Section 10.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_.

  

Each of the parties hereto hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law any right it may have to a trial by jury with respect to any
litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of
the parties hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of
any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other
party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing
waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been
induced to enter into this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this Section 10.10.

  

Section 10.11 _Headings_.

  

The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are included for
convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

  

Section 10.12 _Counterparts_.

  

This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile
transmission) in two or more counterparts, and by the different parties
hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed
to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and
the same agreement.

  

Section 10.13 _Waiver_.

  

Except as provided in this Agreement, no action taken pursuant to this
Agreement, including, without limitation, any investigation by or on behalf
of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such
action of compliance with any representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement. The waiver by any party hereto of a
breach of any provision hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a
waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any other provision
hereunder.

  

(signature page follows)

        

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, MergerCo, and the Company have caused this
Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by their

partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any
other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. To the maximum extent
permitted by Law, (a) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement, the

seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or
in connection with, this Agreement, the Proxy or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby shall be brought exclusively in a United

Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. In this Agreement (a) words
