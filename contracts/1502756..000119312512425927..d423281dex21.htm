(iii)  MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT

 

THIS MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as
of October 12, 2012, is made by and among First Communications, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Seller_ ") and Zayo Group, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (" _Buyer_ ").

_PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS_

A. The Seller owns beneficially and of record 100% of the issued and
outstanding limited liability company membership interests in First Telecom
Services, LLC (the " _Membership Interests_ "), an Ohio limited liability
company (the " _Company_ "); and 

B. The Seller wishes to sell to the Buyer, and the Buyer wishes to purchase
from the Seller, the Membership Interests. 

_AGREEMENTS_

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
and upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth, the
parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

DEFINED TERMS

 

1.1 Definitions. Certain terms used in this Agreement are defined in _Exhibit
A_ attached hereto.

 

ARTICLE II

 

PURCHASE AND SALE

2.1 Purchase and Sale of the Membership Interests. Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the Seller shall sell and
deliver the Membership Interests to the Buyer for an aggregate purchase price
of U.S. $110,000,000 (as adjusted pursuant to this Agreement, the Purchase
Price) (the " _Acquisition_ ").

2.2 Adjustments to Purchase Price.

(a) The parties intend that, on the Closing Date, the Company will have
$2,000,000 (the " _Target Closing NWC_ ") of Net Working Capital. To the
extent that the Company has less than the Target Closing NWC on the close of
business on the Closing Date, such deficiency will be deducted from the Base
Purchase Price, and to the extent that the Company has greater than the Target
Closing NWC on the close of business on the Closing Date, such excess will be
added to the Base Purchase Price (the " _Net Working Capital Adjustment_ "). (b) The parties intend that, on the Closing Date, the Company will have $0
(the " _Target Closing Indebtedness_ ") of Indebtedness. To the extent that
the Company has more than the Target Closing Indebtedness on the close of
business on the Closing Date, such additional debt will be deducted from the
Base Purchase Price, as the " _Debt Adjustment_."

(c) No later than 11:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time at least five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Buyer
a statement (the " _Preliminary Closing Statement_ ") setting forth in good
faith its computations of estimated Net Working Capital (the " _Preliminary
Closing NWC_ ") and estimated Indebtedness (the " _Preliminary Closing
Indebtedness_ ") as of the close of business on the anticipated Closing Date.
If the Preliminary Closing NWC is greater than $3,000,000, the Preliminary
Closing NWC will be deemed to be $3,000,000 for purposes of (i) calculating
the Net Working Capital Adjustment pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ and (ii)
calculating the adjustment pursuant to  _Section 2.2(i)_. The parties will
use the Preliminary Closing NWC and the Preliminary Closing Indebtedness to
calculate the Purchase Price for purposes of Closing.

(d) As promptly as practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event
later than thirty (30) days thereafter, the Seller shall cause to be prepared
and delivered to the Buyer a statement (the " _Post-Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth the calculation of Net Working Capital and Indebtedness as of
the close of business on the Closing Date. The Post-Closing Statement shall be
prepared in good faith in accordance with GAAP and, to the extent not
inconsistent with GAAP, in a manner consistent with the past practices of the
Company.

(e) The Buyer shall have thirty (30) days after the receipt of the Post-
Closing Statement (the " _Review Period_ ") to review the information and
calculations provided therein. During the Review Period, the Seller shall
afford the Buyer (and its representatives) reasonable access to all books and
records and all financial and accounting personnel used to prepare the Post-
Closing Statement under control of or in the possession of the Seller.

 

(f) The Buyer may dispute the calculation of the Post-Closing Statement within
the Review Period by providing written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") to the
Seller of such dispute, setting forth in detail the particulars of such
dispute, including the Buyers calculation of Net Working Capital and
Indebtedness. In the event that the Buyer does not deliver a Dispute Notice
within the Review Period, then the Post-Closing Statement shall be final and
binding upon the parties hereto. In the event a Dispute Notice is timely
provided, the Buyer and the Seller shall use their reasonable best efforts for
a period of thirty (30) days (or such longer period as to which they shall
mutually agree) to resolve the disputed matters. If, at the end of such
period, the Seller and the Buyer are unable to resolve the disputed matters,
then the Seller and the Buyer shall, within five (5) days of the end of such
period, jointly submit all disputed matters raised in the Dispute Notice and
not so resolved (the " _Disputed Matters_ ") to the Arbiter (to be selected as
set forth in subsection (g) below) for final resolution in accordance with
the terms and provisions of this Agreement. The determination of the Arbiter
shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto and shall be limited to
Disputed Matters. The fees and expenses of the Arbiter incurred in the
resolution of the Disputed Matters set forth in the Dispute Notice shall be
borne by the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand, in
proportion to the relative amounts of the disputed amount determined to be
for the account of the Buyer and the Seller, respectively. The determination
of the Arbiter shall be reflected in a written report which shall be delivered
by the Arbiter to the Seller and the Buyer no later than thirty (30) days
following the submission of the Disputed Matters to the Arbiter for
resolution.

 



2 (g) The Arbiter (the " _Arbiter_ ") shall be a regional or
nationally recognized accounting firm jointly selected by the Buyer and the
Seller (other than any accounting firm which has been employed by the Seller,
the Company or the Buyer, or any of their respective Affiliates, in the last
two (2) years) (an " _independent accounting firm_ "). In the event that the
Buyer and the Seller are unable to jointly agree upon the Arbiter, then the
Buyer, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand, shall each select
an independent accounting firm to select the Arbiter, and such two (2)
independent accounting firms shall have twenty (20) days thereafter to
mutually select the Arbiter, which selection shall be binding upon the Buyer
and the Seller.

 

(h) The final, conclusive, and binding Net Working Capital amount determined
in accordance with this _Section 2.2_ will be the " _Final Closing NWC_."
The final, conclusive, and binding Indebtedness amount determined in
accordance with this _Section 2.2_ will be the " _Final Closing
Indebtedness_."

 

(i) If (A) the amount of the Final Closing NWC reduced by the Final Closing
Indebtedness (whether such amount is a positive or negative amount) is _less_
than (B) the amount of the Preliminary Closing NWC reduced by the Preliminary
Closing Indebtedness (whether such amount is a positive or negative amount),
then the Seller and the Buyer shall instruct the Escrow Agent within two (2)
Business Days after the date of final determination to release from the
Indemnification Escrow Account the amount of such shortfall to the Buyer. If
(A) the amount of the Final Closing NWC reduced by the Final
Closing Indebtedness (whether such amount is a positive or negative amount)
is _greater_ than (B) the amount of the Preliminary Closing NWC reduced by the
Preliminary Closing Indebtedness (whether such amount is a positive or
negative amount), then the Buyer shall pay to the Seller the amount of such
surplus in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds. For purposes
of illustration, if on the Closing Date the Preliminary Closing NWC is
$4,000,000 and the Company has $0 of Indebtedness, then (x) the Purchase
Price adjustment for purposes of Closing will be $1,000,000, and (y) the
adjustment pursuant to _Section 2.2(i)_ will be $1,000,000 (assuming that the
Final Closing NWC is $4,000,000 and the Final Closing Indebtedness is $0).

2.3 Allocation of Purchase Price. The Seller and the Buyer agree to allocate
the Purchase Price (and any liabilities of the Company treated as assumed for
U.S. federal income tax purposes) among the assets of the Company in
accordance with applicable Law, and the Buyer will deliver a copy of such
allocation (the " _Allocation_ ") to the Seller no later than 120 days after
the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the assets of the Company shall
include any stock or other ownership interests in any Subsidiary of the
Company that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. The Allocation shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect any
adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement. The Seller and
the Buyer shall report, act, and file tax returns (including, but not limited
to IRS Form 8594) in all respects and for all purposes consistent with the
Allocation and shall not take a position (whether in audits, tax returns, or
otherwise) that is inconsistent with the Allocation, except as otherwise
required by Law.

 



3 2.4 Closing Payments. At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing,
the Seller shall deliver a list of payments to be made by Buyer at the
Closing out of the Base Purchase Price, which shall include the payments set
forth on _Disclosure Schedule 2.4_ , the Company Transaction Costs, any
Indebtedness to be paid at the Closing, and any other payments required to be
made to satisfy any of the closing conditions (collectively, the " _Closing
Payments_ ").

2.5 Indemnification Escrow. On or prior to the Closing, the Seller, the Buyer
and the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall enter into the Indemnification
Escrow Agreement, subject only to the comments, if any, of the
Indemnification Escrow Agent as to its rights and obligations thereunder. An
amount equal to $11,000,000 (including all interest, dividends and other
income earned thereon, the " _Indemnification Escrow Amount_ ") shall be
withheld from the consideration otherwise payable to the Seller pursuant to
_Section 2.2_ and shall be deposited by the Buyer into the Indemnification
Escrow Account, and shall be held in escrow pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement and the Indemnification Escrow Agreement. The Indemnification Escrow
Amount shall be used solely to satisfy any adjustment pursuant to _Section
2.2_ and any Losses, if any, for which the Buyer Indemnified Persons are
entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Article X_.

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

3.1 Representations and Warranties of the Seller. Except as set forth on the
_Disclosure Schedule_ , as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing
Date (except to the extent such representations and warranties speak
expressly as of an earlier date), the Seller represents and warrants to the
Buyer as follows:

(a) Organization; Good Standing and Other Matters. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of its respective jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has
all requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
to carry on its business as now being conducted, and is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation, partnership or limited liability company
in good standing to conduct business in each jurisdiction in which the
business it is conducting, or the operation, ownership or leasing of its
properties, makes such qualification necessary, other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure so to qualify would not be reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Seller has delivered or otherwise made
available to Buyer or its representatives true, correct and complete copies of
(i) the Companys certificate of formation and its Subsidiaries respective
certificates of incorporation and bylaws, or other comparable organizational
documents, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, (ii) minute books, and
(iii) equity transfer records or other comparable ownership records. Such
books and records reflect all meetings of the members of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, their respective boards of managers and any board committees,
and the minutes contained therein accurately reflect the events of and
actions taken at such meetings in all material respects. Such ownership
records accurately reflect all issuances, transfers, and cancellations of
membership interests, or other comparable ownership interests, of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. All Subsidiaries of the Company, their
respective jurisdictions of incorporation or organization and their respective
jurisdictions where qualified to do business are set forth on _Disclosure
Schedule 3.1(a)_. Such certificates of incorporation, bylaws or equivalent
organizational documents are in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any of the provisions of its
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or equivalent organizational documents.

 



4 (b) Capitalization of the Company. The Membership Interests constitute all of
the issued and outstanding limited liability company membership interests of
the Company. No bonds, debentures, notes or other instruments or evidence of
Indebtedness having the right to vote (or convertible into, or exercisable or
exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on
which the Companys Members may vote are issued or outstanding. Except for the
Membership Interests, the Company has not agreed to issue any (i) securities,
equity, ownership, or voting interests; (ii) securities or instruments
convertible into or exchangeable for any securities, equity, ownership or
voting interests; or (iii) equity-equivalents, earnings, profits or revenue-
based or equity-based rights. The Membership Interests have been duly
authorized and validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable, and were
issued in compliance with all applicable federal and state securities laws.
There are no outstanding obligations of the Company to issue, sell, transfer,
repurchase or redeem any securities, equity, ownership or voting interests in
the Company, or any securities or instruments convertible into or exchangeable
for or that otherwise give rights with respect to securities,
equity, ownership or voting interests in the Company, or that relate to the
holding, voting or disposition thereof. No Membership Interests have been
issued in violation of any rights, agreements, commitments or arrangements
under applicable Law, the certificate of formation or operating agreement (or
equivalent thereof) of the Company or any contract to which the Company is a
party or by which it is bound.

(c) Capitalization of the Subsidiaries. As of the date of this Agreement, (i)
the authorized capital stock or other voting securities and the issued and
outstanding capital stock or other voting securities of each Subsidiary of
the Company and (ii) the other voting securities directly or indirectly owned
by the Company are listed on _Disclosure Schedule 3.1(c)_. The Company
directly or indirectly is the record and beneficial owner of all issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock or other voting securities of each such
Subsidiary and such ownership is free and clear of all Liens, other than
Permitted Liens. Each outstanding share of capital stock or other voting
securities of each such Subsidiary is duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and no shares of capital stock or other voting
securities of any such Subsidiary have been issued in violation of any
preemptive or similar rights. No shares of capital stock or other voting
securities of any such Subsidiary are reserved for issuance, and there are no
contracts, agreements, commitments or arrangements obligating any such
Subsidiary to issue, deliver, sell, purchase, redeem or acquire, cause to be
issued, delivered, sold, purchased, redeemed or acquired, any shares of
capital stock or other voting securities, or obligating any such Subsidiary to
grant, extend, or enter into any option, warrant, call, right, commitment or
agreement of any kind to acquire any shares of, or any securities that are
convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of, capital stock or other
voting securities of such Subsidiary. Except for the Subsidiaries and other
equity interests listed on _Disclosure Schedule 3.1(c)_ , neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries directly or indirectly owns any equity,
partnership, membership or similar interest in, or any interest convertible
into, exercisable for the purchase of or exchangeable for any such equity,
partnership, membership or similar interest, or is under any current or
prospective obligation to form or participate in, provide funds to, make any
loan, capital contribution or other investment in, or assume any liability or
obligation of, any Person.

 



5 (d) Membership Interests. The Seller is the record and beneficial owner of
100% of the issued and outstanding Membership Interests as set forth on
_Disclosure Schedule 3.1(d)_ , free and clear of any Liens except as set forth
on _Disclosure Schedule 3.1(d)_. The Seller has the right, authority and power
to sell, assign and transfer the Membership Interests to the Buyer. Upon
delivery to the Buyer of the Assignment at the Closing and the Buyers payment
of the Purchase Price, the Buyer shall acquire good, valid and marketable
title to the Membership Interests, free and clear of any Lien.

(e) Authority. The Seller has the requisite power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a
party and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein and therein. The execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents by the Seller and the consummation by the Seller of the transactions
contemplated herein or therein have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary action on the part of the Seller. No other proceedings on the part
of the Seller are necessary to authorize this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to which it is a party, for the Seller to perform its
obligations hereunder or thereunder, or for the Seller to consummate
the transactions contemplated herein and therein. This Agreement and each of
the other Transaction Documents to which the Seller is or will be a party has
been, or upon execution and delivery thereof will be, duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Seller and, assuming that this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents to which the Seller is a party constitute the
valid and binding agreement of the other parties hereto and thereto,
constitute, or upon execution and delivery will constitute, the valid and
binding obligations of the Seller enforceable against the Seller in accordance
with their respective terms and conditions, except that the enforcement hereof
and thereof may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws now or
hereafter in effect relating to creditors rights generally and (ii) general
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a
proceeding at law or in equity).

(f) No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Seller of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents to which it is a party do not, and the consummation by the Seller of
the transactions contemplated herein and therein will not, (i) violate,
conflict with, or result in any breach of any provision of the Companys
certificate of formation, or its Subsidiaries respective certificates of
incorporation or bylaws, or other similar organizational documents; (ii)
violate, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of, or constitute a
default (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) under, result in
the creation of any Lien upon any properties or assets of the Company, or give
to any Person any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, any Material Contract; or (iii) subject to obtaining the
Consents or making the registrations, declarations or filings set forth in the
next sentence, violate any Applicable Law (including the Communications Laws)
binding upon the Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which or
to which a material portion of the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries
respective assets is bound. No Consent of any Governmental Authority is
required by the Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with the execution, delivery and performance by the Seller of this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party or
the consummation by the Seller of the transactions contemplated herein or
therein, except for (A) the filing of a pre-acquisition notification and
report form by the Company under the HSR Act, and the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting period thereunder and (B) the consents
and/or notices to state public utilities commissions, the FCC and/or the
Canadian Regulatory-Television and Telecommunications Commission (" _CRTC_ ")
as set forth on _Disclosure Schedule 3.1(f)_.

 



6 (g) Financial Statements; Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

 

(i) The Seller has furnished or made available to the Buyer or its
representatives copies of (A) the unaudited consolidated balance sheets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2011, together
with the unaudited consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and
members equity of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the years then

balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2012
(the " _Balance Sheet_ "), together with the related unaudited
consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and members equity of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for the three- and nine-month periods then ended,
in each case, certified by the Chief Financial Officer of the Seller (such
unaudited financial statements collectively being referred to herein as the "
_Financial Statements_ "). The Financial Statements, together with the notes
thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except that the unaudited
Financial Statements do not contain all notes required by GAAP and are
subject to normal year-end audit adjustments) applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods covered thereby (except to the extent disclosed therein
or required by changes in GAAP) and fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries at the
dates thereof and the consolidated results of the operations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for the respective periods indicated. 

(ii) Except as set forth on _Disclosure Schedule 3.1(g)(ii)_ , or as provided
in or contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents,
since December 31, 2011 (the " _Balance Sheet Date_ ") and prior to the date
of this Agreement, (A) the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have conducted
their respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course
of business and consistent with past practices of the Company, (B) there has
not been any change or development that, individually, or in the aggregate has
had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, (C) neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has suffered any loss, damage,
destruction or other casualty affecting any of its material properties or
assets, whether or not covered by insurance, and (D) none of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action that, if taken after the date of
this Agreement, would constitute a breach of any of the covenants set forth in
_Section 4.1_.

 



7 (h) Compliance with Applicable Laws. Except as set forth on _Disclosure
Schedule 3.1(h)_ , each of the Company and its Subsidiaries (i) has
materially complied with, is in material compliance with, and has operated its
business and maintained its assets in material compliance with, all Applicable
Laws (including the Communications Laws), and (ii) holds all material
permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders, franchises and approvals of
all Governmental Authorities necessary for the lawful conduct of its business,
including any material licenses required by the FCC or any similar state

20 4.2 Access and Information. Until the Closing or termination of the Agreement,
the Seller shall afford to Buyer and its representatives (including
accountants and counsel) reasonable access, during normal business hours and
upon reasonable notice, to all properties, books, records, and tax returns of
the Company and each of its Subsidiaries and all other information with
respect to their respective businesses, together with the opportunity, at the
sole cost and expense of the Buyer, to make copies of such books, records and
other documents and to discuss the business of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries with such directors, officers and counsel for the Company as
Buyer may reasonably request for the purposes of familiarizing itself with the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries, and shall cooperate fully with the
Buyer and its representatives (including accountants and counsel), in
connection with the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this _Section 4.2_, the Seller shall not be required to, or to cause the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, grant access or furnish information to
Buyer or any of Buyers representatives to the extent that such access or
disclosure would violate the rights of its customers, would jeopardize an
attorney/client or attorney work product privilege, or is prohibited by law
or an existing contract or agreement. The Buyer shall not have access to
personnel records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to
individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other
information that in the Sellers good faith opinion is sensitive or the
disclosure of which could subject the Seller, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to risk of liability. All information provided pursuant to
this Agreement shall remain subject in all respects to the Confidentiality
Agreement until the Closing Date.

Schedule 4.3_.

4.4 Notification of Certain Matters; Supplemental Disclosure Letters. The
Seller shall give prompt notice to the Buyer of (a) the occurrence, or failure
to occur, of any event of which it has Knowledge that has caused any
representation or warranty of the Seller contained in this Agreement to be
inaccurate in any material respect and (b) the failure of the Seller to comply
with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant to be complied with by
it hereunder. No such notification shall affect the representations or
warranties of the parties or the conditions to their respective obligations
hereunder. The Company shall have the right to disclose additional matters
from time to time prior to the Closing that would have been required to be
set forth in the Disclosure Schedules, provided that such supplemental
disclosure shall not result in a waiver by the Buyer of any of its rights or
remedies under this Agreement. 

4.5 Company Transaction Costs. No later than three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Seller shall provide the amount, in the aggregate, of
all Company Transaction Costs that are to be paid or caused to be paid at
Closing and shall provide the Buyer with a certificate setting forth (a) the
identity of each Person that is to be paid at Closing; (b) the amount owed or
to be owed to each such Person; and (c) the bank account and wire transfer
information for each such Person.

 



21 4.6 No Solicitation.

 

(a) Until the earlier of (i) the Closing, or (ii) the date of termination of
this Agreement pursuant to the provisions of  _Section 9.1_ hereof, neither
the Seller nor any of the Sellers Affiliates shall (nor shall the Seller
permit any of its or the Companys officers, directors, employees,
stockholders, agents, representatives or Affiliates to), directly or
indirectly, take any of the following actions with any party other than the
Buyer and its designees: (A) solicit, encourage, seek, entertain, support,
assist, initiate or participate in any inquiry, negotiations, discussions,
or enter into any agreement, with respect to any offer or proposal to acquire
all or any material part of the business, properties or technologies of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any amount of membership interests of
the Company or equity interests of any Subsidiary (whether or not
outstanding), whether by merger, purchase of assets, purchase of membership
interests of the Company, tender offer, license or otherwise, or effect any
such transaction, (B) disclose any information not customarily disclosed to
any Person concerning the business, technologies or properties of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or afford to any Person access to their respective
properties, technologies, books or records, not customarily afforded such
access, (C) assist or cooperate with any Person to make any proposal to
purchase all or any part of the membership interests of the Company or assets
of the Company or any Subsidiary, or (D) enter into any agreement with
any Person providing for the acquisition of the Company or any Subsidiary
(other than inventory in the ordinary course of business), whether by merger,
purchase of assets, purchase of membership interests of the Company, license,
tender offer or otherwise. In the event that the Seller, the Company or any
of the Sellers or Companys Affiliates shall receive, prior to the Effective
Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.1_
hereof, any offer, proposal, or request, directly or indirectly, of the type
referenced in clause (A), (C), or (D) above, or any request for disclosure or
access as referenced in clause (B) above, the Seller shall immediately (x)
suspend any discussion with such offeror or party with regard to such offers,
proposals, or requests and (y) notify the Buyer thereof, including information
as to identity of the offeror or the party making any such offer or proposal
and the specific terms of such offer or proposal, as the case may be, and
such other information related thereto as the Buyer may reasonably request.

 

(b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that the provisions of this _Section 4.6_ were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
by the parties hereto that the Buyer shall be entitled to seek an immediate
injunction or injunctions, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of
money damages as a remedy and without the necessity of posting any bond or
other security, to prevent breaches of the provisions of this _Section 4.6_
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of
the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which the Buyer may be entitled at law or in equity.
Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth above by any officer, director, agent, representative
or Affiliate of the Seller, the Company or any Subsidiary shall be deemed to
be a breach of this Agreement by the Seller.

 

4.7 Non-Competition.

(a) For a period of five (5) years following the Closing, neither the Seller
nor any of the Sellers Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly, through any
person, entity or contractual arrangement:

(i) sell, transfer, assign, or otherwise dispose of, any dark fiber; or

 



22 (ii) sell any wavelength service(s) that is solely provided on the fiber
provided by the Company to the Seller or its Affiliates as of the Closing
Date pursuant to an IRU or lease between the Company and the Seller.

 

(b) The Seller acknowledges that the covenants of the Seller set forth in this
_Section 4.7_ are an essential element of this Agreement and that any breach
by the Seller of any provision of this _Section 4.7_ will result in
irreparable injury to the Buyer. The Seller acknowledges that in the event of
such a breach, in addition to all other remedies available at law, the Buyer
shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunctive relief, as
well as such other damages as may be appropriate. The Seller has independently
consulted with their counsel and after such consultation agrees that
the covenants set forth in this _Section 4.7_ are reasonable and proper to
protect the legitimate interests of the Buyer.

 

(c) If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the character,
duration or geographical scope of the provisions of this  _Section 4.7_ are
unreasonable, it is the intention and the agreement of the parties hereto that
these provisions shall be construed by the court in such a manner as to impose
only those restrictions on the Sellers conduct that are reasonable in light
of the circumstances and as are necessary to assure to the Buyer the benefits
of this Agreement. If, in any judicial proceeding, a court shall refuse to
enforce all of the separate covenants of this _Section 4.7_ because taken
together they are more extensive than necessary to assure to the Buyer the
intended benefits of this Agreement, it is expressly understood and agreed by
the parties hereto that the provisions hereof that, if eliminated, would
permit the remaining separate provisions to be enforced in such proceeding,
shall be deemed eliminated, for the purposes of such proceeding, from this
Agreement.

4.8 Audited Financials. If the Closing Date is on or before December 31, 2012,
Seller shall provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
respective officers, employees and advisors (including legal and accounting
advisors) of the Seller, the Company and its Subsidiaries to provide to the
Buyer all cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with
preparing and furnishing the Buyer an audited balance sheet for the Company
and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and a reviewed balance sheet for
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the quarter ended September, 30, 2012,
and the related audited and reviewed, as applicable, statements of income,
retained earnings, members equity and changes in financial position of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, together with all related notes and schedules
thereto (the " _Company Audited Financial Statements_ "). If the Closing Date
is on or after January 1, 2013, Seller shall instead provide Company Audited
Financial Statements as of December 31, 2012. The Sellers shall promptly
supplement any of the information provided pursuant to this  _Section 4.8_
if such information contains any material misstatement or omission. The fees
of Sellers accountant in preparing the Company Audited Financial Statements
shall be paid by the Buyer.

 

ARTICLE V

 

COVENANTS OF THE BUYER

5.1 Notification of Certain Matters. The Buyer shall give prompt written
notice to the Seller of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event
of which the Buyer has Knowledge that has caused any representation or
warranty of the Buyer contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate
in any material respect and (b) the failure of the Buyer to comply with or
satisfy in any material respect any covenant to be complied with by it
hereunder. No such notification shall affect the representations or warranties
of the parties or the conditions to their respective obligations hereunder.

 



23 5.2 Employee Matters.

 

(a) The Buyer shall take such action as may be necessary so that on and after
the Closing, and for one (1) year thereafter, officers and employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries who remain after the Closing in the employ of the
Company or its Subsidiaries are, as the Buyer may determine from time to time,
provided employee benefits which, in the aggregate, are substantially similar
to those made available by the Buyer to officers and employees of the Buyer
and its Subsidiaries having similar responsibilities and positions. For
purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting in benefits provided by the
Buyer to such officers and employees, the Buyer shall provide that the
officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be credited
with their years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and any
predecessors thereof to the extent service with the Buyer and its
Subsidiaries and any predecessors thereof is taken into account under the
plans of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries. The eligibility of any officer or
employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries to participate in any
welfare benefit plan or program of the Buyer shall not be subject to any
exclusions for any pre-existing conditions if such individual has met the
participation requirements of similar benefit plans and programs of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. The Buyer shall provide that all individuals
eligible to participate in any plan or arrangement contemplated above shall be
immediately eligible to participate in the similar plan or arrangement
maintained by the Buyer or its Subsidiaries (or the same plan or arrangement
if still maintained). The Buyer shall provide that amounts paid before the
Closing by officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries under
any health plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall, after the
Closing, be taken into account in applying deductible and out-of-pocket
limits applicable under the health plans of the Buyer provided as of the
Closing to the same extent as if such amounts had been paid under such health
plans of the Buyer. Nothing contained in this _Section 5.2(a)_ shall create
any rights in any officer or employee or former officer or employee (including
any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
or the Surviving Corporation in respect of continued employment for any
specified period of any nature or kind whatsoever.

(b) Subject to the other provisions set forth in this _Section 5.2_, after
the Closing and subject to Applicable Law and the terms of any Employee
Benefit Plan, the Buyer may amend, modify or terminate any Employee Benefit
Plan in existence prior to the Closing. Nothing contained in this _Section
5.2_, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries any right to continued receipt of any
specific employee benefit, or shall constitute an amendment to or any other
modification of any Employee Benefit Plan. This _Section 5.2_ shall inure
exclusively to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties to this
Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 5.2_ shall confer any rights or remedies
of any kind or description upon any officer or employee, or their respective
successors and assigns.

 



24 5.3 Access to Information. From and after the Closing, the Buyer shall (and
shall cause the Company and each of its Subsidiaries and other Affiliates
to), during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, make available
and provide the Seller and its respective representatives (including, without
limitation, counsel and independent auditors) with access to the facilities
and properties of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries and to all
information, files, documents and records (written and computer) relating to
the Company and its Subsidiaries or any of their businesses or operations for
any and all periods prior to and including the Closing Date that they may
require with respect to any reasonable business purpose (including, without
limitation, any tax matter) or in connection with any claim, dispute, action,
cause of action, investigation or proceeding of any kind by or against any
Person, and shall (and shall cause the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
and other Affiliates) cooperate fully with the Seller and its respective
representatives (including counsel and independent auditors) in connection
with the foregoing, at the sole cost and expense of the Seller, including,
without limitation, by making tax, accounting and financial personnel and
other appropriate employees and officers of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries available to the Seller and its respective representatives
(including counsel and independent auditors), with regard to any reasonable
business purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer shall not be
required to (and shall not be required to cause the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries and other Affiliates to) grant access or furnish information to
the Seller and its representatives to the extent that such access or
disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of its customers, would
jeopardize an attorney/client or attorney work product privilege, or is
prohibited by law or an existing contract or agreement. The Seller shall not
have access to personnel records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
relating to individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or
other information that in the Buyers good faith opinion is sensitive or the
disclosure of which could subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
risk of liability; __provided that__ the Seller shall not be prohibited from
accessing such information pursuant to a valid court order. In addition, the
Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its auditors, at
Buyers expense, to furnish the Buyer and the Company and their financing
sources all financial statements, pro forma financial statements and other
financial data and financial information of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
including all financial statements and financial and other data of the type
required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act for
registered offerings of debt securities, and of the type and form customarily
included in offering documents used in private placements under Rule 144A of
the Securities Act (including pro forma financial information), and other
documents required to satisfy any customary negative assurance opinion, to
consummate a financing, together with customary consents and comfort letters
by auditors of the Company.

5.4 Tax Matters.

 

(a) Tax Returns. The Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and shall
timely file, or cause to be timely filed, all tax returns of the Company and
its Subsidiaries that become due prior to the Closing Date. The Buyer shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared, and shall timely file, or cause to be timely
filed, all other tax returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Buyer will
provide the Seller with a copy of any such tax return that relates to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period prior to the due date for such return for Sellers review
and approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). Not later than five (5) days prior to the due date for the
filing of any tax return that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, the Seller
shall pay to the Buyer the amount of taxes shown due on such return (or the
portion of such taxes allocable to the Seller pursuant to _Section 5.4(d)_)
to the extent the Seller is obligated to pay such amounts pursuant to _Section
5.4(b)_.

 



25 (b) The Sellers Obligations. Except to the extent that any liability for
taxes is specifically taken into account in determining Net Working Capital,
the Seller shall be responsible for and pay, and shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Buyer and the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to (i)
any and all taxes imposed on the Company or its Subsidiaries, or for which
the Company or a Subsidiary is liable with respect to any periods ending on or
before, or, to the extent apportioned pursuant to _Section 5.4(d)_, including
the Closing Date, (ii) all taxes arising out of a breach of the
representations, warranties or covenants contained in _Section 3.1(o)_, (iii)
all sales, use, real property transfer, real property gains, transfer, stamp,
registration, documentary, recording or similar taxes resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) any costs or expenses
with respect to taxes indemnified hereunder. Any indemnity required to be made
by the Seller pursuant to this  _Section 5.4(b)_ shall be made within thirty
(30) days of written notice from the Buyer.

(c) The Buyers Obligations. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section
5.4_, from and after the Closing Date, the Buyer and the Company shall be
solely responsible for the payment or discharge of all taxes imposed on the
Company or its Subsidiaries for (i) all periods beginning after the Closing
Date or, to the extent apportioned pursuant to _Section 5.4(d)_, including
the Closing Date and (ii) any costs or expenses with respect to taxes
indemnified hereunder. The Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold the Seller
and its Affiliates harmless from any and all taxes that are the Buyers
responsibility pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence. Any indemnity
payment required to be made by the Buyer pursuant to this _Section 5.4(c)_
shall be made within thirty (30) days of written notice from the Seller.

(d) Apportionment. For the sole purpose of appropriately apportioning any
taxes relating to a period that includes (but that would not end on) the
Closing Date, the Buyer and the Seller will, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, elect with the relevant taxing authority to treat for all
purposes the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period of the Company
and its Subsidiaries. In the case where applicable Law does not permit
the Buyer and the Seller to treat the Closing Date as the last day of a
taxable period, then, for purposes of this Agreement, the portion of such tax
that is apportioned to the Company or a Subsidiary for the part of such
taxable period that ends on the Closing Date shall be (i) in the case of a
tax that is not transaction-based, the total amount of such tax for the full
taxable period that includes the Closing Date multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days from the beginning of such taxable
period up to and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the total number of days in such full taxable period, and (ii) in the case of
transaction-based taxes, including any taxes based on net income, the tax
that would be due with respect to such partial period, if such partial period
were a full taxable period, apportioning income, gain, expenses, loss,
depreciation, deductions and credits equitably based on an interim closing of
the books.

 



26 (e) Contests. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Contest" is any audit, court
proceeding or other dispute with respect to any tax matter that affects the
Company or its Subsidiaries. Unless the Buyer has previously received written
notice from the Seller of the existence of such Contest, the Buyer shall give
written notice to the Seller of the existence of any Contest relating to a
tax matter that is the Sellers responsibility under _Section 5.4(b)_ within
ten days from the receipt by the Buyer of any written notice of such Contest,
but no failure to give such notice shall relieve the Seller of any liability
hereunder. Unless the Seller has previously received written notice from the
Buyer of the existence of such Contest, the Seller shall give written notice
to the Buyer of the existence of any Contest for which the Buyer has
responsibility within ten days from the receipt by the Seller of any written
notice of such Contest. The Buyer, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the
other, agree, in each case at no cost to the other party, to cooperate with
the other and the others representatives in a prompt and timely manner in
connection with any Contest. Such cooperation shall include, but not be
limited to, making available to the other party, during normal business
hours, all books, records, returns, documents, files, other information
(including, without limitation, working papers and schedules), officers or
employees (without substantial interruption of employment) or other relevant
information necessary or useful in connection with any Contest requiring any
such books, records and files. The Seller shall, at its election, have the
right to represent the Companys or a Subsidiarys interests in any Contest
relating to a period ending on or before the Closing Date, to employ counsel
of its choice at its expense and to control the conduct of such Contest,
including settlement or other disposition thereof; provided, however, that the
Buyer shall have the right to consult with the Seller regarding any such
Contest at the Buyers own expense and provided, further, that any settlement
or other disposition of any such Contest may only be with the consent of the
Buyer, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. The Buyer shall have
the sole right to control the conduct of any Contest with respect to any
period ending after the Closing Date.

(f) Price Adjustment. All indemnification payments made under this Agreement
shall be treated as purchase price adjustments for tax purposes to the extent
permitted under applicable Laws. 

(g) Controlling Provisions. In the event of any conflict between the
provisions of this _Section 5.4_ and the provisions of _Article X_ , the
provisions of this _Section 5.4_ shall control with respect to taxes.

5.5 First Communications Name. The Buyer agrees that no later than sixty (60)
days after the Closing Date, it shall take all action necessary to discontinue
use of the "First Communications" corporate or tradename or trademark; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer shall have a reasonable period of time
after the Closing Date to remove any "First Communications" trademarks, names
or logos from printed advertising materials.

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

9.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Acquisition may be
abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of the Buyer and the Seller; or

(b) by either the Buyer or the Seller:

(i) if there shall have been any breach by the other party of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement,
which breach (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition to the Closing
hereunder and (B) either (1) cannot be cured or (2) if it can be cured, has
not been cured prior to 5:00 p.m. on the date immediately preceding the
Termination Date (the " _Cure Period_ "); and, without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, there shall be no Cure Period for the Buyers failure to
obtain all funds on or prior to the Closing Date necessary to consummate the
Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents in accordance with the terms and conditions
hereof and thereof (which failure shall constitute a material breach of this
Agreement);

 



34 (ii) if a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority
shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action (which
order, decree or ruling the Buyer and the Seller shall use their reasonable
best efforts to lift), in each case permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents and such order, decree, ruling or other action
shall have become final and nonappealable; provided, however, that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this  _Section 9.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be
available to any party who did not use reasonable best efforts to lift any
such order, decree, ruling or other action or whose failure to comply with
_Section 6.1_ has been the primary cause of the condition set forth in this
_Section 9.1(b)(ii)_ not being satisfied; or

(iii) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before 5:00 p.m. on April
30, 2013 (the " _Termination Date_ "); provided however that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.1(b)(iii)_ shall not be
available if the failure of the party so requesting termination to fulfill
any obligation under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall
have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such
date.

 

9.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
by either the Seller or the Buyer as provided in  _Section 9.1_, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or
obligation hereunder on the part of the Buyer or the Seller or their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees or shareholders,
except that _Article I_, this _Article IX_ and _Article XI_ shall survive
such termination.

9.3 Fees and Expenses Following Termination. If this Agreement is terminated
(a) by the Seller pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ or (b) by the Buyer for any
reason not set forth in _Section 9.1_, then in either such case the Buyer
shall, within three (3) Business Days after such termination, pay to the
Seller the Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds. In
addition, the Buyer shall reimburse the Seller for its out-of-pocket
legal, accounting, investment banker and other professional fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated herein within three
(3) Business Days after the Seller notifies the Buyer of the amount thereof.
The Seller and the Buyer acknowledge and hereby agree that the provisions of
this _Section 9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without such provisions the Seller and the Buyer
would not have entered into this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges and agrees that the Termination Fee provided for in this _Section
9.3_ constitutes liquidated damages, and not a penalty, and is reasonable in
the event of a termination by the Buyer for any reason not provided for in
_Section 9.1_. The payment by the Buyer of the Termination Fee pursuant to
this _Section 9.3_ shall be the sole remedy of the Seller with respect to the
termination by the Buyer or any breach of this Agreement by the Buyer. If the
Buyer shall fail to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to this
_Section 9.3_, and, in order to obtain such payment, the Seller makes a claim
against the Buyer that results in a judgment against the Buyer, the Buyer
shall pay to the Seller the reasonable costs and expenses of the Seller
(including its reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred or accrued in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in
this _Section 9.3_ at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as
published in The Wall Street Journal. Any interest payable hereunder shall be
calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be
paid until (but excluding) the date of actual payment, and on the basis of a
360-day year.

 



35 9.4 Return of Information. Within ten (10) Business Days following
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.1_, the Buyer
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and representatives to, return to the
Seller, or destroy, all Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) furnished or made available to the Buyer and its Affiliates and
representatives by or on behalf of the Seller, and all analyses, compilations,
data, studies, notes, interpretations, memoranda or other documents prepared
by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates or representatives (including
electronic copies thereof) that refer to, relate to, discuss or contain, or
are based on, in whole or in part, any such Evaluation Material. The Buyer
shall deliver a certificate signed by its Chief Executive Officer, which
certificate shall provide evidence reasonably substantiating the return or
destruction of the Information as required under this _Section 9.4_.

"):

(a) the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Buyer in _Section 3.2_, or in any certificate delivered by or on behalf of
the Buyer to the Seller in connection with this Agreement (giving effect to
any limitations or qualifications thereto, including materiality or Material
Adverse Effect, for purposes of determining whether a breach has occurred but
not for purposes of determining Losses therefrom); or

 

(b) any nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement made by the
Buyer under this Agreement.

 

10.4 Limitations.

(a) Minimum Loss. The Buyer Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to be
indemnified for Losses pursuant to _Section 10.2_ (other than pursuant to
_Section 10.2(c))_, unless and until the aggregate amount of all such Losses
exceeds $550,000, or with respect to any inaccuracy or breach of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.1(o)_ relating to
taxes, and the covenants made by the Seller in  _Section 5.4_ relating to
taxes, unless and until the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds
$100,000 (in each case, as applicable, the " _Minimum Loss_ ") and otherwise
satisfy all other requirements under this  _Section 10.4_. After the Minimum
Loss is exceeded, Buyer Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to be paid the
entire amount of any Losses pursuant to _Section 10.2_ from the first dollar
thereof without regard to the Minimum Loss, subject to the limitations on
recovery and recourse set forth in this Agreement.

(b) Limitation as to Time. No Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any
Losses that are indemnifiable under _Section 10.2(a)_ or _Section 10.3(a)_

prior to the applicable Expiration Date.

(c) Sole and Exclusive Remedy; Recourse Against Escrowed Funds.

(i) Except as provided in _Section 5.4_, each of the Buyer and the Seller

to claims for Losses or otherwise, including those set forth in _Sections
10.2_ and _10.3_ , in connection with, arising out of or resulting from the
subject matter of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(except for the equitable remedies described in _Section 11.18_ and claims
arising out of fraud and for claims for injunctive relief) shall be in
accordance with, and limited solely to indemnification under, the provisions
of this _Article X_.

 



37 (ii) Until such time as the Indemnification Escrow Amount is exhausted or
released, Buyer Indemnified Persons shall be prohibited from asserting a
claim against the Seller for Losses.

(d) Maximum Claims. The maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses
which may be recovered from an indemnifying party arising out of or relating
to the causes set forth in _Section 10.2(a)_ or _Section 10.3(a)_, as the
case may be, shall be an amount equal to $16,500,000; provided, that the
foregoing clause shall not apply to Losses arising out of or relating to the
inaccuracy or breach of any Fundamental Representation, the representations
and warranties set forth in  _Section 3.1(o)_ relating to taxes, the
covenants made by Seller in _Section 5.4_ relating to taxes or to any
representation in the event of fraud, intentional misrepresentation or

(e) Characterization of Payments. For all tax purposes, the parties agree to
treat (and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to treat) any
indemnity payment under this Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase Price
payable to the Seller pursuant to _Article II_ unless a final and
nonappealable determination by an appropriate Governmental Authority
(which shall include the execution of an IRS Form 870-AD or successor form)
provides otherwise; provided that the Indemnifying Persons prior written
consent (which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) will
be obtained by the Indemnified Person who seeks to accept, via a settlement
or compromise with any such Governmental Authority, a position that is
contrary to treatment of an indemnity payment as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price payable to the Seller pursuant to  _Article II_.

10.5 Third Party Claims.

(a) Promptly after receipt by any Indemnified Person of notice of the
commencement or assertion of any action, proceeding, demand, claim or
investigation by a third party or circumstances which, with the lapse of
time, such Indemnified Person believes is likely to give rise to an action,
proceeding, demand, claim or investigation by a third party (an " _Asserted
Liability_ ") that may result in a Loss, such Indemnified Person shall
give written notice thereof (the " _Claims Notice_ ") to the Indemnifying
Persons. The Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable
detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary) of the Loss
that has been or may be suffered. The failure to provide such notice,
however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations
under this _Article X_ unless and only to the extent that the Indemnifying
party is materially prejudiced by such failure.

(b) If the Indemnifying Persons acknowledge in writing their obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Persons against any and all Losses that may result
from an Asserted Liability, the Indemnifying Persons shall be, subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Section 10.5_, entitled to assume control of
and appoint lead counsel for such defense; provided, however, that the
Indemnifying Persons shall not have the right to assume control of the defense
of any Asserted Liability (i) to the extent that the object of such Asserted
Liability is to obtain an injunction, restraining order, declaratory relief
or other non-monetary relief against the Indemnified Person which, if
successful, would materially adversely affect the business, operations,
assets, or financial condition of the Indemnified Person, or (ii) if the
named parties to any such action or proceeding (including any impleaded
parties) include both the Indemnified Persons and the Indemnifying Persons and
the former shall have been advised in writing by counsel (with a copy to the
Indemnifying Persons) that there are one or more legal or equitable defenses
available to them that are different from or additional to those available to
Indemnifying Persons; provided, further, that to exercise such rights the
Indemnifying Person must give notice to the Indemnified Person within 30 days
after receipt of any such Claims Notice whether it is agreeing to accept
responsibility and assuming control of and appointing lead counsel for such
defense. If the Indemnifying Person does not give such notice within such
30-day period or either proviso in this _Section 10.5(b)_ applies, then the
Indemnified Person shall have the right to assume control of the defense
thereof at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person.

 



38 (c) If the Indemnifying Person shall assume the control of the defense of the
Asserted Liability in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 10.5_,
(i) the Indemnifying Person shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Person before entering into any settlement, compromise, admission
or acknowledgement of the validity of such Asserted Liability if the
settlement does not unconditionally release the Indemnified Person from all
liabilities and obligations with respect to such Asserted Liability or the
settlement imposes injunctive or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Person and (ii) the Indemnified Person shall be entitled to
participate, at its own cost and expense, in the defense of such Asserted
Liability and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose. The
fees, costs and expenses of any such separate counsel to the Indemnified
Person pursuant to this _Section 10.5_ shall be paid by the Indemnified
Person.

(d) If the Indemnified Person shall assume the control of the defense of any
Asserted Liability in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 10.5_,
the Indemnified Party shall have the sole right to assume the defense of and
settle such Asserted Liability. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to participate, at its cost and expense,
in the defense of such Asserted Liability and to employ separate counsel of
its choice for such purpose, and the Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to
contest the reasonableness of any such settlement to which it does not
consent.

 

(e) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Asserted Liability and shall
furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony
(subject to any applicable confidentiality agreement), and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

10.6 Direct Claims. In any case in which an Indemnified Person
seeks indemnification hereunder which is not subject to _Section 10.5_
because no Asserted Liability is involved, the Indemnified Person shall notify
the Indemnifying Person in writing of any Losses that such Indemnified Person
claims are subject to indemnification under the terms hereof. The failure of
the Indemnified Person to exercise promptness in such notification shall not
amount to a waiver of such claim unless and only to the extent that the
resulting delay materially and adversely prejudices the position of the
Indemnifying Person with respect to such claim.

 



39 10.7 Other Claims. In connection with any Losses for which an Indemnified
Person may seek indemnification under this _Article X_ , such Indemnified
Person shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to seek and pursue any
available insurance coverage or other claims against third parties that such
Indemnified Person may have in respect of such Losses and the amount of
insurance proceeds or other recoveries actually received by the Indemnified
Person (less any deductibles and the related reasonable out-of-pocket fees and
expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in recovering such amounts)
shall not be included in Losses that such Indemnified Person may recover under
this _Article X_ and if the Indemnified Person receives any such amounts
subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Person in
respect of such Losses, then such Indemnified Person shall promptly reimburse
the Indemnifying Person for any payment made or expense incurred by such
Indemnifying Person in connection with providing such indemnification payment
up to the above amounts so received by the Indemnified Person.

10.8 Remedies Not Affected by Investigation or Knowledge. If the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, the Buyer expressly reserves the right to
seek indemnity or other remedy pursuant to _Article X_ of this Agreement for
any Losses arising out of or relating to any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein, notwithstanding any
investigation by, or knowledge of, such party in respect of any fact or
circumstances that reveals the occurrence of any such breach, whether before
or after the execution and delivery hereof.

of an item in one section of the Disclosure Schedules as an exception to a
particular representation or warranty shall be deemed adequately disclosed as
an exception with respect to all other representations or warranties to the
extent that the relevance of such item to such representations or warranties
is reasonably apparent on the face of such item, notwithstanding the presence

to such other representations or warranties or an appropriate cross reference
thereto.

(c) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Disclosure Schedules is
not intended and shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment of
the materiality of such amounts or items, nor shall the same be used in any

construed or deemed to expand the scope of any representation or warranty made
elsewhere in this Agreement or to make any additional representation or

IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE, CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION
OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER, RELATED TO, BASED ON,
OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF, WHETHER
NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT OR CONTRACT OR
OTHERWISE. ANY PARTY HERETO MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF
THIS _SECTION 11.16_ WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF
EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 



44 11.17 Consent to Jurisdiction; Venue.

the State of New York and the Federal courts of the United States sitting in
the State of New York and any appellate court from any such state or Federal
court, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agree that all claims with
respect to any such claim may be heard and determined in such State court
or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. The parties hereto
agree that a final judgment in any such claim shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in any other jurisdiction by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that
any party may otherwise have to bring any claim relating to this Agreement or
any related matter against any other party or its assets or properties in the
courts of any jurisdiction.

 

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any related matter
in any New York state or Federal court located in the State of New York and
the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such claim in any
such court.

11.18 Enforcement. Except as contemplated by _Section 9.3_, the parties
hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that,

injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
