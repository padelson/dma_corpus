iii _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_



THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is made and entered into
as of October 27, 2005, by and between FLORIDA CHOICE BANKSHARES, INC.
("FCB"), a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of
Florida, with its principal office located in Mount Dora, Florida, and
ALABAMA NATIONAL BANCORPORATION ("ANB"), a corporation organized and existing
under the laws of the State of Delaware, with its principal office located in
Birmingham, Alabama.



_Preamble_  



The Boards of Directors of FCB and ANB are of the opinion that the
transactions described herein are in the best interests of the parties and
their respective stockholders. This Agreement provides for the merger (the
"Merger") of FCB with and into ANB. At the Effective Time of such Merger,
the outstanding shares of the capital stock of FCB shall be converted into
the right to receive shares of the common stock of ANB (except as provided
herein). As a result, stockholders of FCB shall become stockholders of ANB.
The Merger is subject to the approvals of the stockholders of FCB, the
Florida Department of Financial Services and the Federal Reserve Board, and
the satisfaction of certain other conditions described in this Agreement. It
is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that, for federal income
tax purposes, the merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the IRC.



Certain terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section 11.1 of this
Agreement.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above and the mutual warranties,
representations, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the parties agree
as follows:



ARTICLE 1 _ _

_TRANSACTIONS AND TERMS OF MERGER_



1.1 _Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, FCB shall be merged with and into ANB in accordance with the
provisions of Section 252 of the DGCL and Section 607.1107 of the FBCA and
with the effect provided in Sections 259 and 261 of the DGCL and the
applicable provisions of the FBCA. ANB shall be the Surviving Corporation
resulting from the Merger and shall continue to be governed by the Laws of the
State of Delaware. The Merger shall be consummated pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, which has been approved and adopted by the ANB Board and the
FCB Board.



1.2 _Time and Place of Closing_. The place of Closing shall be at the offices
of Maynard, Cooper and Gale, P.C., Birmingham, Alabama, or such other place as
may be mutually agreed upon by the Parties. Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing by the
chief executive officers of each Party, the Closing will take place at 9:00
A.M. Central Standard Time on the last business day of the month in which the
closing conditions set forth in Article 9 below have been satisfied (or
waived pursuant to Section 11.4 of this Agreement); provided, however, that
the Closing will not occur earlier than March 15, 2006, unless otherwise
mutually agreed upon in writing by the chief executive officers of each Party.



 

1 1.3 _Effective Time_. The Merger and other transactions provided for in this
Agreement shall become effective: (a) on the date and at the time that the
later of the following shall occur: (i) the Certificate of Merger reflecting
the Merger shall be accepted for filing by the Secretary of State of Delaware,
and (ii) the Articles of Merger reflecting the Merger shall be accepted for
filing by the Secretary of State of Florida, or (b) on such date and at such
time subsequent to the date and time established pursuant to subsection 1.3(a)
above as may be specified by the Parties in the Certificate of Merger and
Articles of Merger (provided that such subsequent date and time shall not be
later than a time on the 30th day after the date that the Certificate of
Merger is filed) (such time is hereinafter referred to as the "Effective
Time"). Unless ANB and FCB otherwise mutually agree in writing, the Parties
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Effective Time to
occur on the date of Closing.



1.4 _Director s Agreements_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement and as a material condition hereto, each member of the FCB Board and
each member of the Board of Directors of FCB Bank has executed and delivered
an Agreement in the form attached as _Exhibit A_ hereto (a
"Directors Agreement").



ARTICLE 2 __

_EFFECT OF MERGER_



2.1 _Certificate of Incorporation_. The Restated Certificate of Incorporation
of ANB in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time.



2.2 _Bylaws_. The Bylaws of ANB in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation immediately following
the Effective Time, until otherwise amended or repealed.



2.3 _Officers and Directors_. The incumbent officers and directors of ANB
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers and directors of
the Surviving Corporation.



ARTICLE 3 __

_CONVERSION OF CONSTITUENTS  CAPITAL SHARES_



3.1 _Manner of Converting Shares_. Subject to the provisions of this Article
3, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of ANB, FCB or the holders of any shares thereof, the
shares of the constituent corporations shall be converted as follows:



(a) each share of ANB Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding from and after
the Effective Time.



 

2 (b) (1) Subject to the potential adjustment provided for in Section 3.1(b)(2)
and/or Section 3.2 below, each share of FCB Common Stock (excluding shares
held by any FCB Company, other than in a fiduciary capacity or as a result of
debts previously contracted, and excluding shares held by stockholders who
perfect their dissenters rights of appraisal as provided in Section 3.4 of
this Agreement) issued and outstanding at the Effective Time shall cease to be
outstanding and shall be converted into and exchanged for the right to receive
0.6079 shares of ANB Common Stock (as such may be adjusted pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, the "Exchange Ratio"); provided that, subject to the
election rights set forth in Section 3.1(c) below, each holder of FCB Common
Stock shall have an opportunity to elect to receive cash consideration for
such holders shares of FCB Common Stock in lieu of receiving ANB Common
Stock.



(2) FCB shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, through a resolution
adopted by a majority of the entire FCB Board, if both of the
following conditions are satisfied:



(i) the Average Determination Price shall be less than the product of 0.85
and the Starting Price; and



(ii) the quotient obtained by dividing the Average Determination Price by the
Starting Price (such number being referred to herein as the "ANB Ratio")
shall be less than the quotient obtained by dividing the Index Price on the
Determination Date by the Index Price on the Starting Date and subtracting
0.15 from such quotient (such number being referred to herein as the "Index
Ratio").



If FCB elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence, it shall give prompt written notice thereof to ANB at any
time during the five business day period commencing on the business day
following the Determination Date; provided that such notice of election to
terminate may be withdrawn at any time within the aforementioned five business
day period. During the five business day period commencing on the business day
following the day on which ANB receives such notice, ANB shall have the
option of adjusting the Exchange Ratio to equal the lesser of (A) a number
equal to a quotient (rounded to the nearest four decimal places), the
numerator of which is the product of 0.85, the Starting Price and the Exchange
Ratio (as then in effect) and the denominator of which is the Average
Determination Price, and (B) a number equal to a quotient (rounded to the
nearest four decimal places), the numerator of which is the Index Ratio
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) and the denominator of
which is the ANB Ratio. If ANB makes this election within such five business
day period, it shall give prompt written notice to FCB of such election and
the revised Exchange Ratio, whereupon no termination shall have occurred
pursuant to this Section 3.1(b)(2), and this Agreement shall remain in effect
in accordance with its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio shall have been so
modified), and any references in this Agreement to the "Exchange Ratio" shall
thereafter be deemed to refer to the Exchange Ratio of this Section 3.1(b)(2).
If the Closing Date would naturally occur during ANBs five business day
option period pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Closing Date shall
be extended until a date selected by ANB no more than ten (10) business days
following the close of such five-day period (unless ANB does not exercise its
option and the Agreement is thereby terminated ).



 

3 FCB and the FCB Subsidiaries shall not, and shall use their best efforts to
ensure that their respective executive officers, directors, and stockholders
who may be deemed an "affiliate" (as defined in SEC Rules 145 and 405) of FCB
do not, purchase or sell on NASDAQ, or submit a bid to purchase or an offer to
sell on NASDAQ, directly or indirectly, any shares of ANB Common Stock or any
options, rights or other securities convertible into shares of ANB Common
Stock during the determination period for the Average Determination Price.



For purposes of this Section 3.1(b)(2), the following terms shall have
the meanings indicated:



"Average Determination Price" means the price (rounded to two decimal places)
derived by adding the averages of the high and low sales price of one share of
ANB Common Stock as reported on NASDAQ on each of the ten (10) consecutive
trading days ending on the Determination Date, and dividing such sum by ten
(10).



"Determination Date" means the date on which the approval of the Federal
Reserve Board required for consummation of the Merger shall be received by
ANB, without regard to any requisite waiting periods in respect thereof.



"Index Price" on a given date means the closing price of the NASDAQ Bank
Index as reported by Bloomberg LP (symbol: CBNK).



"Starting Date" means October 27, 2005, the effective date of this Agreement.



"Starting Price" means $63.32, the closing sales price of one share of ANB
Common Stock as reported on NASDAQ on the trading day immediately prior to the
Starting Date.



If ANB declares or effects a stock split, stock dividend or similar
recapitalization between the Starting Date and the Determination Date, the
prices for the ANB Common Stock shall be appropriately adjusted for the
purposes of applying this Section 3.1(b)(2).



(c) (1) Holders of FCB Common Stock shall be provided with an opportunity to
elect to receive cash consideration in lieu of receiving ANB Common Stock
in the Merger, in accordance with the election procedures set forth below.
Holders who elect to receive cash in lieu of exchanging their shares of FCB
Common Stock for ANB Common Stock as specified below shall receive $39.52 for
each share of FCB Common Stock that is so converted (the "Per Share Cash
Consideration"). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the aggregate Per
Share Cash Consideration shall in all cases equal $5,120,000 (the "Fixed Cash
Amount"), unless and to the extent that ANB determines in its sole discretion
to increase such amount to a percentage not in excess of 20% of the sum of (i)
the product of (A) the number of shares of ANB Common Stock to be issued in
the Merger to holders of outstanding shares of FCB Common Stock as of the
Effective Time multiplied by (B) the Average Quoted Price, plus (ii) the
aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration.



(2) At ANBs election, either the Exchange Agent or FCBs transfer agent shall
mail an election form in such form as ANB and FCB shall mutually agree (the
"Election Form") with or following the issuance of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and at least 20 days



 

4 prior to the date of the FCB Stockholders Meeting or on such other date as
ANB and FCB shall mutually agree (the "Mailing Date") to each holder of
record of FCB Common Stock for such FCB Stockholders Meeting. Each Election
Form shall permit a holder (or the beneficial owner through appropriate and
customary documentation and instructions) of FCB Common Stock to elect to
receive cash with respect to all or a portion of such holders FCB Common
Stock (the shares as to which the election is made being referred to as "Cash
Election Shares").



(3) Any shares of FCB Common Stock with respect to which the holder shall
not have submitted to the Exchange Agent an effective, properly completed
Election Form prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the day before the FCB
Stockholders Meeting (or such other time and date as ANB and FCB may mutually
agree) (the "Election Deadline"), and any shares of FCB Common Stock with
respect to which the holder shall have submitted an Election Form prior to the
Election Deadline but with respect to which such holder shall have elected
_not_ to receive cash, shall be converted into ANB Common Stock at the
Effective Time, as set forth in Section 3.1(b) of this Agreement (all such
shares described in this sub-section (3) being referred to as "ANB Common
Stock Election Shares").

 



(4) Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the person submitting such
Election Form at or prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an Election
Form is revoked and a replacement Election Form not submitted prior to the
Election Deadline, the shares of FCB Common Stock represented by such Election
Form shall become ANB Common Stock Election Shares. Subject to the terms of
this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have
reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change
has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the
Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding
such matters shall be binding and conclusive. Neither ANB nor the Exchange
Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any person of any defect in an
Election Form.



(5) Within 5 business days after the Election Deadline, unless the Effective
Time has not yet occurred, in which case as soon thereafter as practicable,
the allocation among the holders of FCB Common Stock in accordance with the
Election Forms shall be effected by the Exchange Agent as follows:



(i) _Cash Elections Equal to the Fixed Cash Amount_. If the amount of cash
that would be paid upon conversion in the Merger of the Cash Election Shares
(the "Potential Cash Payments") is equal to the Fixed Cash Amount, then:



(1) each Cash Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(1); and



(2) each ANB Common Stock Election Share shall be converted into the right to
receive ANB Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.1(b). 



(ii) _Cash Elections More Than the Fixed Cash Amount_. If the amount of the
Potential Cash Payments is greater than the Fixed Cash Amount, then:



(1) the number of Cash Election Shares designated by each holder of FCB Common
Stock who properly submitted an Election Form shall be 



 

5 automatically reduced to that number of shares equal to the product of (A) the
number of such holders Cash Election Shares designated in the Election Form
and (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the maximum number of Cash
Election Shares allowable such that the amount of the Potential Cash Payments
is equal to the Fixed Cash Amount, and the denominator of which is the total
number of Cash Election Shares designated in the Election Forms;



(2) each Cash Election Share remaining after adjustment pursuant to sub-
section (1) above shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(c)(1);



(3) each share of FCB Common Stock that would have been a Cash Election Share
but for the adjustment pursuant to sub-section (1) above shall automatically
be deemed to be an ANB Common Stock Election Share; and 



(4) each ANB Common Stock Election Share, including those so designated
pursuant to sub-section (ii)(3) above, shall be converted into the right to
receive ANB Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.1(b).



 

(iii) _Cash Elections Less Than the Fixed Cash Amount_. If the amount of the
Potential Cash Payments is less than the Fixed Cash Amount, then:



(1) the shortfall shall be allocated pro rata among the ANB Common Stock
Election Shares, such that all holders of FCB Common Stock will receive at
least a portion of the Merger consideration in cash. Specifically, each holder
of ANB Common Stock Election Shares (whether resulting from the fact that
such holder did not attempt to submit an Election Form, attempted to submit an
Election Form but did not comply with the applicable requirements, or properly
submitted an Election Form with an affirmative election to have fewer than
all shares of FCB Common Stock converted into cash) shall have the number of
such holders ANB Common Stock Election Shares reduced by a number of shares
equal to the product of (A) the number resulting from subtracting (x)
the total number of Cash Election Shares designated in all Election Forms
from (y) the minimum number of Cash Election Shares required such that the
amount of the Potential Cash Payments would equal the Fixed Cash Amount,
multiplied by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of such
holders ANB Common Stock Election Shares, and the denominator of which is the
total number of ANB Common Stock Election Shares held by all holders of FCB
Common Stock;



(2) each ANB Common Stock Election Share that is eliminated pursuant to sub-
section (1) above shall automatically, without the submission or amendment of
any Election Forms, be converted into a Cash Election Share for the benefit of
the applicable holder;



(3) each Cash Election Share, including those resulting from the conversion
procedure described in sub-sections (1) and (2) above, shall be



 

6 converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration pursuant
to Section 3.1(c)(1), such that the aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration is
equal to the Fixed Cash Amount; and



(4) each ANB Common Stock Election Share remaining after the adjustment and
conversion procedures described above shall be converted into the right to
receive ANB Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.1(b) of this Agreement.



(d) Pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Stock Option Committee of the
FCB Board prior to the date hereof, each outstanding and unexercised option to
purchase shares of FCB Common Stock pursuant to the FCB Stock Option Plans
(an "FCB Option") will cease to represent an option to purchase FCB Common
Stock at the Effective Time and will be converted automatically into an option
to purchase ANB Common Stock (each, an "ANB Option"), and ANB will assume
each FCB Option subject to its terms, including any acceleration in vesting
that will occur as a consequence of the Merger according to the instruments
governing the FCB Option; provided, however, that after the Effective Time: 



(1) the number of shares of ANB Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of
each FCB Option will equal the product of (A) the number of shares of FCB
Common Stock that were purchasable under the FCB Option immediately before the
Effective Time and (B) the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole
share;



(2) the per share exercise price for each FCB Option will equal the quotient
of (A) the per share exercise price of the FCB Option in effect immediately
before the Effective Time divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the
nearest cent; and



(3) where the context so requires, all references to FCB shall be deemed to
be references to ANB and its Subsidiaries, and all references to the FCB Board
shall be deemed to be references to the ANB Board (or the Compensation
Committee thereof).



Notwithstanding the foregoing, each FCB Option that is intended to be
an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the IRC) will be
adjusted in accordance with the requirements of Section 424 of the IRC. As
soon as practicable after the Effective Time, ANB shall file a Registration
Statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms), with
respect to the shares of ANB Common Stock subject to converted or substitute
FCB Options and shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness
of such registration statement (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses associated therewith) for so long as such converted
or substitute FCB Options remain outstanding.



In lieu of the assumption feature set forth above, any holder of an FCB Option
may elect to cancel such FCB Option as of the Effective Time and receive, in
exchange therefore, cash in an amount equal to the number of shares of FCB
Common Stock covered by



 

7 such FCB Option multiplied by the excess, if any, of (A) the product of the
Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Average Quoted Price over (B) the exercise
price per share of such FCB Option. Unless extended by ANB, any such election
to receive cash in exchange for an FCB Option must be provided in writing to
ANB no later than the Election Deadline. Concurrently with the execution of
this Agreement, the holders of FCB Options listed on _Schedule 3.1(d)_ hereto
have submitted to ANB irrevocable elections to refrain from exercising their
FCB Options and to exchange them for cash in accordance with this paragraph.
FCB will use commercially reasonable efforts to have the remaining holders of
FCB Options make this same election as soon as possible.



Subject to the ANB Options and the foregoing, the FCB Stock Option Plans and
all options or other rights to acquire FCB Common Stock issued
thereunder shall terminate at the Effective Time.



Any holder of an FCB Option that exercises such option prior to the Effective
Time will only be eligible to participate in the cash election procedure with
respect to the resulting shares of FCB Common Stock set forth in Section
3.1(c) above if such exercise is completed, and such holder becomes the
record holder of the resulting shares of FCB Common Stock, prior to the record
date for the FCB Stockholders Meeting. All shares of FCB Common Stock
resulting from exercises of FCB Options after such record date shall be
converted into ANB Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(1) above and shall
be deemed to be "ANB Common Stock Election Shares" for purposes of this
Agreement.



(e) Assuming (i) that no holders of FCB Common Stock exercise their
rights under the Dissenter Provisions, (ii) that there is no adjustment to
the Exchange Ratio pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(2) above or Section 3.2 below,
and (iii) that all holders of FCB Options elect to exchange their FCB Options
for cash and do not exercise such options, the holders of FCB Common Stock
(excluding holders of FCB Options) shall have the right to receive, in the
aggregate, a maximum of 1,481,000 shares of ANB Common Stock and $5,120,000 in
cash as a result of the Merger. 



(f) FCB will take such steps that may be required to cause the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any disposition of securities of FCB
(including derivative securities) by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act with respect to FCB to
be exempt under rule 16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act.



3.2  _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. In the event ANB changes the number of
shares of ANB Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time
as a result of a stock split, stock dividend or similar recapitalization with
respect to such stock and the record date therefor shall be prior to the
Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted as needed
to preserve the relative economic benefit to the Parties.



3.3 _Shares Held by FCB_. Each of the shares of FCB Common Stock held by any
FCB Company, other than in a fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts
previously contracted, shall be canceled and retired at the Effective Time and
no consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor.



 

8 3.4 _Dissenting Stockholders_. Any holder of shares of FCB Common Stock who
perfects his dissenters rights of appraisal in accordance with and as
contemplated by Section 607.1320 of the FBCA (the "Dissenter Provisions")
shall be entitled to receive the value of such shares in cash as determined
pursuant to such provision of Law; provided, however, that no such payment
shall be made to any dissenting stockholder unless and until such dissenting
stockholder has complied with the applicable provisions of the FBCA and
surrendered to the Surviving Corporation the certificate or certificates
representing the shares for which payment is being made; provided, further,
nothing contained in this Section 3.4 shall in any way limit the right of ANB
to terminate this Agreement and abandon the Merger pursuant to subsection
10.1(i) below. If any dissenting stockholder gives notice to FCB, FCB will
promptly give ANB notice thereof, and ANB will have the right to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands. FCB will
not, except with the prior written consent of ANB, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for
payment. In the event that after the Effective Time a dissenting stockholder
of FCB fails to perfect, or effectively withdraws or loses, his right to
appraisal and of payment for his shares, the Surviving Corporation shall issue
and deliver the consideration to which such holder of shares of FCB Common
Stock is entitled under this Article 3 (without interest) upon surrender by
such holder of the certificate or certificates representing shares of FCB
Common Stock held by him.



3.5 _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of ANB Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of certificates
for exchange; no dividend or distribution with respect to ANB Common Stock
shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share; and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a stockholder of ANB. In lieu of any such fractional
share, ANB shall pay to each former stockholder of FCB who otherwise would be
entitled to receive a fractional share of ANB Common Stock an amount in cash
(without interest) determined by multiplying (a) the Average Quoted Price by
(b) the fraction of a share of ANB Common Stock to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled.



ARTICLE 4 __

_EXCHANGE OF SHARES_



4.1 _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to the former stockholders
of FCB appropriate transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates theretofore
representing shares of FCB Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of such certificates to the Exchange Agent). After completion of the
allocation procedure set forth in Section 3.1(c)(5) and upon surrender of
a certificate or certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange
Agent (such shares to be free and clear of all liens, claims and
encumbrances), together with a properly executed letter of transmittal, the
holder of such certificate or certificates shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefore: (a) a certificate representing that number of whole shares
of ANB Common Stock which such holder of FCB Common Stock became entitled to
receive pursuant to the provisions of Article 3 hereof and (b) a check
representing the aggregate cash consideration, if any, which such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Article 3 hereof, and the
certificate or certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No
interest will be paid or



 

9 accrued on the Per Share Cash Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares, or any unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders
of certificates for FCB Common Stock. The Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to deliver the consideration to which any former holder of FCB
Common Stock is entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder
surrenders his certificate or certificates representing the shares of FCB
Common Stock for exchange as provided in this Section 4.1. The certificate or
certificates for FCB Common Stock so surrendered shall be duly endorsed as
the Exchange Agent may require. Any other provision of this Agreement
notwithstanding, neither the Surviving Corporation, ANB nor the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to a holder of FCB Common Stock for any amounts paid or
property delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property Law.



4.2 _Rights of Former FCB Stockholders_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of FCB shall be closed as to holders of FCB Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and no transfer of FCB Common Stock
by any such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until surrendered
for exchange in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.1 of this
Agreement, each certificate theretofore representing shares of FCB Common
Stock ("FCB Certificate"), other than shares to be canceled pursuant to
Section 3.3 of this Agreement or as to which dissenters rights of appraisal
have been perfected as provided in Section 3.4 of this Agreement, shall from
and after the Effective Time represent for all purposes only the right to
receive the consideration provided in Section 3.1 of this Agreement in
exchange therefor. To the extent permitted by Law, former stockholders of
record of FCB Common Stock shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time
at any meeting of ANB stockholders the number of whole shares of ANB Common
Stock into which their respective shares of FCB Common Stock (excluding Cash
Election Shares) are converted, regardless of whether such holders
have exchanged their FCB Certificates for certificates representing ANB
Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Whenever a
dividend or other distribution is declared by ANB on the ANB Common Stock, the
record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, the declaration
shall include dividends or other distributions on all shares issuable pursuant
to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any person holding
any FCB Certificate at or after six (6) months after the Effective Time (the
"Cutoff") shall not be entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution
payable after the Cutoff to holders of ANB Common Stock, which dividend or
other distribution is attributable to such persons ANB Common Stock
represented by said FCB Certificate held after the Cutoff, until such person
surrenders said FCB Certificate for exchange as provided in Section 4.1 of
this Agreement. However, upon surrender of such FCB Certificate, both the ANB
Common Stock certificate (together with all such undelivered dividends or
other distributions, without interest) and any undelivered cash payments
(without interest) shall be delivered and paid with respect to each share
represented by such FCB Certificate. No holder of shares of FCB Common Stock
shall be entitled to receive any dividends or distributions declared or made
with respect to the ANB Common Stock with a record date before the Effective
Time of the Merger.

 



4.3 _Identity of Recipient of ANB Common Stock_. In the event that the
delivery of the consideration provided for in this Agreement is to be made to
a person other than the person in whose name any certificate representing
shares of FCB Common Stock surrendered is registered, such certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate
instrument of transfer), with the signature(s) appropriately guaranteed, and
otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the person requesting such delivery
shall pay any transfer or 



 

10 other taxes required by reason of the delivery to a person other than the
registered holder of such certificate surrendered or establish to the
satisfaction of ANB that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.



4.4 _Lost or Stolen Certificates_. If any holder of FCB Common Stock
convertible into the right to receive shares of ANB Common Stock is unable to
deliver the FCB Certificate that represents FCB Common Stock, the Exchange
Agent, in the absence of actual notice that any such shares have been acquired
by a bona fide purchaser, shall deliver to such holder the shares of ANB
Common Stock to which the holder is entitled for such shares upon
presentation of the following: (a) evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of
ANB that any such FCB Certificate has been lost, wrongfully taken or
destroyed; (b) such security or indemnity as may be reasonably requested by
ANB to indemnify and hold ANB and the Exchange Agent harmless; and (c)
evidence satisfactory to ANB that such person is the owner of the shares
theretofore represented by each FCB Certificate claimed by the holder to
be lost, wrongfully taken or destroyed and that the holder is the person who
would be entitled to present such FCB Certificate for exchange pursuant to
this Agreement.

(iii) All of the Loans held by any of the FCB Companies are in all respects
the binding obligations of the respective obligors named therein in accordance
with their respective terms, are not subject to any defenses, setoffs or
counterclaims, except as may be provided by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
Laws or by general principles of equity, and were solicited, originated and
exist in material compliance with all applicable Laws and FCB loan policies, 



 

16 except for deviations from such policies that (a) have been approved by
current management of FCB, in the case of Loans with an outstanding principal
balance that exceeds $25,000, or (b) in the judgment of FCB management, will
not adversely affect the ultimate collectibility of such Loan.



(iv) Except as set forth in _Schedule 5.9(a)(iv)_ , none of the FCB Companies
holds any Loans in the original principal amount in excess of $25,000 per
Loan or $50,000 in the aggregate that have been classified by any bank
examiner, whether regulatory or internal, or, in the exercise of reasonable
diligence by FCB, FCB Bank or any Regulatory Authority, should have been
classified, as "other loans Specifically Mentioned," "Special Mention,"
"Substandard," "Doubtful," "Loss," "Classified," "Watch List," "Criticized,"
"Credit Risk Assets," "concerned loans" or words of similar import.



(v) The allowance for possible loan or credit losses (the "FCB Allowance")
shown on the consolidated balance sheets of FCB included in the most recent
FCB Financial Statements dated prior to the date of this Agreement was, and
the FCB Allowance shown on the consolidated balance sheets of FCB included in
the FCB Financial Statements as of dates subsequent to the execution of this
Agreement will be, as of the dates thereof, adequate (within the meaning
of GAAP and applicable regulatory requirements or guidelines) to provide for
losses relating to or inherent in the loan and lease portfolios (including
accrued interest receivables) of the FCB Companies and other extensions of
credit (including letters of credit and commitments to make loans or extend
credit) by the FCB Companies as of the dates thereof. The reserve for losses
with respect to other real estate owned ("OREO Reserve") shown on the most
recent Financial Statements and FCB Call Reports were, and the OREO Reserve
to be shown on the Financial Statements and FCB Call Reports as of any date
subsequent to the execution of this Agreement will be, as of such dates,
adequate to provide for losses relating to the other real estate owned
portfolio of FCB and FCB Bank as of the dates thereof. The reserve for losses
in respect of litigation ("Litigation Reserve") shown on the most recent
Financial Statements and FCB Call Reports and the Litigation Reserve to
be shown on the Financial Statements and FCB Call Reports as of any date
subsequent to the execution of this Agreement will be, as of such dates,
adequate to provide for losses relating to or arising out of all pending or
threatened litigation applicable to FCB, FCB Bank and the FCB Subsidiaries as
of the dates thereof. Each such reserve described above has been established
in accordance with applicable accounting principles and regulatory
requirements and guidelines.



(b) The documentation relating to each Loan made by any FCB Company and
to all security interests, mortgages and other liens with respect to all
collateral for loans is adequate for the enforcement of the material terms of
such Loan, security interest, mortgage or other lien, except for inadequacies
in such documentation which will not, individually or in the aggregate, have
a Material Adverse Effect on FCB.



5.10 _Assets; Insurance_. The FCB Companies have marketable title, free and
clear of all Liens, to all of their respective Assets. One of the FCB
Companies has good and marketable fee simple title to the real property
described in _Schedule 5.10(a)_ and has an enforceable leasehold interest in
the real property described in _Schedule 5.10(b)_ , if any, free and clear of
all Liens. All tangible real and personal properties and Assets used in the
businesses of the FCB Companies are in good condition, reasonable wear and
tear excepted, and are usable in the



 

17 ordinary course of business consistent with FCBs past practices. All Assets
that are material to FCBs business on a consolidated basis, held under
leases or subleases by any of the FCB Companies are held under valid Contracts
enforceable in accordance with their respective terms (except as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally and except that the availability of the equitable
remedy of specific performance or injunctive relief is subject to the
discretion of the court before which any proceedings may be brought), and
each such Contract is in full force and effect and there is not under any such
Contract any Default or claim of Default by FCB or FCB Bank or, to the
Knowledge of FCB or FCB Bank, by any other party to the Contract. _Schedules
5.10(a)_ and _5.10(b)_ identify each parcel of real estate or interest therein
owned, leased or subleased by any of the FCB Companies or in which any FCB
Company has any ownership or leasehold interest. If applicable, _Schedule
5.10(b)_ also lists or otherwise describes each and every written or oral
lease or sublease under which any FCB Company is the lessee of any real
property and which relates in any manner to the operation of the businesses
of any FCB Company. None of the FCB Companies has violated, or is currently in
violation of, any Law, regulation or ordinance relating to the ownership or
use of the real estate and real estate interests described in
_Schedules 5.10(a)_ and _5.10(b)_ , including without limitation any Law
relating to zoning, building, occupancy, environmental or comparable matter
which individually or in the aggregate would have a Material Adverse Effect on
FCB. As to each parcel of real property owned or used by any FCB Company, no
FCB Company has received notice of any pending or, to the Knowledge of each of
the FCB Companies, threatened condemnation proceedings, litigation proceedings
or mechanics or materialmens liens. The Assets of the FCB Companies include
all assets required to operate the business of the FCB Companies as now
conducted. The policies of fire, theft, liability and other insurance
maintained with respect to the Assets or businesses of the FCB Companies
provide adequate coverage under current industry practices against loss or
Liability, and the fidelity and blanket bonds in effect as to which any of the
FCB Companies is a named insured are reasonably sufficient.
_Schedule 5.10(c)_ contains a list of all such policies and bonds maintained
by any of the FCB Companies, and FCB has provided true and correct copies of
each such policy to ANB. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.10(c)_ , no claims
have been made under such policies or bonds, and no FCB Company has Knowledge
of any fact or condition presently existing that might form the basis of any
such claim.



5.11 _Environmental Matters_.

are, and have been, in compliance with all Environmental Laws, except
for violations that are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FCB.



(b) There is no Litigation pending or, to the Knowledge of FCB and FCB Bank,
threatened before any court, governmental agency or authority or other
forum in which any FCB Company or any of its Participation Facilities has
been or, with respect to threatened Litigation, may be named as a defendant
(i) for alleged noncompliance (including by any predecessor) with any
Environmental Law or (ii) relating to the release into the environment of any
Hazardous Material or oil, whether or not occurring at, on, under or involving
a site owned, leased or operated by any FCB Company or any of its
Participation Facilities, except for such Litigation pending or threatened
that is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on FCB.



 

18 (c) There is no Litigation pending or, to the Knowledge of FCB and FCB Bank,
threatened before any court, governmental agency or board or other forum in
which any of its Loan Properties (or FCB with respect to such Loan Property)
has been or, with respect to threatened Litigation, may be named as a
defendant or potentially responsible party (i) for alleged noncompliance
(including by any predecessor) with any Environmental Law or (ii) relating to
the release into the environment of any Hazardous Material or oil, whether or
not occurring at, on, under or involving a Loan Property, except for such
Litigation pending or threatened that is not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FCB.



(d) To the Knowledge of FCB and FCB Bank, there is no reasonable basis for any
Litigation of a type described in subsections 5.11(b) or 5.11(c), except such
as is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on FCB.



(e) During the period of (i) any FCB Companys ownership or operation of any
of its respective current properties, (ii) any FCB Companys participation in
the management of any Participation Facility or (iii) any FCB Companys
holding of a security interest in a Loan Property, there have been no releases
of Hazardous Material or oil in, on, under or affecting such
properties, except such as are not reasonably likely to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FCB. Prior to the period of (i)
any FCB Companys ownership or operation of any of its respective current
properties, (ii) any FCB Companys participation in the management of any
Participation Facility, or (iii) any FCB Companys holding of a security
interest in a Loan Property, to the Knowledge of FCB and FCB Bank, there were
no releases of Hazardous Material or oil in, on, under or affecting any such
property, Participation Facility or Loan Property, except such as are not
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on FCB.



5.12 _Compliance with Laws_. FCB is duly registered as a bank holding company
under the BHC Act. Each FCB Company has in effect all Permits necessary for it
to own, lease or operate its Assets and to carry on its business as now
conducted, except for those Permits the absence of which are not reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on FCB, and there has occurred no Default under any such Permit. Each of the
FCB Companies:



(a) is and has been in compliance with all Laws, Orders and Permits applicable
to its business or employees, agents or representatives conducting its
business; and



(b) has received no notification or communication from any agency or
department of federal, state or local government or any Regulatory Authority
or the staff thereof (i) asserting that any FCB Company is not, or suggesting
that any FCB Company may not be, in compliance with any of the Laws or Orders
that such governmental authority or Regulatory Authority enforces, (ii)
threatening to revoke any Permits, (iii) requiring any FCB Company, or
suggesting that any FCB Company may be required, to enter into or consent to
the issuance of a cease and desist order, formal agreement, directive,
commitment or memorandum of understanding, or to



 

19 adopt any board resolution or similar undertaking, or (iv) directing,
restricting or limiting, or purporting to direct, restrict or limit in any
manner the operations of any FCB Company, including without limitation any
restrictions on the payment of dividends, or that in any manner relates to
such entitys capital adequacy, credit or reserve policies or management or
business.



Without limiting the foregoing, FCB Bank is and has been in compliance with
the Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing
Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001
(the "USA Patriot Act"), the trade sanctions administered and enforced by the
Department of Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Controls, the Equal Credit
Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, all other applicable fair lending Laws and
other Laws relating to discrimination. FCB Bank has systems and procedures in
place such that any material violation of any of the foregoing would
reasonably be expected to have been detected by FCB Bank.



5.13 _Labor Relations; Employees_.



(a) No FCB Company is the subject of any Litigation asserting that it or
any other FCB Company has committed an unfair labor practice (within the
meaning of the National Labor Relations Act or comparable state Law) or
seeking to compel it or any other FCB Company to bargain with any labor
organization as to wages or conditions of employment, nor is there any strike
or other labor dispute involving any FCB Company, pending or threatened, nor
to its Knowledge, is there any activity involving any FCB Companys employees
seeking to certify a collective bargaining unit or engaging in any other
organization activity. Each FCB Company is and has been in compliance with all
Employment Laws, except for violations that are not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FCB.



(b) _Schedule 5.13(b)_ contains a true and complete list showing the names
and current annual salaries of all current executive officers of each of the
FCB Companies and lists for each such person the amounts paid, payable or
expected to be paid as salary, bonus payments and other compensation for
2002, 2003 and 2004. _Schedule 5.13(b)_ also sets forth the name and offices
held by each officer and director of each of the FCB Companies.



5.14 _Employee Benefit Plans_.



(a) _Schedule 5.14(a)_ lists, and FCB has delivered or made available to ANB
prior to the execution of this Agreement copies of, all pension, retirement,
profit-sharing, salary continuation and split dollar agreements, deferred
compensation, director deferred fee agreements, director retirement agreement,
stock option, employee stock ownership, severance pay, vacation, bonus or
other incentive plan, all other written or unwritten employee programs,
arrangements or agreements, all medical, vision, dental or other health plans,
all life insurance plans, and all other employee benefit plans or
fringe benefit plans, including, without limitation, "employee benefit plans"
as that term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, currently adopted,
maintained by, sponsored in whole or in part by, or contributed to by any FCB
Company or Affiliate thereof for the benefit of employees, retirees,
dependents, spouses, directors, independent contractors or other beneficiaries
and under which employees, retirees, dependents, spouses, directors,
independent contractors or other beneficiaries are eligible to participate



 

20 (collectively, the "FCB Benefit Plans"). Any of the FCB Benefit Plans which is
an "employee pension benefit plan," as that term is defined in Section 3(2)
of ERISA, is referred to herein as a "FCB ERISA Plan." Each FCB ERISA Plan
which is also a "defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 414(j) of the
IRC) is referred to herein as an "FCB Pension Plan". No FCB Pension Plan is
or has been a multi-employer plan within the meaning of Section 3(37) of
ERISA.



(b) All FCB Benefit Plans and the administration thereof are in compliance
with the applicable terms of ERISA, the IRC and any other applicable Laws,
the breach or violation of which is reasonably likely to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FCB. Each FCB ERISA Plan
which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the IRC has received
a favorable determination letter or opinion letter, as applicable, from the
Internal Revenue Service, and FCB is not aware of any circumstances that could
result in revocation of any such favorable determination letter/opinion
letter. No FCB Company has engaged in a transaction with respect to any FCB
Benefit Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as
of the date hereof, would subject any FCB Company to a tax or penalty imposed
by either Section 4975 of the IRC or Section 502(i) of ERISA in amounts which
are reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on FCB. There are no actions, suits, arbitrations or claims,
including any investigations or audits by the Internal Revenue Service or any
other governmental authority, pending (other than routine claims for benefits)
or threatened against, any FCB Benefit Plan or any FCB Company with regard to
any FCB Benefit Plan, any trust which is a part of any FCB Benefit Plan, any
trustee, fiduciary, custodian, administrator or other person or entity
holding or controlling assets of any FCB Benefit Plan, and no basis to
anticipate any such action, suit, arbitration, claim, investigation or audit
exists.



(c) No FCB ERISA Plan which is a defined benefit pension plan has
any "unfunded current liability," as that term is defined in Section
302(d)(8)(A) of ERISA, and the fair market value of the assets of any such
plan exceeds the plans "benefit liabilities," as that term is defined in
Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA, when determined under actuarial factors that
would apply if the plan terminated in accordance with all applicable legal
requirements. Since the date of the most recent actuarial valuation, there has
been (i) no material change in the financial position of any FCB Pension
Plan, (ii) no change in the actuarial assumptions with respect to any FCB
Pension Plan, (iii) no increase in benefits under any FCB Pension Plan as a
result of plan amendments or changes in applicable Law which is reasonably
likely to materially adversely affect the funding status of any such plan.
Neither any FCB Pension Plan nor any "single-employer plan," within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by
any FCB Company, or the single-employer plan of any entity which is considered
one employer with FCB under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the IRC or
Section 302 of ERISA (whether or not waived) (an "ERISA Affiliate") has an
"accumulated funding deficiency" within the meaning of Section 412 of the IRC
or Section 302 of ERISA, which is reasonably likely to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FCB. No FCB Company
has provided, or is required to provide, security to a FCB Pension Plan or to
any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29)
of the IRC.



(d) No Liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is
expected to be incurred by any FCB Company with respect to any ongoing,
frozen or terminated single-employer plan or the single-employer plan of any
ERISA Affiliate. No FCB Company has



 

21 incurred any withdrawal Liability with respect to a multi-employer plan under
Subtitle D of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions
of an ERISA Affiliate), which Liability is reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FCB. No notice
of a "reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for
which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived, has been required
to be filed for any FCB Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate within the
12-month period ending on the date hereof.



(e) No FCB Company has any obligations for retiree health and life
benefits under any of the FCB Benefit Plans, and there are no restrictions on
the rights of such FCB Company to amend or terminate any such plan without
incurring any Liability thereunder, which Liability is reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on FCB.



(f) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.14(f)_ , neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions provided
for herein will (i) result in any payment (including, without limitation,
severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute or otherwise) becoming
due to any director, officer or employee of any FCB Company under any FCB
Benefit Plan, employment contract or otherwise, (ii) increase any benefits
otherwise payable under any FCB Benefit Plan, or (iii) result in
any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefit.



(g) With respect to all FCB Benefit Plans (whether or not subject to ERISA and
whether or not qualified under Section 401(a) of the IRC), all contributions
due (including any contributions to any trust account or payments due under
any insurance policy) previously declared or otherwise required by Law or
contract to have been made and any employer contributions (including any
contributions to any trust account or payments due under any insurance policy)
accrued but unpaid as of the date hereof will be paid by the time required by
Law or contract. All contributions made or required to be made under any FCB
Benefit Plan have been made and such contributions meet the requirements for
deductibility under the IRC, and all contributions which are required and
which have not been made have been properly recorded on the books of FCB.



5.15 _Material Contracts_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.15_ , none of
the FCB Companies, nor any of their respective Assets, businesses or
operations, is a party to, or is bound or affected by, or receives benefits
under any of the following (whether written or oral, express or implied): (i)
any employment, severance, termination, consulting or retirement Contract
with any Person; (ii) any Contract relating to the borrowing of money by any
FCB Company or the guarantee by any FCB Company of any such obligation (other
than Contracts evidencing deposit liabilities, purchases of federal funds,
fully-secured repurchase agreements, trade payables and Contracts relating to
borrowings or guarantees made and letters of credit); (iii) any Contract
relating to indemnification or defense of any director, officer or employee of
any of the FCB Companies or any other Person; (iv) any Contract with any
labor union; (v) any Contract relating to the disposition or acquisition of
any interest in any business enterprise; (vi) any Contract relating to the
extension of credit to, provision of services for, sale, lease or license of
Assets to, engagement of services from, or purchase, lease or license of
Assets from, any 5% stockholder, director or officer of any of the FCB
Companies, any member of the immediate family of the foregoing or, to the
Knowledge of FCB, any related interest (as defined in Regulation O



 

22 promulgated by the FRB) ("Related Interest") of any of the foregoing; (vii)
any Contract (A) which limits the freedom of any of the FCB Companies to
compete in any line of business or with any Person or (B) which limits the
freedom of any other Person to compete in any line of business with any FCB
Company; (viii) any Contract providing a power of attorney or similar
authorization given by any of the FCB Companies, except as issued in the
ordinary course of business with respect to routine matters; or (ix) any
Contract (other than deposit agreements and certificates of deposits issued to
customers entered into in the ordinary course of business and letters of
credit) that involves the payment by any of the FCB Companies of amounts
aggregating $5,000 or more in any twelve-month period (together with all
Contracts referred to in Sections 5.10 and 5.14(a) of this Agreement, the
"FCB Contracts"). FCB has delivered or made available to ANB correct and
complete copies of all FCB Contracts. Each of the FCB Contracts is in full
force and effect, and none of the FCB Companies is in Default under any FCB
Contract. All of the indebtedness of any FCB Company for money borrowed is
prepayable at any time by such FCB Company without penalty or premium.



5.16 _Legal Proceedings_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.16_ , there is no
Litigation instituted or pending, or, to the Knowledge of FCB or FCB Bank,
threatened (or unasserted but considered probable of assertion) against any
FCB Company, or against any Asset, interest, or right of any of them, nor are
there any Orders of any Regulatory Authorities, other governmental
authorities or arbitrators outstanding, pending or, to the Knowledge of FCB or
FCB Bank, threatened against any FCB Company. No FCB Company has any Knowledge
of any fact or condition presently existing that might give rise to any
Order, litigation, investigation or proceeding which, if determined adversely
to any FCB Company, would have a Material Adverse Effect on such FCB Company
or would materially restrict the right of any FCB Company to carry on
its businesses as presently conducted.



5.17 _Reports_. Since its formation, each FCB Company has timely filed all
reports, registrations and statements, together with any amendments required
to be made with respect thereto, that it was required to file with (i) the
SEC, including but not limited to, Forms 10-KSB, Forms 10-QSB, Forms 8-K, and
proxy statements, (ii) other Regulatory Authorities, and (iii) any applicable
state securities or banking authorities and all other material reports and
statements required to be filed by it, and has paid all fees and assessments
due and payable in connection therewith. Except for normal examinations
conducted by Regulatory Authorities in the regular course of the business of
the FCB Companies, to the Knowledge of any FCB Company, no
Regulatory Authority has initiated any proceeding or, to the Knowledge of any
FCB Company, investigation into the business or operations of any FCB Company.
There is no unresolved violation, criticism or exception by any Regulatory
Authority with respect to any report or statement or lien or any examinations
of any FCB Company. As of their respective dates, each of such reports,
registrations, statements and documents, including the financial statements,
exhibits, and schedules thereto, complied in all material respects with all
applicable Laws, including without limitation all Securities Laws. As of its
respective date, each of such reports, registrations, statements and documents
did not, in any material respects, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. Other than the FCB Call Reports,
the financial information and reports contained in each of such reports,
registrations, statements and documents (including the related notes, where

23 GAAP, which principles have been consistently applied during the periods
involved, except as otherwise noted therein, (b) fairly presents the
financial position of the FCB Companies as of the respective dates thereof,

5.18 _Statements True and Correct_. Neither this Agreement nor any statement,
certificate, instrument or other writing furnished or to be furnished by any
FCB Company or any Affiliate thereof to ANB pursuant to this Agreement,
including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, or any other document, agreement
or instrument referred to herein, contains or will contain any untrue
statement of material fact or will omit to state a material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. None of the information supplied or to be supplied

be prepared by ANB in connection with the transactions provided for in this
Agreement, including without limitation (i) documents to be filed with the
SEC, including without limitation the Registration Statement on Form S-4 of
ANB registering the shares of ANB Common Stock to be offered to the holders of
FCB Common Stock, and all amendments thereto (as amended, the "S-4

contained in the S-4 Registration Statement, and all amendments and
supplements thereto (as amended and supplemented, the
"Proxy Statement/Prospectus"), (ii) filings pursuant to any state securities
and blue sky Laws, and (iii) filings made in connection with the obtaining of
Consents from Regulatory Authorities, in the case of the S-4 Registration
Statement, at the time the S-4 Registration Statement is declared effective

the time of the mailing thereof and at the time of the meeting of stockholders
to which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus relates, and in the case of any other

contains or will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or fails to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to

were made, not misleading. All documents that any FCB Company is responsible
for filing with any Regulatory Authority in connection with the transactions
provided for herein will comply as to form in all material respects with the
provisions of applicable Law.



5.19 _Tax and Regulatory Matters_. No FCB Company or any Affiliate thereof has
taken any action or has any Knowledge of any fact or circumstance that is
reasonably likely to (a) prevent the transactions provided for herein,
including the Merger, from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the IRC, or (b) materially impede or delay receipt of
any Consents of Regulatory Authorities referred to in subsection 9.1(b) of
this Agreement or result in the imposition of a condition or restriction of
the type referred to in the last sentence of such subsection 9.1(b). 



5.20 _Offices_. The headquarters of each FCB Company and each other office,

similar systems utilized in processing the work of each of the FCB Companies,
including both hardware and software, (a) are supplied by a third party
provider; (b) satisfactorily perform the data processing function for which
they are presently being used; and (c) are wholly within the possession and
control of one of the FCB Companies or its third party provider such that
physical access to all software, documentation, passwords, access codes,
backups, disks and other data storage devices and similar items readily can
be made accessible to and delivered into the possession of ANB or ANBs third
party provider.

valid and binding licenses and other rights to use without additional payment
all material patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trade names, service marks,
trademarks, computer software and other intellectual property used in its
business; and none of the FCB Companies has received any notice of
conflict with respect thereto that asserts the rights of others. The FCB
Companies have in all material respects performed all the obligations required
to be performed by them and are not in default in any material respect under
any contract, agreement, arrangement or commitment relating to any of the
foregoing. _Schedule 5.22_ lists all of the trademarks, trade names, licenses
and other intellectual property used to conduct the businesses of the FCB
Companies. Each of the FCB Companies has taken reasonable precautions to
safeguard its trade secrets from disclosure to third-parties.



5.23 _Administration of Trust Accounts_. FCB Bank does not possess and does
not exercise trust powers.



5.24 _Advisory Fees_. FCB has retained the FCB Financial Advisor to serve as
its financial advisor and, as of the Effective Time, shall incur a liability
to the FCB Financial Advisor in the amount set forth on _Schedule 5.24_ (the
"Advisory Fee") in connection with the Merger. Other than the FCB Financial
Advisor and the Advisory Fee, neither FCB nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any
of their respective officers or directors has employed any broker or finder or
incurred any liability for any brokers fees, commissions or finders fees in
connection with any of the transactions provided for in this Agreement. 



5.25 _Regulatory Approvals_. FCB knows of no reason why all requisite
regulatory approvals regarding the Merger should not or cannot be obtained.



5.26 _Opinion of Counsel_. FCB has no Knowledge of any facts that would
preclude issuance of the opinion of counsel referred to in subsection 9.2(d).



5.27 _Repurchase Agreements; Derivatives Contracts_. With respect to all
agreements currently outstanding pursuant to which any FCB Company has
purchased securities subject to an agreement to resell, such FCB Company has a
valid, perfected first lien or security interest in the securities or other
collateral securing such agreement, and the value of such collateral equals or
exceeds the amount of the debt secured thereby. With respect to all agreements
currently outstanding pursuant to which any FCB Company has sold securities
subject to an agreement to repurchase, no FCB Company has pledged collateral
in excess of the amount of the debt secured thereby. No FCB Company has
pledged collateral in excess of the amount required under any interest rate

6.4 _Reports and Financial Statements_.



(a) Since January 1, 2002, or the date of organization or acquisition if
later, each ANB Company has filed all reports and statements, together with
any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that it was required
to file with (i) the SEC, including, but not limited to, Forms 10-K, Forms
10-Q, Forms 8-K, and proxy statements, (ii) other Regulatory Authorities, and
(iii) any applicable state securities or banking authorities. As of their
respective dates, each of such reports and documents, including the ANB
Financial Statements, exhibits, and schedules thereto, complied in all
material respects with all applicable Laws, including without limitation
Securities Laws. As of its respective date, each such report and document did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The ANB Financial Statements included in such reports
(as of the dates thereof and for the periods covered thereby) (i) are or if
dated after the date of this Agreement, will be, in accordance with the books
and records of the ANB Companies, which are or will be, as the case may be,
complete and correct and which have been or will have been, as the case may
be, maintained in accordance with good business practices, and (ii) present,
or will present, fairly the consolidated financial position of the ANB
Companies as of the dates indicated and the consolidated results of
operations, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows of the
ANB Companies for the periods indicated, in accordance with GAAP (subject to
exceptions as to consistency specified therein or as may be indicated in the
notes thereto or, in the case of interim financial statements, to normal year-
end adjustments that are not material).



(b) PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is and has been (i) since October 22, 2003, a
registered public accounting firm (as defined in Section 2(a)(12) of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and (ii) throughout the periods covered by the
financial statements filed with the SEC by ANB, "independent" with respect to
ANB within the meaning of Regulation S-X under the 1934 Act.



(c) ANB and its Subsidiaries have designed and maintain a system of internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) under the 1934 Act)



 

28 sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP. Since June 30, 2005, there has not been any
material change in the internal controls utilized by ANB to assure that its
consolidated financial statements conform with GAAP. ANB has designed and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined by Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the 1934 Act) to ensure that material information required
to be disclosed by ANB in the reports that it files or submits under the 1934
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to
ANBs management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures and to allow ANBs management to make the certifications of the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of ANB required under the
1934 Act.



6.5 _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. No ANB Company has any Liabilities
that are reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on ANB, except Liabilities accrued or reserved against
in the consolidated balance sheets of ANB as of September 30, 2005, included
in the ANB Financial Statements or reflected in the notes thereto. No
ANB Company has incurred or paid any Liability since September 30, 2005,
except for such Liabilities incurred or paid in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past business practice and which are not reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on ANB.



6.6  _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since September 30, 2005: (i)
there have been no events, changes or occurrences that have had, or are
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on ANB, (ii) the ANB Companies have not taken any action, or
failed to take any action, prior to the date of this Agreement, which action
or failure, if taken after the date of this Agreement, would represent or
result in a material breach or violation of any of the covenants and
agreements of ANB provided in Article 7 of this Agreement, and (iii) to ANBs
Knowledge, no fact or condition exists which ANB believes will cause a
Material Adverse Effect on ANB in the future, subject to changes in general
economic or industry conditions.



6.7 _Compliance with Laws_. ANB is duly registered as a bank holding company
under the BHC Act. Each ANB Company has in effect all Permits necessary for it
to own, lease or operate its Assets and to carry on its business as now
conducted, except for those Permits the absence of which are not reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
ANB, and there has occurred no Default under any such Permit. None of the ANB
Companies:



(a) is in material violation of any Laws, Orders or Permits applicable to its
business or employees conducting its business; or



(b) has received any notification or communication from any agency or
department of federal, state or local government or any Regulatory Authority

with any of the Laws or Orders that such governmental authority or Regulatory

any ANB Company to enter into or consent to the issuance of a cease and desist
order, formal agreement, directive, commitment or memorandum of

29 any board resolution or similar undertaking, that restricts materially the
conduct of its business, or in any manner relates to its capital adequacy,
its credit or reserve policies, its management or the payment of dividends.



6.8 _Material Contracts_. ANB has filed as an exhibit to its annual report on
Form 10-K each Contract required to be so filed under the 1934 Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. None of the ANB Companies is in
Default under any ANB Contract, other than Defaults which are not reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on ANB.



6.9 _Legal Proceedings_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 6.9_ , there is no
Litigation instituted or pending, or, to the Knowledge of ANB, threatened (or
unasserted but considered probable of assertion) against any ANB Company, or
against any Asset, interest, or right of any of them, that is reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
ANB, nor are there any Orders of any Regulatory Authorities, other
governmental authorities or arbitrators outstanding against any ANB Company,
that are reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on ANB.



6.10 _Statements True and Correct_. No statement, certificate, instrument or
other writing furnished or to be furnished by any ANB Company or any Affiliate
thereof to FCB pursuant to this Agreement, including the Exhibits or
Schedules hereto, or any other document, agreement or instrument referred to
herein contains or will contain any untrue statement of material fact or will
omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of
the information supplied or to be supplied by any ANB Company or any Affiliate
thereof for inclusion in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to FCBs
stockholders in connection with the FCB Stockholders Meeting, and any other
documents to be filed by an ANB Company or any Affiliate thereof with the SEC
or any other Regulatory Authority in connection with the transactions
provided for herein, will, at the respective time such documents are filed,
and with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, when first mailed to the
stockholders of FCB, be false or misleading with respect to any material fact,
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. All
documents that any ANB Company or any Affiliate thereof is responsible for
filing with any Regulatory Authority in connection with the transactions
provided for herein will comply as to form in all material respects with the
provisions of applicable Law.



6.11 _Tax and Regulatory Matters_. No ANB Company or any Affiliate thereof has
taken any action or has any Knowledge of any fact or circumstance that is
reasonably likely to (i) prevent the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the IRC, or (ii) materially impede or delay receipt of
any Consents of Regulatory Authorities referred to in subsection 9.1(b) of
this Agreement or result in the imposition of a condition or restriction of
the type referred to in the last sentence of such subsection.



6.12 _1934 Act Compliance_. The Proxy Statement/Prospectus will comply in all
material respects with applicable provisions of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder.



 

30 6.13 _Regulatory Approvals_. ANB knows of no reason why all requisite
regulatory approvals regarding the Merger should not or cannot be obtained.



6.14  _Opinion of Counsel_. ANB has no Knowledge of any facts that would
preclude issuance of the opinion of counsel referred to in subsection 9.3(d).

each Party to perform this Agreement and consummate the Merger and the other
transactions provided for herein are subject to the satisfaction of the
following conditions, unless waived by both Parties pursuant to Section 11.4
of this Agreement:

Agreement by the requisite vote, and the consummation of the transactions

and notifications to, all Regulatory Authorities required for consummation of
the Merger shall have been obtained or made and shall be in full force
and effect and all notice and waiting periods required by Law to have passed
after receipt of such Consents shall have expired. No Consent obtained from
any Regulatory Authority that is necessary to consummate the transactions
provided for herein shall be conditioned or restricted in a manner (including
without limitation requirements relating to the raising of additional capital
or the disposition of Assets) which in the reasonable judgment of the Board of
Directors of either Party would so materially adversely impact the economic
or business benefits of the transactions provided for in this Agreement as to
render inadvisable the consummation of the Merger.



(c) _Consents and Approvals_. Each Party shall have obtained any and all
Consents required for consummation of the Merger (other than those referred
to in Section 9.1(b) of this Agreement) or for the preventing of any Default
under any Contract or Permit of such Party which, if not obtained or made, is
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on such Party. No Consent so obtained which is necessary to
consummate the transactions provided for herein shall be conditioned or
restricted in a manner which in the reasonable judgment of the Board of
Directors of either Party would so materially adversely impact the economic
or business benefits of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as to
render inadvisable the consummation of the Merger.



 

43 (d) _Legal Proceedings_. No court or Regulatory Authority of competent
jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any
Law or Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) or taken any other
action that prohibits, restricts or makes illegal consummation of the
transactions provided for in this Agreement. No action or proceeding shall
have been instituted by any Person, and the Parties shall not have Knowledge
of any threatened action or proceeding by any Person, which seeks to restrain
the consummation of the transactions provided for in this Agreement which, in
the opinion of the ANB Board or the FCB Board, renders it impossible or
inadvisable to consummate the transactions provided for in this Agreement.



(e) _Tax Opinion_. FCB and ANB shall have received a written opinion of
counsel from Maynard, Cooper and Gale, P.C. in form reasonably satisfactory to
them (the "Tax Opinion"), to the effect that (i) the Merger will constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the IRC, (ii) the
exchange in the Merger of FCB Common Stock for ANB Common Stock will not give
rise to gain or loss to the stockholders of FCB with respect to such exchange
(except to the extent of any cash received), and (iii) neither FCB nor ANB
will recognize gain or loss as a consequence of the Merger (except for income
and deferred gain recognized pursuant to Treasury regulations issued under

be entitled to rely upon representations of officers of FCB and ANB reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to such counsel.

shall have been declared effective under the 1933 Act by the SEC and no stop
order suspending the effectiveness of the S-4 Registration Statement shall
have been issued and no action, suit, proceeding or investigation for that
purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the SEC. ANB shall have
received all state securities Laws, or "blue sky" permits or other
authorizations, or confirmations as to the availability of exemptions
from registration requirements, as may be necessary to issue the ANB Common
Stock pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

FCB set forth or referred to in this Agreement and in any certificate

warranties had been made on and as of the Effective Time (provided that
representations and warranties which are confined to a specified date shall
speak only as of such date), except as expressly contemplated by this
Agreement.



(b) _Performance of Obligations_. Each and all of the agreements, obligations
and covenants of FCB to be performed and complied with pursuant to this

Time, FCB and FCB Bank shall each have a minimum net worth of at least

shall mean, without regard to the Conforming Adjustments, the sum of the
amounts set forth on the balance sheet as stockholders equity (including the
par or stated value of all outstanding capital stock, retained earnings,
additional paid-in capital, capital surplus and earned surplus), less the sum
of (i) any amounts at which shares of capital stock of such person appear on
the asset side of the balance sheet and (ii) any amounts due from or owed by
any Subsidiary thereof; provided, however, that unrealized gains or losses on
securities classified as "available for sale" shall be disregarded for
purposes of calculating "net worth."

PA, independent certified public accountants, a comfort letter dated as of
the Effective Time with respect to such matters relating to the financial

in Control Agreements, FCB Benefit Plans, or similar arrangements between a
FCB Company and any officers, directors, or employees thereof.



(i) _Matters Relating to Employment Agreements_. (i) ANB shall have received

FCB Company to consent to the issuance or adoption of, a cease and desist
order, formal agreement, directive, commitment or memorandum of understanding,
or any board resolution or similar undertaking, that, in the reasonable
estimation of ANB, restricts or impairs the conduct of such FCB Companys
business or future prospects.



(k) _Absence of Adverse Facts_. There shall have been no determination by ANB
in good faith that any fact, litigation, claim, event or condition exists or

void and there shall be no Liability or obligation on the part of ANB or FCB
or their respective officers or directors, except that this Section 10.2 and

termination; provided, however, that nothing herein shall relieve any
breaching Party from Liability for an uncured willful or breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or agreement giving rise to
such termination.



(b) In the even that this Agreement is terminated (i) by the ANB
Board pursuant to Section 10.1(j) or (ii) by the FCB Board pursuant to
Section 10.1(k), then FCB shall, in the case of clause (i), one business day

(c) In the event that (i) after the date hereof an Acquisition Proposal shall
have been publicly disclosed or any Person shall have publicly
disclosed that, subject to the Merger being disapproved by FCB stockholders
or otherwise rejected, it will make an Acquisition Proposal with respect to
FCB and thereafter this Agreement is terminated by the ANB Board or the FCB
Board pursuant to Section 10.1(d)(ii), and (ii) concurrently with such
termination or within nine months of such termination FCB enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or consummates an
Acquisition Proposal, then FCB shall, upon the earlier of entering into a

funds, the Termination Fee.



(d) FCB acknowledges that the agreements contained in Sections 10.2(b)
and 10.2(c) are an integral part of the transactions provided for in this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, ANB would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if FCB fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant

obtain such payment, ANB commences a suit which results in a judgment for any
of the Termination Fee, FCB shall pay ANB its costs and expenses (including

Form of Directors Agreement



_AGREEMENT_



THIS AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of the _ _
day of  _ _, 2005, by and between the
undersigned, a resident of the State of Florida, and ALABAMA NATIONAL
BANCORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("ANB").



On even date herewith, ANB and Florida Choice Bankshares, Inc., a Florida
corporation ("FCB"), have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
"Merger Agreement"). The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of FCB with
and into ANB (the "Merger") and the conversion of the issued and outstanding
shares of the common stock of FCB ("FCB Common Stock") into shares of the
common stock of ANB and, in some cases, cash. The Merger Agreement is subject
to the affirmative vote of the shareholders of FCB, the receipt of certain
regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other conditions. Capitalized
terms not otherwise defined herein have the meanings assigned in the Merger
Agreement.



The undersigned is the beneficial owner (as defined by Rule 13d-3 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934) of  _  
_ shares of FCB Common Stock (collectively, "Shares") and/or options to
purchase  _ _ _  
_ shares of FCB Common Stock ("FCB Options"). As a material inducement for
ANB to enter into the Merger Agreement, the undersigned is entering into this
Agreement with ANB to set forth certain terms and conditions governing the
actions to be taken by the undersigned solely in his capacity as a
shareholder of FCB with respect to the Shares and the FCB Options.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the transactions provided for in the
Merger Agreement and the mutual promises and covenants contained herein,
the parties agree as follows:



1\. Without the prior written consent of ANB, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, the undersigned shall not transfer, sell, assign,
convey or encumber any of the Shares during the term of this Agreement except
(i) transfers in which the transferee shall agree in writing to be bound by
the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Agreement as fully as the
undersigned, or (ii) to ANB pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the undersigned shall
not grant to any party any option or right to purchase the Shares or any
interest therein. Further, except with respect to the Merger, the undersigned
shall not during the term of this Agreement vote the Shares to approve or
ratify any agreement or contract pursuant to which the Shares would be
transferred to any other party as a result of a consolidation, merger, share
exchange or acquisition.



2\. The undersigned intends to, and will, vote (or cause to be voted) all of
the Shares over which he has voting authority in favor of the Merger
Agreement and all of the transactions provided for therein, including without
limitation the Merger, at any meeting of shareholders of FCB called to vote on
the Merger Agreement or the Merger or the adjournment thereof or in any other
circumstance upon which a vote, consent or other approval with respect to the
Merger Agreement or the Merger is sought. Further, the undersigned intends to,
and will, surrender the certificate or certificates representing the Shares
over which the undersigned has dispositive authority to ANB upon



 

1 consummation of the Merger as described in the Merger Agreement and hereby
waives any rights of appraisal, or rights to dissent from the Merger, that
the undersigned may have relating to Shares for which the undersigned holds
the right to agree to such waivers.



3\. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, at any meeting of
shareholders of FCB or at any adjournment thereof or any other circumstances
upon which their vote, consent or other approval is sought, the undersigned
will vote (or cause to be voted) all of the Shares over which the undersigned
has voting authority (i) against any merger agreement, share exchange or
merger (other than the Merger Agreement and the Merger), consolidation,
combination, sale of substantial assets, merger, recapitalization,
dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of or by FCB or (ii) any amendment of
FCBs Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws or other proposal or transaction
involving FCB or any of its Subsidiaries, which amendment or other proposal or
transaction would in any manner delay, impede, frustrate, prevent or nullify
the Merger, the Merger Agreement or any of the other transactions provided
for therein.



4\. The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that ANB could not be made whole
by monetary damages in the event of any default by the undersigned of the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed and
understood that ANB, in addition to any other remedy which it may have at law
or in equity, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and specifically to enforce the terms and
provisions hereof in any action instituted in any court of the United States
or in any state having appropriate jurisdiction.



5\. The covenants and obligations set forth in this Agreement shall expire
and be of no further force and effect on the date on which the Merger
Agreement is terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions of Article
10 thereof.



6\. This Agreement shall be binding upon the undersigned and his or her
heirs, devisees, administrators, executors, personal representatives,
successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of ANB and its
Subsidiaries and their respective successors and assigns.



7\. Any proceeding to enforce the provisions of this Agreement or
the declaration of any rights arising from the provisions of this Agreement
shall only be brought by either party in the Circuit Court of Jefferson
County, Alabama or, if federal jurisdictional requirements be met, in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. Each party
hereby waives any present or future objection to such venue and irrevocably
consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction in personam of such courts.
TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY DISPUTE ARISES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES
HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY.



8\. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the undersigned
shall not be precluded from voting all of the Shares, and surrendering the
certificate or certificates representing the Shares over which
the undersigned has dispositive authority, in connection with any Superior
Proposal provided that (i) FCB has complied with the notice and other
requirements set forth in Section 7.6 of the Merger Agreement, (ii) FCB has
provided ANB a reasonable opportunity to match the terms of any such Superior
Proposal, (iii) ANB has not reconstituted its offer to match the terms of such
Superior Proposal, and (iv) FCB has paid the Termination Fee to ANB.



 

2 9\. Other than the number of Shares and FCB Options set forth in the recitals
above, the undersigned represents and warrants to ANB that the undersigned is
not the beneficial owner of any shares of FCB Common Stock or any options to
purchase shares of FCB Common Stock as of the date hereof. If the undersigned
becomes the beneficial owner of any additional shares of FCB Common Stock or
any FCB Options subsequent to the date of this Agreement, (i) the undersigned
shall promptly notify ANB, (ii) the number of Shares and/or FCB Options set
forth above shall automatically be adjusted to include such additional shares
and/or options, and (iii) the undersigned agrees to enter into any amendment
reasonably requested by ANB to reflect the inclusion of such additional shares
and/options as part of the Shares or FCB Options, as the case may be. 



10\. The undersigned hereby agrees that he will not exercise any of his FCB
Options at any time after the date hereafter, unless and until the Merger
Agreement has been terminated pursuant to the terms thereof.



11\. Under the Merger Agreement, options to purchase shares of FCB common
stock will automatically be converted into options to purchase shares of
ANB Common Stock at the Effective Time. However, ANB has agreed to provide
all option holders with an opportunity to elect to cancel their options in
exchange for a cash payment. The amount of the cash payment is based on the
share price of ANBs Common Stock at the time that the Merger is completed.
More specifically, the cash payment is equal to the number of shares of FCB
Common Stock covered by an option multiplied by the excess, if any, of (A) the
product of the so-called "Exchange Ratio" of 0.60791 multiplied by the
"Average Quoted Price"2 of ANBs Common Stock over (B) the exercise price per
share of such options. For example, if someone holds an option to purchase
1,000 shares of FCB Common Stock at an exercise price of $13.50 per share,
and if the "Average Quoted Price" for ANBs stock at the time of the Merger
were $60 per share, then the option holder would be entitled to a cash payment
of $22,974 at the time of the Merger if he or she chooses this election.



IMPORTANT TAX CONSEQUENCES. I understand and acknowledge that an election to
cancel my FCB Options for a cash payment as described above will result in
taxable income for me in an amount equal to such cash payment, and the
payment may be subject to withholding requirements. If my options are
"incentive stock options," I understand that I will lose the favorable tax
benefits that those types of options can otherwise enjoy.

* * *

   1 | As potentially adjusted under the terms of the Merger Agreement. 
---|--- 
   2 | Specifically, this term is defined in the Merger Agreement as the
price (rounded to two decimal places) derived by adding the averages of the
high and low sales price of one share of ANB common stock as reported on
NASDAQ on each of the ten (10) consecutive trading days ending on the fifth
business day prior to the effective time of the merger, and dividing such sum
by ten (10). 
---|--- 


 

3 In lieu of receiving ANB Options in exchange for my FCB Options, the
undersigned hereby makes an irrevocable election to have his or her FCB
Options canceled as of the Effective Time in exchange for the cash payment
described in Section 3.1(d) of the Merger Agreement.



12\. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Merger Agreement, the
Articles of Incorporation and/or Bylaws of FCB or FCB Bank, any
indemnification or other agreement under which the undersigned has any rights,
or in any applicable Laws, including without limitation Section 607.0850 of
the FBCA, the undersigned acknowledges and agrees that ANBs
indemnity obligations set forth in Section 8.17 of the Merger Agreement in
all cases do not cover, and specifically exclude, any and all "liability" and
"expenses" (including advancement of expenses), as those terms are defined in
the FBCA, that in any way arise out of, relate to, or are in connection with
(i) any conviction of the undersigned for a violation of criminal law, (ii)
any transaction in which the undersigned is adjudged to have received improper
personal benefit, or (iii) any offering of securities issued by FCB
(collectively, the "Excluded Matters").



(b) Subject to consummation of the Merger, the undersigned, on behalf of
himself and all persons who may claim through him, hereby waives and releases
any and all claims for indemnity against "liability" or "expenses" (including
advancement of expenses) that the undersigned now has, has ever had or may
hereafter have against FCB, Florida Choice Bank, ANB, and/or their
respective representatives, officers, directors, employees, affiliates,
stockholders, Subsidiaries, and successors and assigns (individually, a
"Releasee") that in any way arise out of, relate to, or are in connection with
any of the Excluded Matters.



(c) Subject to consummation of the Merger, the undersigned hereby irrevocably
covenants to refrain from directly or indirectly asserting any claim,
application or demand, or commencing, instituting or causing to be commenced,
any proceeding of any kind seeking indemnity or advancement of expenses in
connection with any of the Excluded Matters.



(d) Subject to consummation of the Merger, the undersigned agrees that he or
she shall indemnify and hold harmless each Releasee from and against any and
all loss, liability, claim, damage or expense (including reasonable attorneys
fees) arising directly or indirectly from or in connection with any of the
Excluded Matters described in Section 12(a)(iii) above.



13\. If any provision or clause of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions and
clauses of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Any provision
or clause of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or
degree will remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or
unenforceable. This Agreement may not be changed except in a writing signed
by the party against whose interest such change shall operate.

Ladies and Gentlemen:



The undersigned has been advised that as of the date of this letter the

into ANB (the "Merger").



As a result of the Merger, absent an election by the undersigned to
receive all cash consideration, the undersigned will receive shares of common
stock, par value $1.00 per share, of ANB (such shares received by the
undersigned as a result of the Merger are hereinafter referred to as the "ANB

The undersigned represents, warrants and covenants to ANB that:



(a) The undersigned shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of
the ANB Securities in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.

necessary, with the undersigneds counsel or counsel for FCB. 



(c) The undersigned has been advised that the issuance of ANB Securities to
the undersigned pursuant to the Merger has been registered with the Commission
under the Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, the

to ANB) that such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt
from registration under the Act.



 

1 (d) The undersigned understands that ANB is under no obligation to register
the sale, transfer or other disposition of the ANB Securities by the
undersigned or on the undersigneds behalf under the Act or to take any other
action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such
registration available.



(e) The undersigned also understands that stop transfer instructions will
be given to ANBs transfer agent with respect to the ANB Securities and that
there will be placed on the certificates for the ANB Securities issued to the
undersigned, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:



"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION TO
WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 APPLIES. THE
SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY ONLY BE TRANSFERRED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE TERMS OF AN AGREEMENT DATED  _ _, 2005,

COPY OF WHICH AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICES OF ALABAMA
NATIONAL BANCORPORATION."



(f) The undersigned also understands that unless the transfer by the
undersigned of the undersigneds ANB Securities has been registered under
the Act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145, ANB
reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates issued to
the undersigneds transferee:



"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND WERE ACQUIRED FROM A PERSON WHO RECEIVED SUCH
SHARES IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT
OF 1933 APPLIES. THE SHARES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED BY THE HOLDER NOT WITH A VIEW
TO, OR FOR RESALE IN CONNECTION WITH, ANY DISTRIBUTION THEREOF WITHIN THE

OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION FROM THE
REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933."



(g) It is understood and agreed that at the request of the undersigned
the legends set forth in paragraphs (e) and (f) above shall be removed by
delivery of substitute certificates without such legend and the related stop
transfer instructions will be lifted forthwith, at such time as (i) the
undersigned is not an affiliate of ANB and a period of at least one year (as
determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of Rule 144 under the Act) has
elapsed since the date of consummation of the Merger, provided that ANB meets

been for at least three months, an affiliate of ANB, and a period of at least
two years (as determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of Rule 144 under
the Act) has elapsed since the date of consummation of the Merger or (iii) ANB
shall have received an opinion of counsel or other evidence, in each case

are not required for purposes of the Act.



Execution of this letter should not be considered an admission on the part of
the undersigned that the undersigned is an "affiliate" of FCB as described in
the first paragraph of this letter, or as a waiver of any rights the
undersigned may have to object to any claim that the undersigned is such an
affiliate on or after the date of this letter.

Birmingham, Alabama 35203

Attn: Chairman



     | Re: | _Merger of Florida Choice Bankshares, Inc. with and into
Alabama National BanCorporation_ 
---|---|--- 



Gentlemen:



We have acted as counsel to Florida Choice Bankshares, Inc. ("FCB"), a Florida
corporation, in connection with the transactions contemplated by that certain
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of _ _,
2005 (the "Merger Agreement"), between Alabama National BanCorporation
("ANB") and FCB. We render this opinion pursuant to Section 9.2(d) of the
Merger Agreement. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this letter have
the definitions set forth in the Merger Agreement.



In connection with our representation of FCB and in order to render this
opinion pursuant to Section 9.2(d) of the Merger Agreement, we have examined
and relied upon the accuracy of original, certified, conformed or photographic
copies of such records, agreements, instruments, documents, and certificates
of officers and employees of FCB and of other persons, and such questions of
law, as we deemed necessary or appropriate. In all such examinations, we have
assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents
submitted to us as originals and the conformity to the original documents of
documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies. We have relied
on certificates issued to us by the secretaries of state and other
appropriate government officials of the various states in which FCB is
incorporated or qualified and, except as expressly set forth in any such
documents or hereinafter, we have assumed the authority of the person or
persons who have executed any such documents on behalf of any person or
persons, state or any other entity. We also have relied, as to various matters
of fact material to this opinion, on the representations and warranties
contained in the Merger Agreement and the certificates delivered pursuant
thereto, on certificates of public officials, on online information provided
by the Florida Department of State and on certificates and statements of
officers of FCB, and we have made no independent investigations with regard
thereto. All of our assumptions herein have been made with your permission. Alabama National BanCorporation

[Date]

Page 2 of 4



Based upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations, qualifications and
assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:



1\. FCB is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of
Florida, its status is active and it has the corporate power to carry on the
business in which it is engaged, as described in the proxy statement used to
solicit the approval by the FCB stockholders of the transactions provided for
in the Merger Agreement, and to own the properties owned by it. FCB Bank is a
state banking corporation organized under the laws of the State of Florida,
its status is active and it has the corporate power to carry on the business
in which it is engaged, as described in the proxy statement used to solicit
the approval by the FCB stockholders of the transactions provided for in the
Merger Agreement, and to own the properties owned by it.



2\. The execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by FCB, and FCBs
compliance with its terms, do not and will not violate any provision of the
Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of FCB. To our knowledge but without any
independent investigation, the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement,
and compliance with its terms, do not and will not result in any breach of or
default or acceleration under any mortgage, agreement, lease, indenture or
other instrument, order, judgment or decree to which any FCB Company is a
party or by which any FCB Company is bound.



3\. In accordance with applicable Law and the Bylaws of FCB and pursuant
to resolutions duly adopted by its Board of Directors and stockholders, the
Merger Agreement has been duly approved by the Board of Directors of FCB and
by the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of FCB at the
Stockholders Meeting.



4\. The Merger Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
FCB. Assuming valid authorization, execution and delivery by ANB, the Merger
Agreement constitutes the binding agreement of FCB, enforceable against FCB
under the law of Florida and the Federal law of the United States.
Our opinion concerning the validity, binding effect and enforceability of the
Merger Agreement means that: (a) the Merger Agreement constitutes an effective
contract under applicable law; (b) the Merger Agreement is not invalid in its
entirety because of a specific statutory prohibition or public policy, and is
not subject in its entirety to a contractual defense; and (c) subject to the
last sentence of this paragraph, some remedies are available if FCB is in
material default under the Merger Agreement. This opinion does not mean that
(a) any particular remedy is available upon a material default, or (b) every
provision of the Merger Agreement will be upheld or enforced in any
circumstance by a court. Furthermore, the validity, binding effect, and the
enforceability of the Merger Agreement may be limited or otherwise affected by
(a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance
or other similar statutes, rules and regulations, or other laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights and remedies generally, and (b) the
unavailability of, or limitation on the availability of, a particular right or
remedy (whether in a proceeding in equity or at law) because of an equitable
principle or a requirement as to commercial reasonableness, conscionability
or good faith. Alabama National BanCorporation

5\. The authorized capital stock of FCB consists of 5,000,000 shares of FCB
Common Stock, of which 2,565,615 shares are issued and outstanding,
and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value, none of which is
issued and outstanding. The shares of FCB Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding were to our knowledge not issued in violation of any statutory
preemptive rights of shareholders, were duly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable under Florida law. There are currently outstanding options with
the right to purchase a total of 399,685 shares of FCB Common Stock. To our
knowledge, except as set forth in Section 5.3(a) of the Agreement, without
independent investigation, there are no other options, subscriptions,
warrants, calls, rights or commitments obligating FCB to issue any equity
securities or to acquire any of its equity securities.



6\. The authorized capital stock of FCB Bank consists of [ _
_] shares of common stock, par value $[ _ _] per share, of
which [ _ _] shares are issued and outstanding.
All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of FCB Bank are owned
beneficially and of record by FCB. The shares of common stock that are issued
and outstanding were to our knowledge not issued in violation of any statutory
preemptive rights of shareholders, were duly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable under Florida law. To our knowledge, without independent
investigation, there are no other options, subscriptions, warrants, calls,
rights or commitments obligating FCB Bank to issue any equity securities or
to acquire any of its equity securities.



7\. To our actual knowledge, there is no Litigation instituted, pending, or
threatened against any FCB Company or against any of their respective
directors or officers, nor, to our actual knowledge, are there any Orders of
any Regulatory Authorities, other governmental authorities or arbitrators
outstanding, pending, or threatened against any FCB Company.



We are licensed to practice only in the State of Florida, and our opinions
expressed herein are limited to the application of laws in the State of
Florida and the Federal laws of the United States of America, and do not
extend to any laws of any other state or nation.



This opinion has been prepared and is to be construed in accordance with the
Report on Standards for Florida Opinions dated April 8, 1991 issued by
the Business Law Section of The Florida Bar (the "Report"). The Report is
incorporated by reference into this opinion.



The opinions rendered herein are as of the date hereof. We assume no
obligation, and specifically disclaim any responsibility, to update or
supplement these opinions to reflect any facts which hereafter may come to
our attention or any changes in facts or law subsequent to the date hereof. Alabama National BanCorporation

   Attn: | Chairman 
---|--- 



     | Re: | _Merger of Florida Choice Bankshares, Inc. with and into
Alabama National BanCorporation_ 
---|---|--- 



Gentlemen:



We are counsel to Alabama National BanCorporation ("ANB"), a corporation
organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and have
represented ANB in connection with the execution and delivery of the Agreement
and Plan of Merger, dated as of  _ _, 2005 (the
"Agreement"), between Florida Choice Bankshares, Inc. ("FCB") and ANB.



This opinion is delivered pursuant to Section 9.3(d) of the Agreement.
Capitalized terms used in this opinion shall have the meanings set forth in
the Agreement. This opinion is limited to the laws of the State of Alabama,
excluding local laws (i.e., the statutes and ordinances, the administrative
decisions and the rules and regulations of counties, towns, municipalities and
special political subdivisions of, or authorities or quasi-governmental bodies
constituted under the laws of, the State of Alabama and judicial decisions to
the extent they deal with any of the foregoing), and we are expressing no
opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction. We call to
your attention the fact that Section 11.8 of the Merger Agreement
provides that it is to be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware. For purposes of the opinion expressed in
Section 4 hereof, we have assumed that Delaware law is the same as, and would
be construed by a court the same as, Alabama law, notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 11.8 of the Merger Agreement, as to which we express no
opinion, that it be governed by Delaware law.



 

In connection with our representation of ANB, we have made such investigations
of law as, in our judgment, were necessary to render the following opinions.
We have also reviewed (a) the Agreement, (b) ANBs Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws; (c) the minutes of the meetings
or actions of the Board of Directors of ANB with respect to the
authorization, execution and delivery of the Agreement; and (d) such
corporate documents, records, information and certificates of ANB,
certificates of public officials or government authorities and other documents
as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions
hereinafter expressed. As to certain facts material to our opinions, we have
relied upon Florida Choice Bankshares, Inc.

[Date]

statements, certificates or representations, including those delivered or made
in connection with the above-referenced transaction, of officers and other
representatives of ANB. In rendering our opinion we have assumed the
genuineness of all signatures of, and the incumbency, authority and power of,
the officers and other persons signing the Agreement as, for or on behalf of
the parties thereto, other than ANB, the authenticity of all documents
submitted to us as originals, and the conformity to authentic, original
documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or photostatic copies. We
have also assumed that there has not been any mutual mistake of fact
or misunderstanding, fraud, duress or undue influence. We have assumed that
no bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding is pending by or against any party to
the Agreement other than ANB.



We have also assumed that the conduct of the parties to the Agreement has
complied with any requirement of good faith, fair dealing and conscionability
and that each party has acted in good faith and without duress or notice of
any defense against the enforcement of any rights created by, or adverse claim
to any property or security interest transferred or created as part of, the
transaction. We have assumed that there are no agreements or understandings
among the parties, written or oral, and there is no usage of trade or prior
dealings among the parties that would, in either case, define, supplement or
qualify the terms of the Agreement. We have assumed that all parties to the
Agreement will act in accordance with, and will refrain from taking any action
that is forbidden by, the terms and conditions of the Agreement.



All of our assumptions herein have been made with your permission.
Wherever used in any opinion or statement herein, the phrases "to counsels
knowledge," "to the best of our knowledge," and other words or phrases of like
or similar meaning, qualify and limit such opinion or statement to the
current conscious awareness, without investigation, on the part of those
lawyers in this firm who have provided legal services to ANB in connection
with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement or lawyers of this firm
who have otherwise provided legal services to ANB, of facts, matters or other
information affecting such opinion or statement.



Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:



1\. ANB is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware with full corporate power
and authority to carry on the business in which it is engaged, as described
in the proxy statement used to solicit the approval by the FCB stockholders of
the transactions provided for the Agreement, and to own the properties owned
by it.



2\. The execution and delivery of the Agreement by ANB, and ANBs compliance
with its terms, do not and will not violate or contravene any provision of the
Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Amended and Restated Bylaws of ANB.
To the best of our knowledge, the execution and delivery of the Agreement,
and compliance with its terms, do not and will not result in any conflict
with, breach of, or default or acceleration under any mortgage, agreement,
lease, indenture or other instrument, order, judgment or decree to which any
ANB Company is a party or by which any ANB Company is bound. Florida Choice Bankshares, Inc.

[Date]

Page 3 of 4



3\. In accordance with the Amended and Restated Bylaws of ANB and pursuant to
resolutions duly adopted by its Board of Directors, the Agreement has
been duly adopted and approved by the Board of Directors of ANB.



4. The Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by ANB.
Assuming valid authorization, execution and delivery by FCB, the Agreement
constitutes the valid and binding agreement of ANB, enforceable against ANB,
except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights
generally (including without limitation, fraudulent conveyance laws) and by
general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of
materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing and the possible
unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief, regardless of
whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law. Our
opinion concerning the enforceability of the Agreement means that: (i) the
Agreement constitutes an effective contract in general; (ii) the Agreement is
not invalid in its entirety because of a specific statutory prohibition or
public policy, and is not subject in its entirety to a contractual defense;
and (iii) subject to available defenses, some remedy is available if ANB is in
material default under the Agreement. This opinion does not mean that any
particular remedy is available upon a material default or that every
provision of the Agreement will be upheld or enforced in any circumstance by a
court.



5\. The authorized capital stock of ANB consists of 50,000,000 shares of ANB
Common Stock, of which [ _ _] shares were issued
and outstanding as of [ _ _], and 100,000 shares
of preferred stock, $1.00 par value, none of which is issued and outstanding.
The shares of ANB Common Stock that are issued and outstanding were not issued
in violation of any statutory preemptive rights of shareholders. The shares of
ANB Common Stock to be issued to the stockholders of FCB as contemplated by
the Agreement are duly authorized, and when properly issued and delivered
following consummation of the Merger will be validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable.



The opinions expressed herein represent our best legal judgment based upon the
facts and assumptions identified herein and current laws, which laws are
subject to change prospectively and retrospectively. Our opinions are in no
way binding on any jurisdiction, government or agency. Our advice on each
legal issue addressed in this letter represents our opinion as to how that
issue would be resolved were it to be considered by the highest court of the
jurisdiction upon whose law our opinion of that issue is based. The manner in
which any particular issue would be treated in any actual court case would
depend in part on facts and circumstances particular to the case, and this
letter is not intended to guarantee the outcome of any legal disputes that may
arise in the future. Our opinions are limited to the date hereof, and we have
no obligation to render any subsequent or updated opinions, even if future
laws, judicial or administrative decisions should change, modify, supersede or
void any of the facts, assumptions, limitations or opinions Florida Choice Bankshares, Inc.
