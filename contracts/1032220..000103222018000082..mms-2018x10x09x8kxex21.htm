Dispute Resolution Period (the "Remaining Items") shall be resolved by a
licensed Certified Public Accountant employed by an independent U.S.
nationally recognized accounting firm, as mutually agreed upon by the Buyer
and the Seller. In the event the Parties are unable to mutually agree on the
identity of the Accountant within ten (10) Business Days after the expiration
of the Dispute Resolution Period, then each of the Buyer and the Seller shall,
within three (3) Business Days thereafter, select a licensed Certified Public
Accountant employed by an independent U.S. nationally recognized accounting
firm (which need not be the same accounting firm). Such Certified Public
Accountants shall, within ten (10) Business Days after their selection by the
Parties, jointly select an individual who is a licensed Certified Public
Accountant employed by an independent U.S. nationally recognized accounting
firm that does not have a conflict of interest with either Party. The
selection of such individual, who shall have experience serving as a neutral
arbitrator in the resolution of similar purchase price disputes, shall be
final and binding on the Parties. The individual who is either mutually agreed
upon or jointly selected, as the case may be, is referred to in this Agreement
as the "Accountant."

(e) Retention of the Accountant. The Accountant shall be jointly retained by
the Buyer and the Seller on terms mutually agreeable to the Parties set forth
in an engagement letter signed by the Buyer and the Seller (the "Engagement
Letter") within ten (10) Business Days after the Accountant has been mutually
agreed upon or jointly selected, as the case may be. The Parties further agree
as follows:

(i) The Accountant shall serve as a neutral arbitrator and shall make a
determination only on the Remaining Items and determining the correct
calculations to be used with respect to only the Remaining Items. The
Accountant shall not make any other determination, including any determination
as to whether any amounts set forth in the Estimated Financial Statements are
correct.

 (ii) The Accountant shall not resolve any Remaining Item in a manner more
favorable to (1) the Buyer than what is reflected for such Remaining Item in
the Closing Financial Statements or (2) the Seller than what is reflected for
such Remaining Item in the Dispute Notice.

(iii) The Accountant shall render a written determination, which shall provide
a reasonably detailed explanation for the Accountant's determination with
respect to each Remaining Item.

(iv) The decision of the Accountant shall be solely based on (1) whether the
Remaining Items were prepared in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement (including the Accounting Principles), or (2) whether any of the
Remaining Items contain a mathematical or clerical error.

(v) The Accountant's decision shall be based solely on the written submissions
of the Parties and their representatives and not by independent review. The
Accountant shall not be permitted to hold a hearing or otherwise hear
testimony in respect of any of the Remaining Items without the express written
consent of each Party.

(vi) There shall be no ex parte communication between the Accountant and any
of the Buyer, the Seller or any of their respective Affiliates or
representatives, except for ministerial matters or other non-substantive
communications or in the event a Party declines, after notice, to participate
in a communication involving the Accountant and such Person. All
communications to the Accountant (including documentation or other evidence
submitted to the Accountant) by or on behalf of a Party shall be provided
simultaneously by or on behalf of such Party to the other Party. All
communications by the Accountant (including all requests for information or
questions by the Accountant) to a Party or its representatives shall also be
delivered simultaneously by the Accountant to the other Party and its
designated representatives.

(vii) None of the Buyer, the Seller or any of their respective Affiliates or
representatives shall disclose to the Accountant, and the Accountant shall not
consider for any purpose, any settlement discussions or settlement offer made
by any Party.

(viii) The Accountant's determination shall be final, conclusive and binding
for all purposes hereunder, and shall be deemed to be an award under the
Federal Arbitration Act. Judgment on such award may be entered in any court of
competent jurisdiction.

(f) Submissions by the Parties to the Accountant.

(i) Initial Submissions. Within twenty-five (25) Business Days after the date
of the Engagement Letter, each of the Seller and the Buyer may (but neither
shall be obligated to) submit to the Accountant a written position paper
setting forth its positions regarding the Remaining Items and any related data
and documentation (the "Initial Submission").

 (ii) Reply Submissions. Within ten (10) Business Days after the deadline for
submitting an Initial Submission, each of the Seller and the Buyer may (but
neither shall be obligated to) submit to the Accountant a written position
paper further describing its positions regarding the Remaining Items and
responding to statements made in the other Party's Initial Submission and any
related data and documentation (the "Reply Submission").

(iii) Questions by the Accountant; Responses by the Parties. Within ten (10)
Business Days after the deadline for submitting a Reply Submission, the
Accountant may (but shall not be obligated to) submit questions and requests
for additional information to each of the Parties (the "Accountant's
Questions"). Each of the Buyer and the Seller may, within ten (10) Business
Days after receipt thereof, respond to the Accountant's Questions (if any)
directed to such Party.

(g) Decision of the Accountant. The Accountant shall render its decision
resolving the Remaining Items within twenty (20) Business Days after (i) the
expiration of the Initial Submission period (if there are no Reply Submissions
or Accountant's Questions); (ii) the expiration of the Reply Submission period
(if there are no Accountant's Questions); or (iii) the expiration of the
latest deadline for either Party to submit responses to the Accountant's
Questions, as applicable.

(h) Costs of the Accountant. The fees, expenses and other costs of the
Accountant shall be borne by the Buyer and the Seller in the same proportion
as the aggregate amount of the Remaining Items that is unsuccessfully disputed
by each Party (as determined by the Accountant) bears to the total amount of
the Remaining Items submitted to the Accountant. For example, if (a) the total
amount of the Remaining Items submitted to the Accountant for resolution is
$1,000, (b) the aggregate amount of the Remaining Items resolved by the
Accountant in favor of the Seller is $600 and (c) the total amount of fees,
expenses and costs of the Accountant in connection with such dispute is $100,
then the Buyer shall bear $60 of such amount and the Seller shall bear $40 of
such amount.

(i) Resolution of Purchase Price; Payments. If the sum of the amount of the
Closing Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this Section 3.5
minus the amount of the Closing Indebtedness as finally determined pursuant to
this Section 3.5 is less than the amount of the Estimated Net Working Capital
set forth on the Estimated Closing Report minus the amount of the Estimated
Indebtedness set forth on the Estimated Closing Report, then the Seller will
pay to the Buyer the amount of such difference. If the amount of the Closing
Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this Section 3.5 minus
the amount of the Closing Indebtedness as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 3.5 exceeds the amount of the Estimated Net Working Capital set forth
on the Estimated Closing Report minus the amount of the Estimated Indebtedness
set forth on the Estimated Closing Report, then the Buyer will pay to the
Seller the amount of such excess. Any payments pursuant to this Section 3.5
shall be made within five (5) Business Days following the final determination
of the Closing Net Working Capital in accordance with this Section 3.5. All
payments will be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing by the Party to which payment is owed. Any
payment pursuant to

 this Section 3.5 will be treated by the Parties as an adjustment to the
Initial Purchase Price. The Initial Purchase Price as so adjusted is referred
to in this Agreement as the "Purchase Price."

(j) Sole Method of Resolving Disputed Items. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, including any provision stating that remedies
shall be cumulative and not exclusive, this Section 3.5 provides the sole and
exclusive method for resolving any and all disputes of each and every nature
whatsoever that may arise between the Parties with respect to Closing Net
Working Capital and the Purchase Price.

Section 3.6 Allocation of Purchase Price.

(a) Within forty-five (45) Business Days after the Purchase Price is finally
determined pursuant to Section 3.5, the Buyer will provide to the Seller
copies of IRS Form 8594 and any required exhibits thereto, prepared in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code, with the Buyer's proposed allocation
of the Purchase Price, as it may be adjusted, all other capitalizable costs
and the amount of Assumed Liabilities among the Purchased Assets (the
"Allocation Statement").

(b) The Seller will review the Allocation Statement and, to the extent the
Seller in good faith disagrees with the content of the Allocation Statement,
the Seller will, within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of the
Allocation Statement, provide written notice to the Buyer of such disagreement
or will be deemed to have indicated its concurrence therewith. The Seller and
the Buyer will attempt in good faith to resolve any such disagreement. If the
Seller and the Buyer are unable to reach a good faith agreement as to the
content of the Allocation Statement within twenty (20) Business Days after
delivery to the Seller of the Allocation Statement pursuant to Section 3.6(a),
the Seller and the Buyer will each use its own allocation statement consistent
with its own allocation of the Purchase Price.

(c) If the Buyer and the Seller agree on the Allocation Statement or any
modification thereof, the Buyer and the Seller will report the allocation of
the total consideration among the Purchased Assets in a manner consistent with
such Allocation Statement or modification and will act in accordance with such
Allocation Statement in the preparation and timely filing of all income Tax
Returns (including filing Form 8594 with their respective federal income tax
returns for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date and any other
forms or statements required by the Code, the IRS or any applicable state or
local taxing authority). Each of the Buyer and the Seller agrees to promptly
provide the other Party with any additional information and assistance
reasonably required to complete Form 8594 or compute income Taxes arising in
connection with (or otherwise affected by) the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

(d) The Buyer and the Seller will promptly inform one another in writing of
any challenge by any taxing authority to any allocation made pursuant to this
Section 3.6 and agree to consult with and keep one another informed with
respect to the status of, and any discussion, proposal or submission with
respect to, any such challenge.

received any negative past performance evaluations or ratings of any nature by
the U.S. Government and (ii) to the Seller's Knowledge there are no facts that

Section 4.12 Permits. The Transferred Permits are all of the material Permits
necessary for the conduct of the Business as currently conducted by the
Seller. All Transferred Permits are in full force and effect, and Seller is in
compliance in all material respects with the Transferred Permits.

Section 4.13 Intellectual Property.

(a) Schedule 4.13(a) identifies each patent, patent application, trademark
registration and application, copyright registration and application, material
Software (excluding Software that is the subject of a license from a third
party that is not an Affiliate of Seller) and domain name that is owned by the
Seller and is used or held for use by the Seller exclusively in the Business
or is necessary to perform the Purchased Customer Contracts, as conducted by
the Seller as of the date hereof. The Seller owns, free and clear of all Liens
(except Permitted Liens), all right, title and interest in and to the
Purchased Intellectual Property, including the Intellectual Property set forth

violate or otherwise misappropriate any Intellectual Property rights of any
third parties, and the Seller has not received, within the past twelve (12)
months, any written, or to Seller's Knowledge, oral, charge, complaint, claim,
demand, or notice alleging the invalidity of any Purchased Intellectual
Property or alleging any such infringement, violation or misappropriation by
the Business (including any such claim that the Seller must license or refrain
from using any Intellectual Property rights of any third party). To the
Seller's Knowledge, no third party is currently infringing upon, violating or
misappropriating any Purchased Intellectual Property, except as would not have
a Material Adverse Effect.

(c) The Seller has, with respect to the Business, taken reasonable measures to
protect the secrecy and confidentiality of all Purchased Intellectual Property
that is a trade secret or that is otherwise non-public proprietary information
relating to the Business, and to the Seller's Knowledge, no unauthorized
disclosure of any such Purchased Intellectual Property that is material to the
Business has been made.

(d) All material Intellectual Property developed by or on behalf of Seller
exclusively for use in the conduct of the Business or that is necessary to
perform the Purchased Customer Contracts was developed by its employees, or
independent contractors, acting within the scope of their employment or
engagement with the Seller, and all such employees and independent contractors
have assigned, free and clear of all Liens, to the Seller all right, title and
interest in and to all such Intellectual Property, except as would not have a
Material Adverse Effect.

(e) The software, hardware, networks, circuits, voice and data communication
lines, databases, electronic equipment, platforms, servers, interfaces,
applications, websites and related information technology systems and services
owned by or used by the Seller in the Business, including any outsourced
systems and processes (collectively, the "Systems") included in the Purchased
Assets, subject of a Purchased Contract or to be provided pursuant to the
Transition Services Agreement or the Facility Licenses (collectively, the
"Business Systems") are reasonably sufficient for the operation of the

extent applicable, true, correct and complete copies of each Seller Employee

fund of an Acquired Benefit Plan) has been maintained, operated and
administered in all material respects in compliance with its terms and the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other Law. No event has occurred,
nor do any circumstances exist, that could reasonably be expected to result in
any Liability to Seller or Buyer under any Laws with respect to a Seller
Employee Benefit Plan. There are no pending or, to the Seller's Knowledge,
threatened audits or investigations by any Governmental Entity involving or
affecting any current or former employee of the Business under a Seller
Employee Benefit Plan. No Acquired Employee is or reasonably could be expected
to be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 or Section 409A. The Seller
and its ERISA Affiliates have complied in all material respects with the
provisions of COBRA and, with respect to each Acquired Benefit Plan, with the
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder to the extent
applicable to such plan. No Acquired Benefit Plan that is an "employee welfare
benefit plan" (as such term is defined under Section 3(1) of ERISA) has
provided any "disqualified benefit" (as

 such term is defined in Section 4976(b) of the Code) with respect to which an
excise tax could be imposed under Section 4976 of the Code. The Fringe Benefit

respect to any multiemployer plan as a result of the transactions contemplated
herein. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.15(l), none of the Seller Employee
Benefit Plans provide for post-employment life or healthcare coverage for any
Business Employee or any beneficiary of a Business Employee other than as
required by Law.

meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable IRS
determination letter or an IRS prototype opinion letter upon which the sponsor
is entitled to rely with respect to its qualified status under the Code and no
fact exists which could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualified status of such Seller Employee Benefit Plan or the exempt status of
the related trusts.

(n) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.15(n), neither the execution of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
result in or is a precondition to (i) any Business Employee becoming entitled
to severance pay, gratuity payments or any similar payments or benefits, (ii)

amount, of any compensation due to any Business Employee or (iii) the renewal
or extension of the term of any Seller Employee Benefit Plan regarding the
compensation or benefits of any Business Employee.

or any death, disability or retirement benefit calculated by reference to age,
salary or length of service.

the Buyer to take any action that would not be commercially reasonable.

(d) The Buyer and the Seller shall each be responsible for the payment of
fifty percent (50%) of any fees required in connection with the filing of any
notifications and related materials that are required under the HSR Act or any
other Antitrust Law.

(e) Prior to the Closing, the Buyer and the Seller shall cooperate with one
another in determining whether any action, consent or approval by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity (excluding the actions and
filings described in Section 6.2(b)), is required or reasonably appropriate in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement, in taking such actions, seeking such consents or
approvals or making any such filings, the Buyer and the Seller shall furnish
information reasonably required in connection therewith and use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any such actions, consents or approvals and to
make any such filings. Notwithstanding the foregoing and Section 6.1, the
Seller shall not be required to pay any consideration (except filing and
application fees) to any such Governmental Entity from which any such action,
consent or approval is requested.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that, except to the extent provided in Section 9.1(b),
the successful procurement of any consent, approval or authorization of any
third party is not a condition to the Buyer's obligation to effect the
Closing.

Section 6.3 Carry on in Regular Course. Except (i) as set forth on Schedule
6.3, (ii) as otherwise required or contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) for
actions approved in writing by the Buyer (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) or (iv) as required to comply
with applicable Law, from the date hereof through the Closing or the earlier
termination of this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE XI, the Seller:

(a) shall conduct the Business in the ordinary course of business; provided
that nothing in this Section 6.3 will prohibit the Seller from asserting and
exercising its rights under any Contracts or Laws in connection with any
Action or otherwise, and

(b) shall not:

(i) sell, transfer, license, lease, mortgage or otherwise dispose of or
subject to Liens (other than Permitted Liens), any assets (other than
Intellectual Property) constituting Purchased Assets, except for the sale of
goods and services in the ordinary course of business;

(ii) acquire (by merger, exchange, consolidation or acquisition of stock or
assets or otherwise), any other Person or all or substantially all of the
assets of any other Person, in each case, if such Person or such assets, as
applicable, would constitute Purchased Assets at the Closing;

 (iii) (A) amend or modify any Material Contract except for amendments or
modifications that are immaterial or completed in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice (e.g., the delivery of updated or
additional task or work orders under Material Contracts); (B) voluntarily
terminate any Material Contract; or (C) enter into or propose to enter into
any Contract that if existing as of the date hereof would be a Material
Contract, in each case except as amended, modified, terminated, entered into
or proposed to be entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(iv) increase the compensation or benefits of any Business Employee (except
for increases in salary for such Business Employees in the ordinary course of
business and consistent with past practice), and adopt any new employee
benefit plan or arrangement;

(v) initiate, compromise or enter into any settlement of pending or threatened
litigation or arbitration proceedings or cancel, compromise, settle, waive or
release any material debt, right or claim in respect of the Business or any of
the Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities;

(vi) (A) sell, transfer, license, lease or otherwise dispose of or subject to
Liens (other than Permitted Liens), any Purchased Intellectual Property, other
than non-exclusive licenses granted in the ordinary course of business, or (B)
agree to terminate or permit the lapse any Purchased Intellectual Property;

(vii) enter into any Contract, which Contract would constitute a Purchased
Asset, with any of the Seller's Affiliates with respect to the conduct of the
Business or the ownership of the Purchased Assets;

(viii) make or change any material Tax election, adopt or change any material
method of Tax accounting, enter into any closing agreement with respect to
Taxes, settle any Tax claim or assessment (to the extent it will increase the
Buyer's liability for Taxes) or consent to any extension or waiver of the
statute of limitations with respect to Taxes, in each case relating primarily
to the Business or the Purchased Assets;

(ix) make any changes to its accounting principles or practices or its pricing
policies or payment or credit practices to the extent applicable to the
Business, other than as may be required by GAAP or Law;

(x) enter into any collective bargaining agreement;

(xi) terminate or close any material facility, business or operation;

(xii) fail to make any reasonable and prudent expenditure relating to the
normal maintenance, repair and replacement in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice of the material Purchased Assets; or

(xiii) agree or otherwise commit to take any of the actions prohibited by the
foregoing clauses (i) through (xii).

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.3 or anywhere else in
this Agreement shall give the Buyer, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the operations of the Seller or the Business prior to the
Effective Time, and, prior to the Effective Time, the Seller shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete and
unilateral control and supervision over the operation of the Business.

Section 6.4 Access to Business. Except as may be prohibited by Law, or as may
be required to preserve the confidentiality of privileged information or
attorney work product, prior to the Closing, the Seller shall, upon reasonable
notice, permit representatives of the Buyer to have reasonable access during
normal business hours and under reasonable circumstances to personnel,
properties, assets and books and records to the extent related to the
Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities; provided that (a)
access to such personnel, properties, assets and books and records is
reasonably required by the Buyer to timely consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (b) the Buyer and its representatives shall
not unreasonably interfere with the business and operations of the Seller, (c)
at the reasonable request of the Seller, the Buyer shall furnish the Seller
with a certificate of insurance insuring the Seller against loss by reasons of
any liabilities, obligations, damages or penalties imposed upon, incurred by
or asserted against the Seller in connection with or arising out of any access
granted to the Buyer or its representatives pursuant to this Section 6.4, and
(d) the Buyer may not conduct or cause to be conducted any environmental or
other testing at any Leased Real Property. Nothing herein shall require the
Seller to disclose any information to the Buyer if such disclosure would on
the advice of the Seller's legal counsel, be reasonably likely to waive any
legal privilege or work product protection.

Section 6.5 Confidentiality. The Buyer acknowledges that the information that
has been or will be provided or made available to it by the Seller and its
Affiliates (or their respective agents or representatives) is subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement will terminate.

Section 6.6 Notice of Developments. Between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing, each Party will give prompt written notice to the other of any
material development that would reasonably be expected to result in the
failure of any of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE IX to be satisfied.
During the period between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, the
Seller shall be entitled to update the Disclosure Schedules to the extent
information contained therein becomes untrue or incomplete or inaccurate after
the date hereof due to events occurring after the date hereof other than as a
result of a breach by the Seller of the covenants contained herein. Any such
update shall be deemed to have amended the Disclosure Schedules, to have
qualified the relevant representations and warranties contained in ARTICLE IV
and to have cured any misrepresentation or breach of representation or
warranty that otherwise might have existed hereunder by reason of such event
or circumstance. Nothing in this Agreement, including this Section 6.6, shall
imply that the Seller is making any representation or warranty as of any date
other than the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date.

Section 6.7 Publicity. Prior to the Closing, neither the Seller nor the Buyer
shall issue any press release or public announcement concerning this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written
approval of the other Party (which approval

 will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except to the
extent, in the reasonable judgment of such Party, disclosure is otherwise
required by Law or by the applicable rules of any stock exchange on which the
Seller or the Buyer (or any of their respective Affiliates) lists its
securities; provided, however, that, to the extent disclosure is required by
applicable Law or by the rules of any such stock exchange, the Party intending
to make such release or announcement shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to consult with the other Party with respect to the text thereof;
provided further that no Party shall be required to obtain the approval of the
other Party pursuant to this Section 6.7 if all of the information about this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby that is contained in any
proposed release or announcement has previously been made public without any
breach of this Section 6.7 by the Party proposing to issue such release or
announcement.

Section 6.8 Ancillary Documents. On the Closing Date, the Buyer and the Seller
shall execute and deliver each of the Ancillary Documents to which such Party
is to be a party as contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.9 Seller Guarantees. The Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to replace and cause to be returned to the Seller or its applicable
Affiliate, effective as of the Closing, each Seller Guaranty; provided that,
to the extent a Seller Guaranty cannot be replaced and returned to the Seller
or its applicable Affiliate effective as of the Closing, the Buyer shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to do so as promptly as practicable
following the Closing and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnified Parties from and against any Losses related to any action taken by
or on behalf of the Buyer after the Closing imposed on or incurred by any of
them arising from any payment made by the Seller or its applicable Affiliate
to a third party, or any draw-down made by the holder of such Seller Guaranty,
in each case, in respect of any Seller Guaranty.

Section 6.10 Release of Liens. The Seller shall obtain a release of any Liens
(other than Permitted Liens) on the Purchased Assets and, on or prior to the
Closing Date, shall provide evidence of such release to the Buyer and shall
deliver to the Buyer such other bills of sale, deeds, assignments,
certificates of title and other documents of transfer as may be reasonably
requested by the Buyer.

 ARTICLE VII 
ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

Section 7.1 General. In the event that at any time after the Closing any
further action is reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, each Party will take such further action (including the execution
and delivery of such further instruments and documents) as the other Party may
reasonably request, at the sole cost and expense of the requesting Party
(unless otherwise specified herein).

Section 7.2 Post-Closing Consents; Nonassignable Contracts.

(a) The Seller and the Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts after
the Closing to obtain all consents, approvals or authorizations of any third
parties that are not obtained prior to the Closing and that are required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the
Material Contracts that are set forth on Schedule 4.8(a); provided that the
Seller shall not be required to pay or otherwise provide any consideration to,
or incur any liability to, any other Person in connection with such
activities.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, to
the extent that any Purchased Contract is not capable of being transferred by
the Seller to the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement without the consent,
approval or authorization of a third party, and such consent, approval or
authorization is not obtained prior to the Closing, or if such transfer or
attempted transfer would constitute a breach or a violation of the Purchased
Contract or any Law (each a "Specified Consent"), nothing in this Agreement
will constitute an assignment or transfer or an attempted assignment or
transfer thereof.

(c) In the event that any such Specified Consent is not obtained on or prior
to the Closing Date, (i) the Seller and the Buyer will use commercially
reasonable efforts to (A) cooperate in any reasonable and lawful arrangement
designed to provide the benefits of the applicable Purchased Contract to the
Buyer, at the Buyer's expense, and (B) enforce at the request and expense of
the Buyer and for the account of the Buyer any rights of the Seller arising
from any such Purchased Contract; provided that the Seller will not be
required to make any expenditures or incur any liability in connection with
any such activities described in clauses (A) and (B) above, unless the full
amount of any such expenditure or liability is paid in advance to the Seller
by the Buyer; and (ii) the Buyer will pay, perform and discharge when due the
liabilities and obligations of the Seller under such Purchased Contract for
the benefit of the Seller and the other party or parties thereto.

(d) Once a Specified Consent is obtained, the applicable Purchased Contract
shall be deemed to have been automatically assigned and/or transferred to the
Buyer on the terms set forth in this Agreement with respect to the other
Purchased Contracts transferred and assumed at the Closing, and, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations and liabilities of
the Seller under such Purchased Contract shall be deemed to be Assumed
Liabilities, and the rights of the Seller under such Purchased Contract shall
be deemed to be Purchased Assets.

 (e) The Buyer agrees that the Seller will not have any liability whatsoever to
the Buyer arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consents,
approvals or authorizations that may have been or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or because of
the breach, violation, acceleration or termination of any Purchased Contract
as a result thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the Buyer further agrees that no representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of the Seller contained herein will be breached or deemed breached,
and no condition to the obligations of the Buyer will be deemed not to be
satisfied, as a result, directly or indirectly, of the failure to obtain any
consent, approval or authorization.

(f) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, with respect to any
Lease that requires consent to be assigned to Buyer, if such consent is not
obtained before Closing, the Buyer and Seller shall enter into a license that
would permit Buyer to use the licensed space for the Business to the extent
reasonably practicable containing such same terms and conditions, and be in a
form, reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller, unless the Lease prohibits
such license arrangement without the landlord's prior written consent, and
entry into and compliance with such license shall satisfy the obligations of
the Parties with respect to such Lease under this Section 7.2 until the
Specified Consent is obtained and such Lease is assigned in accordance with
Section 7.2(d).

Section 7.3 Novation of Purchased Government Contracts. Notwithstanding
Section 7.2 above:

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Closing, the Seller
will, in accordance with, and to the extent required by Federal Acquisition
Regulation Part 42, Subpart 42.12, promptly submit in writing to each
responsible contracting officer a request of the U.S. Government or
Governmental Entity, as the case may be, to (i) recognize the Buyer as the
successor in interest to all of the Purchased Government Contracts and (ii) if
required, enter into a novation agreement (the "Novation Agreement") in
substantially the form contemplated by such regulations. The Buyer and the
Seller will each use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly obtain all
consents, approvals and waivers required for the purpose of processing,
entering into and completing the Novation Agreement with regard to the
Purchased Government Contracts, including responding to requests for
information by the U.S. Government with regard to such Novation Agreement. The
Seller and the Buyer will each use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
all reasonable information and take all other actions reasonably necessary to
execute and consummate such Novation Agreement.

(b) In the event that the U.S. Government declines to enter into a Novation
Agreement in accordance with, and to the extent required by, Federal
Acquisition Regulation Part 42, Subpart 42.12 recognizing the transfer of the
Purchased Government Contracts to the Buyer, or until such time as the U.S.
Government recognizes such transfer by entering into a Novation Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement will constitute a transfer, assignment, attempted
transfer or an attempted assignment thereof or of any Government Furnished
Equipment related thereto.

(c) Until such time as the U.S. Government recognizes the transfer of the
rights and obligations under a Purchased Government Contract to the Buyer, in
accordance with, and to the

 extent required by, Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 42, Subpart 42.12, the
provisions of the Subcontract Pending Novation and Consent shall apply;
provided that the provisions of the Subcontract Pending Novation and Consent
shall not apply to any Purchased Government Contract for which novation is not
required.

Section 7.4 Litigation Support. Following the Closing, in the event that and
for so long as any Party is actively (i) contesting or defending against any
Action brought by a third party, (ii) undertaking an investigation (including
an internal investigation) in relation to circumstances that relate to
mandatory disclosure obligations under Government Contracts or that would
otherwise reasonably be expected to lead to an Action, or (iii) seeking
reimbursement and recovery of fees and expenses in connection with any Action,
in each case, in connection with any fact, situation, circumstance, status,
condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action,
failure to act or transaction involving the Business (the "Contesting Party"),
the other Party will (A) reasonably cooperate with the Contesting Party and
its counsel in the contest, defense, investigation, reimbursement or recovery,
(B) make available to the Contesting Party and its counsel in a timely manner
its personnel and provide such interviews and testimony and access to its non-
privileged physical and electronic books and records (including timekeeping
records) as may be reasonably requested in connection with the contest,
defense, investigation, reimbursement or recovery, in each case, at the sole
cost and expense of the Contesting Party (unless the Contesting Party is
entitled to indemnification therefor under ARTICLE X, in which case the costs
and expense will be borne by the other Party as set forth in ARTICLE X). For
so long as the Contesting Party is actively contesting or defending against
any such Action, involved in such an investigation or seeking such
reimbursement or recovery, the other Party shall preserve copies of all
physical and electronic books and records that is subject to a record hold
order (or written request by the Contesting Party Party in compliance with
this Section 7.4) in relation to such Action, investigation or request for
reimbursement or recovery in effect as of immediately prior to the Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 7.4 shall not apply to an Action,
investigation or request for reimbursement or recovery with respect to which
the Parties are in dispute as to whether either Party has an obligation to
provide indemnification under ARTICLE X.

Section 7.5 Agreements Regarding Tax Matters.

(a) The Seller will prepare and timely file all Tax Returns in respect of the
Purchased Assets and the Business for all Tax periods ending on or prior to
the Closing Date. The Buyer will prepare and timely file all other Tax Returns
that are required to be filed in respect of the Purchased Assets and the
Business. The Buyer shall provide each Tax Return for a Straddle Period to the
Seller for the Seller's review and comment at least fifteen (15) Business Days
prior to the filing thereof, and the Buyer shall make any changes to such Tax
Returns reasonably requested by the Seller.

(b) The Seller and the Buyer will provide each other with such assistance and
non-privileged information relating to the Business and the Purchased Assets
as may reasonably be requested in connection with the preparation of any Tax
Return or the performance of any audit, examination or any other proceeding by
any taxing authority relating to any Tax Return, whether conducted in a
judicial or administrative forum, and will each retain and provide to the
other party

 all non-privileged records and other information which may be relevant to any
such Tax Return, audit, examination or any other proceeding relating to Taxes.

(c) The Seller will exercise exclusive control over the handling, disposition
and settlement of any inquiry, examination or proceeding by a Governmental
Entity (or that portion of any inquiry, examination or proceeding by a
Governmental Entity) that could result in a determination with respect to
Taxes due or payable by the Seller, or for which the Seller may be required to
indemnify the Buyer (each, a "Tax Contest"). The Buyer will notify the Seller
or its Affiliates in writing promptly upon learning of any Tax Contest. The
Buyer and its Affiliates will cooperate with the Seller, as the Seller may
reasonably request, in any Tax Contest. If the Buyer could be subject to any
liability for such Taxes, including as a result of any indemnification
obligation under this Agreement, in connection with any such Tax Contest, the
Seller shall keep the Buyer informed of the progress of any such Tax Contest
(including the prompt provision to the Buyer of all material correspondence,
pleadings, protests, briefs, and other documents pertaining to such Tax
Contest). The Buyer may also participate in any such Tax Contest at the
Buyer's expense and the Seller shall not settle any such Tax Contest without
the advance written consent of the Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. With respect to any other Tax
Contest not controlled by the Seller, such Tax Contest shall be controlled by
the Buyer. The Seller may also participate in any such Tax Contest at the
Seller's expense, and the Buyer shall not settle any such Tax Contest without
the prior written consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Neither the Buyer nor any of
its Affiliates will extend, without the Seller's written consent, the statute
of limitations for any Tax for which the Seller may be required to pay or
indemnify the Buyer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, to the extent
this Section 7.5(c) conflicts with Section 10.3(b) or Section 10.3(c), this
Section 7.5(c) shall control.

(d) The portion of any Taxes payable with respect to a Straddle Period that,
for the purposes of this Agreement, shall be allocated to the portion of such
Straddle Period ending at the close of the Closing Date are:

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) based upon or related to income
or receipts or (B) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), other than
conveyances pursuant to this Agreement, deemed equal to the amount which would
be payable if the taxable year ended on the Closing Date; and

(ii) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the
Purchased Assets or Business, shall be the product of (A) the amount of such
Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an
arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period),
and (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period. Any credit or refund resulting from an overpayment of Taxes for a
Straddle Period shall be prorated based upon the method employed in this
Section 7.5(d) taking into account the type of the Tax to which the refund
relates. In the case of any Tax based upon or measured by receipts, capital
(including net worth or long term debt) or intangibles, or imposed in
connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment

 of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), other than conveyances
pursuant to this Agreement, any amount thereof to be allocated under this
Section 7.5(d) shall be computed by reference to the level of such items on
the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to effect the foregoing
allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practices of the
Seller.

(e) If the Buyer receives a refund with respect to Taxes for which the Seller
is wholly or partially responsible under Section 2.3(b)(iii) or this Section
7.5, the Buyer will pay, within twenty (20) Business Days following the
receipt of such Tax refund, the amount of such Tax refund attributable to the
Seller. If the Seller receives a refund with respect to Taxes for which the
Buyer is wholly or partially responsible under Section 2.3(a) or this Section
7.5, the Seller will pay, within twenty (20) Business Days following the
receipt of such Tax refund, the amount of such Tax refund attributable to the
Buyer.

(f) Neither Party will agree to settle any liability for Taxes or compromise
any claim with respect to Taxes relating to the Purchased Assets or the
Business, which settlement or compromise would adversely impact the liability
for Taxes hereunder (or the right to Tax benefits) of the other Party, without
the other Party's consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

(g) The Buyer will pay all foreign, federal, state and local sales, use,
direct and indirect transfer, documentary transfer, excise, value-added, VAT,
goods or services, registration, recording, stamp, documentation, real estate
transfer or asset gains Taxes, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
foreign non-resident stock sale or similar taxes that may be imposed by reason
of the sale, assignment, transfer and delivery of the Purchased Assets and the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement ("Transfer Taxes"). The Buyer will
timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed in connection with the
payment of such Transfer Taxes.

(h) The Buyer and the Seller acknowledge and agree that the Buyer constitutes
a "successor employer" within the meaning of Section 3121(a)(1) of the Code
and Section 3306(b)(1) of the Code and the regulations thereunder.
Accordingly, the Buyer agrees to treat all wages paid to Acquired Employees as
paid by a successor employer for all federal and state income and employment
Tax purposes.

Section 7.6 Records and Documents. Without limiting the effect of Section
7.5(b), the Parties will preserve and keep all Books and Records (which in the
case of the Seller shall apply only to those Books and Records that the Seller
elects to retain pursuant to the proviso to Section 2.2(a)(xi)) relating to
the Business or the Purchased Assets for a period of six (6) years following
the Closing Date. After such six (6)-year period, a Party will provide at
least sixty (60) days prior written notice to the other Party of its intent to
dispose of any such Books and Records, and such other Party will be given the
opportunity, at its cost and expense, to remove and retain all or any part of
such Books and Records as it may select. Following the Closing, duly
authorized representatives of a Party will, upon reasonable notice, have
reasonable access during normal business hours to examine, inspect and copy
such Books and Records held by the other Party.

Section 7.7 Use of Excluded Names. No right to use the Excluded Names is being
provided to the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement. Neither the Buyer nor any of
its Affiliates will

 (a) use, register or attempt to register any Excluded Name, trademark, service
mark, brand name, certification mark, trade name, corporate name, domain name
or other indication of source or origin that is likely to cause confusion with
any of the Excluded Names or be associated with the Seller or any of its
Affiliates after the Closing; or (b) at any time challenge the validity or
enforceability of any Excluded Name as a trademark, or the Seller's ownership
thereof.

Section 7.8 Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation.

(a) The Seller agrees that, for a period commencing on the Closing Date and
terminating on the Non-Compete End Date, it will not directly, or indirectly,
either for itself or through any of its Affiliates, (i) compete for or bid on
any (A) work performed under any of the Purchased Customer Contracts, (B) work
contemplated to be performed under any Purchased Government Bid or Pipeline
Opportunity, or (C) the recompete work or any other form of successor work to
work performed or contemplated to be performed under any of the Purchased
Government Contracts, Purchased Government Bids or Pipeline Opportunities,
including under another contractual vehicle or new Contract that includes such
work (collectively, a "Competing Business"), or (ii) intentionally cause or
induce any customer under any Purchased Customer Contracts or any contract
resulting from any Purchased Government Bids as of the Closing Date or
Pipeline Opportunities (a "New Government Contract") to terminate, in whole or
in part, any Purchased Government Contract or New Government Contract, reduce
the scope of work on any Purchased Government Contract or New Government
Contract, move requirements from any Purchased Government Contract or New
Government Contract to another contractual vehicle, or to not exercise any
options or otherwise not extend the term of any Purchased Government Contract
or New Government Contract. As used herein, "Non-Compete End Date" means (1)
with respect to the obligations in clauses (i) and (ii) above applicable to
Purchased Customer Contracts and Purchased Government Bids, the date that is
five (5) years after the Closing Date, and (2) with respect to the obligations
in clause (i) and (ii) above applicable to Pipeline Opportunities, the date
that is three (3) years after the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt,
except as specifically set forth above, the Seller and its Affiliates will not
be prohibited from competing or recompeting for any current or future business
opportunity that is outside of the scope of the opportunities listed on
Schedule 1.1(a) as a result of the restrictions on Pipeline Opportunities set
forth in this Section 7.8.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7.8(a), (i) except for a
Competing Business, the Seller and its Affiliates will not be prohibited from
engaging in any business currently conducted or proposed to be conducted by
the Seller or any natural extension thereof, (ii) neither the Seller nor any
Affiliate of the Seller will be prohibited from engaging in any of the
businesses or activities described on Schedule 7.8(b) and (iii) the
acquisition (by asset purchase, stock purchase, merger, consolidation or
otherwise) by the Seller or any of its Affiliates of the stock, business or
assets of any Person that at the time of such acquisition is engaged in a
Competing Business, and the continuation of such Competing Business following
such acquisition, will not be prohibited hereunder if (A) the revenues of such
Person and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis for the last fiscal year
ending prior to the date of such acquisition that are attributable to the
Competing Business by such Person and its subsidiaries (excluding any such
revenues of such Person or any of its subsidiaries generated from sales of
goods or services to the Seller or any of

 its Affiliates) account for less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the
revenues of such Person and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis for such
fiscal year and (B) the Seller uses its commercially reasonable efforts to
divest that portion of such Person or business that engages in the Competing
Business within eighteen (18) months after its acquisition of such Person or
Competing Business. If, on or prior to the date that is three (3) years after
the Closing Date, a Seller Contracting Party determines to pursue a Designated
Opportunity, such Contracting Party shall provide written notice to the Buyer
of such Designated Opportunity, and the Buyer and such Contracting Party shall
engage in good faith discussions to determine whether the Buyer could provide
contact center services as a teaming partner on the Designated Opportunity.
The Parties agree that the foregoing shall not obligate either the Buyer or
any Seller Contracting Party to enter into any teaming arrangement.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7.8(a), the acquisition of the
stock, business or assets of the Seller and/or any of its Affiliates (by asset
purchase, stock purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) by any Person
who is not a current Affiliate of the Seller will not be prohibited hereunder.

(d) Nothing in this Section 7.8 will restrict or prevent the Seller or any of
its Affiliates from maintaining or undertaking an investment in the debt or
equity securities of any Person engaged in a Competing Business so long as
such investment does not exceed five percent (5%) of the respective class of
outstanding debt or equity securities of such Person.

(e) Nothing in this Section 7.8 will restrict or prevent the Seller or any of
its Affiliates from complying with its obligations under this Agreement
(including Section 7.2 hereof) or any Ancillary Document.

(f) Except as provided in Section 8.1, during the period commencing on the
Closing Date and terminating on the date that is three (3) years after the
Closing Date, the Seller will not, directly or indirectly, solicit (or assist
or encourage any other Person to solicit) for employment any Business
Employees or any other individual who is employed by the Buyer at the "Vice
President" level or higher in the business of providing contact center
services to the public on behalf of Governmental Entities provided, however,
that this Section 7.8(f) shall not prohibit the Seller from: (i) publishing or
sending out a general public advertisement or other such general solicitation
for employment not targeted to any Acquired Employees; (ii) engaging any
recruiting firm or similar organization to identify and solicit persons for
employment on the Seller's behalf, so long as such recruiting firm or
organization does not target, and the Seller has not instructed or otherwise
directed such recruiting firm or organization to target, any of the Acquired
Employees; or (iii) soliciting any person whose employment with the Buyer has
been terminated by the Buyer prior to and independent of any communication
with the Seller regarding employment.

(g) Except as provided in Section 8.1, during the period commencing on the
Closing Date and terminating on the date that is three (3) years after the

or encourage any other Person to solicit) for employment any individual who is
employed by the Seller at the "Vice President" level or higher in the business
of providing contact center services to the public on behalf of Governmental
Entities; provided, however, that this Section 7.8(g) shall not prohibit the
Buyer from: (i) publishing or sending out

 a general public advertisement or other such general solicitation for
employment not targeted to the Seller's employees; (ii) engaging any
recruiting firm or similar organization to identify and solicit persons for
employment on the Buyer's behalf, so long as such recruiting firm or
organization does not target, and the Buyer has not instructed or otherwise
directed such recruiting firm or organization to target, any of the Seller's
employees; or (iii) soliciting any person whose employment with the Seller has
been terminated by the Seller prior to and independent of any communication
with the Buyer regarding employment.

Section 7.9 Post-Closing Receipts. If after the Closing either Party receives
any funds properly belonging to the other Party in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, the receiving Party will promptly advise the other Party
and will promptly deliver such funds to the account or accounts designated in
writing by such other Party.

Section 7.10 Rep Insurance Policy. The Parties acknowledge that, as of the
date hereof, the Buyer has obtained a conditional binder to the Rep Insurance
Policy, a true and correct copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B. The
Parties further acknowledge that obtaining the Rep Insurance Policy is a
material inducement to the Seller entering into the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents, and that the Seller is relying
on the Buyer's covenants and obligations set forth in this Section 7.10. The
Buyer shall bear all fees, expenses and premiums relating to the procurement
and binding of the Rep Insurance Policy, other than the Rep Insurance
Reimbursement Amount. Prior to and after the Closing, the Buyer shall take all
commercially reasonable actions necessary to complete the conditions in the
conditional binder to the Rep Insurance Policy within the times set forth
therein so that the Rep Insurer will issue the Rep Insurance Policy,
including, prior to or after the Closing and within the times set forth in
such conditional binder, the payment of any premiums owed in connection with
the Rep Insurance Policy, delivery of the required Closing No Claims
Declaration (as defined in the Rep Insurance Policy) and delivery of copies of
this Agreement, the documents contemplated hereby and, subject to the last
sentence of this Section 7.10, a copy of the electronic data room operated by
Intralinks under the title "Project Constellation." The Rep Insurance Policy
shall provide that (i) the Rep Insurer may not seek to enforce, or enforce,
any subrogation rights it might have against the Seller or any of its
Affiliates or representatives, except in the case of Fraud, and (ii) the Buyer
is not obligated to bring any claim against the Seller prior to bringing a
claim against the Rep Insurance Policy. Following the Closing, the Rep
Insurance Policy may not be amended in any manner adverse to the Seller
(including with respect to the subrogation provisions, policy term, retention
amount or coverage amount), and neither the Buyer nor any of the Buyer's
Affiliates shall cause the cancellation of the Rep Insurance Policy, without
the Seller's prior written consent (which consent shall be given or withheld
in the sole and absolute discretion of the Seller). A soft copy (e.g., thumb
drive) of the contents of the aforementioned electronic data room as of the
Closing shall be delivered by the Seller to the Buyer no later than ten (10)
Business Days following the Closing Date.

Section 7.11 Confidentiality. For a period commencing on the Closing Date and
terminating on the date that is thirty-six (36) months after the Closing Date,
each Party (the "Receiving Party") shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
its and their respective representatives to, maintain the terms of the
Ancillary Documents and all non-public, proprietary and confidential
information relating to the other Party (the "Disclosing Party") or its
Affiliates (collectively,

 "Confidential Information") disclosed to the Receiving Party or any of its
Affiliates or any of their respective representatives in connection with this
Agreement, in confidence and not disclose to any other Person any Confidential
Information or use any such Confidential Information for any purpose. From and
after the Closing, Confidential Information of or relating to the Business and
the Purchased Assets shall be deemed Confidential Information of the Buyer.
The obligations of each Party set forth in this Section 7.11 shall not apply
to (i) any information that becomes available to the general public prior to,
on or after the Closing Date (other than as a result of disclosure by the
Disclosing Party or any of its Affiliates in violation of this Section 7.11 or
the Confidentiality Agreement), (ii) any information that becomes available to
any such Person after the Closing Date on a non-confidential basis from a
source other than a Party or its Affiliates or its or their respective
representatives, provided that such source was not, to the knowledge of such
Person, prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal, contractual,
fiduciary or other obligation, (iii) except as provided in clause (v) below,
any disclosure requested or required by applicable Law or any Governmental
Entity, including any applicable Tax Laws, securities Laws or securities
exchange or listing regulations or requirements, provided that, to the extent
such disclosure is requested or required in connection with an Action, the
Receiving Party shall, to the extent reasonably practicable and legally
permissible, promptly notify the Disclosing Party of such disclosure under
this clause (iii) prior to making such disclosure with reasonably sufficient
time, where reasonably practicable, to allow the Disclosing Party to seek
protective measures for such Confidential Information (and the Receiving Party
and its Affiliates shall cooperate with the Disclosing Party in seeking such
protection, at the Disclosing Party's sole cost and expense), (iv) any Action
in connection with the enforcement of a Party's rights or remedies under this
Agreement or the Ancillary Documents solely to the extent necessary for any
filings with a Governmental Entity (provided, that to the extent possible, the
Disclosing Party shall request that such Governmental Entity treat such
Confidential Information as confidential and non-public), (v) any disclosure
or use of Confidential Information in respect of the Transition Services
Agreement, (vi) in connection with and to the extent necessary for a Party or
any of its Affiliates to prepare or file Tax Returns or other Tax filings, or
(vii) any disclosure or use of Confidential Information that is necessary for
a Party to perform or satisfy any of its obligations under this Agreement.

Section 7.12 Incurred Costs, Government Contract Payments.

(a) Period Between Closing and Novation: With respect to each Purchased
Government Contract, promptly following acceptance by the applicable
Governmental Entity of the final Incurred Costs under such Purchased
Government Contract, the Seller shall invoice the applicable Governmental
Entity for such Incurred Costs within thirty (30) days of acceptance of final
Incurred Costs. Any amounts collected or payments received by the Seller for
the Incurred Costs shall be an Excluded Asset; provided that with respect to
each task order that is part of such Purchased Government Contract, Seller
waives any entitlement to Incurred Costs that are $500 or less at the time of
final closeout of such task order or that becomes final (as finally determined
by the Defense Contract Audit Agency or cognizant Governmental Entity) more
than five (5) years after the Closing. Any amounts required to be paid by the
Buyer to the applicable Governmental Entity for any Incurred Costs incurred in
connection with work performed under such Purchased Government Contract prior
to the Closing shall be an Excluded Liability and the Seller shall promptly
reimburse the Buyer for any such amounts paid by the Buyer; provided that

 with respect to each task order that is part of such Purchased Government
Contract, Buyer waives any entitlement to Incurred Costs that are $500 or less
at the time of final closeout of such task order. The Parties shall cooperate
with each other in connection with their respective efforts to bill, collect
and pay the applicable amounts arising from the Incurred Costs. In the event
that Buyer receives any other claim, demand, or invoice in connection with a
Purchased Government Contract that constitutes an Excluded Liability, the

that constitutes an Excluded Liability, the Seller shall promptly reimburse
the Buyer for any amounts paid by the Buyer pursuant to the claim, demand or
invoice.

Section 7.13 Financial Information Cooperation. From and after the Closing
Date (provided that Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to begin
compliance with this covenant as soon as practicable after the date of this
Agreement) until the earlier of the date the financial statements contemplated
by this Section 7.13 are completed or the seventy-fifth (75th) day after the
Closing, Seller shall cooperate in a commercially reasonable manner with Buyer
in facilitating the preparation, review and audit of financial statements and
other financial information regarding the Business that is required to be
included in the financial reports and other public disclosures of Buyer's
affiliates pursuant to Regulations S-X and S-K promulgated under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Exchange Act in connection with
the transaction contemplated hereby (the "Audited Financial Statements"). Such
cooperation shall include commercially reasonable assistance with the
preparation of financial statements and all other financial information
reasonably necessary for the accounting firm responsible for reviewing and
auditing such financial statements to perform its review and audit, including
the execution and delivery by Seller of a customary representation letter to
such accounting firm (if and to the extent reasonably required by such
accounting firm and reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller). Seller

 shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide such cooperation in a
timely manner such that the preparation of the financial statements and other
financial information can be completed and the audit report thereon delivered
to Buyer no later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date. The accounting
firm responsible for the review and audit of such financial statements shall
be KPMG LLP. All reasonable, out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in

ARTICLE VIII 
EMPLOYEE MATTERS

Section 8.1 Employment. The Buyer will offer to employ, effective as of the
Closing, each of the Business Employees, in the same or substantially
comparable positions with the Buyer as provided by the Seller as of the
Closing Date. Each Business Employee who accepts Buyer's offer of employment
shall become an employee of Buyer (collectively, the "Acquired Employees") as
of the Effective Time. Buyer shall offer continued health coverage under the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ("COBRA") under an
Acquired Benefit Plan to any Business Employee who was covered under an
Acquired Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing, does not become an
Acquired Employee and experiences a qualifying event on or after the Closing
Date. The Seller shall terminate the employment of such Business Employees
effective as of the Closing. Without the prior written consent of the Seller,
the Buyer will not communicate any terms of employment to Business Employees
prior to the Closing or otherwise communicate directly with the Business
Employees. Effective as of the Closing and for a period of one (1) year after
the Closing, the Buyer shall provide to each Non-SCA Acquired Employee, for so
long as the Non-SCA Acquired Employee is employed by the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, (i) base salary or wages that are no less than the base salary or
wages provided to each such Non-SCA Acquired Employee by the Seller and its
Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii) employee benefits that
are comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to each
similarly situated employee of Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
in this Agreement will, after the Closing, impose on the Buyer any obligation
to retain any Acquired Employee in his or her employment. The Buyer shall
honor offers of employment made by the Seller to prospective Business
Employees prior to the Closing in accordance with their respective terms. The
Seller shall provide the Personal Data to the Buyer at such times and upon
such terms and conditions set forth in the Data Transfer Agreement.



Section 8.2 Employee Benefit Matters.

(a) To the extent that participants in the Seller's 2018 annual cash bonus
plans set forth on Schedule 8.2(a) (the "Bonus Plans") have not been paid
their 2018 annual bonuses (the "Annual Bonuses") at the Effective Time, the
Buyer shall cause such Annual Bonuses (only to the extent such Annual Bonuses
are accrued as of the Closing and included in the calculation of Net Working
Capital and such Annual Bonuses are set forth on a schedule provided to the
Buyer by the Seller at the Closing, stating each Acquired Employee's name and
the amount of the Annual Bonus target with respect to such Acquired Employee
as of the Closing Date) to be paid in accordance with the objective terms and
performance criteria of the Bonus Plans (calculated based

 on the performance of the Business through December 31, 2018), on or before
March 15, 2019, to each Qualified Acquired Employee who is a participant in a
Bonus Plan. A "Qualified Acquired Employee" means each Acquired Employee who
is employed by the Business as of the date Annual Bonuses are paid, and each
Acquired Employee whose employment is terminated by the Buyer or its Affiliate
following the Effective Time and prior to such Annual Bonus payment date for a
reason other than "cause" as defined in Schedule 8.2(a).

(b) As of the Closing, the Acquired Employees will cease participation in all
Seller Employee Benefit Plans except as provided for herein with respect to
the SCA Benefit Plans and Trust and the GSA Retirement Plan. As of the
Closing, the Buyer shall assume sponsorship of the SCA Benefit Plans and
Trust, GSA Retirement Plan and those certain Seller Employee Benefit Plans set
forth on Schedule 8.2(b)) (collectively, together with the SCA Benefit Plans
and Trust and the GSA Retirement Plan, the "Acquired Benefit Plans"). Seller
shall be responsible for all liabilities related to any assessment of any
Taxes, penalties or interest under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
Act of 2010 (as amended) with respect to any period prior to the Closing or
with respect to the correction of any pre-Closing documentary or operational
failure related to the GSA Retirement Plan. In addition, Seller shall be
liable for any health benefit claims covered by an Acquired Benefit Plan that
are incurred prior to the Closing to the extent that such health benefit
claims are not reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet, are not covered by stop
loss coverage, and are not covered by the assets of the underlying trust as of
the Closing. For purposes of this Agreement, a claim for health benefits will
be deemed to have been incurred on the date the related medical service or
material was rendered to or received by the Acquired Employee claiming such
benefit. Nothing in this Section 8.2(b) shall impair the Buyer's right to
indemnification pursuant to Article X of this Agreement. The Parties shall
execute such documents and plan and trust amendments necessary to effectuate
the Buyer assuming the Acquired Benefit Plans and shall cooperate and use
their commercially reasonable efforts to transfer and assign all third party
vendor relationships related to the Acquired Benefit Plans from the Seller to
the Buyer such that such relationships transfer to the Buyer at the Closing.
From and after the Closing, the Seller shall provide such information as
reasonably needed by the Buyer for purposes of timely completing any required
governmental filing pertaining to the Acquired Benefit Plans.

(c) As of the Closing, the Buyer shall recognize for purposes of applying
benefits and other perquisites that may be linked to an employee's seniority
or service with Buyer, the service of Acquired Employees with Seller prior to
the Closing.

(d) The Seller shall pay to each Acquired Employee any such accrued but unused
vacation and, to the extent required by applicable Law, paid time off, both
less applicable withholding Taxes, at the time of the Closing or, if permitted
by applicable Law, at the next regularly scheduled payroll of the Seller after
the Closing.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, all transaction
or retention bonuses relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement arising from any contract or arrangement entered into between the
Seller and any Business Employee will be paid by the Seller to any such
Business Employee in accordance with the terms and conditions of any

 such transaction or retention bonus contract or arrangement, and the Buyer
shall not assume any liability for any such bonuses.

(f) Following the Closing, the Buyer will waive any pre-existing condition
limitation under any Employee Welfare Benefit Plan maintained by the Buyer in
which Acquired Employees and their eligible dependents participate.

Section 8.3 Defined Contribution Plans. Except with respect to the GSA
Retirement Plan, as of the Closing, with respect to any Employee Pension
Benefit Plan that is a defined contribution plan intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code and is maintained by the Seller or any of its
Affiliates for the benefit of any of the Acquired Employees, such Acquired
Employees will cease to participate in such defined contribution plan. As of
the Closing or as soon as practicable thereafter, each Acquired Employee will
be permitted to elect a distribution of his or her account balance in the
Seller's or its Affiliate's defined contribution plan and will be permitted to
roll over his or her account balances in the Seller's or its Affiliate's
defined contribution plan (or any portion thereof) to the Buyer's defined
contribution plan.

Section 8.4 Compliance with WARN. With respect to all employment losses
experienced by the Acquired Employees and all other persons employed by the
Buyer which take place on or after the Closing, the Buyer will have full
responsibility and all liability under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act of 1988 ("WARN") and all other statutes, ordinances and
regulations of any jurisdiction which impose advance notice or other
requirements concerning any such employment losses. In the event that any such
employment losses are deemed to cause a plant closing, mass layoff or other
event requiring advance notice or other actions by the Seller and/or its
Affiliates under WARN or other statutes, ordinances or regulations of any
jurisdiction (a "Triggering Event"), then the Buyer will have full
responsibility and all liability arising from any such Triggering Event. For
purposes of this Section 8.4, a Triggering Event will be deemed to have been
caused by such employment losses if the Triggering Event would not have
occurred but for the employment losses which take place upon or after the
Closing, and "employment loss" has the same meaning as defined in WARN and
includes any other employment action giving rise to notice or other
obligations under other statutes, ordinances and regulations of any
jurisdiction.

Section 8.5 No Third Party Rights. Nothing contained herein is intended to
confer upon any Business Employee any separate right to employment or
continued employment with Buyer or its Affiliates, or any benefits under any
Employee Benefit Plan by reason of this Agreement. No provision in this
Agreement shall modify or amend any other agreement, plan, program or document
unless this Agreement explicitly states that the provisions "amend" that other
agreement, plan, program or document. This shall not prevent the Parties
entitled to enforce this Agreement from enforcing any provision in this
Agreement, but no other Person shall be entitled to enforce any provision in
this Agreement on the grounds that it is an amendment to another agreement,
plan, program or document, unless the provision is explicitly designated as
such in this Agreement, and the Person is otherwise entitled to enforce the
other agreement, plan, program or document. If a Person not entitled to
enforce this Agreement brings an action to enforce any provision in this
Agreement as an amendment to another agreement, plan, program or document, and
that provision is construed to be such an amendment despite not being
explicitly designated as one in this

 Agreement, then that provision shall lapse retroactively as of its inception,
thereby precluding it from having any amendatory effect.

applicable statute of limitations or other applicable Law, the representations
and warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents (other than the Subcontract Pending Novation and Consent, the
Transition Services Agreement and the Facility Licenses) shall not survive the
Closing and shall terminate at the Closing. All covenants and agreements
contained herein which by their terms contemplate actions or impose
obligations following the Closing shall survive the Closing and remain in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms. All covenants and agreements
contained herein which by their terms contemplate full performance at or prior
to the Closing shall terminate upon the Closing. In the event notice of any
claim for indemnification under this ARTICLE X shall have been given prior to
the expiration of a particular covenant or agreement and such claim has not
been finally resolved by the expiration of such covenant or agreement, such
covenant or agreement that is the subject of such claim shall survive, but
only to the extent of and in the amount of the claim as made prior to the
expiration of such covenant or agreement, until such claim is finally
resolved. Indemnified Parties shall not have the right to bring any claim for
indemnification under this ARTICLE X after the expiration of the survival
period set forth in this Section 10.1 applicable to such claim.

 Section 10.2 Indemnification. Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations
set forth in this ARTICLE X, from and after the Closing:

(a) the Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer and each of its
Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, members, managers
and employees (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") from and against
any Losses that are imposed on or incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties
prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in Section
10.1 arising out of:

(i) any failure to perform any covenant or agreement of the Seller set forth
in this Agreement or any Ancillary Document that by its terms contemplates
actions or imposes obligations following the Closing, or

(i) any failure to perform any covenant or agreement of the Buyer set forth in
this Agreement or any Ancillary Document that by its terms contemplates
actions or imposes obligations following the Closing,

(ii) any obligation of the Buyer described in ARTICLE VIII that by its terms
contemplates actions or imposes obligations following the Closing, or

(iii) the Assumed Liabilities.

Section 10.3 Indemnification Procedures.

(a) In order for a Party seeking indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE X
(the "Indemnified Party") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for
under this ARTICLE X in respect of a claim made against the Indemnified Party
by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement (a "Third-Party Claim"),
such Indemnified Party must notify the Party from whom indemnification is
sought pursuant to this ARTICLE X (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing of the
Third-Party Claim promptly following receipt by such Indemnified Party of
notice of the Third-Party Claim; provided, however, that failure to give such
notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except in
the event the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a
result of such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the
Indemnifying Party, promptly following the Indemnified Party's receipt
thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received
by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third-Party Claim, other than those
notices and documents separately addressed to the Indemnifying Party.

 (b) The Indemnifying Party will have the right at any time to conduct and
control the defense of, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third-
Party Claim which relates to any Losses indemnifiable hereunder and to select
counsel of its choice, provided, however, that, to the extent the Buyer
specifies in a notice to the Seller of a Third-Party Claim arising out of or
relating to any Ordinary Course Liability that such Third-Party Claim is
reasonably expected to result in an indemnifiable Loss hereunder of fifty
percent (50%) or less of the aggregate Loss reasonably expected from such
Third-Party Claim, the Buyer shall have the right to conduct and control the
defense of, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third-Party Claim
and to select counsel of its choice with respect thereto. If the Indemnifying
Party does not elect to conduct or control the defense of any Third-Party
Claim which relates to any Losses indemnifiable hereunder (other than arising
out of or relating to any Ordinary Course Liability), the applicable
Indemnified Party may defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with
such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any
such Third-Party Claim, the applicable Indemnified Party may participate, at
its own expense, in (but not control) the defense of such Third-Party Claim;
provided, however, that such Indemnified Party will be entitled to participate
in (but not control) any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of
the Indemnifying Party if (i) such participation is requested by the
Indemnifying Party or (ii) in the reasonable written opinion of counsel to the
applicable Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party's counsel would not be
permitted to represent both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
in the defense of such Third-Party Claim under applicable rules of
professional responsibility; provided, further, that the Indemnifying Party
will not be required to pay for more than one such counsel for all Indemnified
Parties in connection with any Third-Party Claim, provided, further, that the
Indemnifying Party will not be entitled to control, and the Indemnified Party
will be entitled to have control over, the defense or settlement of any Third-
Party Claim (and the reasonable, out-of-pocket costs of such defense and any
Losses with respect to such Third Party Claim shall constitute an amount for
which the Indemnified Party is entitled, subject to the limitations herein, to
indemnification hereunder) if (i) the Third Party Claim involves a criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation, (ii) if the Third
Party Claim seeks injunctive or equitable relief against the Indemnified
Party, or (iii) the Third Party Claim may result in suspension or debarment of
the Indemnified Party by a Governmental Entity.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause any other applicable
Indemnified Parties to, cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and
the Indemnifying Party shall consult with the Indemnified Party prior to
settling, compromising or discharging any Third-Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall, and shall cause any other applicable Indemnified Parties to,
agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third-Party Claim that
the Indemnifying Party may recommend and that (i) by its terms obligates the
Indemnifying Party or its Affiliates to pay the full amount of the liability
in connection with such Third-Party Claim which such payment is or will be
made in full, (ii) does not require any payment or other action by any
Indemnified Party, and (iii) unconditionally releases all applicable
Indemnified Parties in connection with such Third-Party Claim, with prejudice,
and does not require any admission or acknowledgement of liability or fault of
any Indemnified Party. For all other Third-Party Claims the defense of which
is assumed by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not settle,
compromise or discharge such Third-Party Claim without the

 consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the
defense of a Third-Party Claim, the applicable Indemnified Parties shall not
admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such
Third-Party Claim without the Indemnifying Party's prior written consent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(d) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party under this ARTICLE X that does not involve a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver timely notice of such claim to the
Indemnifying Party promptly following the Indemnified Party becoming aware of
the same; provided, however, that failure to give such timely notification
shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except in the event
the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure. Such notice will include a reasonably detailed description of such
claim, the amount of such claim (or estimate thereof, if the amount is not
known) and the basis for indemnification hereunder. For purposes of any
investigation of a claim against any Indemnifying Party under this ARTICLE X
that does not involve a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall provide
the Indemnifying Party with reasonable access during normal business hours to
the Indemnified Party's non-privileged books and records, other applicable
non-privileged documentation and information and personnel relating to such
claim.

(e) An Indemnifying Party making any indemnification payment under this
ARTICLE X shall be subrogated to all rights of the applicable Indemnified
Party in respect of any Losses or Taxes indemnified by such party.

Section 10.4 Indemnification Limitations.

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) the rights provided
under the Rep Insurance Policy shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Buyer with respect to any and all claims and Losses directly or indirectly
arising out of or relating to any breach of any of the Seller's
representations and warranties contained in ARTICLE IV and the Ancillary
Documents (other than the Subcontract Pending Novation and Consent, the
Transition Services Agreement and the Facility Licenses), provided that
nothing in this Section 10.4(a)(i) shall in any way limit Buyer's remedies
with respect to Fraud or a breach or non-performance of any of the Seller's
covenants and agreements hereunder or under any Ancillary Document, (ii) in no
event shall any Affiliate of the Seller or any of the Seller's or its
Affiliates' past, present or future officers, managers, employees, advisors,
members, consultants, investment bankers, attorneys, brokers or other
representatives or agents be liable for any indemnification to the Buyer under
or in connection with this Agreement, and (iii) in no event shall the Buyer
have any right to seek any indemnification or any other recourse of any type
under or in connection with this Agreement or otherwise from any Affiliate of
the Seller or any of the Seller's or its Affiliates' past, present or future
officers, managers, employees, advisors, members, consultants, investment
bankers, attorneys, brokers or other representatives or agents.

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, in
no event shall the Seller be required to make payments for indemnification
pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i) in an aggregate amount in excess of the
Purchase Price.

 (c) The Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
recover under any and all Collateral Sources (including, with respect to the
Buyer Indemnified Parties, the Rep Insurance Policy), for any Losses, but
shall not be required to commence litigation or any other proceeding against
any Collateral Source. In the event that a Buyer Indemnified Party is able to
seek to recover for any Losses by pursuing a claim for a breach of
representations or warranties for which coverage may be available under the
Rep Insurance Policy or by pursuing any other type of claim, such Buyer
Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to claim such
Losses in the manner for which coverage under the Rep Insurance Policy may be
available, unless and until such coverage has been exhausted or denied by the
Rep Insurer. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that a Buyer Indemnified
Party is able to seek to recover for any Losses as a breach of a
representation or warranty, on the one hand, or as a breach of a covenant or
as an Excluded Liability on the other hand, it shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to first pursue such Losses pursuant to a breach of a
representation or warranty, provided that such obligation to pursue Losses
pursuant to a breach of a representation or warranty shall not limit in any
way a Buyer Indemnified Party from also pursuing such Losses pursuant to a
breach of a covenant or as an Excluded Liability. In calculating amounts
payable to an Indemnified Party hereunder, the amount of any indemnified
Losses shall be determined without duplication of any other Loss for which an
indemnification claim has been made or could be made under any other
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement and shall be computed net of
(i) payments recovered by the Indemnified Party under indemnification
agreements or arrangements with third parties or under any insurance policy
obtained from a third party (including the Rep Insurance Policy) with respect
to such Losses (each, a "Collateral Source"), or (ii) any prior recovery by
the Indemnified Party from any Person with respect to such Losses, including
by means of the operation of Section 3.3 through Section 3.5, less, in each
case, any costs or expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in procuring
such payments or benefits. In the event of any indemnification claim paid, the
Indemnifying Party may, in its sole discretion, require the Indemnified Party
to grant to the Indemnifying Party an assignment of the right of such
Indemnified Party to assert a claim against any Collateral Source. If the
amount to be netted hereunder (the "Netted Amount") from any payment required
to be made by an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified Party under this ARTICLE
X is received by an Indemnified Party or otherwise determined after payment of
any amount otherwise required to be paid to an Indemnified Party under this
ARTICLE X such that the Indemnified Party has received an amount in connection
therewith in excess of its related Losses (such excess recovery, the "Excess
Recovery"), the Indemnified Party shall repay to the Indemnifying Party,
promptly after receipt or determination of the Netted Amount, the Excess
Recovery. In the event that the Seller is required to indemnify the Buyer for
any Loss pursuant to the Excluded Liability listed as Item #12 on Schedule
2.3(b)(x), the availability of reimbursement or recovery for such Loss from
the Governmental Entity constituting the customer under the applicable prime
contract shall be deemed a Collateral Source from which the Buyer must use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery in accordance with this
Section 10.4(c), and the full amount of any such recovery received by the
Buyer shall be promptly disbursed by the Buyer to the Seller (whether or not
such recovery constitutes an Excess Recovery).

(d) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
and without limiting any recovery from Collateral Sources (including the Rep
Insurance Policy) that

 may be available, after the Closing, except (i) as otherwise set forth in
Section 3.5, (ii) in the case of Fraud committed by a Party, (iii) for a
Party's right to seek specific performance or an injunction pursuant to
Section 12.8 or (v) for a Party's rights under Section 12.18, indemnification
pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE X shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties
with respect to any and all claims arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents (other than the Subcontract Pending
Novation and Consent, the Transition Services Agreement and the Facility
Licenses) and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including in
respect of any misrepresentation or breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other provision contained in this Agreement or the Ancillary
Documents (other than the Subcontract Pending Novation and Consent, the
Transition Services Agreement and the Facility Licenses). Without limiting the
generality or effect of the foregoing, as a material inducement to the Seller
entering into this Agreement, the Buyer (on behalf of itself and the other
Buyer Indemnified Parties) hereby waives, from and after the Closing, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any claim or cause of action,
known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which it or any of the other Buyer
Indemnified Parties may have against the Seller or any of its Affiliates by
reason of this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents (other than the
Subcontract Pending Novation and Consent, the Transition Services Agreement
and the Facility Licenses), the events giving rise to this Agreement or the
Ancillary Documents (other than the Subcontract Pending Novation and Consent,
the Transition Services Agreement and the Facility Licenses) and the
transactions provided for herein or therein or contemplated hereby or thereby,
except for claims or causes of action brought under or expressly permitted by,
and subject to the terms and conditions of, the provisions contained in this
ARTICLE X. All payments made pursuant to this ARTICLE X shall be deemed to be
adjustments to the Purchase Price.

(e) An Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under this ARTICLE X for any (i)
Losses relating to any matter to the extent that there is included in the
Recent Balance Sheet a specific liability or reserve relating to such matter
or (ii) Losses relating to any matter to the extent that the amount of such
matter is reflected in the Closing Net Working Capital, as finally determined
pursuant to Section 3.5.

(f) The obligation of the Indemnifying Party to provide indemnification under
this ARTICLE X shall be terminated, modified or abated as appropriate to the
extent that the underlying Loss, cause of action or other claim: (i) would not
have arisen but for a voluntary act or failure to act that is carried out by
or at the express written request of, with the express written approval or
concurrence of or with the knowing assistance of the Indemnified Party, (ii)
is based, in whole or in part, on the fraud, bad faith or willful misconduct
of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (iii) is a Loss, cause of
action or claim with respect to which the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates has taken action (or caused action to be taken) to accelerate the
time period in which such matter is asserted or payable or (iv) is primarily a
possible or potential Loss, cause of action or claim that the Indemnified
Party believes may be asserted rather than a Loss, cause of action or claim
that has, in fact, been filed of record against such Indemnified Party or paid
or incurred by such Indemnified Party.

 (g) No Indemnified Party shall have a right to recover Losses hereunder in
respect of any claim if such claim would not have arisen but for a change
after the Closing in Law or GAAP or other applicable accounting policies or a
change after the Closing in interpretation of applicable Law as determined by
a Governmental Entity.

(h) AN INDEMNIFYING PARTY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE UNDER THIS ARTICLE X IN RESPECT
OF ANY CLAIM FOR EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (EXCEPT TO THE
EXTENT RECOVERED BY A THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH A THIRD-PARTY CLAIM).
FURTHER, SOLELY WITH RESPECT TO INDEMNIFICATION UNDER Section 10.2(a)(i),
Section 10.2(a)(ii), Section 10.2(b)(i), Section 10.2(b)(ii), and Section
10.2(b)(iii) AN INDEMNIFYING PARTY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN RESPECT OF ANY CLAIM
FOR INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (EXCEPT
TO THE EXTENT RECOVERED BY A THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH A THIRD-PARTY
CLAIM).

Section 10.5 Mitigation. Each Party agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate any Loss which forms the basis of a claim for
indemnification hereunder.

Section 10.6 Tax Treatment. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, all
indemnification payments hereunder will constitute adjustments to the Purchase
Price for all Tax purposes, to the extent permissible under applicable Law,
and no Party will take any position inconsistent with such characterization.

ARTICLE XI

Agreement as provided below:

this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the issuance,
promulgation, enforcement or entry of any such Order.

Section 11.2 Effect of Termination. If any Party terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 11.1, all obligations and liabilities of the Parties

Section 12.2 Expenses; No Offset. Except as expressly provided in this
Agreement, each of the Buyer and the Seller, and their respective Affiliates,
will bear its own costs and expenses (including legal, accounting and
investment banking fees and expenses) incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, whether or not such
transactions are consummated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer and the
Seller shall each bear the cost of fifty percent (50%) of any fees required in
connection with the filing of any notifications and related materials that are
required under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law. Neither Party may make
any offset against amounts due to the other Party or its Affiliates pursuant
to this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents or otherwise.

Section 12.3 Disclosure Schedules. The representations and warranties of the
Seller set forth in this Agreement are made and given subject to the
disclosures contained in the Disclosure Schedules. Where only brief
particulars of a matter are set out or referred to in the Disclosure
Schedules, or a reference is made only to a particular disclosed document or
part of a disclosed document, full particulars of the matter and the full
contents of the document are deemed to be disclosed so long as (in the case of
disclosed documents) such documents were made available to the Party to which
such Disclosure Schedules were delivered. Inclusion of information in the
Disclosure Schedules will not be construed as an admission that such
information is material to the business, operations or condition (financial or
otherwise) of the Business or the Purchased Assets, taken in part or as a
whole, or as an admission of liability or obligation of the Seller to any
third

 party. The specific disclosures set forth in the Disclosure Schedules have
been organized to correspond to section references in this Agreement to which
the disclosure may be most likely to relate, together with appropriate cross
references when disclosure may be applicable to other sections of this
Agreement; provided, however, that any disclosure made in the Disclosure
Schedules for the purposes of any one section of this Agreement shall be
deemed made for the purposes of all other sections of this Agreement so long
as the applicability of such disclosure to such other sections of this
Agreement is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure. In the event
that there is any inconsistency between this Agreement and matters disclosed
in the Disclosure Schedules, information contained in the Disclosure Schedules
will prevail and will be deemed to be the relevant disclosure.

Section 12.4 Bulk Sales or Transfer Laws. The Buyer waives compliance by the
Seller with the provisions of any bulk sales laws that may be applicable to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 12.5 Assignment; Successors and Assigns. Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations provided by this Agreement may be
assigned or delegated by either Party (whether by operation of law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Party. Subject to
the preceding sentence and except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this
Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

Section 12.6 Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may only be amended, modified
or supplemented by a written instrument executed and delivered by the Seller
and the Buyer. A Party may extend the time for performance of or waive
compliance with any of the covenants or agreements of the other Party, and may
waive any breach of the representations or warranties of such other Party. No
agreement extending or waiving any provision of this Agreement will be valid
or binding unless it is in writing and is executed and delivered by or on
behalf of the Party against which it is sought to be enforced.

Section 12.7 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under Law, but
if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid
under Law, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent of such
prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of this
Agreement.

Section 12.8 Specific Performance; Time For Performance.

(a) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the other Party would be
irreparably damaged if any provision of this Agreement is not performed in
accordance with its terms or otherwise is breached and that monetary damages
would not provide adequate remedy in such event. Accordingly, each Party
agrees that the other Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent
any such failure of performance or breach and to enforce specifically this
Agreement and any of the terms and provisions hereof, in each case without
proof of actual damages and without posting any bond or other indemnity, in
addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled at law or in equity.

 (b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that time is of the essence for the
performance of all actions required or permitted to be taken by the Buyer or
the Seller under this Agreement. In the computation of any period of time
provided for in this Agreement or by law, the day of the act or event from
which said period of time runs shall be excluded, and the entirety of the last
day of such period shall be included, unless it is not a Business Day, in
which case the period shall be deemed to run until the end of the next day
which is a Business Day.

Section 12.9 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all such
counterparts taken together will constitute one and the same Agreement. This
Agreement may be executed and delivered by facsimile transmission or by
electronic mail in "portable document format" (".pdf") or by a combination of
such means, which will constitute effective execution and delivery of this
Agreement as to the Parties and may be used in lieu of an original Agreement
for all purposes.

Section 12.10 Descriptive Headings. The headings of this Agreement are
inserted for convenience only and will not constitute a part of this Agreement
or affect the interpretation hereof.

Section 12.11 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as set forth in ARTICLE X
hereof, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or
equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason
of this Agreement.

Section 12.12 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Ancillary Documents
collectively constitute the entire agreement among the Parties and supersede
any prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations or
warranties by or among the Parties, written or oral, that may have related in
any way to the subject matter hereof. In the event of any inconsistency
between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and those in any of the
Ancillary Documents, the terms and conditions of this Agreement will control.

Section 12.13 Exhibits and Schedules. The Exhibits and Disclosure Schedules
attached to this Agreement are made a part of this Agreement as if set forth
fully herein.

Section 12.14 Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO
ANY LAW OR RULE THAT WOULD CAUSE THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE
STATE OF NEW YORK TO BE APPLIED.

Section 12.15 Forum Selection; Waiver of Jury Trial.

(a) Any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of or based upon this
Agreement, the Ancillary Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby may be instituted in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York located in the Borough of Manhattan or the courts of the
State of New York located in New York County, and each Party irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action
or proceeding. Delivery of service of process, summons, notice or other
document by mail to such Party's address

 set forth herein shall be effective service of process for any suit, action or
other proceeding brought in any such court. The Parties irrevocably and
unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of any suit, action
or proceeding in such courts and irrevocably waive and agree not to plead or
claim in any such court that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in
any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

(b) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may arise
under this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents is likely to involve
complicated and difficult issues and, therefore, each such Party irrevocably
and unconditionally waives any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect
of any legal action arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
Ancillary Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Each
Party certifies and acknowledges that (a) no representative of the other Party
has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other Party would not seek
to enforce the foregoing waiver in the event of a legal action, (b) such Party
has considered the implications of this waiver, (c) such Party makes this
waiver voluntarily, and (d) such Party has been induced to enter into this
Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in
this Section 12.15(b).

Section 12.16 Acknowledgements; Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties.

(a) THE BUYER HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET
FORTH IN ARTICLE IV, NEITHER THE SELLER NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, NOR ANY OF
THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, STOCKHOLDERS OR
REPRESENTATIVES HAS MADE, OR IS MAKING, AND THE BUYER IS NOT RELYING ON, ANY
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING BY OMISSION),
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WRITTEN OR ORAL, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, IN RESPECT OF THE
BUSINESS OR ANY OF THE PURCHASED ASSETS OR THE ASSUMED LIABILITIES OR
OTHERWISE, OR WITH RESPECT TO ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THE BUYER AND/OR ITS
REPRESENTATIVES, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE, ENVIRONMENTAL
CONDITION, TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE SELLER, FOR ITSELF AND ON BEHALF OF
ITS AFFILIATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES,
STOCKHOLDERS AND REPRESENTATIVES, HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY SUCH OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES (INCLUDING BY OMISSION) AND ANY SUCH OTHER
INFORMATION THAT MAY HAVE BEEN PROVIDED. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT SPECIFICALLY SET
FORTH IN ARTICLE IV, THE BUYER IS PURCHASING, AND THE SELLER IS SELLING,
ASSIGNING AND TRANSFERRING, THE PURCHASED ASSETS ON AN "AS-IS, WHERE-IS",
"WITH ALL FAULTS" BASIS. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING,
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE IV, THE BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT NONE OF THE SELLER, ITS AFFILIATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS,
OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, STOCKHOLDERS OR REPRESENTATIVES HAS MADE, OR IS MAKING,
AND THE BUYER IS NOT RELYING ON, ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY (INCLUDING BY
OMISSION) REGARDING (A) THE CONTINUATION OF GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, THE
PROSPECTS FOR FUTURE AWARDS, THE EXERCISE

 OF OPTIONS, THE ISSUANCE OF TASK ORDERS OR THE FUNDING FOR ANY GOVERNMENT
CONTRACTS, AND NONE WILL BE IMPLIED AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, (B) THE ACCURACY OR
COMPLETENESS OF ANY INFORMATION REGARDING THE BUSINESS, THE PURCHASED ASSETS
OR THE ASSUMED LIABILITIES FURNISHED OR MADE AVAILABLE TO THE BUYER AND/OR ITS
REPRESENTATIVES, OR (C) ANY PROJECTIONS, ESTIMATES, FORECASTS OR BUSINESS
PLANS WITH RESPECT TO THE BUSINESS, THE PURCHASED ASSETS, THE ASSUMED
LIABILITIES OR OTHERWISE, ALL OF WHICH REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
(INCLUDING BY OMISSION) THE SELLER HEREBY DISCLAIMS. THE SELLER WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO THE BUYER OR ANY OTHER PERSON AS A RESULT OF THE DISTRIBUTION TO THE
BUYER, OR THE BUYER'S USE OF OR RELIANCE UPON, ANY INFORMATION, DOCUMENTS OR
MATERIAL MADE AVAILABLE IN ANY "DATA ROOMS," "VIRTUAL DATA ROOMS," MANAGEMENT
PRESENTATIONS OR INFORMATION MEMORANDA, OR IN ANY OTHER FORM, IN EXPECTATION
OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

(b) The provisions of this Section 12.16, together with the remedies specified
in ARTICLE X, were specifically bargained-for between the Seller and the Buyer
and were taken into account by the Seller and the Buyer in agreeing to the
amount of the Purchase Price, the adjustments thereto and the other terms and
conditions hereof. The Seller and the Buyer have specifically relied upon the
provisions of this Section 12.16, together with the remedies specified in
ARTICLE X, in agreeing to the Purchase Price, the adjustments thereto and the
other terms and conditions hereof, including in agreeing to provide the
specific representations and warranties set forth herein.

(c) Each of the Parties is a sophisticated Person that was advised by
experienced counsel and, to the extent it deemed necessary, other advisors in
connection with this Agreement. The Parties hereto have voluntarily agreed to
define their rights, liabilities and obligations respecting the transactions
contemplated hereby exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and
provisions of this Agreement; and the Parties hereto expressly disclaim that
they are owed any duties or are entitled to any remedies not expressly set
forth in this Agreement. Furthermore, the Parties each hereby acknowledge that
this Agreement embodies the justifiable expectations of sophisticated Parties
derived from arm's length negotiations; both Parties to this Agreement
specifically acknowledge that no Party has any special relationship with the
other Party that would justify any expectation beyond that of an ordinary
buyer and an ordinary seller in an arm's length transaction.

Section 12.17 Representation of the Business and the Seller. Each of the Buyer
and the Seller hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
directors, equityholders, officers, employees and Affiliates, that, in the
event that a dispute arises under this Agreement or any Ancillary Document
after the Closing between the Buyer and the Seller, Jenner and Block LLP ("JandB")
may represent the Seller, or any director, equityholder, officer, employee or
Affiliate of the Seller, in such dispute even though the interests of the
Seller may be directly adverse to the interests of the Buyer or the Business,
and even though JandB may have represented the Business in a matter
substantially related to such dispute. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Buyer, for itself and on behalf of its directors, equityholders, officers,
employees and Affiliates, hereby irrevocably waives and consents to any such
representation in any such matter. The Buyer further agrees that (i) all

 communications among JandB, the Business and the Seller and (ii) the attorney-
client privilege and the expectation of client confidence arising from JandB's
representation of the Seller and the Business, in the case of the preceding
