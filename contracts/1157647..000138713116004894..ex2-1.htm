This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is dated as of April 4,
2016, by and between Westfield Financial, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation
("WFD"), and Chicopee Bancorp, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation ("CBNK").

  



  

 _WITNESSETH_

  



  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of WFD and the Board of Directors of CBNK
have each (i) determined that this Agreement and the business combination and
related transactions contemplated hereby are in the best interests of their
respective entities and shareholders; (ii) determined that this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby are consistent with and in furtherance of
their respective business strategies; and (iii) approved this Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, CBNK will merge with
and into WFD, and WFD shall be the surviving entity (the "Merger");

  



  

WHEREAS, as a material inducement to WFD to enter into this Agreement, each
of the directors and certain executive officers of CBNK have entered into a
voting agreement with WFD dated as of the date hereof (a "Voting Agreement"),
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ , pursuant to which
each such director or executive officer has agreed, among other things, to
vote all shares of CBNK Common Stock (as defined herein) owned by such person
in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in such
agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, the parties intend for the Merger to qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"), and that this Agreement be and hereby is adopted as a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 354 and 361 of the
Code; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the transactions described in this Agreement and
to prescribe certain conditions thereto.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  



  

Article I

  



  

THE MERGER

  



  

 _Section 1.01_ _Terms of the Merger._ Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, CBNK shall merge with and
into WFD, and WFD shall be the surviving entity (hereinafter sometimes
referred to as the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue to be governed
by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and its name and separate
corporate existence, with all of its rights, privileges, immunities, powers
and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger. The
Surviving Corporation shall be named Western New England Bancorp, Inc. As
part of the Merger, shares of CBNK Common Stock shall, at the Effective Time,
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
the terms of Article II. __

  



  

 _Section 1.02_ _Bank Merger._ Concurrently with or as soon as
practicable after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Westfield Bank
("Westfield Bank"), a wholly owned subsidiary of WFD, and Chicopee Savings
Bank ("Chicopee Bank"), a wholly owned subsidiary of CBNK, shall enter into
the Plan of Bank Merger (the "Plan of Bank Merger"), substantially in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ , pursuant to which Chicopee Bank will merge
with and into Westfield Bank, and Westfield Bank shall be the surviving
institution (the "Bank Merger"). The parties intend that the Bank Merger will
become effective simultaneously with or immediately following the Effective
Time.

  



  

 _Section 1.03_ _Tax Consequences._ It is intended that the Merger
shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" as
that term is used in Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. From and after the
date of this Agreement and until the Closing, each party hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and will not
knowingly take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any
action or cause any action to fail to be taken, which action or failure to act
would reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. CBNK and WFD each hereby
agree to deliver a certificate substantially in compliance with IRS published
advance ruling guidelines, with customary exceptions and
modifications thereto, to enable its counsel to deliver the legal opinion
contemplated by Section 6.01(e).

--- 

    

  



  

 _Section 1.04_ _Articles of Organization and Bylaws._ The Articles
of Organization, as amended, of WFD, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Organization of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law. The
Amended and Restated Bylaws of WFD, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.

  



  

 _Section 1.05_ _Directors of Surviving Corporation After Effective
Time._ Subject to Section 5.18, immediately after the Effective Time, until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, the
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall consist of the directors of WFD
serving immediately prior to the Effective Time. __

  



  

 _Section 1.06_ _Effect of the Merger._ At the Effective Time, the
effect of the Merger shall be as provided under the Massachusetts Business
Corporation Act (the "MBCA"), and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of CBNK shall cease and all
of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties, assets, debts,
liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of CBNK shall
be vested in and assumed by WFD.

  



  

 _Section 1.07_ _Effective Date and Effective Time; Closing._

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, WFD will
make all such filings as may be required to consummate the Merger by
applicable laws and regulations. The Merger shall become effective at such
time as the Articles of Merger are duly filed with the Secretary of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts or at such later date or time as WFD and CBNK
agree and specify in the Articles of Merger (the date and time the Merger
becomes effective being the "Effective Time").

  



  

(b) The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at
10:00 a.m., Eastern time on the Closing Date (as defined below), at the
principal offices of Hogan Lovells US LLP in Washington, D.C., or such other
place or at such other time on the Closing Date as the parties may mutually
agree upon. At the Closing, there shall be delivered to WFD and CBNK the
certificates and other documents required to be delivered under Article VI
hereof. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to closing
contained in Article VI hereof, the Closing shall occur no later than ten
Business Days following the latest to occur of (i) the receipt of all
Regulatory Approvals, and the expiration of any applicable waiting periods,
(ii) the approval of the Merger by the stockholders of WFD and by the
stockholders of CBNK, or (iii) at such other date or time upon which WFD and
CBNK mutually agree (the "Closing Date").

  



  

 _Section 1.08_ _Alternative Structure._ WFD may, at any time prior
to the Effective Time, change the method of effecting the combinations of WFD
and CBNK, or Westfield Bank and Chicopee Bank, respectively (including the
provisions of this Article I, other than this Section 1.08) if and to the
extent it deems such change to be necessary, appropriate or desirable;
_provided, however,_ that no such change shall (a) alter or change the Merger
Consideration in any way; (b) adversely affect the tax treatment of
CBNK's shareholders pursuant to this Agreement; (c) adversely affect the tax
treatment of WFD or CBNK pursuant to this Agreement; or (d) materially impede
or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Plan of Bank Merger. In the event WFD makes such a change, CBNK agrees to
execute an appropriate amendment to this Agreement or the Plan of Bank
Merger, as applicable, in order to reflect such change. __

  



  

 _Section 1.09_ _Additional Actions._ If, at any time after the
Effective Time, WFD shall consider or be advised that any further deeds,
documents, assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary
or desirable to (i) vest, perfect or confirm, or record or otherwise, in WFD
its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or
assets of CBNK, or (ii) otherwise carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, CBNK and its officers and directors shall be deemed to have
granted to WFD an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver, in
such official corporate capacities, all such deeds, assignments or assurances
in law or any other acts as are necessary or desirable to (a) vest, perfect
or confirm, of record or otherwise, in WFD its right, title or interest
in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of CBNK or (b)
otherwise carry out the purposes of this Agreement, and the officers and
directors of WFD are authorized in the name of CBNK or otherwise to take any
and all such action.

 _Section 1.10_ _Absence of Control. _ It is the intent of the
parties to this Agreement that WFD by reason of this Agreement shall not be
deemed (until consummation of the transactions contemplated herein) to
control, directly or indirectly, CBNK and shall not exercise or be deemed to
exercise, directly or indirectly, a controlling influence over the management
or policies of CBNK.

  



  

Article II

  



  

CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

  



  

 _Section 2.01_ _Merger Consideration. _ Subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, by virtue of the Merger, automatically and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, each share of CBNK Common Stock issued and
outstanding at the Effective Time, other than Excluded Shares, shall become
and be converted into, as provided in and subject to the limitations set forth
in this Agreement, the right to receive 2.425 shares (the "Exchange Ratio")
of WFD Common Stock plus cash in lieu of Fractional Shares as provided for
in Section 2.03 (the "Merger Consideration"). __

  



  

 _Section 2.02_ _Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers._ At the
Effective Time, holders of CBNK Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have
no rights as, shareholders of CBNK other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration provided under this Article II. Upon and after the
Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of
CBNK of shares of CBNK Common Stock.

  



  

 _Section 2.03_ _No Fractional Shares. _ Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional
shares of WFD Common Stock ("Fractional Shares") shall be issued in the
Merger. Each holder of a Certificate who otherwise would have been entitled
to a fraction of a share of WFD Common Stock shall receive in lieu thereof
cash (without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying the fractional
share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking
into account all shares of CBNK Common Stock owned by such holder at the
Effective Time) by the WFD Share Price. No such holder shall be entitled to
dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional
share.

  



  

 _Section 2.04_ _Treasury Shares; Shares Owned by the Parties._
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, all shares of CBNK
Common Stock that are (i) held by CBNK as treasury shares or (ii) owned by
WFD or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no shares of WFD
Common Stock or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.
Any shares of WFD Common Stock that are owned by CBNK or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
retired.

  



  

 _Section 2.05_ _Reserved._

  



  

 _Section 2.06_ _Exchange Procedures. _

  



  

(a) Appropriate transmittal materials ("Letter of Transmittal") in a
form satisfactory to WFD and CBNK shall be mailed as soon as practicable, but
in no event later than five Business Days after the Closing Date, after the
Effective Time to each holder of record of CBNK Common Stock as of the
Effective Time. A Letter of Transmittal will be deemed properly completed
only if accompanied by certificates representing all shares of CBNK Common
Stock ("Certificate(s)") to be converted thereby.

  



  

(b) At and after the Effective Time, each Certificate shall
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, WFD shall (i) reserve for issuance
with its transfer agent and registrar a sufficient number of shares of WFD
Common Stock to provide for payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.07 and (ii) deposit, or cause to be deposited, with
Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of
the holders of shares of CBNK Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with
this Section 2.06, an amount of cash sufficient to pay any cash in lieu of
Fractional Shares pursuant to Section 2.03.

  



  

(d) The Letter of Transmittal shall (i) specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, (ii) be in a form
and contain any other provisions as are reasonably satisfactory to CBNK and
WFD and (iii) include instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon the proper
surrender of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly
completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal, the holder of such
Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate
representing that number of whole shares of WFD Common Stock that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.01, and a check in the amount
equal to the cash in lieu of Fractional Shares, if any, that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.03, and any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section 2.06.
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. As soon as
practicable following receipt of the properly completed Letter of
Transmittal and any necessary accompanying documentation, the Exchange Agent
shall distribute WFD Common Stock and cash as provided herein. The Exchange
Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with
respect to the shares of WFD Common Stock held by it from time to time
hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other
distributions paid or distributed with respect to such shares for the account
of the persons entitled thereto. If there is a transfer of ownership of any
shares of CBNK Common Stock not registered in the transfer records of CBNK,
the Merger Consideration shall be issued to the transferee thereof if the
Certificates representing such CBNK Common Stock are presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required, in the reasonable judgment of
WFD and the Exchange Agent, to evidence and effect such transfer and to
evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

  



  

(e) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to WFD Common Stock issued pursuant to this
Agreement shall be remitted to any person entitled to receive shares of WFD
Common Stock hereunder until such person surrenders his or her Certificates
in accordance with this Section 2.06. Upon the surrender of such person's
Certificates, such person shall be entitled to receive any dividends or other
distributions, without interest thereon, which subsequent to the Effective
Time had become payable but not paid with respect to shares of WFD Common
Stock represented by such person's Certificates.

  



  

(f) The stock transfer books of CBNK shall be closed immediately
upon the Effective Time and from and after the Effective Time there shall be
no transfers on the stock transfer records of CBNK of any shares of CBNK
Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to WFD,
they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration deliverable
in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 2.06.

  



  

(g) Any portion of the aggregate amount of cash to be paid pursuant
to Section 2.03, any dividends or other distributions to be paid pursuant to
this Section 2.06 or any proceeds from any investments thereof that remains
unclaimed by the shareholders of CBNK for nine months after the
Effective Time shall be repaid by the Exchange Agent to WFD upon the written
request of WFD. After such request is made, any shareholders of CBNK who have
not theretofore complied with this Section 2.06 shall look only to WFD for the
Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of Fractional Shares, if any,
deliverable in respect of each share of CBNK Common Stock such shareholder
holds, as determined pursuant to Section 2.06 of this Agreement, without any
interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates are not surrendered prior to
the date on which such payments would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to
the extent permitted by any abandoned property, escheat or other applicable
laws, become the property of WFD (and, to the extent not in its possession,
shall be paid over to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled to such claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement (or any
affiliate thereof) shall be liable to any former holder of CBNK Common Stock
for any amount delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(h) WFD and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon CBNK's
stock transfer books to establish the identity of those persons entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration, which books shall be conclusive with
respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of
stock represented by any Certificate, WFD and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of Fractional
Shares, if any, represented thereby in escrow with an independent third party
and thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto.

  



  

(i) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Exchange
Agent or WFD, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as the
Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration and cash in lieu of Fractional Shares, if any, deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.03.

  



  

 _Section 2.07_ _Reservation of Shares. _ Effective upon the date of

not be affected by the Merger.

(a) Each option to purchase shares of CBNK Common Stock issued by
CBNK and outstanding at the Effective Time pursuant to the CBNK 2007 Equity
Incentive Plan (each, a "CBNK Option") shall be converted into an option to
purchase shares of WFD Common Stock as follows:

  



  

(i) The aggregate number of shares of WFD Common Stock issuable upon
the exercise of the converted CBNK Option after the Effective Time shall be
equal to the product of the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the number of shares
of CBNK Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the CBNK Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, such product to be rounded to the
nearest whole share of WFD Common Stock; and

  



  

(ii) the exercise price per share of each converted CBNK Option shall
be equal to the quotient of the exercise price of such CBNK Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio, such quotient to
be rounded to the nearest whole cent; provided, however, that, in the case of
any CBNK Option that is intended to qualify as an incentive stock option under
Section 422 of the Code, the number of shares of WFD Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of and the exercise price per share for such converted CBNK
Option determined in the manner provided above shall be further adjusted in
such manner as may be necessary to ensure that such incentive stock option
continues to qualify as an incentive stock option and to conform to the
requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code.

  



  

(iii) Options to purchase shares of WFD Common Stock that arise from
the operation of this Section 2.10 shall be referred to herein as "Converted
Options." All Converted Options shall be exercisable for the same period and
shall otherwise have the same terms and conditions applicable to the CBNK
Options that they replace; provided, however, that all such Converted Options
shall be fully vested to the extent not previously vested prior to the
Effective Time.

(b) Before the Effective Time, WFD will take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for future issuance a sufficient additional number of
shares of WFD Common Stock to provide for the satisfaction of its obligations
with respect to the Converted Options. WFD agrees to file, promptly after
the Effective Time, a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or
other appropriate form) and make any state filings or obtain state exemptions
with respect to the WFD Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Converted
Options.

  



  

(c) Each unvested award of restricted stock issued by CBNK and
outstanding at the Effective Time pursuant to the CBNK 2007 Equity Incentive
Plan (each, a "CBNK Restricted Share Award") shall be fully vested as of the
Effective Time and converted into WFD Common Stock in the same manner as
any other outstanding share of CBNK Common Stock pursuant to the terms of
this Article II.

circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such favorable
determination letter or the loss of the qualification of such CBNK Pension
Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. There is no pending or, to
CBNK's Knowledge, threatened litigation relating to the CBNK Benefit Plans.
CBNK has not engaged in a transaction with respect to any CBNK Benefit Plan

severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date hereof, (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under,
increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant
to, any of the CBNK Benefit Plans, (iii) result in any breach or violation of,
or a default under, any of the CBNK Benefit Plans, (iv) result in any payment
that would be a "parachute payment" to a "disqualified individual" as those
terms are defined in Section 280G of the Code, without regard to whether such
payment is reasonable compensation for personal services performed or to be
performed in the future, (v) limit or restrict the right of CBNK, or
after the consummation of the transactions contemplated herby, WFD or
Surviving Corporation, to merge amend, or terminate any of the CBNK Benefit
Plans, or (vi) result in payments that would not be deductible under Section
162(m) of the Code. _CBNK Disclosure Schedule 3.18(f)_ contains a schedule
showing the present value of the monetary amounts payable as of the date
specified in such schedule, whether individually or in the aggregate
(including good faith estimates of all amounts not subject to
precise quantification as of the date of this Agreement), under any
employment, change-in-control, severance or similar contract, plan or
arrangement with or which covers any present or former director, officer or
employee of CBNK who may be entitled to any such amount and identifying the
types and estimated amounts of the in-kind benefits due under any CBNK Benefit
Plans (other than a plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code) for each
such person, specifying the assumptions in such schedule and
providing estimates of other related fees or expenses together with such
detail as is needed to ensure that no such payment or benefit would result in
a parachute payment to a disqualified individual within the meaning of Section
280G of the Code.

information by any governmental authority with respect to the condition, use
or operation of any of the owned real properties or WFD Loan Property nor has

 _Section 4.21_ _Tax Matters._

  



  

(a) WFD has filed all Tax Returns that it was required to file under
applicable laws and regulations, other than Tax Returns that are not yet due
or for which a request for extension was filed. All such Tax Returns were
correct and complete in all material respects and have been prepared in
substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. All Taxes
due and owing by WFD (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been paid
other than Taxes that have been reserved or accrued on the balance sheet of
WFD and which WFD is contesting in good faith. WFD is not the beneficiary of
any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return, and neither WFD nor
any of its Subsidiaries currently has any open tax years. No claim has ever
been made by an authority in a jurisdiction where WFD does not file Tax
Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. There
are no Liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due and payable) upon any of
the assets of WFD.

  



  

(b) WFD has withheld and paid all Taxes required to have been
withheld and paid in connection with any amounts paid or owing to any
employee, independent contractor, creditor, shareholder, or other third
party.

  



  

(c) No foreign, federal, state, or local tax audits or
administrative or judicial Tax proceedings are being conducted or to the
Knowledge of WFD are pending with respect to WFD. WFD has not received from
any foreign, federal, state, or local taxing authority (including
jurisdictions where WFD has not filed Tax Returns) any (i) notice indicating
an intent to open an audit or other review, (ii) request for
information related to Tax matters, or (iii) notice of deficiency or proposed
adjustment for any amount of Tax proposed, asserted, or assessed by any
taxing authority against WFD.

  



  

(d) WFD has provided CBNK with true and complete copies of the
United States federal, state, local, and foreign income Tax Returns filed with
respect to WFD for taxable periods ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
WFD has delivered to CBNK correct and complete copies of all
examination reports, and statements of deficiencies assessed against or
agreed to by WFD filed for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
WFD has timely and properly taken such actions in response to and in
compliance with notices WFD has received from the IRS in respect of
information reporting and backup and nonresident withholding as are required
by law.

  



  

(e) WFD has not waived any statute of limitations in respect of
Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or
deficiency.

  



  

(f) WFD has not been a United States real property holding
corporation within the meaning of Code Section 897(c)(2) during the applicable
period specified in Code Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii). WFD has disclosed on its
federal income Tax Returns all positions taken therein that could give rise
to a substantial understatement of federal income Tax within the meaning of
Code Section 6662\. WFD is not a party to or bound by any Tax allocation or
sharing agreement. WFD (i) has not been a member of an affiliated group filing
a consolidated federal income Tax Return, and (ii) has no liability for the
Taxes of any individual, bank, corporation, partnership, association, joint
stock company, business trust, limited liability company, or unincorporated
organization (other than WFD) under Reg. Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local, or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by
contract, or otherwise.

  



  

(g) The unpaid Taxes of WFD (i) did not, as of the end of the most
recent period covered by WFD's call reports filed on or prior to the date
hereof, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) set forth on the face of the financial statements included in WFD's
call reports filed on or prior to the date hereof (rather than in any notes
thereto), and (ii) do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of
time through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice
of WFD in filing its Tax Returns. Since the end of the most recent period
covered by WFD's call reports filed prior to the date hereof, WFD has not
incurred any liability for Taxes arising from extraordinary gains or losses,
as that term is used in GAAP, outside the ordinary course of business
consistent with past custom and practice.

shall be submitted to the shareholders of CBNK for their approval at the CBNK
Meeting and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve CBNK of such
obligation (unless and until this agreement is terminated in accordance with
Section 7.01).

 _Section 5.05_ _Merger Registration Statement; Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus._ For the purposes of (x) registering WFD Common Stock to
be offered to holders of CBNK Common Stock in connection with the Merger with
the SEC under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws and (y)
holding the WFD Meeting and the CBNK Meeting, WFD shall draft and prepare, and
CBNK shall cooperate in the preparation of, a registration statement on Form
S-4 for the registration of the shares to be issued by WFD in the Merger (the
"Merger Registration Statement"), including the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. WFD shall provide CBNK and its counsel with appropriate
opportunity to review and comment on the Merger Registration Statement and
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus prior to the time they are initially filed
with the SEC. WFD shall file the Merger Registration Statement with the SEC.
Each of WFD and CBNK shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Merger
Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing, and parties shall thereafter
promptly mail the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to their respective
shareholders. WFD shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any
necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required
to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and CBNK shall
furnish to WFD all information concerning CBNK and the holders of CBNK Common
Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with such action.

  



  

 _Section 5.06_ _Cooperation and Information Sharing._ CBNK shall
provide WFD with any information concerning CBNK that WFD may reasonably
request in connection with the drafting and preparation of the Merger
Registration Statement and Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and each party
shall notify the other promptly of the receipt of any comments of the SEC
with respect to the Merger Registration Statement or Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and of any requests by the SEC for any amendment or
supplement thereto or for additional information and shall provide to the
other party promptly copies of all correspondence between it or any of its
representatives and the SEC. WFD shall provide CBNK and its counsel with
appropriate opportunity to review and comment on all amendments and
supplements to the Merger Registration Statement and Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and all responses to requests for additional information
and replies to comments prior to their being filed with, or sent to, the SEC.
Each of WFD and CBNK agrees to use all reasonable efforts, after consultation
with the other party hereto, to respond promptly to all such comments of and
requests by the SEC. Each of WFD and CBNK agrees to cause the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and all required amendments and supplements thereto to be
mailed to the holders of CBNK Common Stock entitled to vote at the CBNK
Meeting and the holders of WFD Common Stock entitled to vote at the WFD
Meeting, respectively, at the earliest practicable time. __

  



  

 _Section 5.07_ _Supplements or Amendments._ CBNK and WFD shall
promptly notify the other party if at any time it becomes aware that the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Merger Registration Statement contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements contained
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. In such event, CBNK shall cooperate with WFD in the preparation of
a supplement or amendment to such Proxy Statement/Prospectus which corrects
such misstatement or omission, and WFD shall file an amended Merger
Registration Statement with the SEC, and each of WFD and CBNK shall mail an
amended Proxy Statement/Prospectus to their respective shareholders. __

  



  

 _Section 5.08_ _Regulatory Approvals._ Each of CBNK and WFD will
cooperate with the other and use all reasonable efforts to promptly prepare
all necessary documentation, to effect all necessary filings and to obtain
all necessary permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. CBNK and WFD will furnish each other and each
other's counsel with all information concerning themselves, their
subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as
may be necessary or advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and any application, petition or any other statement or
application made by or on behalf of WFD or CBNK to any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Merger and the Bank Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party hereto shall have the
right to review and approve in advance all characterizations of the
information relating to such party and any of its Subsidiaries that appear in
any filing made in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with any Governmental Authority. In addition, WFD and CBNK shall
each furnish to the other for review a copy of each such filing made
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any
Governmental Authority prior to its filing. __

  



  

 _Section 5.09_ _Press Releases._ CBNK and WFD shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statements without the prior consent of the
other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided,
however_ , that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party
(but after such consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances),
issue such press release or make such public statements as may upon the
advice of outside counsel be required by law. CBNK and WFD shall cooperate to
develop all public announcement materials and make appropriate management
available at presentations related to this Agreement as reasonably requested
by the other party. __

 _Section 5.10_ _Access; Information._

  



  

(a) Each of WFD and CBNK agrees that upon reasonable notice and
subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, it shall
afford the other party and the other party's officers, employees, counsel,
accountants and other authorized representatives such access during
normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time to
its books, records (including, without limitation, Tax Returns and work
papers of independent registered public accountants), properties and personnel
and to such other information relating to it as the other party may
reasonably request and, during such period, shall furnish promptly to the
other party all information concerning its business, properties and personnel
as may reasonably request.

  



  

(b) All information furnished pursuant to Section 5.10(a) shall be
subject to, and each party shall hold all such information in confidence in
accordance with, the provisions of the Mutual Agreement of Confidentiality,
dated as of December 7, 2015, by and between CBNK and WFD (the
"Confidentiality Agreement").

  



  

(c) No investigation by a party of the business and affairs of the
other party shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the conditions to the
obligations of such party to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

 _Section 5.11_ _No Solicitation._

  



  

(a) From the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time,
CBNK shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its directors,
officers or employees or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney,
accountant or other representative retained by it to, directly or indirectly
through another Person, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way
of furnishing information or assistance), or take any other action designed
to facilitate or that is likely to result in, any inquiries or the making of
any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into any agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding any Acquisition Proposal or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to
any Person (other than WFD) any information or data with respect to CBNK or
any of the CBNK Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an Acquisition
Proposal, or (iv) make or authorize any statement or recommendation in support
of any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, CBNK may
take any of the actions described in clause (iii) of the foregoing sentence
only if, (A) CBNK has received a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal prior to the CBNK Meeting that did not result from a breach of this
Section 5.11, (B) the CBNK Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with and having considered the advice of its outside legal
counsel and its financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, (C) CBNK has provided
WFD with at least one (1) Business Day's prior notice of such determination
(the "Notice of Superior Proposal"), and (D) prior to furnishing or affording
access to any information or data with respect to CBNK or otherwise relating
to an Acquisition Proposal, CBNK receives from such Person a
confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to CBNK than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement between WFD and CBNK. CBNK shall
promptly provide to WFD any non-public information regarding CBNK provided to
any other Person that was not previously provided to WFD, such additional
information to be provided no later than the date of provision of such
information to such other party.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding Section 5.04, prior to the date of the CBNK
Meeting, the CBNK Board may approve or recommend to the stockholders of CBNK a
Superior Proposal and withdraw, change, qualify or modify the CBNK
Recommendation in connection therewith (a "Change in Recommendation") after
the third (3rd) Business Day following WFD's receipt of the Notice of
Superior Proposal advising WFD that the CBNK Board has decided that a bona
fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that it received (that did not
result from a breach of this Section 5.11) constitutes a Superior Proposal
(it being understood that CBNK shall be required to deliver a new Notice of
Superior Proposal in respect of any revised Superior Proposal from such third
party or its affiliates that CBNK proposes to accept and the subsequent
notice period (which shall not shorten such original three (3) Business Day
period) shall be two (2) Business Days) if, but only if, (a) the CBNK Board
has reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation with and having
considered the advice of outside legal counsel and its financial advisor,
that the failure to take such actions would be reasonably likely to violate
its fiduciary duties to CBNK's stockholders under applicable law, and (b) at
the end of such three (3) Business Day period or two (2) Business Day period
(as the case may be), after taking into account any such adjusted, modified or
amended terms as may have been committed to in writing by WFD since its
receipt of such Notice of Superior Proposal (provided, however, that WFD
shall not have any obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications or
amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement), the CBNK Board has
again in good faith made the determination (i) in clause (a) of this Section
5.11, and (ii) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the withdrawal, changing,
qualifying or modifying of the CBNK Recommendation or the making of a Change
in Recommendation by the CBNK Board shall not change the approval of the CBNK
Board for purposes of causing any applicable "moratorium," "control share,"
"fair price," "takeover," "interested stockholder" or similar law to be
inapplicable to this Agreement and the CBNK Voting Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger.

(c) CBNK shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than WFD)
conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause all Persons other than WFD who have been
furnished confidential information regarding CBNK in connection with the
solicitation of or discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal within
the twelve (12) months prior to the date hereof promptly to return or destroy
such information. CBNK agrees not to release any third party from the
confidentiality and standstill provisions of any agreement to which CBNK is or
may become a party, and shall immediately take all steps necessary to
terminate any approval that may have been heretofore given under any such
provisions authorizing any Person (other than WFD) to make an Acquisition
Proposal.

  



  

CBNK shall ensure that the directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives (including any investment bankers, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants or other retained representatives) of CBNK are aware
of the restrictions described in this Section 5.11 as reasonably necessary to
avoid violations thereof. It is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 5.11 by any director, officer,
employee, agent or representative (including any investment banker, financial
advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained representative) of CBNK, at
the direction or with the consent of CBNK, shall be deemed to be a breach of
this Section 5.11 by CBNK.

  



  

 _Section 5.12_ _Indemnification. _

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, WFD (the "Indemnifying
Party") shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and
officer of CBNK and each other Person entitled to indemnification under the
Bylaws of WFD as in effect on the date hereof, as applicable, determined as
of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties") against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of
or pertaining to the fact that he or she was a director or officer of CBNK or
is or was serving at the request of CBNK as a director, officer, employee or
other agent of any other organization or in any capacity with respect to any
employee benefit plan of CBNK, including without limitation matters related
to the negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement or any of the
Transactions contemplated hereby, to the fullest extent which such Indemnified
Parties would be entitled under the Amended and Restated Bylaws of CBNK as in
effect on the date hereof (subject to change as required by law). WFD's
obligations under this Section 5.12(a) shall continue in full force and
effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time;
_provided, however,_ that all rights to indemnification in respect of any
claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final
disposition of such claim. In addition, WFD shall advance expenses to the
Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent which such Indemnified Parties
would be entitled under the Amended and Restated Bylaws of CBNK as in effect
on the date hereof without regard to director approval of such advancement of
expenses.

  



  

   

33

--- 

    

  



  

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
this Section 5.12, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party, but the
failure to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent that
such failure does actually prejudice the Indemnifying Party. In the event of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising
before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have
the right to assume the defense thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall not
be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel
or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in
connection with the defense thereof, except that if the Indemnifying Party
elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties
advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may
retain counsel which is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party, and
the Indemnifying Party shall pay, promptly as statements therefor are
received, the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Parties (which may not exceed one firm in any jurisdiction unless
counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues that raise
conflicts of interest between the Indemnified Parties), (ii) the Indemnified
Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter, (iii) the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its
prior written consent and (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall have no
obligation hereunder in the event that indemnification of an
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable laws and regulations or by an applicable federal or state banking
agency or a court of competent jurisdiction.

  



    

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, WFD shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the persons serving as directors and officers of
CBNK immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered by the directors'
and officers' liability insurance policy maintained by CBNK (provided that
WFD may substitute therefor policies which are not materially less
advantageous than such policy or single premium tail coverage with policy
limits equal to CBNK's existing coverage limits) for a six-year period
following the Effective Time with respect to acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time which were committed by such directors and
officers in their capacities as such, provided that in no event shall WFD be
required to expend in any one year more than an amount equal to 200% of the
current annual amount expended by CBNK to maintain such insurance (the
"Insurance Amount"), and further provided that if WFD is unable to maintain
or obtain the insurance called for by this Section 5.12(c) as a result of
the preceding provision, WFD shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
as much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount.

  



  

(d) If WFD or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate
with or merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or
surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or
substantially all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of WFD
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.12.

  



  

 _Section 5.13_ _Employees; Benefit Plans._

  



  

(a) Following the Closing Date, WFD may choose to maintain any or
all of the CBNK Benefit Plans in its sole discretion and CBNK shall cooperate
with WFD in order to effect any plan terminations to be made as of the
Effective Time. However, for any CBNK Benefit Plan terminated for which there
is a comparable WFD Benefit Plan of general applicability (other than the
defined benefit pension plan maintained by WFD), WFD shall take all
reasonable action so that employees of CBNK shall be entitled to participate
in such WFD Benefit Plan to the same extent as similarly-situated employees
of WFD (it being understood that inclusion of the employees of CBNK in the WFD
Benefit Plans may occur at different times with respect to different plans).
WFD shall cause each WFD Benefit Plan in which employees of CBNK are eligible
to participate to take into account for purposes of eligibility and vesting
under the WFD Benefit Plans (but not for purposes of benefit accrual) the
service of such employees with CBNK and its Subsidiaries to the same extent as
such service was credited for such purpose by CBNK (other than for the
defined benefit pension plan maintained by WFD); _provided, however,_  that
such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits. Nothing herein shall limit the ability
of WFD to amend or terminate any of the CBNK Benefit Plans or WFD Benefit
Plans in accordance with their terms at any time; _provided, however,_ that
WFD shall continue to maintain the CBNK Benefit Plans (other than stock-
based or incentive plans and the defined benefit pension plan) for which
there is a comparable WFD Benefit Plan until the CBNK Employees are permitted
to participate in the WFD Benefit Plans, unless such WFD Benefit Plan has been
frozen or terminated with respect to similarly-situated employees of WFD or
any Subsidiary of WFD. Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the
contrary, the CBNK 2007 Equity Incentive Plan will be maintained to the
extent there are outstanding Converted Options.

(b) WFD shall assume and honor, under the vacation policies of
CBNK, as disclosed on _CBNK Disclosure Schedule 3.18_ , the accrued but unused
vacation time of employees of the Surviving Corporation who were employees of
CBNK prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, CBNK shall
take all actions needed to revise the terms of its existing severance pay
plan as set forth on _CBNK Disclosure Schedule 5.13(b)_.

  



  

(c) If employees of CBNK become eligible to participate in a
medical, dental or health plan of WFD upon termination of such plan of CBNK,
WFD shall make all commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such plan to
(i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such
conditions are covered under the applicable medical, health or dental plans
of WFD, (ii) honor under such plans any deductible, co-payment and out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by the employees and their beneficiaries during the
portion of the calendar year prior to such participation and (iii) waive any
waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement which would
otherwise be applicable to such employee on or after the Effective Time, in
each case to the extent such employee had satisfied any similar limitation or
requirement under an analogous CBNK Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(d) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, CBNK shall
obtain from each of the individuals named in _CBNK Disclosure Schedule
5.13(d)_ an agreement (a "Settlement Agreement") to accept in full settlement
of his or her rights under the specified programs the amounts and benefits
determined under his or her Settlement Agreement (the aggregate amounts of
such payments to be specified in _CBNK Disclosure Schedule 5.13(d)_ ) and pay
such amounts to such individuals who are employed at the Effective Time
pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement. As to, and only as to,
each individual who enters into a Settlement Agreement, WFD acknowledges and
agrees that (i) the Merger constitutes a "change of control" or "change in
control" for all purposes pursuant to such agreements, and (ii) CBNK will pay
out all cash amounts under such agreements at the Closing Date . Any officer
or employee of CBNK who is a party to a Settlement Agreement shall be
entitled to receive the benefits payable or to be otherwise provided pursuant
to the terms of such Settlement Agreement, and WFD agrees to provide the non-
cash benefits, if any, pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement.

  



  

(e) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, WFD and/or
Westfield Bank is entering into employment agreements with William J. Wagner
and Darlene Libiszewski in the forms attached hereto as Exhibits C-1 and C-2,
respectively, to be effective as of the Effective Time, and settlement
agreements with William J. Wagner, Maria J.C. Aigner, Russell J. Omer, Guida
R. Sajdak and Cidalia Inacio in the forms attached hereto as Exhibits D-1 to
D-5 hereto, respectively, to be effective as of the Effective Time.

  



  

(f) Subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, the CBNK tax-
qualified employee stock ownership plan (the "ESOP") shall be terminated
immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time (all shares held
by the ESOP shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration), a portion of the unallocated shares held by the ESOP will be
either (i) sold and the proceeds of such sale applied to the repayment of all
outstanding ESOP indebtedness, or (ii) a sufficient number of unallocated
shares of CBNK Common Stock will be delivered to CBNK in order to repay all
outstanding ESOP indebtedness, and the balance of the unallocated shares and
any other assets remaining unallocated shall be allocated and distributed to
ESOP participants (subject to the receipt of a favorable determination
letter from the IRS), as provided for in the ESOP unless otherwise required
by applicable law. Prior to the Effective Time, CBNK, and following the
Effective Time, WFD shall use their respective best efforts in good faith to
obtain such favorable determination letter (including, but not limited to,
making such changes to the ESOP and the proposed allocations as may be
requested by the IRS as a condition to its issuance of a favorable
determination letter). CBNK and following the Effective Time, WFD, will
adopt such amendments to the ESOP as may be reasonably required by the IRS as
a condition to granting such favorable determination letter on termination.
Neither CBNK, nor following the Effective Time, WFD shall make any
distribution from the ESOP except as may be required by applicable law until
receipt of such favorable determination letter. In the case of a conflict
between the terms of this Section 5.13(f) and the terms of the ESOP, the
terms of the ESOP shall control however, in the event of any such
conflict, CBNK before the Merger, and WFD after the Merger, shall use their
best efforts to cause the ESOP to be amended to conform to the requirements
of this Section 5.13(f).

(g) WFD will use its best efforts to cause each employee of CBNK
that continues employment with WFD at the Closing Date to be eligible to
participate in WFD's 401(k) Plan and employee stock ownership plan on the
first day of the calendar month immediately following the Closing Date;
_provided, however_ , that participation in the WFD 401(k) Plan and employee
stock ownership plan by each such employee of CBNK that continues employment
with WFD at the Closing Date shall be subject to applicable length of service
requirements for eligibility for participation in such plans, which length of
service of such employees that continue employment with WFD shall take into
account for purposes of eligibility to participate in such plans the service
of such employees with CBNK and its Subsidiaries to the same extent as such
service was credited for such purpose by CBNK.

  



  

(h) WFD shall provide a retention pool in an amount up to $100,000
for the benefit of certain employees of CBNK to be designated by WFD at its
sole discretion; provided that, any such designations shall be made in
consultation with CBNK. Such designated employees will enter into retention
agreements to be agreed upon by WFD and CBNK.

  



  

 _Section 5.14_ _Notification of Certain Changes._ WFD and CBNK shall
promptly advise the other party of any change or event having, or which could
be reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on it or which it
believes would, or which could reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute
a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants
contained herein. From time to time prior to the Effective Time (and on the
date prior to the Closing Date), each party will supplement or amend its
Disclosure Schedules delivered in connection with the execution of this
Agreement to reflect any matter which, if existing, occurring or known at
the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or
described in such Disclosure Schedules or which is necessary to correct any
information in such Disclosure Schedules which has been rendered inaccurate
thereby. No supplement or amendment to such Disclosure Schedules shall have
any effect for the purpose of determining the accuracy of the representations
and warranties of the parties contained in Article III and Article IV in
order to determine the fulfillment of the conditions set forth in
Sections 6.02(a) or 6.03(a) hereof, as the case may be, or the compliance by
CBNK or WFD, as the case may be, with the respective covenants and agreements
of such parties contained herein. __

  



  

 _Section 5.15_ _Current Information._ During the period from the
date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, each party will cause one or
more of its designated representatives to confer on a regular and frequent
basis with representatives of the other party and to report the general
status of its ongoing operations. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees to provide the other party (i) a copy of each report filed by it with
a Governmental Authority within one (1) Business Day following the filing
thereof and (ii) monthly updates of the information required to be set forth
in CBNK Disclosure Schedule 3.14 or WFD Disclosure Schedule 4.14, as the case
may be.

  



  

 _Section 5.16_ _Board Packages._ Each party shall distribute a copy
of its Board package, including the agenda and any draft minutes, to the
other party at the same time and in the same manner in which it distributes a
copy of such packages to its Board; _provided, however, _ that neither party
shall be required to copy the other party on any documents that disclose
confidential discussions of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or any third party proposal to acquire control of such party or any
other matter that such party's Board has been advised of by counsel that such
distribution to the other party may violate a confidentiality obligation or
fiduciary duty or any law or regulation.

  



  

 _Section 5.17_ _Transition; Informational Systems Conversion._ From
and after the date hereof, WFD and CBNK shall use their reasonable best
efforts to facilitate the integration of CBNK with the business of WFD
following consummation of the Transactions, and shall meet on a regular basis
to discuss and plan for the conversion of CBNK's data processing and related
electronic informational systems (the "Informational Systems Conversion") to
those used by WFD and its Subsidiaries, which planning shall include, but
not be limited to: (a) discussion of CBNK's third-party service provider
arrangements; (b) non-renewal of personal property leases and software
licenses used by CBNK in connection with its systems operations; (c) retention
of outside consultants and additional employees to assist with the
conversion; (d) outsourcing, as appropriate, of proprietary or self-
provided system services; and (e) any other actions necessary and appropriate
to facilitate the conversion, as soon as practicable following the Effective
Time. CBNK shall take all action which is necessary and appropriate to
facilitate the Informational Systems Conversion; _provided, however,_ that
WFD shall indemnify CBNK for any reasonable out-of-pocket fees, expenses or
charges that CBNK may incur as a result of taking, at the request of WFD, any
action to facilitate the Informational Systems Conversion. If this Agreement
is terminated by WFD and/or CBNK in accordance with Section 7.01(a), 7.01(b),
7.01(c) or 7.01(f), or by CBNK only in accordance with Section 7.01(d),
7.01(e) or 7.01(g)(ii), WFD shall indemnify CBNK for any reasonable fees,
expenses or charges related to reversing the Informational Systems
Conversion. __

the Effective Time, WFD shall take, and shall cause Westfield Bank to
take, all action necessary to expand the size of the Board of Directors of
WFD and Westfield Bank by five seats and to (i) appoint four members of
CBNK's Board of Directors, selected by WFD after consultation with CBNK, to
WFD's and Westfield Bank's Board of Directors, and (ii) appoint William J.
Wagner to WFD's and Westfield Bank's Board of Directors, with the title of
Vice Chairman, each to serve on WFD's and Westfield Bank's Board of Directors

Article VII

  



  

TERMINATION

  



  

 _Section 7.01_ _Termination. _ This Agreement may be terminated, and
the Transactions may be abandoned:

  



  

(a) _Mutual Consent_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, by
the mutual consent of WFD and CBNK if the Board of Directors of each so
determines by vote of a majority of the members of its entire Board.

  



  

(b) _No Regulatory Approval_. By either WFD or CBNK, if its Board
of Directors so determines by a vote of a majority of the members of its
entire Board, in the event the approval of any Governmental Authority

Authority or an application therefor shall have been permanently withdrawn at
the request of a Governmental Authority.

  



  

(c) _No Shareholder Approval_. By either WFD or CBNK (provided
that the terminating party is not in material breach of any of its obligations
under Section 5.04), if the approval of the shareholders of either party
required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the
required vote at a duly held meeting of such shareholders or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof.

  



  

(d) _Breach of Representations and Warranties_. By either WFD or
CBNK (provided that the terminating party is not then in material breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein)
if there shall have been a material breach of any of the representations or
warranties set forth in this Agreement by the other party, which breach is
not cured within thirty (30) days following written notice to the party
committing such breach, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior
to the Closing; _provided, however, _ that neither party shall have the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(d) unless the
breach of representation or warranty, together with all other such breaches,
would entitle the party receiving such representation or warranty not to
consummate the Merger under Section 6.02(a) (in the case of a breach of a
representation or warranty by CBNK) or Section 6.03(a) (in the case of a
breach of a representation or warranty by WFD).

  



  

(e) _Breach of Covenants_. By either WFD or CBNK (provided that
the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have
been a material breach of any of the covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement on the part of the other party, which breach shall not have
been cured within thirty (30) days following receipt by the breaching party
of written notice of such breach from the other party hereto, or which breach,
by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing, _provided, however_ ,
that neither party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.01(e) unless the breach of covenant or agreement,
together with all other such breaches, would entitle the party receiving the
benefit of such covenant or agreement not to consummate the Merger under
Section 6.02(b) (in the case of a breach of a covenant or agreement by CBNK)
or Section 6.03(b) (in the case of a breach of a representation or

39 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  



  

(f) _Delay_. By either WFD or CBNK if the Merger shall not have
been consummated on or before December 31, 2016 (the "Termination Date"),
unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to a
material breach of this Agreement by the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement.

  



  

(g) _Superior Proposal_. By CBNK if it has received a Superior
Proposal and the CBNK Board of Directors has determined to accept such
Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 5.11.

  



  

(h) _Failure to Recommend; Third-Party Acquisition Transaction;
Etc_.

  



  

(i) By WFD, if (A) CBNK shall have materially breached its
obligations under Section 5.11, (B) the CBNK Board shall have failed to make
its recommendation referred to in Section 5.04(b), withdrawn such
recommendation or modified or changed such recommendation in a manner adverse
in any respect to the interests of WFD, (C) the CBNK Board shall have
recommended, proposed, or publicly announced its intention to recommend or
propose, to engage in an Acquisition Transaction with any Person other than
WFD or a Subsidiary of WFD or (D) CBNK shall have materially breached its
obligations under Section 5.04(b) by failing to call, give notice of, convene
and hold the CBNK Meeting in accordance with Section 5.04(b), and, in each
case, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publically announced or
otherwise communicated to CBNK.

  



  

(ii) By WFD, if any of (A)-(D) of 7.01(h)(i) shall have occurred, but
an Acquisition Proposal shall not have been publically announced or otherwise
communicated to CBNK, in which case WFD shall be entitled to receive, in lieu
of the fee provided under Section 7.02(a), an expense reimbursement fee for
reasonable documented fees up to $750,000 to be paid by CBNK within three (3)
Business Days after written demand for payment is made by WFD, following such
occurrence. In the event that WFD shall later be entitled to receive the
termination fee under Section 7.02, any expense reimbursement fee paid to WFD
under this Section 7.01(h)(ii) shall be subtracted from the amount of the
termination fee to be paid to WFD under Section 7.01.

  



  

(iii) By CBNK, if WFD shall have materially breached its obligations
under Section 5.04(a) by failing to call, give notice of, convene and hold the
WFD Meeting or by failing to make its recommendation or withdrawing,
modifying or changing such recommendation in any manner adverse in
any respect to the interests of CBNK in accordance with Section 5.04(a).

  



  

(i) _Decrease in WFD Stock Price_. By CBNK, if the CBNK Board so
determines by a vote of the majority of the members of the entire CBNK Board,
at any time during the five-day period commencing with the Determination Date
(as defined below), if both of the following conditions are satisfied:

  



  

(A) The quotient obtained by dividing the Average Closing Price by the
Starting Price (as defined below) (the "WFD Ratio") shall be less than 0.80;
and

  



  

(B) (x) the WFD Ratio shall be less than (y) the quotient obtained by
dividing the Final Index Price by the Index Price on the Starting Date (each
as defined below) and subtracting 0.20 from the quotient in this clause
(B)(y) (such number in this clause (B)(y) that results from dividing
the Final Index Price by the Index Price on the Starting Date being referred
to herein as the "Index Ratio");

  



  

subject, however, to the following three sentences. If CBNK elects to
exercise its termination right pursuant to this Section 7.01(i), it shall give
written notice to WFD. During the five-day period commencing with its receipt
of such notice, WFD shall have the option to increase the consideration to
be received by the holders of CBNK Common Stock hereunder, by adjusting the
Exchange Ratio (calculated to the nearest one one-thousandth) to equal the
lesser of (x) a number (rounded to the nearest one one-thousandth) obtained by
dividing (A) the product of the Starting Price, 0.80 and the Exchange Ratio
(as then in effect) by (B) the Average Closing Price and (y) a number (rounded
to the nearest one one-thousandth) obtained by dividing (A) the product of
the Index Ratio and the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) by (B) the WFD
Ratio. If WFD so elects within such five-day period, it shall give prompt
written notice to CBNK of such election and the revised Exchange Ratio,
whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 7.01(i)
and this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms
(except as the Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified.)

");

  



  

WHEREAS, the Shareholder beneficially owns (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under

Agreement or are subsequently acquired prior to the Expiration Date (as

Merger Agreement that the Shareholder execute and deliver this Agreement; and

  



  

WHEREAS, all capitalized terms used in this Agreement without definition
herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals, the mutual
covenants and agreements contained herein, and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Shareholder and Buyer agree as
follows:

  



  

1. _Agreement to Vote Shares_. The Shareholder agrees that, prior to the Expiration Date, at any meeting of the shareholders of the Company, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, or in connection with any written consent of the shareholders of the Company, with respect to the Merger Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated thereby (including the Merger), the Shareholder shall:

counted as present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum; and 
---|---|--- 
    |  | 
    | (b) | vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, in favor
of the consummation of the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement and against any other Acquisition Proposal.

3. _Agreement to Retain Shares_. The Shareholder shall not, except as contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger Agreement, directly or indirectly, (a) sell, assign, transfer, or otherwise dispose of (including, without limitation, by the creation of a Lien (as defined in Section 4(c)), any Shares, (b) enter into any contract, option, commitment or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale, transfer, assignment or other disposition of, any Shares, (c) deposit any Shares in a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or similar agreement with respect to any Shares or grant any proxy or power of attorney with respect thereto, or (d) take any action that would make any representation or warranty of the Shareholder contained herein untrue or incorrect or have the effect of preventing or disabling the Shareholder from performing the Shareholder's obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Shareholder may make (w) transfers of Shares by will or by operation of law, in which case this Agreement shall bind the transferee, (x) transfers of Shares in connection with estate and charitable planning purposes, including transfers to relatives, trusts and charitable organizations, subject to the transferee agreeing in writing to be bound by the terms of, and perform the obligations of the Shareholder under, this Agreement, (y) disposition of Shares to satisfy tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted shares of Common Stock or to facilitate the exercise of CBNK Options, and (z) as Buyer may otherwise agree in writing in its sole discretion.

applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights or by general equity
principles); 
    |  | 
    | (c) | the Shareholder beneficially owns the number of Shares

Shares shall be subject to the foregoing representations and warranties); 
    |  | 
    | (d) | the Shareholder understands that, at the Effective Time, each
outstanding Share listed on _Schedule 1_ (including any restricted shares of

Time) shall be converted into, as provided in and subject to the limitations

2

 



    



      | (e) | the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Shareholder does not, and the performance by the Shareholder of his
obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Shareholder of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not, violate or conflict with, or
constitute a default under, any agreement, instrument, contract or other
obligation or any order, arbitration award, judgment or decree to which the
Shareholder is a party or by which the Shareholder is bound, or any statute,
rule or regulation to which the Shareholder is subject or, in the event that
the Shareholder is a corporation, partnership, trust or other entity, any
bylaw or other organizational document of the Shareholder; and 
---|---|--- 
    |  | 
    | (f) | the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the

does not and will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit
of, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Authority by the
Shareholder except for applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act,
and except where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals,
authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would not
prevent or delay the performance by the Shareholder of his obligations under
this Agreement in any material respect. 
    



  

5. _Irrevocable Proxy_. Subject to the last sentence of this _Section 5_ , by execution of this Agreement, the Shareholder does hereby appoint Buyer with full power of substitution to any Affiliate of Buyer, as the Shareholder's true and lawful attorney and irrevocable proxy, to the full extent of the Shareholder's rights with respect to the Shares, to vote, if the Shareholder is unable to perform his obligations under this Agreement, each of such Shares that the Shareholder shall be entitled to so vote with respect to the matters set forth in Section 1 hereof at any meeting of the shareholders of the Company, and at any adjournment or postponement thereof, and in connection with any action of the shareholders of the Company taken by written consent. The Shareholder intends this proxy to be irrevocable and coupled with an interest hereafter until the Expiration Date and hereby revokes any proxy previously granted by the Shareholder with respect to the Shares. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, this irrevocable proxy shall automatically terminate upon the Expiration Date of this Agreement.

  



  

6. _No Solicitation_.

 _ _

  

(a) During the Employment Period and for a period of six (6) years
thereafter, the Company shall cause the Executive to be covered by and named
as an insured under any policy or contract of insurance obtained by it to
insure its officers against personal liability for acts or omissions in
connection with service as an officer of the Company or service in other

same terms and conditions as the coverage (if any) provided to other officers
of the Company.

the Company shall indemnify the Executive against and hold him harmless from
any costs, damages, losses and exposures arising out of a bona fide action,

officer of the Company to the fullest extent and on the most favorable terms
and conditions that similar indemnification is offered to any officer of the
Company or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof.

  



  

(c) The Executive, the Company and the Bank agree that the
termination benefits described in this Section 6 are intended to be exempt

The Executive may serve as a member of the boards of directors of such
business, community and charitable organizations as he may disclose to and as
may be approved by the Board (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld); _provided, however,_ that such service shall not materially
interfere with the performance of his duties under this Agreement. The
Executive may also engage in personal business and investment activities
which do not materially interfere with the performance of his duties
hereunder; _provided, however, _ that such activities are not prohibited
under any code of conduct or investment or securities trading policy
established by the Company and generally applicable to all similarly situated
executives. The Executive may also serve as an officer or director of the
Bank on such terms and conditions as the Company and the Bank may mutually
agree upon, and such service shall not be deemed to materially interfere with
the Executive's performance of his duties hereunder or otherwise result in a
material breach of this Agreement. If the Executive is discharged or
suspended, or is subject to any regulatory prohibition or restriction
with respect to participation in the affairs of the Bank, he shall continue
to perform services for the Company in accordance with this Agreement but

 _Section 9 _Termination of Employment with Severance Benefits.__

  

 _ _

  

(a) The Executive shall be entitled to the severance benefits
described in section 9(b) in the event that:

  



  

(i) his employment with the Company terminates during the Employment
Period as a result of the Executive's voluntary resignation within
ninety (90) days following:

  



  

(A) the failure of the Board to appoint or re-appoint or elect or re-
elect the Executive to the position with the Company stated in section 3 of
this Agreement;

  



  

(B) if the Executive is a member of the Board, the failure of the
shareholders of the Company to elect or re-elect the Executive to the Board
or the failure of the Board (or the nominating committee thereof) to nominate
the Executive for such election or re-election;

  



  

(C) the expiration of a thirty (30)-day period following the date on
which the Executive gives written notice to the Company of its
material failure, whether by amendment of the Company's Certificate of
Incorporation, the Company's By-Laws, action of the Board or the Company's
shareholders or otherwise, to vest in the Executive the functions, duties, or
responsibilities prescribed in section 3 of this Agreement, unless, during
such thirty (30)-day period, the Company cures such failure;

  



  

(D) the expiration of a thirty (30)-day period following the date on
which the Executive gives written notice to the Company of its
material breach of any term, condition or covenant contained in this
Agreement (including, without limitation any reduction of the
Executive's rate of base salary in effect from time to time and any change in
the terms and conditions of any compensation or benefit program in which the
Executive participates which, either individually or together with other
changes, has a material adverse effect on the aggregate value of his total
compensation package), unless, during such thirty (30)-day period, the Company
cures such failure;

  



  

   

4

 



    



  

(E) a change in the Executive's principal place of employment to a place
that is not the principal executive office of the Bank, or a relocation of
the Bank's principal executive office to a location that is both more than
twenty-five (25) miles away from the Executive's principal residence and more
than twenty-five (25) miles away from the location of the Bank's principal
executive office on the date of this Agreement; or

  



  

(F) any material breach by the Company of any material term, condition or
covenant contained in this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that the Executive
shall have given notice of such materials adverse effect to the Company, and
the Company has not fully cured such failure within thirty (30) days after
such notice is deemed given; or reason other than for "cause" as provided
in section 11(a).

  



  

(b) Upon the occurrence of any of the events described in section
9(a) of this Agreement, the Company shall pay and provide to the Executive
(or, in the event of his death thereafter and prior to payment, to his
estate):

  



  

(i) his earned but unpaid salary (including, without limitation, all
items which constitute wages under applicable law and the payment of which is
not otherwise provided for in this section 9(b)) as of the date of the
termination of his employment with the Company and the Bank, such payment to
be made at the time and in the manner prescribed by law applicable to the
payment of wages but in no event later than thirty (30) days after
termination of employment as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.409A-1(h)(1)(ii);

  



  

(ii) the benefits, if any, to which he is entitled as a former employee
under the employee benefit plans and programs and compensation plans and

The coverage provided under this section 9(b)(iii) may, at the election of the
Company, be secondary to the coverage provided pursuant to section 9(b)(ii)
and to any employer-paid coverage provided by a subsequent employer or
through Medicare, with the result that benefits under the other coverages
will offset the coverage required by this section 9(b)(iii). The Executive,
the Company and the Bank agree that the termination benefits described in this
Section 9(b)(iii) are intended to be exempt from Section 409A pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(1) as non-taxable benefits;

  



  

   

5

 



    



  

(iv) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the estimated present value
of the salary that the Executive would have earned if he had
continued working for the Company and the Bank during the Remaining Unexpired
Employment Period at the highest annual rate of salary achieved during the
period of three (3) years ending immediately prior to the date of termination
(the "Salary Severance Payment"). The Salary Severance Payment shall be
computed using the

  



  

     following formula:  | ![](ex2-1001.jpg)  | 
---|---|--- 
   



  

where "SSP" is the amount of the Salary Severance Payment (before the
deduction of applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes); "BS" is
the highest annual rate of salary achieved by the Executive during the period
of three (3) years ending immediately prior to the date of termination; "PR"
is the number of payroll periods that occur during a year under the
Company's normal payroll practices; "I" equals the applicable federal short
term rate established under section 1274 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
(the "Code") for the month in which the Executive's termination of employment
occurs (the "Short Term AFR") and "n" equals the product of the Remaining
Unexpired Employment Period at the Executive's termination of employment
(expressed in years and fractions of years) multiplied by the number of
payroll periods that occur during a year under the Company's and the Bank's
normal payroll practices. The Salary Severance Payment shall be made in
lieu of any claim to a continuation of base salary which the Executive might
otherwise have and in lieu of cash severance benefits under any severance
benefits program which may be in effect for officers or employees of the Bank
or the Company;

  



  

(v) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the estimated present value
of the annual bonuses that the Executive would have earned if he
had continued working for the Company and the Bank during the Remaining
Unexpired Employment Period at the highest annual rate of salary achieved
during the period of three (3) years ending immediately prior to the date of
termination (the "Bonus Severance Payment"). The Bonus Severance Payment
shall be computed using the following formula:

  



  

BSP = SSP x (ABP / ASP)

  



  

   

6

 



    



  

where "BSP" is the amount of the Bonus Severance Payment (before the
deduction of applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes); "SSP" is
the amount of the Salary Severance Payment (before the deduction of applicable
federal, state and local withholding taxes); "BP" is the aggregate of the
annual bonuses paid or declared (whether or not paid) for the most recent
period of three (3) calendar years to end on or before the Executive's
termination of employment; and "SP" is the aggregate base salary actually
paid to the Executive during such period of three (3) calendar years
(excluding any year for which no bonus was declared or paid). The Bonus
Severance Payment shall be in lieu of any claim to a continuation of
participation in annual bonus plans of the Bank or the Company which the
Executive might otherwise have;

  



  

(vi) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the estimated present value
of the long-term incentive bonuses that the Executive would have earned if he
had continued working for the Company and the Bank during the Remaining
Unexpired Employment Period (the "Incentive Severance Payment"). The
Incentive Severance Payment shall be computed using the following formula:

  



  

ISP = (SSP / RUP) x (ALTIP / ALTSP) x Y

  



  

where "ISP" is the amount of the Incentive Severance Payment (before the
deduction of applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes); "SSP" is
the amount of the Salary Severance Payment (before the deduction of applicable
federal, state and local withholding taxes); "ALTIP" is the aggregate of the
most recently paid or declared (whether or not paid) long-term incentive
compensation payments (but not more than three (3) such payments) for
performance periods that end on or before the Executive's termination of
employment; "ALTSP" is the aggregate base salary actually paid to the
Executive during the performance periods covered by the payments included in
"ALTIP" and excluding base salary paid for any period for which no long-term
incentive compensation payment was declared or paid; "RUP" is the Remaining
Unexpired Employment Period, expressed in years and fractions of years; and
"Y" is the aggregate (expressed in years and fractions of years) of the
Remaining Unexpired Employment Period plus the number of years and fraction
of years that have elapsed since the end of the last performance period for
which a long-term incentive payment has been declared and paid. In the event
that the Executive's employment terminates prior to the payment date under
any long-term incentive compensation plan, then for purposes of computing the
Incentive Severance Payment, the "ALTSP" shall be deemed to be the average of
the target and maximum award level under such plan and the "ALTSP" shall be
deemed to be the Executive's annual base salary as in effect on the
Executive's termination of employment. The Incentive Severance Payment shall
be in lieu of any claim to a continuation of participation in cash long-
term incentive compensation plans of the Bank or the Company which the
Executive might otherwise have;

  



  

   

7

 



    



  

(vii) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (A)
the present value of the aggregate benefits to which he would be
entitled under any and all tax-qualified and non-tax-qualified defined
benefit plans maintained by, or covering employees of, the Company or the
Bank (the "Pension Plans") if he had continued working for the Company and
the. Bank during the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period; over (B) the
present value of the benefits to which the Executive and his spouse and/or
designated beneficiaries are actually entitled under such plans (the "Pension
Severance Payment"). The Pension Severance Payment shall be
computed according to the following formula:

  



  

PSP=PPB - APB

  



  

where "PSP" is the amount of the Pension Severance Payment (before deductions
for applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes); "APB" is the
aggregate lump sum present value of the actual vested pension benefits payable
under the Pension Plans in the form of a straight life annuity beginning at
the earliest date permitted under the Pension Plans, computed on the basis of
the Executive's life expectancy at the earliest date on which payments under
the Pension Plans could begin, determined by reference to Table VI of section
1.72-9 of the Income Tax Regulations (the "Assumed Life Expectancy"), and on
the basis of an interest rate assumption equal to the average bond-equivalent
yield on United States Treasury Securities with a Constant Maturity of thirty
(30) Years for the month prior to the month in which the Executive's
termination of employment occurs (the "30-Year Treasury Rate"); and "PPB" is
the lump sum present value of the pension benefits (whether or not vested)
that would be payable under the Pension Plans in the form of a straight life
annuity beginning at the earliest date permitted under the Pension Plans,
computed on the basis that the Executive's actual age at termination of
employment is his attained age as of his last birthday that would occur
during the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period, that his service for benefit
accrual purposes under the Pension Plans is equal to the aggregate of his
actual service plus the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period, that his
average compensation figure used in determining his accrued benefit is equal
to the highest annual rate of salary achieved by the Executive during the
period of three (3) years ending immediately prior to the date of termination,
that the Executive's life expectancy at the earliest date on which payments
under the Pension Plans could begin is the Assumed Life Expectancy and that
the interest rate assumption used is equal to the 30-Year Treasury Rate. The
Pension Severance Payment shall be in lieu of any claim to any actual
increase in his accrued benefit in the Pension Plans in respect of the
Remaining Unexpired Employment Period; _provided, however,_ that if the
Pension Severance Payment represents the benefits under a non-tax-qualified
benefit plan, the payment shall be paid in the same time and form as provided
under the related non-tax-qualified benefit plan;

  



  

(viii) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the present value of the
additional employer contributions that would have been credited directly to
his account(s) under any and all tax-qualified and non-tax-qualified defined
contribution plans maintained by, or covering employees of, the Bank and the
Company (the "Non-ESOP DC Plans"), plus the fair market value of the
additional shares of employer securities or other property that would have
been allocated to his account as a result of employer contributions or
dividends under any tax-qualified leveraged employee stock ownership plan and
any related non-tax-qualified supplemental plan maintained by, or covering
employees of, the Bank and the Company (the "ESOP Plans") if he had continued
in employment during the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period (the "Defined
Contribution Severance Payment"). The Defined Contribution Severance
Payment shall be computed according to the following formula:

  



  

DCSP = [SSP x (EC / BS)] + [(STK + PROP) x Y]

  



  

   

8

 



    



  

where: "DCSP" is the amount of the Defined Contribution Severance Payment
(before deductions for applicable federal, state and local
withholding taxes); "SSP" is the amount of the Salary Severance Payment
(before deductions for applicable federal, state and local withholding
taxes); "EC" is the amount of employer contributions actually credited to the
Executive's accounts under the Non-ESOP Plans for the last plan year to end
before his termination of employment; "BS" is the Executive's compensation
taken into account in computing EC; "Y" is the aggregate (expressed in years
and fractions of years) of the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period and the
number of years and fractions of years that have elapsed between the end of
plan year for which EC was computed and the date of the Executive's
termination of employment; "STK" is the fair market value (determined on the
basis of the midpoint of the highest and lowest reported sales price for a
share of stock of the same class during the thirty (30)-day period ending on
the day of the Executive's termination of employment (the "Fair Market Value
of a Share")) of the employer securities actually allocated to the Executive's
accounts under the ESOP Plans in respect of employer contributions and
dividends applied to loan amortization payments for the last plan year to end
before his termination of employment; and "PROP" is the fair market value
(determined as of the day before the Executive's termination of employment
using the same valuation methodology used to value the assets of the ESOP
Plans) of the property other than employer securities actually allocated to
the Executive's accounts under the ESOP Plans in respect of employer
contributions and dividends applied to loan amortization payments for the
last plan year to end before his termination of employment. The
Defined Contribution Severance Payment shall be in lieu of any claim to any
actual increase in his accrued benefit in the Non-ESOP DC Plans or the ESOP
DC Plans in respect of the Remaining Unexpired Employment; _provided,
however,_ that if the Defined Contribution Severance Payment represents the
benefits under a non-tax-qualified defined contribution plan, the payment
shall be paid in the same time and form as provided under the related non-
tax-qualified defined contribution plan;

  



  

(ix) at the election of the Company made within thirty (30) days
following the Executive's termination of employment, upon the surrender of
options or appreciation rights issued to the Executive under any stock option
and appreciation rights plan or program maintained by, or covering employees
of, the Company or the Bank, a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the
product of:

  



  

(A) the excess of (I) the Fair Market Value of a Share, over (II) the
exercise price per share for such option or appreciation right, as specified
in or under the relevant plan or program; multiplied by

  



  

   

9

 



    



  

(B) the number of shares with respect to which options or appreciation
rights are being surrendered.

  



  

For the purpose of computing this payment, the Executive shall be deemed
fully vested in all options and appreciation rights under any stock option or
appreciation rights plan or program maintained by, or covering employees of,
the Company or the Bank, even if he is not vested under such plan or program;
and

  



  

(x) at the election of the Company made within thirty (30) days
following the Executive's termination of employment, upon the surrender of
any shares awarded to the Executive under any restricted stock plan
maintained by, or covering employees of, the Company or the Bank, the Company
shall make a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the product of:

  



  

(A) the Fair Market Value of a Share granted under such plan; multiplied by

  



  

(B) the number of shares which are being surrendered.

  



  

For purposes of computing this payment, the Executive shall be deemed fully
vested in all shares awarded under any restricted stock plan maintained by,
or covering employees of, the Company or the Bank, even if he is not vested
under such plan.

  



  

The Company and the Executive hereby stipulate that the damages which may be
incurred by the Executive following any such termination of employment are
not capable of accurate measurement as of the date first above written and
that the payments and benefits contemplated by this section 9(b) constitute
reasonable damages under the circumstances and shall be payable without any
requirement of proof of actual damage and without regard to the Executive's
efforts, if any, to mitigate damages. The Company and the Executive
further agree that the Company may condition the payments and benefits (if
any) due under sections 9(b)(iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii), (viii), (ix), and
(x) on the receipt of the Executive's resignation from any and all positions
which he holds as an officer, director or committee member with respect to
the Company, the Bank or any subsidiary or affiliate of either of them;
provided that such resignation is requested in writing not later than five
(5) business days after termination of employment. The Executive agrees that
the payments and benefits (if any) due under sections 9(b) (iii), (iv), (v),
(vi), (vii) and (viii) shall be paid to Executive upon the sixtieth (60th)
day following the Executive's termination of employment, subject to the
Executive's execution, delivery, and non-revocation of a written release in
substantially the form attached hereto as Appendix A ("Release of Claims"),
within fifty-two (52) days of the Executive's termination of employment and
that no payment shall be made prior to the expiration of the revocation
period.

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

(c) The Executive, the Company and the Bank acknowledge that each of
the payments and benefits promised to the Executive under this Agreement
must either comply with the requirements of Section 409A and the regulations
thereunder or qualify for an exception from compliance. To that end, the
Executive, the Company and the Bank agree that the termination benefits
described in Section 9(b) are intended to be exempt from Section 409A
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) as short-term
deferrals.

  



  

 _Section 10. _Death and Disability Benefits.__

  

 _ _

  

(a) In the event the Executive's employment with the Company
terminates during the Employment Period because of the Executive's death,
then the Company shall pay to the Executive's estate the benefits listed in
sections 9(b)(i) and 9(b)(ii) of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) The Company may terminate the Executive's employment upon a
determination, by vote of a majority of the members of the Boards of
Directors of the Company, acting in reliance on the written advice of a
medical professional acceptable to them, that the Executive is suffering from
a physical or mental impairment which, at the date of the determination, has
prevented the Executive from performing his assigned duties on a
substantially full-time basis for a period of at least ninety (90) days during
the period of one (1) year ending with the date of the determination or is
likely to result in death or prevent the Executive from performing his
assigned duties on a substantially full-time basis for a period of at least
ninety (90) days during the period of one (1) year beginning with the date of
the determination. In such event:

  



  

(i) The Company shall pay and deliver to the Executive (or in the event
of his death before payment, to his estate and surviving dependents and
beneficiaries, as applicable) the benefits described in sections 9(b)(i) and
9(b)(ii).

  



  

(ii) In addition to the benefits described in sections 9(b)(i) and
9(b)(ii), the Company shall continue to pay the Executive his base salary, at
the annual rate in effect for him immediately prior to the termination of his
employment, during a period ending on the earliest of: (A) the expiration of
ninety (90) days after the date of termination of his employment; (B) the date
on which long-term disability insurance benefits are first payable to him
under any long-term disability insurance plan covering employees of the Bank
or the Company (the "LTD Eligibility Date"); (C) the date of his death; and
(D) the expiration of the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period (the "Initial
Continuation Period"). If the end of the Initial Continuation Period is
neither the LTD Eligibility Date nor the date of his death, the Company shall
continue to pay the Executive his base salary, at an annual rate equal to
sixty percent (60%) of the annual rate in effect for his immediately prior to
the termination of his employment, during an additional period ending on the
earliest of the LTD Eligibility Date, the date of his death and
the expiration of the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period.

  



  

A termination of employment due to disability under this section 10 shall be
effected by notice of termination given to the Executive by the Company and
shall take effect on the later of the effective date of termination specified
in such notice or the date on which the notice of termination is deemed given
to the Executive. To that end, the Executive, the Company and the Bank agree
that the disability benefits described in this Section 10 are intended to be
exempt from Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)
as permissible payments.

  



  

   

11

 



    



  

 _Section 11. _Termination without Additional Company Liability.__

  

 _ _

  

In the event that the Executive's employment with the Company shall terminate
during the Employment Period on account of:

  



  

(a) the discharge of the Executive for "cause," which, for purposes
of this Agreement, shall mean a discharge of the Executive due to the
Executive's (i) personal dishonesty, (ii) incompetence, (iii) willful
misconduct, (iii) breach of fiduciary duties involving personal profit, (iv)
intentional failure to perform stated duties, (v) willful violation of any
law, rule or regulation (other than traffic violations or similar offenses)
or final cease-and-desist order or (vi) material breach of any provision
of this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that, if the Executive engages in any
of the acts described in section 11(a)(vi) above, the Company shall provide
the Executive with written notice of its intent to discharge the Executive for
cause, and the Executive shall have forty-five (45) days from the date on
which the Executive receives such notice to cure any such acts; _and
provided, further,_ that on and after the date that a Change of Control
occurs, a determination under this section 11 shall require the affirmative
vote of at least three-fourths of the members of the Board acting in good
faith and such vote shall not be made prior to the expiration of a sixty
(60)-day period following the date on which the Board shall, by written notice
to the Executive, furnish to him a statement of its grounds for proposing to
make such determination, during which period the Executive shall be
afforded a reasonable opportunity to make oral and written presentations to
the members of the Board, and to be represented by his legal counsel at such
presentations, to refute the grounds for the proposed determination; or

  



  

(b) the Executive's voluntary resignation from employment with the
Company (including retirement) for reasons other than those specified in
section 9(a)(i) or Section 12; then the Company shall have no further
obligations under this Agreement, other than the payment to the Executive of
his earned but unpaid salary as of the date of the termination of his
employment and the provision of such other benefits, if any, to which he is
entitled as a former employee under the Company's employee benefit plans and
programs and compensation plans and programs. For purposes of this section
11, no act or failure to act, on the part of the Executive, shall be
considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the
Executive in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the Executive's
action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any act, or
failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly
adopted by the Board or based upon the written advice of counsel for the
Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by
the Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Company. The
cessation of employment of the Executive shall not be deemed to be for "cause"
within the meaning of section 11(a) unless and until there shall have been
delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the
affirmative vote of three-fourths of the members of the Board at a meeting of
the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is
provided to the Executive and the Executive is given an opportunity, together
with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the good faith
opinion of the Board, the Executive is guilty of the conduct described in
section 11(a) above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

 _Section 12. _Termination Upon or Following a Change of Control.__

  

 _ _

  

(a) A Change of Control of the Company ("Change of Control") shall
be deemed to have occurred upon the happening of any of the following events:

  



  

(i) the consummation of a reorganization, merger or consolidation of
the Company, respectively, with one (1) or more other persons, other than a
transaction following which:

  



  

(A) at least 51% of the equity ownership interests of the entity resulting
from such transaction are beneficially owned (within the meaning of Rule
13d-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
"Exchange Act") in substantially the same relative proportions by persons
who, immediately prior to such transaction, beneficially owned (within the
meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) at least 51% of the
outstanding equity ownership interests in the Company; and

  



  

(B) at least 51% of the securities entitled to vote generally in the
election of directors of the entity resulting from such transaction
are beneficially owned (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act) in substantially the same relative proportions by persons
who, immediately prior to such transaction, beneficially owned (within the
meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) at least 51% of the
securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the
Company;

  



  

(ii) the acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company or beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 25% or more of the outstanding
securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors by any person or by any persons acting in concert, or approval by
the stockholders of the Company of any transaction which would result in such
an acquisition;

  



  

(iii) a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company;

  



  

(iv) the occurrence of any event if, immediately following such event, at
least 50% of the members of the Board of the Company do not belong to any of
the following groups

  



  

(A) individuals who were members of the Board of the Company on the date
of this Agreement; or

  



  

(B) individuals who first became members of the Board of the Company after
the date of this Agreement either:

  



  

(I) upon election to serve as a member of the Board of the Company by
affirmative vote of three-quarters of the members of such Board, or of a
nominating committee thereof, in office at the time of such first election; or

  



  

   

13

 



    



  

(II) upon election by the stockholders of the Company to serve as a member
of the Board of the Company, but only if nominated for election by
affirmative vote of three-quarters of the members of the Board of the Company,
or of a nominating committee thereof; in office at the time of such first
nomination;

  



  

 _provided, however, _ that such individual's election or nomination did not
result from an actual or threatened election contest or other actual or
threatened solicitation of proxies or consents other than by or on behalf of
the Board of the Company; or

  



  

(v) any event which would be described in section 12(a)(i), (ii), (iii)
or (iv) if the term "Bank" were substituted for the term "Company" therein.

  



  

In no event, however, shall a Change of Control be deemed to have occurred as
a result of any acquisition of securities or assets of the Company, the
Bank, or a subsidiary of either of them, by the Company, the Bank, or a
subsidiary of either of them, or by any employee benefit plan maintained by
any of them. For purposes of this section 12(a), the term "person" shall have
the meaning assigned to it under sections 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the
Exchange Act.

  



  

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, a "Pending Change of Control"
shall mean: (i) the signing of a definitive agreement for a
transaction which, if consummated, would result in a Change of Control; (ii)
the commencement of a tender offer which, if successful, would result in a
Change of Control; or (iii) the circulation of a proxy statement seeking
proxies in opposition to management in an election contest which, if
successful, would result in a Change of Control.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
the Executive's employment with the Bank and the Company terminates due
to death or disability within one (1) year after the occurrence of a Pending
Change of Control and if a Change of Control occurs within two (2) years
after such termination of employment, he (or in the event of his death, his
estate) shall be entitled to receive the benefits described in section 9(b)
that would have been payable if a Change of Control had occurred on the date
of his termination of employment and he had resigned pursuant to section
9(a)(i) immediately thereafter; _provided,_ that payment shall be
deferred without interest until, and shall be payable immediately upon, the
actual occurrence of a Change of Control.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary: (i)
in the event of the Executive's resignation within sixty (60) days after the
occurrence of a Change of Control, he shall be entitled to receive the
benefits described in section 9(b) that would be payable if his resignation
were pursuant to section 9(a)(i), without regard to the actual circumstances
of his resignation; and (ii) for a period of one (1) year after the
occurrence of a Change of Control, no discharge of the Executive shall be
deemed a discharge with Cause unless the votes contemplated by section 11(a)
of this Agreement are supported by at least two-thirds of the members of the
Board of Directors of the Company at the time the vote is taken who were also
members of the Board of Directors of the Company immediately prior to the
Change of Control.

  



  

   

14

 



    



  

 _Section 13. _Covenant Not To Compete.__

  

 _ _

  

The Executive hereby covenants and agrees that, in the event of his
termination of employment with the Company, for a period of two (2) years
following the date of his termination of employment with the Company, he
shall not, without the written consent of the Company, become an
officer, employee, consultant, director or trustee of any savings bank,
savings and loan association, savings and loan holding company, bank or bank
holding company, credit union, or any direct or indirect subsidiary or
affiliate of any such entity, that entails working within Hampden county or
any other county in which the Company or the Bank maintains an office;
_provided, however,_ that this section 13 and section 15 shall not apply if
the Executive is entitled to the benefits under section 12. In
consideration of his agreement to be bound by this non-competition covenant
and the non-solicitation covenant set forth in section 15, the Company shall
pay the Executive an aggregate amount of $475,000, in equal monthly
installments, less applicable tax withholdings.

  



  

 _Section 14. _Confidentiality. __

  

 _ _

  

Unless he obtains the prior written consent of the Company, the Executive
shall keep confidential and shall refrain from using for the benefit of
himself, or any person or entity other than the Company or any entity which
is a subsidiary of the Company or of which the Company is a subsidiary, any
material document or information obtained from the Company, or from its parent
or subsidiaries, in the course of his employment with any of them concerning
their properties, operations or business (unless such document or information
is readily ascertainable from public or published information or trade
sources or has otherwise been made available to the public through no fault
of his own) until the same ceases to be material (or becomes so ascertainable
or available); _provided, however,_ that nothing in this section 14 shall
prevent the Executive, with or without the Company's consent, from
participating in or disclosing documents or information in connection with
any judicial or administrative investigation, inquiry or proceeding to the
extent that such participation or disclosure is required under applicable
law.

  



  

 _Section 15. _Solicitation. __

  

 _ _

  

The Executive hereby covenants and agrees that, for a period of two (2) years
following his termination of employment with the Company, he shall not,
without the written consent of the Company, either directly or indirectly:

  



  

(a) solicit, offer employment to, or take any other action intended,
or that a reasonable person acting in like circumstances would expect, to have
the effect of causing any officer or employee of the Company, the Bank or any
of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates to terminate his or her
employment and accept employment or become affiliated with, or provide
services for compensation in any capacity whatsoever to, any savings bank,
savings and loan association, bank, bank holding company, savings and loan
holding company, or other institution engaged in the business of accepting
deposits, making loans or doing business within the counties specified in
section 13;

  



  

   

15

 



    



  

(b) provide any information, advice or recommendation with respect to
any such officer or employee of any savings bank, savings and loan company,
bank, bank holding company, savings and loan holding company, or other
institution engaged in the business of accepting deposits, making
loans, providing wealth management services, or doing business within the
counties specified in section 14; that is intended, or that a reasonable
person acting in like circumstances would expect, to have the effect of
causing any officer or employee of the Company, the Bank, or any of their
respective subsidiaries or affiliates to terminate his or her employment and
accept employment or become affiliated with, or provide services for
compensation in any capacity whatsoever to, any savings bank, savings and loan
association, bank, bank holding company, savings and loan holding company, or
other institution engaged in the business of accepting deposits, making loans
or doing business within the county specified in section 13;

  



  

(c) solicit, provide any information, advice or recommendation or
take any other action intended, or that a reasonable person acting in like
circumstances would expect, to have the effect of causing any customer of the
Company, the Bank or any of their respective subsidiaries to terminate an
existing business or commercial relationship with any of them.

  



  

 _Section 16. _No Effect on Employee Benefit Plans or Programs.__

  

 _ _

  

The termination of the Executive's employment during the term of this
Agreement or thereafter, whether by the Company or by the Executive,
shall have no effect on the rights and obligations of the parties hereto
under the Company's qualified or non-qualified retirement, pension, savings,
thrift, profit-sharing or stock bonus plans, group life, health (including
hospitalization, medical and major medical), dental, accident and long term
disability insurance plans or such other employee benefit plans or programs,
or compensation plans or programs, as may be maintained by, or cover
employees of, the Company from time to time; _provided, however,_
that nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to duplicate any compensation
or benefits provided under any agreement, plan or program covering the
Executive to which the Bank is a party and any duplicative amount payable
under any such agreement, plan or program shall be applied as an offset to
reduce the amounts otherwise payable hereunder.

  



  

 _Section 17. _Other Termination.__

  

 _ _

  

Upon the expiration of this Agreement, other than on account of the
Executive's refusing to accept an extension offered by the Company or the
Executive's giving of a notice of non-extension, unless the Company shall
offer to the Executive continued service either: (i) in the same position in
effect immediately prior to the expiration of this Agreement with cash
compensation and pension and welfare benefits no less favorable than those in
effect immediately prior to the expiration of this Agreement; or (ii) in
another position acceptable to the Executive and upon mutually and reasonably
agreeable terms, and termination of employment, the Executive shall be
entitled to receive for a period of twelve (12) months after the expiration
of the Agreement (in this event, the "Severance Period") and continuation of
base salary at the rate then in effect plus medical, dental, life-insurance
and disability coverage; provided, that the Executive's continued
participation is permissible or otherwise practicable under the general terms
and provisions of such plans. To the extent that continued participation is
neither permissible nor practicable, the Company shall take such actions as
may be necessary to provide the Executive with substantially comparable
benefits (without additional cost to the Executive) outside the scope of such
plans. If the Executive engages in regular employment after his termination of
employment (whether as an executive or as a self-employed person), any
employee welfare benefits received by the Executive during the Severance
Period in consideration of such employment which are similar in nature to the
employee welfare benefits provided by the Company will relieve the Company of
their obligations under this section 17 to provide comparable benefits to the
extent of the benefits so received. This section 17 shall have no application
if, prior to the expiration of this Agreement, the Executive's employment has
terminated in a termination to which section 9, 10, 11 or 12 applies or if,
after the expiration of this Agreement, the Executive's employment is
terminated with Cause.

  



  

   

16

 



    



  

The Executive, the Company and the Bank agree that the termination benefits
other than the salary continuation payments described in this Section 17 are
intended to be exempt from Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.409A-1(b)(1) as non-taxable benefits.

  



  

 _Section 18. _Successors and Assigns.__

  

 _ _

  

This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the
Executive, his legal representatives and testate or intestate distributees,
and the Company, and their respective successors and assigns, including any
successor by merger or consolidation or a statutory receiver or any other
person or firm or corporation to which all or substantially all of the assets
and business of the Company may be sold or otherwise transferred. Failure of
the Company to obtain from any successor its express written assumption of the
Company's obligations hereunder at least sixty (60) days in advance of the
scheduled effective date of any such succession shall be deemed a material
breach of this Agreement.

  



  

 _Section 19   _Notices.__

  

 _ _

  

Any communication required or permitted to be given under this Agreement,
including any notice, direction, designation, consent, instruction, objection
or waiver, shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given at such
time as it is delivered personally, or five (5) days after mailing if mailed,
postage prepaid, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested,

 _Section 20. _Indemnification for Attorneys ' Fees. __

  

 _ _

  

(a) The Company shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend the Executive
against reasonable costs, including legal fees and expenses, incurred by him
in connection with or arising out of any action, suit or proceeding in which
he may be involved, as a result of his efforts, in good faith, to defend or
enforce the terms of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, any
settlement agreement which provides for payment of any amounts in settlement
of the Company's or the Bank's obligations hereunder shall be
conclusive evidence of the Executive's entitlement to indemnification
hereunder, and any such indemnification payments shall be in addition to
amounts payable pursuant to such settlement agreement, unless such settlement
agreement expressly provides otherwise. Any such indemnification payments
will occur promptly following a request therefor, and in any event not later
than the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which
the indemnified expense is incurred or in which the Executive's legal right
thereto is finally determined.

  



  

(b) The Company's obligation to make the payments provided for in this
Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be
affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim,
right or action which the Company may have against the Executive or others.
In no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take
any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Executive
under any of the provisions of this Agreement and such amounts shall not be
reduced whether or not the Executive obtains other employment.

  



  

 _Section 21. _Severability_. _ __

  

 _ _

  

A determination that any provision of this Agreement is invalid or
unenforceable shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision hereof.

  



  

 _Section 22. _Waiver_._

  

 _ _

  

Failure to insist upon strict compliance with any of the terms, covenants or
conditions hereof shall not be deemed a waiver of such term, covenant,
or condition. A waiver of any provision of this Agreement must be made in
writing, designated as a waiver, and signed by the party against whom its
enforcement is sought. Any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power
hereunder at any one (1) or more times shall not be deemed a waiver or
relinquishment of such right or power at any other time or times.

 _Section 23. _Counterparts. __

  

 _ _

  

This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, and all of which shall constitute one and the
same Agreement.

  



  

 _Section 24. _Governing Law.__

  

 _ _

  

Except to the extent preempted by federal law, this Agreement shall be
governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts applicable to contracts entered into and to be
performed entirely within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

  



  

 _Section 25. _Headings and Construction.__

reference to a section number shall refer to a section of this Agreement,
unless otherwise stated.

  



  

 _Section 26. _Entire Agreement: Modifications.__

  

 _ _

  

This instrument contains the entire agreement of the parties relating to the
subject matter hereof, and supersedes in its entirety any and all prior
agreements, understandings or representations relating to the subject matter
hereof including the Prior Employment Agreement. No modifications of this
Agreement shall be valid unless made in writing and signed by the parties
hereto. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
construed and administered in such manner as shall be necessary to effect
compliance with Section 409A and shall be subject to amendment in the future,
in such manner as the Company and the Bank may deem necessary or appropriate
to effect such compliance; provided that any such amendment shall preserve
for the Executive the benefit originally afforded pursuant to this Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, Executive hereby agrees that the Closing shall not
be considered a "Change In Control" for purposes of the Prior Employment
Agreement and the occurrence of the Closing shall not entitle Executive to
receive any payments, benefits or rights that would or could have been paid or
provided under the Prior Employment Agreement in connection with a Change In
Control as defined therein nor shall any amounts be due under this Agreement
related to the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, this Agreement shall be subject to consummation of the Merger in
accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, as the same may be amended
by the parties thereto in accordance with its terms. In the event the Merger
Agreement is terminated for any reason or the Merger does not occur, this
Agreement shall be deemed null and void.

  



  

 _Section 27. _Non-duplication. __

  

 _ _

  

The Company hereby agrees to guarantee the payment by the Bank of any
benefits and compensation to which the Executive is, or may be, entitled under
the terms and conditions of the employment agreement of even date herewith
between the Bank and the Executive. In the event that the Executive shall
perform services for the Bank or any other direct or indirect subsidiary or
affiliate of the Company or the Bank, any compensation or benefits provided
to the Executive by such other employer shall be applied to offset the
obligations of the Company hereunder, it being intended that this Agreement
set forth the aggregate compensation and benefits payable to the
Executive for all services to the Company, the Bank and all of their
respective direct or indirect subsidiaries and affiliates.

  



  

   

19

 



    



  

 _Section 28. _Dispute Resolution.__

  

 _ _

  

(a) The Executive acknowledges and agrees that upon any breach by
the Executive of his obligations under sections 13, 14 or 15 hereof, the
Company and Bank will have no adequate remedy at law, and accordingly will be
entitled, in addition to monetary damages, to specific performance and other
appropriate injunctive and equitable relief.

  



  

(b) Excluding only requests for equitable relief by the Company or
Bank under section 28(a) of this Agreement, in the event that there is any
claim or dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach
thereof, and the parties hereto shall not have resolved such claim or dispute
within sixty (60) days after written notice from one (1) party to the other
setting forth the nature of such claim or dispute, then such claim or dispute
shall be settled exclusively by binding arbitration in Boston, Massachusetts
in accordance with the Employment Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association by an arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the
parties hereto or, in the absence of such agreement, by an arbitrator
selected according to such Rules. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if either
the Company and Bank or the Executive shall request, such arbitration shall be
conducted by a panel of three (3) arbitrators, one (1) selected by the
Company and Bank, one (1) selected by the Executive and the third selected by
agreement of the first two (2), or, in the absence of such agreement, in
accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such
arbitrator(s) shall be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof upon
the application of either party.

  



  

 _Section 29.   _Survival_. _

  

 _ _

  

Any provision of this Agreement which, by its terms, contemplates performance
after the expiration of the Employment Period or other termination of this
Agreement shall be deemed to survive the expiration of this Agreement.

  



  

 _Section 30. _Required Regulatory Provisions.__

  

 _ _

  

The following provisions are included for the purposes of complying with
various laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Company:

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, in no
event shall the aggregate amount of compensation payable to the Executive
under section 9(b) hereof exceed the three (3) times the Executive's average
annual compensation (within the meaning of the regulatory guidelines of the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") or any successor thereto)
for the last five (5) consecutive calendar years to end prior to his
termination of employment with the Company (or for his entire period of
employment with the Company if less than five (5) calendar years). The
compensation payable to the Executive hereunder shall be further reduced (but
not below zero) if such reduction would avoid the assessment of excise taxes
on excess parachute payments (within the meaning of section 280G of the
Code).

  



  

   

20

 



    



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, any
payments to the Executive by the Company, whether pursuant to this Agreement
or otherwise, are subject to and conditioned upon their compliance with
section 18(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act ("FDI Act"), 12 U.S.C.
§1828 (k), and any regulations promulgated thereunder.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, if the
Executive is suspended from office and/or temporarily prohibited from
participating in the conduct of the affairs of the Company pursuant to a
notice served under section 8(e)(3) or 8(g)(1) of the FDI Act, 12
U.S.C. §1818(e)(3) or 1818(g)(1), the Company's obligations under this
Agreement shall be suspended as of the date of service of such notice, unless
stayed by appropriate proceedings. If the charges in such notice are
dismissed, the Company, in its discretion, may (i) pay to the Executive all
or part of the compensation withheld while the Company's obligations hereunder
were suspended and (ii) reinstate, in whole or in part, any of the
obligations which were suspended.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, if the
Executive is removed and/or permanently prohibited from participating in
the conduct of the Company's affairs by an order issued under section 8(e)(4)
or 8(g)(I) of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. §1818(e)(4) or (g)(I), all obligations
of the Company under this Agreement shall terminate as of the effective date
of the order, but vested rights of the Company and the Executive shall not be
affected.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, if
the Company is in default (within the meaning of section 3(x)(1) of the FDI
Act, 12 U.S.C. §1813(x)(1), all obligations of the Company under this
Agreement shall terminate as of the date of default, but vested rights and
obligations of the Company and the Executive shall not be affected.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, all
obligations of the Company hereunder shall be terminated, except to the extent
that a continuation of this Agreement is necessary for the continued
operation of the Bank: (i) by the Director of the OCC or his designee or the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), at the time the FDIC enters
into an agreement to provide assistance to or on behalf of the Bank under the
authority contained in section 13(c) of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. §1823(c); (ii)
by the Director of the OCC or his designee at the time such Director or
designee approves a supervisory merger to resolve problems related to the
operation of the Bank or when the Bank is determined by such Director to be in
an unsafe or unsound condition. The vested rights of the parties shall not be
affected by such action.

  



  

If and to the extent that any of the foregoing provisions shall cease to be
required or by applicable law, rule or regulation, the same shall become
inoperative as though eliminated by formal amendment of this Agreement.

  



  

   

21

 



    



  

 _Section 31. _Payments to Key Employees.__

  

 _ _

  

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent
required under Section 409A, no payment to be made to a key employee (within
the meaning of Section 409A) shall be made sooner than six (6) months after
such termination of employment; provided, however, that to the extent such
six (6)-month delay is imposed by Section 409A as a result of a Change of
Control as defined in Section 12(a), the payment shall be paid into a rabbi
trust for the benefit of the Executive as if the six (6)-month delay was not
imposed with such amounts then being distributed to the Executive as soon as
permissible under Section 409A.

  



  

 _Section 32. _Involuntary Termination Payments to Employees (Safe
Harbor).__

  

 _ _

  

In the event a payment is made to an employee upon an involuntary termination
of employment, as deemed pursuant to this Agreement, such payment will not be
subject to Section 409A provided that such payment does not exceed two (2)
times the lesser of (i) the sum of the Executive's annualized compensation
based on the taxable year immediately preceding the year in which termination
of employment occurs or (ii) the maximum amount that may be taken into
account under a qualified plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(17) of the Code for
the year in which the Executive terminates service (the "Safe Harbor
Amount"). However, if such payment exceeds the Safe Harbor Amount, only the
amount in excess of the Safe Harbor Amount will be subject to Section 409A. In
addition, if such Executive is considered a key employee, such payment in
excess of the Safe Harbor Amount will have its timing delayed and will be
subject to the six (6)-month wait-period imposed by Section 409A as provided
in Section 31 of this Agreement. The Executive, the Company and the Bank
agree that the termination benefits described in this Section 32 are intended
to be exempt from Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) as the safe harbor for separation pay due to involuntary
separation from service.

  



  

 _Section 33. _Section 280G Cut-Back_. _

  

 _ _

  

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any payments
or benefits provided for in this Agreement, together with any other
payments which the Executive has the right to receive from the Company, the
Bank, Seller, Chicopee Savings Bank, or any corporation which is a member of
an "affiliated group" (as defined in Code Section 1504(a), without regard to
Code Section 1504(b)) of which Company, the Bank, Seller, or Chicopee Savings
Bank is a member, would constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined
in Code Section 280G(b)(2)), payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be
reduced to the extent necessary to ensure that no portion of such payments
will be subject to the excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999. Any
determination required under this section 33 shall be made by the Company and
its tax advisors, whose determination shall be conclusive and binding upon
the Executive.

  



  

   

22

 



    



  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Agreement to be executed and
the Executive has hereunto set his hand, all as of the day and year first
above written.

 _RELEASE OF CLAIMS_

  



  

I, William J. Wagner, of [City], [County], Massachusetts, (hereinafter, the

himself and his heirs and assigns, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
releases and forever discharges, individually and collectively, WESTFIELD

acting by, through or in concert with them, of and from any and all charges,
claims, complaints, demands, liabilities, causes of action, losses, costs or
expenses of any kind whatsoever (including related attorneys' fees and costs),
known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, that Employee may now have or has
ever had against the Company by reason of any act, omission, transaction, or
event occurring up to and including the date of the signing of this Agreement.

  



  

This waiver, release and discharge includes without limitation, claims

whether express or implied, any promotions or demotions, compensation, the
Company's benefit plan(s) and the management thereof, defamation,
slander, libel, invasion of privacy, misrepresentation, fraud, infliction of
emotional distress, stress, breach of any covenant of good faith and fair
dealing, and any other claims relating to the Employee's employment with the
Company and the termination thereof. This waiver, release and discharge
further applies but is not limited to any claims based on Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Post Civil War Civil Rights Act (41 U.S.C. ss.

Leave Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B (all as they may be amended), and any
other applicable federal, state or local laws, ordinances and
regulations including those relating to discrimination to the extent
permitted by law. Employee expressly waives all claims, including those which
he does not know or suspect to exist in his favor as of the date of this
Agreement against the Company. As used herein, the Employee understand the
word "claims" to include all actions, claims, and grievances, whether actual
or potential, known or unknown, and specifically but not exclusively
including all claims against the Company or otherwise arising from
Employee's employment with the Company, the termination thereof or any other
conduct occurring on or prior to the date the Employee signs this Release of
Claims. All such claims are forever barred by this Release of Claims whether
they arise in contract or tort or under a statute or any other law.

  



  

 _SEVERANCE_. In return for Employee's execution of and adherence to this
Release of Claims, the Company shall pay the Employee the [Salary Severance
Payment, Bonus Severance Payment, Incentive Severance Payment, Pension
Severance Payment and Defined Contribution Severance Payment], as defined in

usual and customary deductions required by law and Company policy.

  



  

   

24

 



    



  

 _CONFIDENTIAL TERMS._ Employee and the Company agree that each will keep the
contents of this Release of Claims (including its existence and the terms
and provisions hereof) and the negotiations leading to it completely
confidential, that neither will hereafter publish or disclose any information
concerning such matters to anyone, and that each shall take every reasonable
precaution to prevent the direct or indirect disclosure of such information
to third parties, provided that the foregoing provisions shall not
be construed to prevent Employee from disclosing such matters to his
accountant or to prevent the Company from disclosing such matters to its
accountants, and provided further that Employee may also make such disclosures
as are finally compelled by law provided Employee gives the Company immediate
notice of such legal process in order that the Company shall have
the opportunity to object to the disclosure of such information.

  



  

 _INJUNCTIVE RELIEF_. Employee acknowledges and recognizes that a violation
of this Release of Claims and its covenants will cause irreparable damage to
the Company and the Company will have no adequate remedy at law for such
violation. Accordingly, Employee agrees that the Company will be entitled, as
a matter of right, to an injunction from any court of competent jurisdiction
restraining any further violation of this Release of Claims or the terms and
conditions provided herein. This right to injunctive relief will be cumulative
and in addition to whatever remedies the parties may otherwise have at law.

  



  

 _CONSIDERATION AND REVOCATION PERIOD_. I acknowledge that I am hereby
advised to consult with an attorney before signing this Release of Claims. I
further understand that I may consider this Release of Claims for up to
twenty-one (21) days before deciding whether to sign it. If I signed this
Release of Claims before the expiration of that twenty-one (21) day period, I
acknowledge that such decision was entirely voluntary. I understand that if I
do not sign and return this Release of Claims to the Company by the end of
that twenty-one (21) day period, the Severance Payment described above will
expire. I understand that for a period of seven (7) days after I execute this
General Release, I have the right to revoke it by a written notice to be
received by the Company by the end of that period. I also understand that
this Release of Claims shall not be effective or enforceable until the
expiration of that seven (7) day period. I further represent and agree that I
have carefully read and fully understand all of the provisions of
this Release of Claims and that I am voluntarily agreeing to those
provisions. I acknowledge that I have not been induced to sign this Release
of Claims by any representatives of any released party other than the
Severance Payment as stated above.

  



  

Employee understands and agrees that Employee has carefully read and fully
understands all of the provisions of this Agreement and knowingly and
voluntarily agrees to all of the terms set forth in this Release of Claims.

 _Section 6. _Indemnification and Insurance.__

  

 _ _

  

(a) During the Employment Period and for a period of six (6) years
thereafter, the Bank shall cause the Executive to be covered by and named as
an insured under any policy or contract of insurance obtained by it to insure
its officers against personal liability for acts or omissions in connection
with service as an officer of the Bank or service in other capacities at the

conditions that similar indemnification is offered to any officer of the Bank
or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof.

 _Section 7. _Outside Activities_. ___

  

 _ _

  

The Executive may serve as a member of the boards of directors of such
business, community and charitable organizations as he may disclose to and as
may be approved by the Board (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld); _provided, however,_ that such service shall not materially
interfere with the performance of his duties under this Agreement. The
Executive may also engage in personal business and investment activities
which do not materially interfere with the performance of his duties
hereunder; _provided, however, _ that such activities are not prohibited
under any code of conduct or investment or securities trading policy
established by the Bank and generally applicable to all similarly situated
executives. The Executive may also serve as an officer or director of the
Company on such terms and conditions as the Company and the Bank may mutually
agree upon, and such service shall not be deemed to materially interfere with
the Executive's performance of his duties hereunder or otherwise result in a
material breach of this Agreement. If the Executive is discharged or
suspended, or is subject to any regulatory prohibition or restriction with
respect to participation in the affairs of the Bank, he shall not directly or

reimbursement policy or procedure of the Bank and in any event not later than

compensation or benefit program in which the Executive participates which,

(F) any material breach by the Bank of any material term, condition
or covenant contained in this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that
the Executive shall have given notice of such materials adverse effect to the
Bank, and the Bank has not fully cured such failure within thirty (30) days
after such notice is deemed given; or

  



  

(ii) the Executive's employment with the Bank is terminated by the
Bank for any reason other than for "cause" as provided in section 11(a).

  



  

(b) Upon the occurrence of any of the events described in section
9(a) of this Agreement, the Bank shall pay and provide to the Executive (or,
in the event of his death thereafter and prior to payment, to his estate):

  



  

(i) his earned but unpaid salary (including, without limitation, all
items which constitute wages under applicable law and the payment of which is
not otherwise provided for in this section 9(b)) as of the date of the
termination of his employment with the Company and the Bank, such payment to
be made at the time and in the manner prescribed by law applicable to the
payment of wages but in no event later than thirty (30) days after
termination of employment as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.409A-1(h)(1)(ii);

  



  

(ii) the benefits, if any, to which he is entitled as a former
employee under the employee benefit plans and programs and compensation plans
and programs maintained for the benefit of the Company's and the Bank's
officers and employees;

  



  

(iii) continued group life, health (including hospitalization, medical
and major medical), dental, accident and long-term disability
insurance benefits on substantially the same terms and conditions (including
any required premium-sharing arrangements, co-payments and deductibles) in
effect for them immediately prior to the Executive's termination for the
Remaining Unexpired Employment Period for the Executive and his dependents.
The coverage provided under this section 9(b)(iii) may, at the election of the
Bank, be secondary to the coverage provided pursuant to section 9(b)(ii) and
to any employer-paid coverage provided by a subsequent employer or
through Medicare, with the result that benefits under the other coverages
will offset the coverage required by this section 9(b)(iii). The Executive,
the Company and the Bank agree that the termination benefits described in this
Section 9(b)(iii) are intended to be exempt from Section 409A pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b) (1) as non-taxable benefits;

(iv) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the estimated present
value of the salary that the Executive would have earned if he had
continued working for the Company and the Bank during the Remaining Unexpired
Employment Period at the highest annual rate of salary achieved during the
period of three (3) years ending immediately prior to the date of termination
(the "Salary Severance Payment"). The Salary Severance Payment shall be
computed using the

  



  

     following formula:  | ![](ex2-1002.jpg) 
---|--- 
   



  

where "SSP" is the amount of the Salary Severance Payment (before the
deduction of applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes); "BS" is
the highest annual rate of salary achieved by the Executive during the period
of three (3) years ending immediately prior to the date of termination; "PR"
is the number of payroll periods that occur during a year under the
Company's normal payroll practices; "I" equals the applicable federal short
term rate established under section 1274 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
(the "Code") for the month in which the Executive's termination of employment
occurs (the "Short Term AFR") and "n" equals the product of the Remaining
Unexpired Employment Period at the Executive's termination of employment
(expressed in years and fractions of years) multiplied by the number of
payroll periods that occur during a year under the Company's and the Bank's
normal payroll practices. The Salary Severance Payment shall be in lieu
of any claim to a continuation of base salary which the Executive might
otherwise have and in lieu of cash severance benefits under any severance
benefits program which may be in effect for officers or employees of the Bank
or the Company;

  



  

(v) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the estimated present
value of the annual bonuses that the Executive would have earned if he
had continued working for the Company and the Bank during the Remaining
Unexpired Employment Period at the highest annual rate of salary achieved
during the period of three (3) years ending immediately prior to the date of
termination (the "Bonus Severance Payment"). The Bonus Severance Payment
shall be computed using the following formula:

  



  

BSP = SSP x (ABP / ASP)

  



  

where "BSP" is the amount of the Bonus Severance Payment (before the
deduction of applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes); "SSP" is
the amount of the Salary Severance Payment (before the deduction of applicable
federal, state and local withholding taxes); "BP" is the aggregate of the
annual bonuses paid or declared (whether or not paid) for the most recent
period of three (3) calendar years to end on or before the Executive's
termination of employment; and "SP" is the aggregate base salary actually
paid to the Executive during such period of three (3) calendar years
(excluding any year for which no bonus was declared or paid). The Bonus
Severance Payment shall be in lieu of any claim to a continuation of
participation in annual bonus plans of the Bank or the Company which the
Executive might otherwise have;

  



  

   

6 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(vi) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the estimated present
value of the long-term incentive bonuses that the Executive would have earned
if he had continued working for the Company and the Bank during the Remaining
Unexpired Employment Period (the "Incentive Severance Payment"). The
Incentive Severance Payment shall be computed using the following formula:

  



  

ISP = (SSP / RUP) x (ALTIP / ALTSP) x Y

  



  

where "ISP" is the amount of the Incentive Severance Payment (before the
deduction of applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes); "SSP" is
the amount of the Salary Severance Payment (before the deduction of applicable
federal, state and local withholding taxes); "ALTIP" is the aggregate of the
most recently paid or declared (whether or not paid) long-term incentive
compensation payments (but not more than three (3) such payments) for
performance periods that end on or before the Executive's termination of
employment; "ALTSP" is the aggregate base salary actually paid to the
Executive during the performance periods covered by the payments included in
"ALTIP" and excluding base salary paid for any period for which no long-term
incentive compensation payment was declared or paid; "RUP" is the Remaining
Unexpired Employment Period, expressed in years and fractions of years; and
"Y" is the aggregate (expressed in years and fractions of years) of the
Remaining Unexpired Employment Period plus the number of years and fraction
of years that have elapsed since the end of the last performance period for
which a long-term incentive payment has been declared and paid. In the event
that the Executive's employment terminates prior to the payment date under
any long-term incentive compensation plan, then for purposes of computing the
Incentive Severance Payment, the "ALTSP" shall be deemed to be the average of
the target and maximum award level under such plan and the "ALTSP" shall be
deemed to be the Executive's annual base salary as in effect on the
Executive's termination of employment. The Incentive Severance Payment shall
be in lieu of any claim to a continuation of participation in cash long-
term incentive compensation plans of the Bank or the Company which the
Executive might otherwise have;

  



  

(vii) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of
(A) the present value of the aggregate benefits to which he would be
entitled under any and all tax-qualified and non-tax-qualified defined
benefit plans maintained by, or covering employees of, the Company or the
Bank (the "Pension Plans") if he had continued working for the Company and the
Bank during the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period; over (B) the present
value of the benefits to which the Executive and his spouse and/or designated
beneficiaries are actually entitled under such plans (the "Pension Severance
Payment"). The Pension Severance Payment shall be computed according to the
following formula:

  



  

   

7 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

PSP=PPB - APB

  



  

where "PSP" is the amount of the Pension Severance Payment (before deductions
for applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes); "APB" is the
aggregate lump sum present value of the actual vested pension benefits payable
under the Pension Plans in the form of a straight life annuity beginning at
the earliest date permitted under the Pension Plans, computed on the basis of
the Executive's life expectancy at the earliest date on which payments under
the Pension Plans could begin, determined by reference to Table VI of section
1.72-9 of the Income Tax Regulations (the "Assumed Life Expectancy"), and on
the basis of an interest rate assumption equal to the average bond-equivalent
yield on United States Treasury Securities with a Constant Maturity of thirty
(30) Years for the month prior to the month in which the Executive's
termination of employment occurs (the "30-Year Treasury Rate"); and "PPB" is
the lump sum present value of the pension benefits (whether or not vested)
that would be payable under the Pension Plans in the form of a straight life
annuity beginning at the earliest date permitted under the Pension Plans,
computed on the basis that the Executive's actual age at termination of
employment is his attained age as of his last birthday that would occur
during the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period, that his service for benefit
accrual purposes under the Pension Plans is equal to the aggregate of his
actual service plus the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period, that his
average compensation figure used in determining his accrued benefit is equal
to the highest annual rate of salary achieved by the Executive during the
period of three (3) years ending immediately prior to the date of termination,
that the Executive's life expectancy at the earliest date on which payments
under the Pension Plans could begin is the Assumed Life Expectancy and that
the interest rate assumption used is equal to the 30-Year Treasury Rate. The
Pension Severance Payment shall be in lieu of any claim to any actual
increase in his accrued benefit in the Pension Plans in respect of the
Remaining Unexpired Employment Period; _provided, however,_ that if the
Pension Severance Payment represents the benefits under a non-tax-qualified
benefit plan, the payment shall be paid in the same time and form as provided
under the related non-tax-qualified benefit plan; and

  



  

(viii) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the present value of the
additional employer contributions that would have been credited directly to
his account(s) under any and all tax-qualified and non-tax-qualified defined
contribution plans maintained by, or covering employees of, the Bank and the
Company (the "Non-ESOP DC Plans"), plus the fair market value of the
additional shares of employer securities or other property that would have
been allocated to his account as a result of employer contributions or
dividends under any tax-qualified leveraged employee stock ownership plan and
any related non-tax-qualified supplemental plan maintained by, or covering
employees of, the Bank and the Company (the "ESOP Plans") if he had continued
in employment during the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period (the "Defined
Contribution Severance Payment"). The Defined Contribution Severance
Payment shall be computed according to the following formula:

  



  

   

8 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

DCSP = [SSP x (EC / BS)] + [(STK + PROP) x Y]

  



  

where: "DCSP" is the amount of the Defined Contribution Severance Payment
(before deductions for applicable federal, state and local
withholding taxes); "SSP" is the amount of the Salary Severance Payment
(before deductions for applicable federal, state and local withholding
taxes); "EC" is the amount of employer contributions actually credited to the
Executive's accounts under the Non-ESOP Plans for the last plan year to end
before his termination of employment; "BS" is the Executive's compensation
taken into account in computing EC; "Y" is the aggregate (expressed in years
and fractions of years) of the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period and the
number of years and fractions of years that have elapsed between the end of
plan year for which EC was computed and the date of the Executive's
termination of employment; "STK" is the fair market value (determined on the
basis of the midpoint of the highest and lowest reported sales price for a
share of stock of the same class during the thirty (30)-day period ending on
the day of the Executive's termination of employment (the "Fair Market Value
of a Share")) of the employer securities actually allocated to the Executive's
accounts under the ESOP Plans in respect of employer contributions and
dividends applied to loan amortization payments for the last plan year to end
before his termination of employment; and "PROP" is the fair market value
(determined as of the day before the Executive's termination of employment
using the same valuation methodology used to value the assets of the ESOP
Plans) of the property other than employer securities actually allocated to
the Executive's accounts under the ESOP Plans in respect of employer
contributions and dividends applied to loan amortization payments for the
last plan year to end before his termination of employment. The
Defined Contribution Severance Payment shall be in lieu of any claim to any
actual increase in his accrued benefit in the Non-ESOP DC Plans or the ESOP
DC Plans in respect of the Remaining Unexpired Employment; _provided,
however,_ that if the Defined Contribution Severance Payment represents the
benefits under a non-tax-qualified defined contribution plan, the payment
shall be paid in the same time and form as provided under the related non-
tax-qualified defined contribution plan.

  



  

The Bank and the Executive hereby stipulate that the damages which may be
incurred by the Executive following any such termination of employment are
not capable of accurate measurement as of the date first above written and
that the payments and benefits contemplated by this section 9(b) constitute
reasonable damages under the circumstances and shall be payable without any
requirement of proof of actual damage and without regard to the Executive's
efforts, if any, to mitigate damages. The Bank and the Executive further
agree that the Bank may condition the payments and benefits (if any) due
under sections 9(b)(iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii) and (viii) on the receipt of
the Executive's resignation from any and all positions which he holds as an
officer, director or committee member with respect to the Company, the Bank
or any subsidiary or affiliate of either of them; provided that such
resignation is requested in writing not later than five (5) business days
after termination of employment. The Executive agrees that the payments and
benefits (if any) due under sections 9(b)(iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii) and
(viii) shall be paid to Executive upon the sixtieth (60th) day following the
Executive's termination of employment, subject to the Executive's execution,
delivery, and non-revocation of a written release in substantially the form
attached hereto as Appendix A ("Release of Claims"), within fifty-two (52)
days of the Executive's termination of employment and that no payment shall be
made prior to the expiration of the revocation period.

(c) The Executive, the Company and the Bank acknowledge that each of
the payments and benefits promised to the Executive under this Agreement
must either comply with the requirements of Section 409A and the regulations
thereunder or qualify for an exception from compliance. To that end, the
Executive, the Company and the Bank agree that the termination benefits
described in Section 9(b) are intended to be exempt from Section 409A
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) as short-term
deferrals.

  



  

 _Section 10.   _Death and Disability Benefits.__

  

 _ _

  

(a) In the event the Executive's employment with the Bank terminates
during the Employment Period because of the Executive's death, then the Bank
shall pay to the Executive's estate the benefits listed in sections 9(b)(i)
and 9(b)(ii) of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) The Bank may terminate the Executive's employment upon a
determination, by vote of a majority of the members of the Board, acting in
reliance on the written advice of a medical professional acceptable to them,
that the Executive is suffering from a physical or mental impairment which,
at the date of the determination, has prevented the Executive from performing
his assigned duties on a substantially full-time basis for a period of at
least ninety (90) days during the period of one (1) year ending with the date
of the determination or is likely to result in death or prevent the Executive
from performing his assigned duties on a substantially full-time basis for a
period of at least ninety (90) days during the period of one (1) year
beginning with the date of the determination. In such event:

  



  

(i) The Bank shall pay and deliver to the Executive (or in the event
of his death before payment, to his estate and surviving dependents
and beneficiaries, as applicable) the benefits described in sections 9(b)(i)
and 9(b)(ii).

  



  

(ii) In addition to the benefits described in sections 9(b)(i) and
9(b)(ii), the Bank shall continue to pay the Executive his base salary, at
the annual rate in effect for his immediately prior to the termination of his
employment, during a period ending on the earliest of: (A) the expiration of
ninety (90) days after the date of termination of his employment; (B) the date
on which long-term disability insurance benefits are first payable to his
under any long-term disability insurance plan covering employees of the Bank
or the Company (the "LTD Eligibility Date"); (C) the date of his death; and
(D) the expiration of the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period (the "Initial
Continuation Period"). If the end of the Initial Continuation Period is
neither the LTD Eligibility Date nor the date of his death, the Bank shall
continue to pay the Executive his base salary, at an annual rate equal to
sixty percent (60%) of the annual rate in effect for his immediately prior to
the termination of his employment, during an additional period ending on the
earliest of the LTD Eligibility Date, the date of his death and the expiration
of the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period.

  



  

   

10

--- 

    



  

A termination of employment due to disability under this section 10 shall be
effected by notice of termination given to the Executive by the Bank and
shall take effect on the later of the effective date of termination specified
in such notice or the date on which the notice of termination is deemed given
to the Executive. To that end, the Executive, the Company and the Bank agree
that the disability benefits described in this Section 10 are intended to be
exempt from Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)
as permissible payments.

  



  

 _Section 11. _Termination without Additional Company Liability.__

  

 _ _

  

In the event that the Executive's employment with the Bank shall terminate
during the Employment Period on account of:

  



  

(a) the discharge of the Executive for "cause," which, for purposes
of this Agreement, shall mean a discharge of the Executive due to
the Executive's (i) personal dishonesty, (ii) incompetence, (iii) willful
misconduct, (iii) breach of fiduciary duties involving personal profit, (iv)
intentional failure to perform stated duties, (v) willful violation of any
law, rule or regulation (other than traffic violations or similar offenses)
or final cease-and-desist order or (vi) material breach of any provision of
this Agreement;  _provided, however,_ that, if the Executive engages in any
of the acts described in section 11(a)(vi) above, the Bank shall provide the
Executive with written notice of its intent to discharge the Executive for
cause, and the Executive shall have thirty (30) days from the date on which
the Executive receives such notice to cure any such acts; _and provided,
further,_ that on and after the date that a Change of Control occurs, a
determination under this section 11 shall require the affirmative vote of at
least three-fourths of the members of the Board acting in good faith and such
vote shall not be made prior to the expiration of a sixty (60)-day period
following the date on which the Board shall, by written notice to the
Executive, furnish to him a statement of its grounds for proposing to make
such determination, during which period the Executive shall be afforded a
reasonable opportunity to make oral and written presentations to the members
of the Board, and to be represented by his legal counsel at such
presentations, to refute the grounds for the proposed determination; or

  



  

(b) the Executive's voluntary resignation from employment with the
Bank (including retirement) for reasons other than those specified in section
9(a)(i) or Section 12; then the Bank shall have no further obligations under
this Agreement, other than the payment to the Executive of his earned but
unpaid salary as of the date of the termination of his employment and the
provision of such other benefits, if any, to which he is entitled as a former
employee under the Bank's employee benefit plans and programs and compensation
plans and programs. For purposes of this section 11, no act or failure to
act, on the part of the Executive, shall be considered "willful" unless it is
done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in bad faith or without
reasonable belief that the Executive's action or omission was in the best
interests of the Bank. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given
pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or based upon the written
advice of counsel for the Bank shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or
omitted to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best interests
of the Bank. The cessation of employment of the Executive shall not be deemed
to be for "cause" within the meaning of section 11(a) unless and until there
shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly
adopted by the affirmative vote of three-fourths of the members of the Board
at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable
notice is provided to the Executive and the Executive is given an
opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding
that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive is guilty of the
conduct described in section 11(a) above, and specifying the particulars
thereof in detail.

 _Section 12. _Termination Upon or Following a Change of Control.__

  

 _ _

  

(a) A Change of Control of the Company ("Change of Control") shall
be deemed to have occurred upon the happening of any of the following events:

  



  

(i) the consummation of a reorganization, merger or consolidation of
the Company, respectively, with one (1) or more other persons, other than a
transaction following which:

  



  

(A) at least 51% of the equity ownership interests of the entity
resulting from such transaction are beneficially owned (within the meaning of
Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
"Exchange Act") in substantially the same relative proportions by persons
who, immediately prior to such transaction, beneficially owned (within the
meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) at least 51% of the
outstanding equity ownership interests in the Company; and

  



  

(B) at least 51% of the securities entitled to vote generally in the
election of directors of the entity resulting from such transaction
are beneficially owned (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act) in substantially the same relative proportions by persons
who, immediately prior to such transaction, beneficially owned (within the
meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) at least 51% of the
securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the
Company;

  



  

(ii) the acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company or beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 25% or more of the outstanding
securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors by any person or by any persons acting in concert, or approval by
the stockholders of the Company of any transaction which would result in such
an acquisition;

  



  

(iii) a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company;

  



  

(iv) the occurrence of any event if, immediately following such event,
at least 50% of the members of the Board of the Company do not belong to
any of the following groups:

  



  

(A) individuals who were members of the Board of the Company on the
date of this Agreement; or

  



  

   

12 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(B) individuals who first became members of the Board of the Company
after the date of this Agreement either:

  



  

(I) upon election to serve as a member of the Board of the Company by
affirmative vote of three-quarters of the members of such Board, or of a
nominating committee thereof, in office at the time of such first election;
or

  



  

(II) upon election by the stockholders of the Company to serve as a
member of the Board of the Company, but only if nominated for election by
affirmative vote of three-quarters of the members of the Board of the
Company, or of a nominating committee thereof; in office at the time of such
first nomination;

  



  

 _provided, however, _ that such individual's election or nomination did not
result from an actual or threatened election contest or other actual or
threatened solicitation of proxies or consents other than by or on behalf of
the Board of the Company; or

  



  

(v) any event which would be described in section 12(a)(i), (ii),
(iii) or (iv) if the term "Bank" were substituted for the term "Company"
therein.

  



  

In no event, however, shall a Change of Control be deemed to have occurred as
a result of any acquisition of securities or assets of the Company, the
Bank, or a subsidiary of either of them, by the Company, the Bank, or a
subsidiary of either of them, or by any employee benefit plan maintained by
any of them. For purposes of this section 12(a), the term "person" shall have
the meaning assigned to it under sections 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the
Exchange Act.

  



  

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, a "Pending Change of Control"
shall mean: (i) the signing of a definitive agreement for a
transaction which, if consummated, would result in a Change of Control; (ii)
the commencement of a tender offer which, if successful, would result in a
Change of Control; or (iii) the circulation of a proxy statement seeking
proxies in opposition to management in an election contest which, if
successful, would result in a Change of Control.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
the Executive's employment with the Bank and the Company terminates due
to death or disability within one (1) year after the occurrence of a Pending
Change of Control and if a Change of Control occurs within two (2) years
after such termination of employment, he (or in the event of his death, his
estate) shall be entitled to receive the benefits described in section 9(b)
that would have been payable if a Change of Control had occurred on the date
of his termination of employment and he had resigned pursuant to section
9(a)(i) immediately thereafter; _provided,_ that payment shall be
deferred without interest until, and shall be payable immediately upon, the
actual occurrence of a Change of Control.

  



  

   

13 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary: (i)
in the event of the Executive's resignation within sixty (60) days after the
occurrence of a Change of Control, he shall be entitled to receive the
benefits described in section 9(b) that would be payable if his resignation
were pursuant to section 9(a)(i), without regard to the actual circumstances
of his resignation; and (ii) for a period of one (1) year after the
occurrence of a Change of Control, no discharge of the Executive shall be
deemed a discharge with Cause unless the votes contemplated by section 11(a)
of this Agreement are supported by at least two-thirds of the members of the
Board of Directors of the Company at the time the vote is taken who were also
members of the Board of Directors of the Company immediately prior to the
Change of Control.

  



  

 _Section 13. _Covenant Not To Compete.__

  

 _ _

  

The Executive hereby covenants and agrees that, in the event of his
termination of employment with the Bank, for a period of two (2) years
following the date of his termination of employment with the Bank, he shall
not, without the written consent of the Bank, become an officer,
employee, consultant, director or trustee of any savings bank, savings and
loan association, savings and loan holding company, bank or bank holding
company, credit union, or any direct or indirect subsidiary or affiliate of
any such entity, that entails working within Hampden county or any other
county in which the Company or the Bank maintains an office; _provided,
however,_ that this section 13 and section 15 shall not apply if the
Executive is entitled to benefits under section 12. In consideration of his
agreement to be bound by this non-competition covenant and the non-
solicitation covenant set forth in section 15, the Company shall pay
the Executive an aggregate amount of $475,000, in equal monthly installments,
less applicable tax withholdings.

  



  

 _Section 14. _Confidentiality. __

  

 _ _

  

Unless he obtains the prior written consent of the Bank, the Executive shall
keep confidential and shall refrain from using for the benefit of himself,
or any person or entity other than the Company or any entity which is a
subsidiary of the Company or of which the Company is a subsidiary, any
material document or information obtained from the Company, or from its parent
or subsidiaries, in the course of his employment with any of them concerning
their properties, operations or business (unless such document or information
is readily ascertainable from public or published information or trade
sources or has otherwise been made available to the public through no fault of
his own) until the same ceases to be material (or becomes so ascertainable or
available); _provided, however,_ that nothing in this section 14 shall
prevent the Executive, with or without the Bank's consent, from participating
in or disclosing documents or information in connection with any judicial or
administrative investigation, inquiry or proceeding to the extent that such
participation or disclosure is required under applicable law.

  



  

 _Section 15. _Solicitation. __

  

 _ _

  

The Executive hereby covenants and agrees that, for a period of two (2) years
following his termination of employment with the Bank, he shall not, without
the written consent of the Bank, either directly or indirectly:

  



  

   

14 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(a) solicit, offer employment to, or take any other action intended,
or that a reasonable person acting in like circumstances would expect, to have
the effect of causing any officer or employee of the Company, the Bank or any
of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates to terminate his or her
employment and accept employment or become affiliated with, or provide
services for compensation in any capacity whatsoever to, any savings bank,
savings and loan association, bank, bank holding company, savings and loan
holding company, or other institution engaged in the business of accepting

any such officer or employee of any savings bank, savings and loan company,
bank, bank holding company, savings and loan holding company, or other
institution engaged in the business of accepting deposits, making
loans, providing wealth management services, or doing business within the
counties specified in section 14; that is intended, or that a reasonable
person acting in like circumstances would expect, to have the effect of
causing any officer or employee of the Company, the Bank, or any of their
respective subsidiaries or affiliates to terminate his or her employment and
accept employment or become affiliated with, or provide services for
compensation in any capacity whatsoever to, any savings bank, savings and loan
association, bank, bank holding company, savings and loan holding company, or

take any other action intended, or that a reasonable person acting in like
circumstances would expect, to have the effect of causing any customer of the
Company, the Bank or any of their respective subsidiaries to terminate an
existing business or commercial relationship with any of them.

  



  

 _Section 16. _No Effect on Employee Benefit Plans or Programs.__

  

 _ _

  

The termination of the Executive's employment during the term of this
Agreement or thereafter, whether by the Bank or by the Executive, shall
have no effect on the rights and obligations of the parties hereto under the
Bank's qualified or non-qualified retirement, pension, savings, thrift,
profit-sharing or stock bonus plans, group life, health (including
hospitalization, medical and major medical), dental, accident and long term
disability insurance plans or such other employee benefit plans or programs,
or compensation plans or programs, as may be maintained by, or cover
employees of, the Bank from time to time; _provided, however,_ that
nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to duplicate any compensation or
benefits provided under any agreement, plan or program covering the Executive
to which the Bank is a party and any duplicative amount payable under any such
agreement, plan or program shall be applied as an offset to reduce the
amounts otherwise payable hereunder.

  



  

 _Section 17. _Successors and Assigns.__

  

 _ _

  

This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the
Executive, his legal representatives and testate or intestate distributees,
and the Bank, and their respective successors and assigns, including any
successor by merger or consolidation or a statutory receiver or any other
person or firm or corporation to which all or substantially all of the assets
and business of the Bank may be sold or otherwise transferred. Failure of the
Bank to obtain from any successor its express written assumption of the Bank's
obligations hereunder at least sixty (60) days in advance of the scheduled
effective date of any such succession shall be deemed a material breach
of this Agreement.

 _Section 19. _Indemnification for Attorneys ' Fees. __

  

 _ _

  

The Bank shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend the Executive against
reasonable costs, including legal fees and expenses, incurred by him in
connection with or arising out of any action, suit or proceeding in which he
may be involved, as a result of his efforts, in good faith, to defend or
enforce the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that the Executive
shall have substantially prevailed on the merits pursuant to a judgment,
decree or order of a court of competent jurisdiction or of an arbitrator in an
arbitration proceeding. The determination whether the Executive shall have
substantially prevailed on the merits and is therefore entitled to such
indemnification, shall be made by the court or arbitrator, as applicable. In
the event of a settlement pursuant to a settlement agreement, any
indemnification payment under this section 19 shall be made only after a
determination by the members of the Board (other than the Executive and any
other member of the Board to which the Executive is related by blood or
marriage) that the Executive has acted in good faith and that such
indemnification is in the best interests of the Bank. For purposes of this
Agreement, any such indemnification payments will occur promptly following a
request therefor, and in any event not later than the last day of the calendar
year following the calendar year in which the indemnified expense is incurred
or in which the Executive's legal right thereto is finally determined.

 _Section 20. _Severability_. _ __

  

 _ _

  

A determination that any provision of this Agreement is invalid or
unenforceable shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision hereof.

  



  

 _Section 21. _Waiver_._

  

 _ _

  

Failure to insist upon strict compliance with any of the terms, covenants or
conditions hereof shall not be deemed a waiver of such term, covenant,
or condition. A waiver of any provision of this Agreement must be made in
writing, designated as a waiver, and signed by the party against whom its
enforcement is sought. Any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power
hereunder at any one (1) or more times shall not be deemed a waiver or
relinquishment of such right or power at any other time or times.

  



  

 _Section 22. _Counterparts. __

  

 _ _

  

This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, and all of which shall constitute one and the
same Agreement.

  



  

 _Section 23. _Governing Law.__

  

 _ _

  

Except to the extent preempted by federal law, this Agreement shall be
governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts applicable to contracts entered into and to be
performed entirely within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

  



  

 _Section 24. _Headings and Construction.__

unless otherwise stated.

  



  

 _Section 25. _Entire Agreement: Modifications.__

  

 _ _

  

This instrument contains the entire agreement of the parties relating to the
subject matter hereof, and supersedes in its entirety any and all prior
agreements, understandings or representations relating to the subject matter
hereof including the Prior Employment Agreement. No modifications of this
Agreement shall be valid unless made in writing and signed by the parties
hereto. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
construed and administered in such manner as shall be necessary to effect
compliance with Section 409A and shall be subject to amendment in the future,
in such manner as the Company and the Bank may deem necessary or appropriate
to effect such compliance; provided that any such amendment shall preserve
for the Executive the benefit originally afforded pursuant to this Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, Executive hereby agrees that the Closing shall not
be considered a "Change In Control" for purposes of the Prior Employment
Agreement and the occurrence of the Closing shall not entitle Executive to
receive any payments, benefits or rights that would or could have been paid or
provided under the Prior Employment Agreement in connection with a Change In
Control as defined therein nor shall any amounts be due under this Agreement
related to the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, this Agreement shall be subject to consummation of the Merger in
accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, as the same may be amended
by the parties thereto in accordance with its terms. In the event the Merger
Agreement is terminated for any reason or the Merger does not occur, this
Agreement shall be deemed null and void.

 _Section 26. _Non-duplication. __

  

 _ _

  

In the event that the Executive shall perform services for the Company or any
other direct or indirect subsidiary or affiliate of the Company or the Bank,
any compensation or benefits provided to the Executive by such other employer
shall be applied to offset the obligations of the Bank hereunder, it being
intended that this Agreement set forth the aggregate compensation and benefits
payable to the Executive for all services to the Company, the Bank and all of
their respective direct or indirect subsidiaries and affiliates.

  



  

 _Section 27. _Dispute Resolution.__

  

 _ _

  

(a) The Executive acknowledges and agrees that upon any breach by
the Executive of his obligations under sections 13, 14 or 15 hereof, the
Company and Bank will have no adequate remedy at law, and accordingly will be
entitled, in addition to monetary damages, to specific performance and other
appropriate injunctive and equitable relief.

  



  

(b) Excluding only requests for equitable relief by the Company or
Bank under section 28(a) of this Agreement, in the event that there is any
claim or dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach
thereof, and the parties hereto shall not have resolved such claim or dispute
within sixty (60) days after written notice from one (1) party to the other
setting forth the nature of such claim or dispute, then such claim or dispute
shall be settled exclusively by binding arbitration in Boston, Massachusetts
in accordance with the Employment Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association by an arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the
parties hereto or, in the absence of such agreement, by an arbitrator
selected according to such Rules. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if either
the Company and Bank or the Executive shall request, such arbitration shall be
conducted by a panel of three (3) arbitrators, one (1) selected by the
Company and Bank, one (1) selected by the Executive and the third selected by
agreement of the first two (2), or, in the absence of such agreement, in
accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such
arbitrator(s) shall be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof upon
the application of either party.

  



  

 _Section 28.   _Survival_. _

  

 _ _

  

Any provision of this Agreement which, by its terms, contemplates performance
after the expiration of the Employment Period or other termination of this
Agreement shall be deemed to survive the expiration of this Agreement.

 _Section 29. _Required Regulatory Provisions.__

  

 _ _

  

The following provisions are included for the purposes of complying with
various laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Bank:

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, in no
event shall the aggregate amount of compensation payable to the Executive
under section 9(b) hereof exceed the three (3) times the Executive's average
annual compensation (within the meaning of the regulatory guidelines of the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") or any successor thereto)
for the last five (5) consecutive calendar years to end prior to his
termination of employment with the Bank (or for his entire period of
employment with the Bank if less than five (5) calendar years). The
compensation payable to the Executive hereunder shall be further reduced (but
not below zero) if such reduction would avoid the assessment of excise taxes
on excess parachute payments (within the meaning of section 280G of the
Code).

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, any
payments to the Executive by the Bank, whether pursuant to this Agreement or
otherwise, are subject to and conditioned upon their compliance with section
18(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act ("FDI Act"), 12 U.S.C. §1828 (k),
and any regulations promulgated thereunder.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, if the
Executive is suspended from office and/or temporarily prohibited from
participating in the conduct of the affairs of the Bank pursuant to a notice
served under section 8(e)(3) or 8(g)(1) of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. §1818(e)(3)
or 1818(g)(1), the Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall be suspended
as of the date of service of such notice, unless stayed by appropriate
proceedings. If the charges in such notice are dismissed, the Bank, in its
discretion, may (i) pay to the Executive all or part of the compensation
withheld while the Bank's obligations hereunder were suspended and (ii)
reinstate, in whole or in part, any of the obligations which were suspended.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, if the
Executive is removed and/or permanently prohibited from participating in
the conduct of the Bank 's affairs by an order issued under section 8(e)(4)
or 8(g)(I) of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. §1818(e)(4) or (g)(I), all obligations
of the Bank under this Agreement shall terminate as of the effective date of
the order, but vested rights of the Bank and the Executive shall not be
affected.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, if
the Bank is in default (within the meaning of section 3(x)(1) of the FDI Act,
12 U.S.C. §1813(x)(1), all obligations of the Bank under this Agreement shall
terminate as of the date of default, but vested rights and obligations of the
Bank and the Executive shall not be affected.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, all
obligations of the Bank hereunder shall be terminated, except to the extent
that a continuation of this Agreement is necessary for the continued
operation of the Bank: (i) by the Director of the OCC or his designee or the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), at the time the FDIC enters
into an agreement to provide assistance to or on behalf of the Bank under the
authority contained in section 13(c) of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. §1823(c); (ii)
by the Director of the OCC or his designee at the time such Director or
designee approves a supervisory merger to resolve problems related to the
operation of the Bank or when the Bank is determined by such Director to be in
an unsafe or unsound condition. The vested rights of the parties shall not be
affected by such action.

  



  

   

19 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

If and to the extent that any of the foregoing provisions shall cease to be
required or by applicable law, rule or regulation, the same shall become
inoperative as though eliminated by formal amendment of this Agreement.

  



  

 _Section 30. _Payments to Key Employees.__

  

 _ _

  

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent
required under Section 409A, no payment to be made to a key employee (within
the meaning of Section 409A) shall be made sooner than six (6) months after
such termination of employment; provided, however, that to the extent such
six (6)-month delay is imposed by Section 409A as a result of a Change of
Control as defined in Section 12(a), the payment shall be paid into a rabbi
trust for the benefit of the Executive as if the six (6)-month delay was not
imposed with such amounts then being distributed to the Executive as soon as
permissible under Section 409A.

  



  

 _Section 31. _Involuntary Termination Payments to Employees (Safe
Harbor).__

  

 _ _

  

In the event a payment is made to an employee upon an involuntary termination
of employment, as deemed pursuant to this Agreement, such payment will not be
subject to Section 409A provided that such payment does not exceed two (2)
times the lesser of (i) the sum of the Executive's annualized compensation
based on the taxable year immediately preceding the year in which termination
of employment occurs or (ii) the maximum amount that may be taken into
account under a qualified plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(17) of the Code for
the year in which the Executive terminates service (the "Safe Harbor
Amount"). However, if such payment exceeds the Safe Harbor Amount, only the
amount in excess of the Safe Harbor Amount will be subject to Section 409A. In
addition, if such Executive is considered a key employee, such payment in
excess of the Safe Harbor Amount will have its timing delayed and will be
subject to the six (6)-month wait-period imposed by Section 409A as provided
in Section 30 of this Agreement. The Executive, the Company and the Bank
agree that the termination benefits described in this Section 31 are intended
to be exempt from Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) as the safe harbor for separation pay due to involuntary
separation from service.

  



  

 _Section 32. _Section 280G Cut-Back_. _

  

 _ _

  

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any payments
or benefits provided for in this Agreement, together with any other
payments which the Executive has the right to receive from the Company, the
Bank, Seller, Chicopee Savings Bank, or any corporation which is a member of
an "affiliated group" (as defined in Code Section 1504(a), without regard to
Code Section 1504(b)) of which Company, the Bank, Seller, or Chicopee Savings
Bank is a member, would constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined
in Code Section 280G(b)(2)), payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be
reduced to the extent necessary to ensure that no portion of such payments
will be subject to the excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999. Any
determination required under this section 32 shall be made by the Bank and
its tax advisors, whose determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the
Executive.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Bank has caused this Agreement to be executed and the
Executive has hereunto set his hand, all as of the day and year first above
written.

 APPENDIX A

  



  

 _RELEASE OF CLAIMS_

  



  

I, William J. Wagner, of [City], [County], Massachusetts, (hereinafter, the
"Employee"), in consideration of the severance described below, on behalf of
himself and his heirs and assigns, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
releases and forever discharges, individually and collectively, WESTFIELD
BANK, a federally chartered savings bank, with a place of business at 141 Elm
Street, Westfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts (hereinafter, the "Bank"),
its affiliated companies, and each of their respective officers, directors,
employees, shareholders, representatives, parent companies, subsidiaries,
predecessors, successors, assigns, attorneys and all persons acting by,
through or in concert with them, of and from any and all charges, claims,
complaints, demands, liabilities, causes of action, losses, costs or expenses
of any kind whatsoever (including related attorneys' fees and costs), known or
unknown, suspected or unsuspected, that Employee may now have or has ever had
against the Bank by reason of any act, omission, transaction, or event
occurring up to and including the date of the signing of this Agreement.

  



  

This waiver, release and discharge includes without limitation, claims
related to any wrongful or unlawful discharge, discipline or retaliation,
whether express or implied, any promotions or demotions, compensation, the
Bank's benefit plan(s) and the management thereof, defamation, slander,
libel, invasion of privacy, misrepresentation, fraud, infliction of emotional
distress, stress, breach of any covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and
any other claims relating to the Employee's employment with the Bank and the
termination thereof. This waiver, release and discharge further applies but
is not limited to any claims based on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, the Post Civil War Civil Rights Act (41 U.S.C. ss. 1981 - 88), the
Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Equal Pay Act, the Age
Discrimination Employment Act, the Older Workers' Benefit Protection Act, the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973,the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Vietnam
Era Veterans' Readjustment Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Workers
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, Executive Order 11246, the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the Family and Medical Leave
Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B (all as they may be amended), and any other
applicable federal, state or local laws, ordinances and regulations
including those relating to discrimination to the extent permitted by law.
Employee expressly waives all claims, including those which he does not know
or suspect to exist in his favor as of the date of this Agreement against the
Bank. As used herein, the Employee understand the word "claims" to include
all actions, claims, and grievances, whether actual or potential, known
or unknown, and specifically but not exclusively including all claims against
the Bank or otherwise arising from Employee's employment with the Bank, the
termination thereof or any other conduct occurring on or prior to the date the
Employee signs this Release of Claims. All such claims are forever barred by
this Release of Claims whether they arise in contract or tort or under a
statute or any other law.

  



  

 _SEVERANCE_. In return for Employee's execution of and adherence to this
Release of Claims, the Bank shall pay the Employee the [Salary Severance
Payment, Bonus Severance Payment, Incentive Severance Payment, Pension
Severance Payment and Defined Contribution Severance Payment], as defined in
and described in the Employment Agreement between the Bank and the Employee,
dated April 4, 2016, in the total amount of _____________ ($______) (the
"Severance Payment"). Payments shall be made in a lump sum subject to usual
and customary deductions required by law and Bank policy.

  



  

   

22

 _CONFIDENTIAL TERMS._ Employee and the Bank agree that each will keep the
contents of this Release of Claims (including its existence and the terms and
provisions hereof) and the negotiations leading to it completely
confidential, that neither will hereafter publish or disclose any information
concerning such matters to anyone, and that each shall take every reasonable
precaution to prevent the direct or indirect disclosure of such information
to third parties, provided that the foregoing provisions shall not be
construed to prevent Employee from disclosing such matters to his accountant
or to prevent the Bank from disclosing such matters to its accountants, and
provided further that Employee may also make such disclosures as are finally
compelled by law provided Employee gives the Bank immediate notice of
such legal process in order that the Bank shall have the opportunity to
object to the disclosure of such information.

  



  

 _INJUNCTIVE RELIEF_. Employee acknowledges and recognizes that a violation
of this Release of Claims and its covenants will cause irreparable damage to
the Bank and the Bank will have no adequate remedy at law for such violation.
Accordingly, Employee agrees that the Bank will be entitled, as a matter of
right, to an injunction from any court of competent jurisdiction restraining
any further violation of this Release of Claims or the terms and conditions
provided herein. This right to injunctive relief will be cumulative and in
addition to whatever remedies the parties may otherwise have at law.

  



  

 _CONSIDERATION AND REVOCATION PERIOD_. I acknowledge that I am hereby
advised to consult with an attorney before signing this Release of Claims. I
further understand that I may consider this Release of Claims for up to
twenty-one (21) days before deciding whether to sign it. If I signed this
Release of Claims before the expiration of that twenty-one (21) day period, I
acknowledge that such decision was entirely voluntary. I understand that if I
do not sign and return this Release of Claims to the Bank by the end of that
twenty-one (21) day period, the Severance Payment described above will
expire. I understand that for a period of seven (7) days after I execute this
General Release, I have the right to revoke it by a written notice to be
received by the Bank by the end of that period. I also understand that this
Release of Claims shall not be effective or enforceable until the expiration
of that seven (7) day period. I further represent and agree that I have
carefully read and fully understand all of the provisions of this Release of
Claims and that I am voluntarily agreeing to those provisions. I acknowledge
that I have not been induced to sign this Release of Claims by any
representatives of any released party other than the Severance Payment as
stated above.

  



  

Employee understands and agrees that Employee has carefully read and fully
understands all of the provisions of this Agreement and knowingly and
voluntarily agrees to all of the terms set forth in this Release of Claims.
Employee knowingly and voluntarily intends to be legally bound by the same.

 _ _

  

(a) During the Employment Period and for a period of six (6) years
thereafter, the Company shall cause the Executive to be covered by and named
as an insured under any policy or contract of insurance obtained by it to
insure its officers against personal liability for acts or omissions in
connection with service as an officer of the Company or service in other

(b) To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, during the
Employment Period and for a period of six (6) years thereafter, the Company
shall indemnify the Executive against and hold her harmless from any costs,
damages, losses and exposures arising out of a bona fide action, suit or

which do not materially interfere with the performance of her duties
hereunder; _provided, however, _ that such activities are not prohibited
under any code of conduct or investment or securities trading policy
established by the Company and generally applicable to all similarly situated
executives. The Executive may also serve as an officer or director of the
Bank on such terms and conditions as the Company and the Bank may mutually
agree upon, and such service shall not be deemed to materially interfere with
the Executive's performance of her duties hereunder or otherwise result in a
material breach of this Agreement. If the Executive is discharged or
suspended, or is subject to any regulatory prohibition or restriction
with respect to participation in the affairs of the Bank, she shall continue

Period as a result of the Executive's voluntary resignation within
ninety (90) days following:

  



  

(A) the failure of the Board to appoint or re-appoint or elect or re-
elect the Executive to the position with the Company stated in section 3
of this Agreement;

  



  

(B) if the Executive is a member of the Board, the failure of the

(C) the expiration of a thirty (30)-day period following the date on
which the Executive gives written notice to the Company of its material
failure, whether by amendment of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation,
the Company's By-Laws, action of the Board or the Company's shareholders or
otherwise, to vest in the Executive the functions, duties, or responsibilities
prescribed in section 3 of this Agreement, unless, during such thirty
(30)-day period, the Company cures such failure;

  



  

(D) the expiration of a thirty (30)-day period following the date on
which the Executive gives written notice to the Company of its material
breach of any term, condition or covenant contained in this Agreement
(including, without limitation any reduction of the Executive's rate of base
salary in effect from time to time and any change in the terms and conditions
of any compensation or benefit program in which the Executive participates
which, either individually or together with other changes, has a material
adverse effect on the aggregate value of her total compensation package),
unless, during such thirty (30)-day period, the Company cures such failure;

  



  

   

4 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  



  

(E) a change in the Executive's principal place of employment to a place
that is not the principal executive office of the Bank, or a relocation of
the Bank's principal executive office to a location that is both more than

than twenty-five (25) miles away from the location of the Bank's
principal executive office on the date of this Agreement; or

  



  

(F) any material breach by the Company of any material term, condition
or covenant contained in this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that
the Executive shall have given notice of such materials adverse effect to the
Company, and the Company has not fully cured such failure within thirty (30)
days after such notice is deemed given; or reason other than for "cause" as
provided in section 11(a).

  



  

(b) Upon the occurrence of any of the events described in section
9(a) of this Agreement, the Company shall pay and provide to the Executive
(or, in the event of her death thereafter and prior to payment, to her
estate):

  



  

(i) her earned but unpaid salary (including, without limitation, all
items which constitute wages under applicable law and the payment of which is
not otherwise provided for in this section 9(b)) as of the date of the
termination of her employment with the Company and the Bank, such payment to
be made at the time and in the manner prescribed by law applicable to the
payment of wages but in no event later than thirty (30) days after
termination of employment as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.409A-1(h)(1)(ii);

  



  

(ii) the benefits, if any, to which she is entitled as a former employee
under the employee benefit plans and programs and compensation plans
and programs maintained for the benefit of the Company's and the Bank's

(iii) continued group life, health (including hospitalization, medical

The coverage provided under this section 9(b)(iii) may, at the election of the
Company, be secondary to the coverage provided pursuant to section 9(b)(ii)
and to any employer-paid coverage provided by a subsequent employer or
through Medicare, with the result that benefits under the other coverages
will offset the coverage required by this section 9(b)(iii). The Executive,
the Company and the Bank agree that the termination benefits described in this
Section 9(b)(iii) are intended to be exempt from Section 409A pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b) (1) as non-taxable benefits;

  



  

   

5 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  



  

(iv) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the estimated present value
of the salary that the Executive would have earned if she had
continued working for the Company and the Bank during the Remaining Unexpired
Employment Period at the highest annual rate of salary achieved during the
period of three (3) years ending immediately prior to the date of termination
(the "Salary Severance Payment"). The Salary Severance Payment shall be
computed using the

  



  

       | following formula:  | ![](ex2-1004.jpg) 
---|---|--- 
   



  



  

where "SSP" is the amount of the Salary Severance Payment (before the
deduction of applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes); "BS" is
the highest annual rate of salary achieved by the Executive during the period
of three (3) years ending immediately prior to the date of termination; "PR"
is the number of payroll periods that occur during a year under the
Company's normal payroll practices; "I" equals the applicable federal short
term rate established under section 1274 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
(the "Code") for the month in which the Executive's termination of employment
occurs (the "Short Term AFR") and "n" equals the product of the Remaining
Unexpired Employment Period at the Executive's termination of employment
(expressed in years and fractions of years) multiplied by the number of
payroll periods that occur during a year under the Company's and the Bank's
normal payroll practices. The Salary Severance Payment shall be in lieu
of any claim to a continuation of base salary which the Executive might
otherwise have and in lieu of cash severance benefits under any severance
benefits program which may be in effect for officers or employees of the Bank
or the Company;

  



  

(v) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the estimated present value
of the annual bonuses that the Executive would have earned if she
had continued working for the Company and the Bank during the Remaining
Unexpired Employment Period at the highest annual rate of salary achieved
during the period of three (3) years ending immediately prior to the date of
termination (the "Bonus Severance Payment"). The Bonus Severance Payment
shall be computed using the following formula:

  



  

BSP = SSP x (ABP / ASP)

  



  

where "BSP" is the amount of the Bonus Severance Payment (before the
deduction of applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes); "SSP" is
the amount of the Salary Severance Payment (before the deduction of applicable
federal, state and local withholding taxes); "BP" is the aggregate of the
annual bonuses paid or declared (whether or not paid) for the most recent
period of three (3) calendar years to end on or before the Executive's
termination of employment; and "SP" is the aggregate base salary actually
paid to the Executive during such period of three (3) calendar years
(excluding any year for which no bonus was declared or paid). The Bonus
Severance Payment shall be in lieu of any claim to a continuation of
participation in annual bonus plans of the Bank or the Company which the
Executive might otherwise have;

  



  

   

6 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  



  

(vi) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the estimated present value
of the long-term incentive bonuses that the Executive would have earned if
she had continued working for the Company and the Bank during the Remaining
Unexpired Employment Period (the "Incentive Severance Payment"). The
Incentive Severance Payment shall be computed using the following formula:

  



  

ISP = (SSP / RUP) x (ALTIP / ALTSP) x Y

  



  

where "ISP" is the amount of the Incentive Severance Payment (before the
deduction of applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes); "SSP" is
the amount of the Salary Severance Payment (before the deduction of applicable
federal, state and local withholding taxes); "ALTIP" is the aggregate of the
most recently paid or declared (whether or not paid) long-term incentive
compensation payments (but not more than three (3) such payments) for
performance periods that end on or before the Executive's termination of
employment; "ALTSP" is the aggregate base salary actually paid to the
Executive during the performance periods covered by the payments included in
"ALTIP" and excluding base salary paid for any period for which no long-term
incentive compensation payment was declared or paid; "RUP" is the Remaining
Unexpired Employment Period, expressed in years and fractions of years; and
"Y" is the aggregate (expressed in years and fractions of years) of the
Remaining Unexpired Employment Period plus the number of years and fraction
of years that have elapsed since the end of the last performance period for
which a long-term incentive payment has been declared and paid. In the event
that the Executive's employment terminates prior to the payment date under
any long-term incentive compensation plan, then for purposes of computing the
Incentive Severance Payment, the "ALTSP" shall be deemed to be the average of
the target and maximum award level under such plan and the "ALTSP" shall be
deemed to be the Executive's annual base salary as in effect on the
Executive's termination of employment. The Incentive Severance Payment shall
be in lieu of any claim to a continuation of participation in cash long-
term incentive compensation plans of the Bank or the Company which the
Executive might otherwise have;

  



  

(vii) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (A)
the present value of the aggregate benefits to which she would be entitled
under any and all tax-qualified and non-tax-qualified defined benefit plans
maintained by, or covering employees of, the Company or the Bank (the
"Pension Plans") if she had continued working for the Company and the. Bank
during the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period; over (B) the present value
of the benefits to which the Executive and her spouse and/or
designated beneficiaries are actually entitled under such plans (the "Pension
Severance Payment"). The Pension Severance Payment shall be computed
according to the following formula:

  



  

PSP=PPB - APB

  



  

   

7 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  



  

where "PSP" is the amount of the Pension Severance Payment (before deductions
for applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes); "APB" is the
aggregate lump sum present value of the actual vested pension benefits payable
under the Pension Plans in the form of a straight life annuity beginning at
the earliest date permitted under the Pension Plans, computed on the basis of
the Executive's life expectancy at the earliest date on which payments under
the Pension Plans could begin, determined by reference to Table VI of section
1.72-9 of the Income Tax Regulations (the "Assumed Life Expectancy"), and on
the basis of an interest rate assumption equal to the average bond-equivalent
yield on United States Treasury Securities with a Constant Maturity of thirty
(30) Years for the month prior to the month in which the Executive's
termination of employment occurs (the "30-Year Treasury Rate"); and "PPB" is
the lump sum present value of the pension benefits (whether or not vested)
that would be payable under the Pension Plans in the form of a straight life
annuity beginning at the earliest date permitted under the Pension Plans,
computed on the basis that the Executive's actual age at termination of
employment is her attained age as of her last birthday that would occur
during the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period, that her service for benefit
accrual purposes under the Pension Plans is equal to the aggregate of her
actual service plus the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period, that her
average compensation figure used in determining her accrued benefit is equal
to the highest annual rate of salary achieved by the Executive during the
period of three (3) years ending immediately prior to the date of termination,
that the Executive's life expectancy at the earliest date on which payments
under the Pension Plans could begin is the Assumed Life Expectancy and that
the interest rate assumption used is equal to the 30-Year Treasury Rate. The
Pension Severance Payment shall be in lieu of any claim to any actual
increase in her accrued benefit in the Pension Plans in respect of the
Remaining Unexpired Employment Period; _provided, however,_ that if the
Pension Severance Payment represents the benefits under a non-tax-qualified
benefit plan, the payment shall be paid in the same time and form as provided
under the related non-tax-qualified benefit plan;

  



  

(viii) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the present value of the
additional employer contributions that would have been credited directly to
her account(s) under any and all tax-qualified and non-tax-qualified defined
contribution plans maintained by, or covering employees of, the Bank and the
Company (the "Non-ESOP DC Plans"), plus the fair market value of the
additional shares of employer securities or other property that would have
been allocated to her account as a result of employer contributions or
dividends under any tax-qualified leveraged employee stock ownership plan and
any related non-tax-qualified supplemental plan maintained by, or covering
employees of, the Bank and the Company (the "ESOP Plans") if she had continued
in employment during the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period (the "Defined
Contribution Severance Payment"). The Defined Contribution Severance
Payment shall be computed according to the following formula:

  



  

DCSP = [SSP x (EC / BS)] + [(STK + PROP) x Y]

  



  

   

8 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  



  

where: "DCSP" is the amount of the Defined Contribution Severance Payment
(before deductions for applicable federal, state and local
withholding taxes); "SSP" is the amount of the Salary Severance Payment
(before deductions for applicable federal, state and local withholding
taxes); "EC" is the amount of employer contributions actually credited to the
Executive's accounts under the Non-ESOP Plans for the last plan year to end
before her termination of employment; "BS" is the Executive's compensation
taken into account in computing EC; "Y" is the aggregate (expressed in years
and fractions of years) of the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period and the
number of years and fractions of years that have elapsed between the end of
plan year for which EC was computed and the date of the Executive's
termination of employment; "STK" is the fair market value (determined on the
basis of the midpoint of the highest and lowest reported sales price for a
share of stock of the same class during the thirty (30)-day period ending on
the day of the Executive's termination of employment (the "Fair Market Value
of a Share")) of the employer securities actually allocated to the Executive's
accounts under the ESOP Plans in respect of employer contributions and
dividends applied to loan amortization payments for the last plan year to end
before her termination of employment; and "PROP" is the fair market value
(determined as of the day before the Executive's termination of employment
using the same valuation methodology used to value the assets of the ESOP
Plans) of the property other than employer securities actually allocated to
the Executive's accounts under the ESOP Plans in respect of employer
contributions and dividends applied to loan amortization payments for the
last plan year to end before her termination of employment. The
Defined Contribution Severance Payment shall be in lieu of any claim to any
actual increase in her accrued benefit in the Non-ESOP DC Plans or the ESOP
DC Plans in respect of the Remaining Unexpired Employment; _provided,
however,_ that if the Defined Contribution Severance Payment represents the
benefits under a non-tax-qualified defined contribution plan, the payment
shall be paid in the same time and form as provided under the related non-
tax-qualified defined contribution plan;

  



  

(ix) at the election of the Company made within thirty (30) days
following the Executive's termination of employment, upon the surrender of
options or appreciation rights issued to the Executive under any stock option
and appreciation rights plan or program maintained by, or covering employees
of, the Company or the Bank, a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the
product of:

  



  

(A) the excess of (I) the Fair Market Value of a Share, over (II) the
exercise price per share for such option or appreciation right, as specified
in or under the relevant plan or program; multiplied by

  



  

(B) the number of shares with respect to which options or appreciation
rights are being surrendered.

  



  

   

9 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  



  

For the purpose of computing this payment, the Executive shall be deemed
fully vested in all options and appreciation rights under any stock option or
appreciation rights plan or program maintained by, or covering employees of,
the Company or the Bank, even if she is not vested under such plan or
program; and

  



  

(x) at the election of the Company made within thirty (30) days
following the Executive's termination of employment, upon the surrender of
any shares awarded to the Executive under any restricted stock plan
maintained by, or covering employees of, the Company or the Bank, the Company
shall make a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the product of:

  



  

(A) the Fair Market Value of a Share granted under such plan; multiplied
by

  



  

(B) the number of shares which are being surrendered.

  



  

For purposes of computing this payment, the Executive shall be deemed fully
vested in all shares awarded under any restricted stock plan maintained by,
or covering employees of, the Company or the Bank, even if she is not vested
under such plan.

  



  

The Company and the Executive hereby stipulate that the damages which may be
incurred by the Executive following any such termination of employment are
not capable of accurate measurement as of the date first above written and
that the payments and benefits contemplated by this section 9(b) constitute
reasonable damages under the circumstances and shall be payable without any
requirement of proof of actual damage and without regard to the Executive's
efforts, if any, to mitigate damages. The Company and the Executive
further agree that the Company may condition the payments and benefits (if
any) due under sections 9(b)(iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii), (viii), (ix), and
(x) on the receipt of the Executive's resignation from any and all positions
which she holds as an officer, director or committee member with respect to
the Company, the Bank or any subsidiary or affiliate of either of them;
provided that such resignation is requested in writing not later than five
(5) business days after termination of employment. The Executive agrees that
the payments and benefits (if any) due under sections 9(b)(iii), (iv), (v),
(vi), (vii) and (viii) shall be paid to Executive upon the sixtieth (60th)
day following the Executive's termination of employment, subject to the
Executive's execution, delivery, and non-revocation of a written release in
substantially the form attached hereto as Appendix A ("Release of Claims"),
within fifty-two (52) days of the Executive's termination of employment and
that no payment shall be made prior to the expiration of the revocation
period.

  



  

(c) The Executive, the Company and the Bank acknowledge that each of
the payments and benefits promised to the Executive under this Agreement
must either comply with the requirements of Section 409A and the regulations
thereunder or qualify for an exception from compliance. To that end, the
Executive, the Company and the Bank agree that the termination benefits
described in Section 9(b) are intended to be exempt from Section 409A
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) as short-term
deferrals.

 _Section 10. _Death and Disability Benefits.__

  

 _ _

  

(a) In the event the Executive's employment with the Company
terminates during the Employment Period because of the Executive's death,
then the Company shall pay to the Executive's estate the benefits listed in
sections 9(b)(i) and 9(b)(ii) of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) The Company may terminate the Executive's employment upon a
determination, by vote of a majority of the members of the Boards of
Directors of the Company, acting in reliance on the written advice of a
medical professional acceptable to them, that the Executive is suffering from
a physical or mental impairment which, at the date of the determination, has
prevented the Executive from performing her assigned duties on a
substantially full-time basis for a period of at least ninety (90) days during
the period of one (1) year ending with the date of the determination or is
likely to result in death or prevent the Executive from performing her
assigned duties on a substantially full-time basis for a period of at least
ninety (90) days during the period of one (1) year beginning with the date of
the determination. In such event:

  



  

(i) The Company shall pay and deliver to the Executive (or in the event
of her death before payment, to her estate and surviving dependents
and beneficiaries, as applicable) the benefits described in sections 9(b)(i)
and 9(b)(ii).

  



  

(ii) In addition to the benefits described in sections 9(b)(i) and
9(b)(ii), the Company shall continue to pay the Executive her base salary,
at the annual rate in effect for her immediately prior to the termination of
her employment, during a period ending on the earliest of: (A) the expiration
of ninety (90) days after the date of termination of her employment; (B) the
date on which long-term disability insurance benefits are first payable to
her under any long-term disability insurance plan covering employees of the
Bank or the Company (the "LTD Eligibility Date"); (C) the date of her death;
and (D) the expiration of the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period (the
"Initial Continuation Period"). If the end of the Initial Continuation Period
is neither the LTD Eligibility Date nor the date of her death, the Company
shall continue to pay the Executive her base salary, at an annual rate equal
to sixty percent (60%) of the annual rate in effect for her immediately prior
to the termination of her employment, during an additional period ending on
the earliest of the LTD Eligibility Date, the date of her death and the
expiration of the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period.

  



  

A termination of employment due to disability under this section 10 shall be
effected by notice of termination given to the Executive by the Company and
shall take effect on the later of the effective date of termination specified
in such notice or the date on which the notice of termination is deemed given
to the Executive. To that end, the Executive, the Company and the Bank agree
that the disability benefits described in this Section 10 are intended to be
exempt from Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)
as permissible payments.

 _Section 11. _Termination without Additional Company Liability.__

  

 _ _

  

In the event that the Executive's employment with the Company shall terminate
during the Employment Period on account of:

  



  

(a) the discharge of the Executive for "cause," which, for purposes
of this Agreement, shall mean a discharge of the Executive due to
the Executive's (i) personal dishonesty, (ii) incompetence, (iii) willful
misconduct, (iii) breach of fiduciary duties involving personal profit, (iv)
intentional failure to perform stated duties, (v) willful violation of any
law, rule or regulation (other than traffic violations or similar offenses)
or final cease-and-desist order or (vi) material breach of any provision of
this Agreement;  _provided, however,_ that, if the Executive engages in any
of the acts described in section 11(a)(vi) above, the Company shall provide
the Executive with written notice of its intent to discharge the Executive for
cause, and the Executive shall have forty-five (45) days from the date on
which the Executive receives such notice to cure any such acts; _and provided,
further,_ that on and after the date that a Change of Control occurs, a
determination under this section 11 shall require the affirmative vote of at
least three-fourths of the members of the Board acting in good faith and such
vote shall not be made prior to the expiration of a sixty (60)-day period
following the date on which the Board shall, by written notice to the
Executive, furnish to her a statement of its grounds for proposing to make
such determination, during which period the Executive shall be afforded a
reasonable opportunity to make oral and written presentations to the members
of the Board, and to be represented by her legal counsel at such
presentations, to refute the grounds for the proposed determination; or

  



  

(b) the Executive's voluntary resignation from employment with the
Company (including retirement) for reasons other than those specified in
section 9(a)(i) or Section 12; then the Company shall have no further
obligations under this Agreement, other than the payment to the Executive of
her earned but unpaid salary as of the date of the termination of her
employment and the provision of such other benefits, if any, to which she is
entitled as a former employee under the Company's employee benefit plans and
programs and compensation plans and programs. For purposes of this section
11, no act or failure to act, on the part of the Executive, shall be
considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the
Executive in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the Executive's
action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any act, or
failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly
adopted by the Board or based upon the written advice of counsel for the
Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by
the Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Company. The
cessation of employment of the Executive shall not be deemed to be for
"cause" within the meaning of section 11(a) unless and until there shall have
been delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the
affirmative vote of three-fourths of the members of the Board at a meeting of
the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is
provided to the Executive and the Executive is given an opportunity, together
with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the good faith
opinion of the Board, the Executive is guilty of the conduct described in
section 11(a) above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

 _Section 12. _Termination Upon or Following a Change of Control.__

  

 _ _

  

(a) A Change of Control of the Company ("Change of Control") shall
be deemed to have occurred upon the happening of any of the following events:

  



  

(i) the consummation of a reorganization, merger or consolidation of
the Company, respectively, with one (1) or more other persons, other than a
transaction following which:

  



  

(A) at least 51% of the equity ownership interests of the entity
resulting from such transaction are beneficially owned (within the meaning of
Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
"Exchange Act") in substantially the same relative proportions by persons
who, immediately prior to such transaction, beneficially owned (within the
meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) at least 51% of the
outstanding equity ownership interests in the Company; and

  



  

(B) at least 51% of the securities entitled to vote generally in the
election of directors of the entity resulting from such transaction
are beneficially owned (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act) in substantially the same relative proportions by persons
who, immediately prior to such transaction, beneficially owned (within the
meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) at least 51% of the
securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the
Company;

  



  

(ii) the acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company or beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 25% or more of the outstanding
securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors by any person or by any persons acting in concert, or approval by
the stockholders of the Company of any transaction which would result in such
an acquisition;

  



  

(iii) a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company;

  



  

(iv) the occurrence of any event if, immediately following such event, at
least 50% of the members of the Board of the Company do not belong to any of
the following groups

  



  

(A) individuals who were members of the Board of the Company on the date
of this Agreement; or

  



  

(B) individuals who first became members of the Board of the Company
after the date of this Agreement either:

  



  

(I) upon election to serve as a member of the Board of the Company by
affirmative vote of three-quarters of the members of such Board, or of a
nominating committee thereof, in office at the time of such first election; or

  



  

   

13 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  



  

(II) upon election by the stockholders of the Company to serve as a member
of the Board of the Company, but only if nominated for election by affirmative
vote of three-quarters of the members of the Board of the Company, or of a
nominating committee thereof; in office at the time of such first nomination;

  



  

 _provided, however, _ that such individual's election or nomination did not
result from an actual or threatened election contest or other actual or
threatened solicitation of proxies or consents other than by or on behalf of
the Board of the Company; or

  



  

(v) any event which would be described in section 12(a)(i), (ii), (iii)
or (iv) if the term "Bank" were substituted for the term "Company" therein.

  



  

In no event, however, shall a Change of Control be deemed to have occurred as
a result of any acquisition of securities or assets of the Company, the
Bank, or a subsidiary of either of them, by the Company, the Bank, or a
subsidiary of either of them, or by any employee benefit plan maintained by
any of them. For purposes of this section 12(a), the term "person" shall have
the meaning assigned to it under sections 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the
Exchange Act.

  



  

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, a "Pending Change of Control"
shall mean: (i) the signing of a definitive agreement for a
transaction which, if consummated, would result in a Change of Control; (ii)
the commencement of a tender offer which, if successful, would result in a
Change of Control; or (iii) the circulation of a proxy statement seeking
proxies in opposition to management in an election contest which, if
successful, would result in a Change of Control.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
the Executive's employment with the Bank and the Company terminates due
to death or disability within one (1) year after the occurrence of a Pending
Change of Control and if a Change of Control occurs within two (2) years
after such termination of employment, she (or in the event of her death, her
estate) shall be entitled to receive the benefits described in section 9(b)
that would have been payable if a Change of Control had occurred on the date
of her termination of employment and she had resigned pursuant to section
9(a)(i) immediately thereafter; _provided,_ that payment shall be
deferred without interest until, and shall be payable immediately upon, the
actual occurrence of a Change of Control.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary: (i)
in the event of the Executive's resignation within sixty (60) days after the
occurrence of a Change of Control, she shall be entitled to receive the
benefits described in section 9(b) that would be payable if her resignation
were pursuant to section 9(a)(i), without regard to the actual circumstances
of her resignation; and (ii) for a period of one (1) year after the
occurrence of a Change of Control, no discharge of the Executive shall be
deemed a discharge with Cause unless the votes contemplated by section 11(a)
of this Agreement are supported by at least two-thirds of the members of the
Board of Directors of the Company at the time the vote is taken who were also
members of the Board of Directors of the Company immediately prior to the
Change of Control.

  



  

   

14

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for
purposes of computing the benefits described in section 9(b) due upon a
termination of employment that occurs, or is deemed to have occurred, after a
Change of Control, the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period shall be deemed
to be three (3) full years.

  



  

 _Section 13. _Covenant Not To Compete.__

  

 _ _

  

The Executive hereby covenants and agrees that, in the event of her
termination of employment with the Company prior to the expiration of the
Employment Period, for a period of one (1) year following the date of her
termination of employment with the Company, she shall not, without the
written consent of the Company, become an officer, employee, consultant,
director or trustee of any savings bank, savings and loan
association, savings and loan holding company, bank or bank holding company,
credit union, or any direct or indirect subsidiary or affiliate of any such
entity, that entails working within Hampden county or any other county in
which the Company or the Bank maintains an office; _provided, however,_ that
this section 13 and section 15 shall not apply if the Executive is entitled to
the benefits under section 12.

  



  

 _Section 14. _Confidentiality. __

  

 _ _

  

Unless she obtains the prior written consent of the Company, the Executive
shall keep confidential and shall refrain from using for the benefit of
herself, or any person or entity other than the Company or any entity which
is a subsidiary of the Company or of which the Company is a subsidiary, any
material document or information obtained from the Company, or from its parent
or subsidiaries, in the course of her employment with any of them concerning
their properties, operations or business (unless such document or information
is readily ascertainable from public or published information or trade
sources or has otherwise been made available to the public through no fault
of her own) until the same ceases to be material (or becomes so ascertainable
or available); _provided, however,_ that nothing in this section 14 shall
prevent the Executive, with or without the Company's consent, from
participating in or disclosing documents or information in connection with
any judicial or administrative investigation, inquiry or proceeding to the
extent that such participation or disclosure is required under applicable
law.

  



  

 _Section 15. _Solicitation. __

  

 _ _

  

The Executive hereby covenants and agrees that, for a period of one (1) year
following her termination of employment with the Company, she shall not,
without the written consent of the Company, either directly or indirectly:

  



  

(a) solicit, offer employment to, or take any other action intended,
or that a reasonable person acting in like circumstances would expect, to have
the effect of causing any officer or employee of the Company, the Bank or any
of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates to terminate his or her
employment and accept employment or become affiliated with, or provide
services for compensation in any capacity whatsoever to, any savings bank,
savings and loan association, bank, bank holding company, savings and loan
holding company, or other institution engaged in the business of accepting
deposits, making loans, providing wealth management services, or doing
business within the counties specified in section 13;

  



  

   

15 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  



  

(b) provide any information, advice or recommendation with respect
to any such officer or employee of any savings bank, savings and loan company,
bank, bank holding company, savings and loan holding company, or other
institution engaged in the business of accepting deposits, making loans or
doing business within the counties specified in section 14; that is intended,
or that a reasonable person acting in like circumstances would expect, to
have the effect of causing any officer or employee of the Company, the Bank,
or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates to terminate his or her
employment and accept employment or become affiliated with, or provide
services for compensation in any capacity whatsoever to, any savings bank,
savings and loan association, bank, bank holding company, savings and loan
holding company, or other institution engaged in the business of accepting
deposits, making loans or doing business within the county specified in
section 13;

  



  

(c) solicit, provide any information, advice or recommendation or
take any other action intended, or that a reasonable person acting in like
circumstances would expect, to have the effect of causing any customer of the
Company, the Bank or any of their respective subsidiaries to terminate an
existing business or commercial relationship with any of them.

  



  

 _Section 16. _No Effect on Employee Benefit Plans or Programs.__

  

 _ _

  

The termination of the Executive's employment during the term of this
Agreement or thereafter, whether by the Company or by the Executive,
shall have no effect on the rights and obligations of the parties hereto
under the Company's qualified or non-qualified retirement, pension, savings,
thrift, profit-sharing or stock bonus plans, group life, health (including
hospitalization, medical and major medical), dental, accident and long term
disability insurance plans or such other employee benefit plans or programs,
or compensation plans or programs, as may be maintained by, or cover
employees of, the Company from time to time; _provided, however,_
that nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to duplicate any compensation
or benefits provided under any agreement, plan or program covering the
Executive to which the Bank is a party and any duplicative amount payable
under any such agreement, plan or program shall be applied as an offset to
reduce the amounts otherwise payable hereunder.

  



  

 _Section 17. _Other Termination.__

  

 _ _

  

Upon the expiration of this Agreement, other than on account of the
Executive's refusing to accept an extension offered by the Company or the
Executive's giving of a notice of non-extension, unless the Company shall
offer to the Executive continued service either: (i) in the same position in
effect immediately prior to the expiration of this Agreement with cash
compensation and pension and welfare benefits no less favorable than those in
effect immediately prior to the expiration of this Agreement; or (ii) in
another position acceptable to the Executive and upon mutually and reasonably
agreeable terms, and termination of employment, the Executive shall be
entitled to receive for a period of twelve (12) months after the expiration
of the Agreement (in this event, the "Severance Period") and continuation of
base salary at the rate then in effect plus medical, dental, life-insurance
and disability coverage; provided, that the Executive's continued
participation is permissible or otherwise practicable under the general terms
and provisions of such plans. To the extent that continued participation is
neither permissible nor practicable, the Company shall take such actions as
may be necessary to provide the Executive with substantially comparable
benefits (without additional cost to the Executive) outside the scope of such
plans. If the Executive engages in regular employment after her termination of
employment (whether as an executive or as a self-employed person), any
employee welfare benefits received by the Executive during the Severance
Period in consideration of such employment which are similar in nature to the
employee welfare benefits provided by the Company will relieve the Company of
their obligations under this section 17 to provide comparable benefits to the
extent of the benefits so received. This section 17 shall have no application
if, prior to the expiration of this Agreement, the Executive's employment has
terminated in a termination to which section 9, 10, 11 or 12 applies or if,
after the expiration of this Agreement, the Executive's employment is
terminated with Cause.

  



  

   

16 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  



  

The Executive, the Company and the Bank agree that the termination benefits
other than the salary continuation payments described in this Section 17 are
intended to be exempt from Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.409A-1(b)(1) as non-taxable benefits.

  



  

 _Section 18. _Successors and Assigns.__

  

 _ _

  

This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the
Executive, her legal representatives and testate or intestate distributees,
and the Company, and their respective successors and assigns, including any
successor by merger or consolidation or a statutory receiver or any other
person or firm or corporation to which all or substantially all of the assets
and business of the Company may be sold or otherwise transferred. Failure of
the Company to obtain from any successor its express written assumption of the
Company's obligations hereunder at least sixty (60) days in advance of the
scheduled effective date of any such succession shall be deemed a material
breach of this Agreement.

  



  

 _Section 19. _Notices.__

  

 _ _

  

Any communication required or permitted to be given under this Agreement,
including any notice, direction, designation, consent, instruction, objection
or waiver, shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given at such
time as it is delivered personally, or five (5) days after mailing if mailed,
postage prepaid, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested,

 _Section 20. _Indemnification for Attorneys ' Fees. __

  

 _ _

  

(a) The Company shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend the Executive
against reasonable costs, including legal fees and expenses, incurred by her
in connection with or arising out of any action, suit or proceeding in which
she may be involved, as a result of her efforts, in good faith, to defend or
enforce the terms of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, any
settlement agreement which provides for payment of any amounts in settlement
of the Company's or the Bank's obligations hereunder shall be
conclusive evidence of the Executive's entitlement to indemnification
hereunder, and any such indemnification payments shall be in addition to
amounts payable pursuant to such settlement agreement, unless such settlement
agreement expressly provides otherwise. Any such indemnification payments
will occur promptly following a request therefor, and in any event not later
than the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which
the indemnified expense is incurred or in which the Executive's legal right
thereto is finally determined.

  



  

(b) The Company's obligation to make the payments provided for in this
Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not
be affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim,
right or action which the Company may have against the Executive or others.
In no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take
any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Executive
under any of the provisions of this Agreement and such amounts shall not be
reduced whether or not the Executive obtains other employment.

  



  

 _Section 21. _Severability_. _ __

  

 _ _

  

A determination that any provision of this Agreement is invalid or
unenforceable shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision hereof.

  



  

 _Section 22. _Waiver_._

  

 _ _

  

Failure to insist upon strict compliance with any of the terms, covenants or
conditions hereof shall not be deemed a waiver of such term, covenant,
or condition. A waiver of any provision of this Agreement must be made in
writing, designated as a waiver, and signed by the party against whom its
enforcement is sought. Any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power
hereunder at any one (1) or more times shall not be deemed a waiver or
relinquishment of such right or power at any other time or times.

 _Section 23. _Counterparts. __

  

 _ _

  

This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, and all of which shall constitute one and the
same Agreement.

  



  

 _Section 24. _Governing Law.__

  

 _ _

  

Except to the extent preempted by federal law, this Agreement shall be
governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts applicable to contracts entered into and to be
performed entirely within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

  



  

 _Section 25. _Headings and Construction.__

  

 _ _

  

The headings of sections in this Agreement are for convenience of reference
only and are not intended to qualify the meaning of any section. Any
reference to a section number shall refer to a section of this Agreement,
unless otherwise stated.

  



  

 _Section 26. _Entire Agreement: Modifications.__

  

 _ _

  

This instrument contains the entire agreement of the parties relating to the
subject matter hereof, and supersedes in its entirety any and all prior
agreements, understandings or representations relating to the subject matter
hereof including the Change in Control Agreement. No modifications of this
Agreement shall be valid unless made in writing and signed by the parties
hereto. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
construed and administered in such manner as shall be necessary to effect
compliance with Section 409A and shall be subject to amendment in the future,
in such manner as the Company and the Bank may deem necessary or appropriate
to effect such compliance; provided that any such amendment shall preserve
for the Executive the benefit originally afforded pursuant to this Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, Executive hereby agrees that the Closing shall not
be considered a "Change In Control" for purposes of the Change in Control
Agreement and the occurrence of the Closing shall not entitle Executive to
receive any payments, benefits or rights that would or could have been paid or
provided under the Change in Control Agreement in connection with a Change In
Control as defined therein nor shall any amounts be due under this Agreement
related to the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, this Agreement shall be subject to consummation of the Merger in
accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, as the same may be amended
by the parties thereto in accordance with its terms. In the event the Merger
Agreement is terminated for any reason or the Merger does not occur, this
Agreement shall be deemed null and void.

 _Section 27. _Non-duplication. __

  

 _ _

  

The Company hereby agrees to guarantee the payment by the Bank of any
benefits and compensation to which the Executive is, or may be, entitled under
the terms and conditions of the employment agreement of even date herewith
between the Bank and the Executive. In the event that the Executive shall
perform services for the Bank or any other direct or indirect subsidiary or
affiliate of the Company or the Bank, any compensation or benefits provided
to the Executive by such other employer shall be applied to offset the
obligations of the Company hereunder, it being intended that this Agreement
set forth the aggregate compensation and benefits payable to the
Executive for all services to the Company, the Bank and all of their
respective direct or indirect subsidiaries and affiliates.

  



  

 _Section 28. _Dispute Resolution.__

  

 _ _

  

(a) The Executive acknowledges and agrees that upon any breach by
the Executive of her obligations under sections 13, 14 or 15 hereof, the
Company and Bank will have no adequate remedy at law, and accordingly will be
entitled, in addition to monetary damages, to specific performance and other
appropriate injunctive and equitable relief.

  



  

(b) Excluding only requests for equitable relief by the Company or
Bank under section 28(a) of this Agreement, in the event that there is any
claim or dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach
thereof, and the parties hereto shall not have resolved such claim or dispute
within sixty (60) days after written notice from one (1) party to the other
setting forth the nature of such claim or dispute, then such claim or dispute
shall be settled exclusively by binding arbitration in Boston, Massachusetts
in accordance with the Employment Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association by an arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the
parties hereto or, in the absence of such agreement, by an arbitrator
selected according to such Rules. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if either
the Company and Bank or the Executive shall request, such arbitration shall be
conducted by a panel of three (3) arbitrators, one (1) selected by the
Company and Bank, one (1) selected by the Executive and the third selected by
agreement of the first two (2), or, in the absence of such agreement, in
accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such
arbitrator(s) shall be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof upon
the application of either party.

  



  

 _Section 29. _Survival_. _

  

 _ _

  

Any provision of this Agreement which, by its terms, contemplates performance
after the expiration of the Employment Period or other termination of this
Agreement shall be deemed to survive the expiration of this Agreement.

  



  

 _Section 30. _Required Regulatory Provisions.__

  

 _ _

  

The following provisions are included for the purposes of complying with
various laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Company:

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, in no
event shall the aggregate amount of compensation payable to the Executive
under section 9(b) hereof exceed the three (3) times the Executive's average
annual compensation (within the meaning of the regulatory guidelines of the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") or any successor thereto)
for the last five (5) consecutive calendar years to end prior to her
termination of employment with the Company (or for her entire period of
employment with the Company if less than five (5) calendar years). The
compensation payable to the Executive hereunder shall be further reduced (but
not below zero) if such reduction would avoid the assessment of excise taxes
on excess parachute payments (within the meaning of section 280G of the
Code).

  



  

   

20 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, any
payments to the Executive by the Company, whether pursuant to this Agreement
or otherwise, are subject to and conditioned upon their compliance with
section 18(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act ("FDI Act"), 12 U.S.C.
§1828 (k), and any regulations promulgated thereunder.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, if
the Executive is suspended from office and/or temporarily prohibited from
participating in the conduct of the affairs of the Company pursuant to a
notice served under section 8(e)(3) or 8(g)(1) of the FDI Act, 12
U.S.C. §1818(e)(3) or 1818(g)(1), the Company's obligations under this
Agreement shall be suspended as of the date of service of such notice, unless
stayed by appropriate proceedings. If the charges in such notice are
dismissed, the Company, in its discretion, may (i) pay to the Executive all
or part of the compensation withheld while the Company's obligations hereunder
were suspended and (ii) reinstate, in whole or in part, any of the
obligations which were suspended.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, if
the Executive is removed and/or permanently prohibited from participating in
the conduct of the Company's affairs by an order issued under section 8(e)(4)
or 8(g)(I) of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. §1818(e)(4) or (g)(I), all obligations
of the Company under this Agreement shall terminate as of the effective date
of the order, but vested rights of the Company and the Executive shall not be
affected.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, if
the Company is in default (within the meaning of section 3(x)(1) of the FDI
Act, 12 U.S.C. §1813(x)(1), all obligations of the Company under this
Agreement shall terminate as of the date of default, but vested rights and
obligations of the Company and the Executive shall not be affected.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, all
obligations of the Company hereunder shall be terminated, except to the extent
that a continuation of this Agreement is necessary for the continued
operation of the Bank: (i) by the Director of the OCC or his designee or the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), at the time the FDIC enters
into an agreement to provide assistance to or on behalf of the Bank under the
authority contained in section 13(c) of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. §1823(c); (ii)
by the Director of the OCC or his designee at the time such Director or
designee approves a supervisory merger to resolve problems related to the
operation of the Bank or when the Bank is determined by such Director to be in
an unsafe or unsound condition. The vested rights of the parties shall not be
affected by such action.

  



  

If and to the extent that any of the foregoing provisions shall cease to be
required or by applicable law, rule or regulation, the same shall become
inoperative as though eliminated by formal amendment of this Agreement.

 _Section 31. _Payments to Key Employees.__

  

 _ _

  

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent
required under Section 409A, no payment to be made to a key employee (within
the meaning of Section 409A) shall be made sooner than six (6) months after
such termination of employment; provided, however, that to the extent such
six (6)-month delay is imposed by Section 409A as a result of a Change of
Control as defined in Section 12(a), the payment shall be paid into a rabbi
trust for the benefit of the Executive as if the six (6)-month delay was not
imposed with such amounts then being distributed to the Executive as soon as
permissible under Section 409A.

  



  

 _Section 32. _Involuntary Termination Payments to Employees (Safe
Harbor).__

  

 _ _

  

In the event a payment is made to an employee upon an involuntary termination
of employment, as deemed pursuant to this Agreement, such payment will not be
subject to Section 409A provided that such payment does not exceed two (2)
times the lesser of (i) the sum of the Executive's annualized compensation
based on the taxable year immediately preceding the year in which termination
of employment occurs or (ii) the maximum amount that may be taken into
account under a qualified plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(17) of the Code for
the year in which the Executive terminates service (the "Safe Harbor
Amount"). However, if such payment exceeds the Safe Harbor Amount, only the
amount in excess of the Safe Harbor Amount will be subject to Section 409A. In
addition, if such Executive is considered a key employee, such payment in
excess of the Safe Harbor Amount will have its timing delayed and will be
subject to the six (6)-month wait-period imposed by Section 409A as provided
in Section 31 of this Agreement. The Executive, the Company and the Bank
agree that the termination benefits described in this Section 32 are intended
to be exempt from Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section

Bank, Seller, Chicopee Savings Bank, or any corporation which is a member of
an "affiliated group" (as defined in Code Section 1504(a), without regard to

Company immediate notice of such legal process in order that the Company
shall have the opportunity to object to the disclosure of such information.

WITNESSETH:

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Westfield

WHEREAS, Buyer and the Executive desire to enter into this Agreement, which
shall supersede the Change in Control Agreement by and among Seller,

February 28, 2013 (the "Change in Control Agreement"), effective as of the
Effective Time of the Merger, and in lieu of any rights and potential payments
under the Change in Control Agreement which are hereby waived, the Executive
shall continue employment with the Bank following the Closing Date; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the Executive is willing to continue to serve the Bank on the terms
and conditions hereinafter set forth;

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants and

(b) The Board of Directors of the Bank (the "Board") shall conduct
an annual review of the Executive's performance in January following the end
of the fiscal year in accordance with regular employee reviews (each, an
"Anniversary Date") and may, on the basis of such review and by written
notice to the Executive, offer to extend the Employment Period for an
additional one (1)-year period. In such event, the Employment Period shall be
deemed extended in the absence of objection from the Executive by
written notice to the Bank given within ten (10) business days after her
receipt of the Bank's offer of extension. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, any reference in this Agreement to the term
"Remaining Unexpired Employment Period" as of any date shall mean the period
beginning on such date and ending on the day of the third (3rd) anniversary of
the last Anniversary Date as of which the Employment Period was extended
pursuant to this section 2(b).

  



  

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the Bank
at any time from terminating the Executive's employment during the
Employment Period with or without notice for any reason; _provided, however,_
that the relative rights and obligations of the Bank and the Executive in the
event of any such termination shall be determined under this Agreement.

  



  

 _Section 3. _Duties.__

  

 _ _

  

The Executive shall serve as Senior Vice President, Chief Information Officer

use her best efforts to advance the interests of the Bank.

  



  

 _Section 4. _Cash Compensation.__

  

 _ _

  

In consideration for the services to be rendered by the Executive hereunder,
the Bank shall pay to her a salary at an annual rate of $180,000, payable
in approximately equal installments in accordance with the Bank 's customary
payroll practices for senior officers. The Board shall review the Executive's
annual rate of salary during the regular employee review process and at such
other times during the Employment Period as it deems appropriate, and may, in
its discretion, approve an increase therein. In addition to salary, the
Executive may receive other cash compensation from the Bank for services
hereunder at such times, in such amounts and on such terms and conditions as
the Board may determine from time to time.

sharing or stock bonus plans, any and all group life, health (including

plans (including, but not limited to, any incentive compensation plans or
programs, stock option and appreciation rights plans and restricted stock
plans) as may from time to time be maintained by, or cover employees of,
the Bank in accordance with the terms and conditions of such employee benefit

 _Section 6. _Indemnification and Insurance.__

  

 _ _

  

(a) During the Employment Period and for a period of six (6) years
thereafter, the Bank shall cause the Executive to be covered by and named as
an insured under any policy or contract of insurance obtained by it to insure
its officers against personal liability for acts or omissions in connection
with service as an officer of the Bank or service in other capacities at the
request of the Bank. The coverage provided to the Executive pursuant to this
section 6 shall be of the same scope and on the same terms and conditions as
the coverage (if any) provided to other officers of the Bank.

  



  

(b) To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, during the
Employment Period and for a period of six (6) years thereafter, the Bank shall
indemnify the Executive against and hold her harmless from any costs,
damages, losses and exposures arising out of a bona fide action, suit or
proceeding in which she may be involved by reason of her having been an
officer of the Bank to the fullest extent and on the most favorable terms and
conditions that similar indemnification is offered to any officer of the Bank
or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof.

  



  

(c) The Executive, the Company and the Bank agree that the
termination benefits described in this Section 6 are intended to be exempt
from Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code ("Section 409A") pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(10) as certain indemnification and
liability insurance plans.

  



  

 _Section 7. _Outside Activities_. ___

  

 _ _

  

The Executive may serve as a member of the boards of directors of such
business, community and charitable organizations as she may disclose to and as
may be approved by the Board (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld); _provided, however,_ that such service shall not materially
interfere with the performance of her duties under this Agreement. The
Executive may also engage in personal business and investment activities
which do not materially interfere with the performance of her duties
hereunder; _provided, however, _ that such activities are not prohibited
under any code of conduct or investment or securities trading policy
established by the Bank and generally applicable to all similarly situated
executives. The Executive may also serve as an officer or director of the
Company on such terms and conditions as the Company and the Bank may mutually
agree upon, and such service shall not be deemed to materially interfere with
the Executive's performance of her duties hereunder or otherwise result in a
material breach of this Agreement. If the Executive is discharged or
suspended, or is subject to any regulatory prohibition or restriction with
respect to participation in the affairs of the Bank, she shall not directly or
indirectly provide services to or participate in the affairs of the Bank in a
manner inconsistent with the terms of such discharge or suspension or any
applicable regulatory order.

executive offices at the address first above written or at such other
location as the Bank and the executive may mutually agree upon. The Bank
shall reimburse the Executive for her ordinary and necessary
business expenses in accordance with any relevant Bank reimbursement policy
or procedure in each case upon presentation to the Bank of an itemized
account of such expenses in such form as the Bank may reasonably require.
Expense reimbursements shall occur at the time provided in any relevant
reimbursement policy or procedure of the Bank and in any event not later than

 _Section 9 _Termination of Employment with Severance

 _ _

  

(a) The Executive shall be entitled to the severance benefits

(i) her employment with the Bank terminates during the Employment
Period as a result of the Executive's voluntary resignation within
ninety (90) days following:

  



  

(A) the failure of the Board to appoint or re-appoint or elect or re-
elect the Executive to the position with the Bank stated in section 3 of
this Agreement;

  



  

(B) if the Executive is a member of the Board, the failure of the

(C) the expiration of a thirty (30)-day period following the date on
which the Executive gives written notice to the Bank of its material
failure, whether by amendment of the Bank's Restated Organization
Certificate, the Bank's By-Laws, action of the Board or the Bank's
shareholders or otherwise, to vest in the Executive the functions, duties, or
responsibilities prescribed in section 3 of this Agreement, unless, during
such thirty (30)-day period, the Bank cures such failure;

  



  

(D) the expiration of a thirty (30)-day period following the date on
which the Executive gives written notice to the Bank of its material breach
of any term, condition or covenant contained in this Agreement (including,
without limitation any reduction of the Executive's rate of base salary in
effect from time to time and any change in the terms and conditions of any
compensation or benefit program in which the Executive participates which,
either individually or together with other changes, has a material adverse

during such thirty (30)-day period, the Bank cures such failure;

  



  

   

4 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  



  

(E) a change in the Executive's principal place of employment to a place
that is not the principal executive office of the Bank, or a relocation of
the Bank's principal executive office to a location that is both more than
twenty-five (25) miles away from the Executive's principal residence and more
than twenty-five (25) miles away from the location of the Bank's
principal executive office on the date of this Agreement; or

  



  

(F) any material breach by the Bank of any material term, condition or
covenant contained in this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that the Executive
shall have given notice of such materials adverse effect to the Bank, and the
Bank has not fully cured such failure within thirty (30) days after such
notice is deemed given; or

  



  

(ii) the Executive's employment with the Bank is terminated by the Bank
for any reason other than for "cause" as provided in section 11(a).

  



  

(b) Upon the occurrence of any of the events described in section
9(a) of this Agreement, the Bank shall pay and provide to the Executive (or,
in the event of her death thereafter and prior to payment, to her estate):

  



  

(i) her earned but unpaid salary (including, without limitation, all
items which constitute wages under applicable law and the payment of which is
not otherwise provided for in this section 9(b)) as of the date of the
termination of her employment with the Company and the Bank, such payment to
be made at the time and in the manner prescribed by law applicable to the
payment of wages but in no event later than thirty (30) days after
termination of employment as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.409A-1(h)(1)(ii);

  



  

(ii) the benefits, if any, to which she is entitled as a former employee
under the employee benefit plans and programs and compensation plans
and programs maintained for the benefit of the Company's and the Bank's
officers and employees;

  



  

(iii) continued group life, health (including hospitalization, medical

effect for them immediately prior to the Executive's termination for the
Remaining Unexpired Employment Period for the Executive and her dependents.
The coverage provided under this section 9(b)(iii) may, at the election of the
Bank, be secondary to the coverage provided pursuant to section 9(b)(ii) and
to any employer-paid coverage provided by a subsequent employer or
through Medicare, with the result that benefits under the other coverages
will offset the coverage required by this section 9(b)(iii). The Executive,
the Company and the Bank agree that the termination benefits described in this
Section 9(b)(iii) are intended to be exempt from Section 409A pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b) (1) as non-taxable benefits;

  



  

   

5 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  



  

(iv) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the estimated present value
of the salary that the Executive would have earned if she had
continued working for the Company and the Bank during the Remaining Unexpired
Employment Period at the highest annual rate of salary achieved during the
period of three (3) years ending immediately prior to the date of termination
(the "Salary Severance Payment"). The Salary Severance Payment shall be
computed using the

  



  

       | following formula:  | ![](ex2-1003.jpg) 
---|---|--- 
   



  

where "SSP" is the amount of the Salary Severance Payment (before the
deduction of applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes); "BS" is
the highest annual rate of salary achieved by the Executive during the period
of three (3) years ending immediately prior to the date of termination; "PR"
is the number of payroll periods that occur during a year under the
Company's normal payroll practices; "I" equals the applicable federal short
term rate established under section 1274 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
(the "Code") for the month in which the Executive's termination of employment
occurs (the "Short Term AFR") and "n" equals the product of the Remaining
Unexpired Employment Period at the Executive's termination of employment
(expressed in years and fractions of years) multiplied by the number of
payroll periods that occur during a year under the Company's and the Bank's
normal payroll practices. The Salary Severance Payment shall be in lieu
of cash severance benefits under any severance benefits program which may be
in effect for officers or employees of the Bank or the Company;

  



  

(v) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the estimated present value
of the annual bonuses that the Executive would have earned if she
had continued working for the Company and the Bank during the Remaining
Unexpired Employment Period at the highest annual rate of salary achieved
during the period of three (3) years ending immediately prior to the date of
termination (the "Bonus Severance Payment"). The Bonus Severance Payment
shall be computed using the following formula:

  



  

BSP = SSP x (ABP / ASP)

  



  

where "BSP" is the amount of the Bonus Severance Payment (before the
deduction of applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes); "SSP" is
the amount of the Salary Severance Payment (before the deduction of applicable
federal, state and local withholding taxes); "BP" is the aggregate of the
annual bonuses paid or declared (whether or not paid) for the most recent
period of three (3) calendar years to end on or before the Executive's
termination of employment; and "SP" is the aggregate base salary actually
paid to the Executive during such period of three (3) calendar years
(excluding any year for which no bonus was declared or paid). The Bonus
Severance Payment shall be in lieu of any claim to a continuation of
participation in annual bonus plans of the Bank or the Company which the
Executive might otherwise have;

  



  

   

6 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  



  

(vi) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the estimated present value
of the long-term incentive bonuses that the Executive would have earned if
she had continued working for the Company and the Bank during the Remaining
Unexpired Employment Period (the "Incentive Severance Payment"). The
Incentive Severance Payment shall be computed using the following formula:

  



  

ISP = (SSP / RUP) x (ALTIP / ALTSP) x Y

  



  

where "ISP" is the amount of the Incentive Severance Payment (before the
deduction of applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes); "SSP" is
the amount of the Salary Severance Payment (before the deduction of applicable
federal, state and local withholding taxes); "ALTIP" is the aggregate of the
most recently paid or declared (whether or not paid) long-term incentive
compensation payments (but not more than three (3) such payments) for
performance periods that end on or before the Executive's termination of
employment; "ALTSP" is the aggregate base salary actually paid to the
Executive during the performance periods covered by the payments included in
"ALTIP" and excluding base salary paid for any period for which no long-term
incentive compensation payment was declared or paid; "RUP" is the Remaining
Unexpired Employment Period, expressed in years and fractions of years; and
"Y" is the aggregate (expressed in years and fractions of years) of the
Remaining Unexpired Employment Period plus the number of years and fraction
of years that have elapsed since the end of the last performance period for
which a long-term incentive payment has been declared and paid. In the event
that the Executive's employment terminates prior to the payment date under
any long-term incentive compensation plan, then for purposes of computing the
Incentive Severance Payment, the "ALTSP" shall be deemed to be the average of
the target and maximum award level under such plan and the "ALTSP" shall be
deemed to be the Executive's annual base salary as in effect on the
Executive's termination of employment. The Incentive Severance Payment shall
be in lieu of any claim to a continuation of participation in cash long-
term incentive compensation plans of the Bank or the Company which the
Executive might otherwise have;

  



  

(vii) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (A)
the present value of the aggregate benefits to which she would be entitled
under any and all tax-qualified and non-tax-qualified defined benefit plans
maintained by, or covering employees of, the Company or the Bank (the
"Pension Plans") if she had continued working for the Company and the Bank
during the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period; over (B) the present value
of the benefits to which the Executive and her spouse and/or
designated beneficiaries are actually entitled under such plans (the "Pension
Severance Payment"). The Pension Severance Payment shall be computed
according to the following formula:

  



  

PSP=PPB - APB

  



  

   

7 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  



  

where "PSP" is the amount of the Pension Severance Payment (before deductions
for applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes); "APB" is the
aggregate lump sum present value of the actual vested pension benefits payable
under the Pension Plans in the form of a straight life annuity beginning at
the earliest date permitted under the Pension Plans, computed on the basis of
the Executive's life expectancy at the earliest date on which payments under
the Pension Plans could begin, determined by reference to Table VI of section
1.72-9 of the Income Tax Regulations (the "Assumed Life Expectancy"), and on
the basis of an interest rate assumption equal to the average bond-equivalent
yield on United States Treasury Securities with a Constant Maturity of thirty
(30) Years for the month prior to the month in which the Executive's
termination of employment occurs (the "30-Year Treasury Rate"); and "PPB" is
the lump sum present value of the pension benefits (whether or not vested)
that would be payable under the Pension Plans in the form of a straight life
annuity beginning at the earliest date permitted under the Pension Plans,
computed on the basis that the Executive's actual age at termination of
employment is her attained age as of her last birthday that would occur
during the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period, that her service for benefit
accrual purposes under the Pension Plans is equal to the aggregate of her
actual service plus the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period, that her
average compensation figure used in determining her accrued benefit is equal
to the highest annual rate of salary achieved by the Executive during the
period of three (3) years ending immediately prior to the date of termination,
that the Executive's life expectancy at the earliest date on which payments
under the Pension Plans could begin is the Assumed Life Expectancy and that
the interest rate assumption used is equal to the 30-Year Treasury Rate. The
Pension Severance Payment shall be in lieu of any claim to any actual
increase in her accrued benefit in the Pension Plans in respect of the
Remaining Unexpired Employment Period; _provided, however,_ that if the
Pension Severance Payment represents the benefits under a non-tax-qualified
benefit plan, the payment shall be paid in the same time and form as provided
under the related non-tax-qualified benefit plan; and

  



  

(viii) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the present value of the
additional employer contributions that would have been credited directly to
her account(s) under any and all tax-qualified and non-tax-qualified defined
contribution plans maintained by, or covering employees of, the Bank and the
Company (the "Non-ESOP DC Plans"), plus the fair market value of the
additional shares of employer securities or other property that would have
been allocated to her account as a result of employer contributions or
dividends under any tax-qualified leveraged employee stock ownership plan and
any related non-tax-qualified supplemental plan maintained by, or covering
employees of, the Bank and the Company (the "ESOP Plans") if she had continued
in employment during the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period (the "Defined
Contribution Severance Payment"). The Defined Contribution Severance
Payment shall be computed according to the following formula:

  



  

DCSP = [SSP x (EC / BS)] + [(STK + PROP) x Y]

  



  

   

8 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  



  

where: "DCSP" is the amount of the Defined Contribution Severance Payment
(before deductions for applicable federal, state and local
withholding taxes); "SSP" is the amount of the Salary Severance Payment
(before deductions for applicable federal, state and local withholding
taxes); "EC" is the amount of employer contributions actually credited to the
Executive's accounts under the Non-ESOP Plans for the last plan year to end
before her termination of employment; "BS" is the Executive's compensation
taken into account in computing EC; "Y" is the aggregate (expressed in years
and fractions of years) of the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period and the
number of years and fractions of years that have elapsed between the end of
plan year for which EC was computed and the date of the Executive's
termination of employment; "STK" is the fair market value (determined on the
basis of the midpoint of the highest and lowest reported sales price for a
share of stock of the same class during the thirty (30)-day period ending on
the day of the Executive's termination of employment (the "Fair Market Value
of a Share")) of the employer securities actually allocated to the Executive's
accounts under the ESOP Plans in respect of employer contributions and
dividends applied to loan amortization payments for the last plan year to end
before her termination of employment; and "PROP" is the fair market value
(determined as of the day before the Executive's termination of employment
using the same valuation methodology used to value the assets of the ESOP
Plans) of the property other than employer securities actually allocated to
the Executive's accounts under the ESOP Plans in respect of employer
contributions and dividends applied to loan amortization payments for the
last plan year to end before her termination of employment. The
Defined Contribution Severance Payment shall be made within sixty (60)
business days after the Executive's termination of employment and shall be in
lieu of any claim to any actual increase in her accrued benefit in the Non-
ESOP DC Plans or the ESOP DC Plans in respect of the Remaining Unexpired
Employment; _provided, however,_ that if the Defined Contribution Severance
Payment represents the benefits under a non-tax-qualified defined
contribution plan, the payment shall be paid in the same time and form as
provided under the related non-tax-qualified defined contribution plan.

  



  

The Bank and the Executive hereby stipulate that the damages which may be
incurred by the Executive following any such termination of employment are
not capable of accurate measurement as of the date first above written and
that the payments and benefits contemplated by this section 9(b) constitute
reasonable damages under the circumstances and shall be payable without any
requirement of proof of actual damage and without regard to the Executive's
efforts, if any, to mitigate damages. The Bank and the Executive further
agree that the Bank may condition the payments and benefits (if any) due
under sections 9(b)(iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii) and (viii) on the receipt of
the Executive's resignation from any and all positions which she holds as an
officer, director or committee member with respect to the Company, the Bank
or any subsidiary or affiliate of either of them; provided that such
resignation is requested in writing not later than five (5) business days
after termination of employment. The Executive agrees that the payments and
benefits (if any) due under sections 9(b)(iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii) and
(viii) shall be paid to Executive upon the sixtieth (60th) day following the
Executive's termination of employment, subject to the Executive's execution,
delivery, and non-revocation of a written release in substantially the form
attached hereto as Appendix A ("Release of Claims"), within fifty-two (52)
days of the Executive's termination of employment and that no payment shall be
made prior to the expiration of the revocation period.

(c) The Executive, the Company and the Bank acknowledge that each of the
payments and benefits promised to the Executive under this Agreement
must either comply with the requirements of Section 409A and the regulations
thereunder or qualify for an exception from compliance. To that end, the
Executive, the Company and the Bank agree that the termination benefits
described in Section 9(b) are intended to be exempt from Section 409A
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) as short-term
deferrals.

  



  

 _Section 10. _Death and Disability Benefits.__

  

 _ _

  

(a) In the event the Executive's employment with the Bank terminates
during the Employment Period because of the Executive's death, then the Bank
shall pay to the Executive's estate the benefits listed in sections 9(b)(i)
and 9(b)(ii) of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) The Bank may terminate the Executive's employment upon a
determination, by vote of a majority of the members of the Board, acting in
reliance on the written advice of a medical professional acceptable to them,
that the Executive is suffering from a physical or mental impairment which,
at the date of the determination, has prevented the Executive from performing
her assigned duties on a substantially full-time basis for a period of at
least ninety (90) days during the period of one (1) year ending with the date
of the determination or is likely to result in death or prevent the Executive
from performing her assigned duties on a substantially full-time basis for a
period of at least ninety (90) days during the period of one (1) year
beginning with the date of the determination. In such event:

  



  

(i) The Bank shall pay and deliver to the Executive (or in the event of
her death before payment, to her estate and surviving dependents
and beneficiaries, as applicable) the benefits described in sections 9(b)(i)
and 9(b)(ii).

  



  

(ii) In addition to the benefits described in sections 9(b)(i) and
9(b)(ii), the Bank shall continue to pay the Executive her base salary, at
the annual rate in effect for her immediately prior to the termination of her
employment, during a period ending on the earliest of: (A) the expiration of
ninety (90) days after the date of termination of her employment; (B) the date
on which long-term disability insurance benefits are first payable to her
under any long-term disability insurance plan covering employees of the Bank
or the Company (the "LTD Eligibility Date"); (C) the date of her death; and
(D) the expiration of the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period (the "Initial
Continuation Period"). If the end of the Initial Continuation Period is
neither the LTD Eligibility Date nor the date of her death, the Bank shall
continue to pay the Executive her base salary, at an annual rate equal to
sixty percent (60%) of the annual rate in effect for her immediately prior to
the termination of her employment, during an additional period ending on the
earliest of the LTD Eligibility Date, the date of her death and the expiration
of the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period.

  



  

   

10 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  



  

A termination of employment due to disability under this section 10 shall be
effected by notice of termination given to the Executive by the Bank and
shall take effect on the later of the effective date of termination specified
in such notice or the date on which the notice of termination is deemed given
to the Executive. To that end, the Executive, the Company and the Bank agree
that the disability benefits described in this Section 10 are intended to be
exempt from Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)
as permissible payments.

  



  

 _Section 11. _Termination without Additional Company Liability.__

  

 _ _

  

In the event that the Executive's employment with the Bank shall terminate
during the Employment Period on account of:

  



  

(a) the discharge of the Executive for "cause," which, for purposes
of this Agreement, shall mean a discharge of the Executive due to
the Executive's (i) personal dishonesty, (ii) incompetence, (iii) willful
misconduct, (iii) breach of fiduciary duties involving personal profit, (iv)
intentional failure to perform stated duties, (v) willful violation of any
law, rule or regulation (other than traffic violations or similar offenses)
or final cease-and-desist order or (vi) material breach of any provision of
this Agreement;  _provided, however,_ that, if the Executive engages in any
of the acts described in section 11(a)(vi) above, the Bank shall provide the
Executive with written notice of its intent to discharge the Executive for
cause, and the Executive shall have thirty (30) days from the date on which
the Executive receives such notice to cure any such acts; _and provided,
further,_ that on and after the date that a Change of Control occurs, a
determination under this section 11 shall require the affirmative vote of at
least three-fourths of the members of the Board acting in good faith and such
vote shall not be made prior to the expiration of a sixty (60)-day period
following the date on which the Board shall, by written notice to the
Executive, furnish to her a statement of its grounds for proposing to make
such determination, during which period the Executive shall be afforded a
reasonable opportunity to make oral and written presentations to the members
of the Board, and to be represented by her legal counsel at such
presentations, to refute the grounds for the proposed determination; or

  



  

(b) the Executive's voluntary resignation from employment with the
Bank (including retirement) for reasons other than those specified in section
9(a)(i) or Section 12; then the Bank shall have no further obligations under
this Agreement, other than the payment to the Executive of her earned but
unpaid salary as of the date of the termination of her employment and the
provision of such other benefits, if any, to which she is entitled as a
former employee under the Bank's employee benefit plans and programs and
compensation plans and programs. For purposes of this section 11, no act or
failure to act, on the part of the Executive, shall be considered
"willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in bad
faith or without reasonable belief that the Executive's action or omission
was in the best interests of the Bank. Any act, or failure to act, based upon
authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or based
upon the written advice of counsel for the Bank shall be conclusively presumed
to be done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the
best interests of the Bank. The cessation of employment of the Executive
shall not be deemed to be for "cause" within the meaning of section 11(a)
unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a
resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of three-fourths of the
members of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such
purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the Executive and the
Executive is given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before
the Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the
Executive is guilty of the conduct described in section 11(a) above, and
specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

 _Section 12. _Termination Upon or Following a Change of Control.__

  

 _ _

  

(a) A Change of Control of the Company ("Change of Control") shall be
deemed to have occurred upon the happening of any of the following events:

  



  

(i) the consummation of a reorganization, merger or consolidation of
the Company, respectively, with one (1) or more other persons, other than a
transaction following which:

  



  

(A) at least 51% of the equity ownership interests of the entity
resulting from such transaction are beneficially owned (within the meaning of
Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
"Exchange Act") in substantially the same relative proportions by persons
who, immediately prior to such transaction, beneficially owned (within the
meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) at least 51% of the
outstanding equity ownership interests in the Company; and

  



  

(B) at least 51% of the securities entitled to vote generally in the
election of directors of the entity resulting from such transaction
are beneficially owned (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act) in substantially the same relative proportions by persons
who, immediately prior to such transaction, beneficially owned (within the
meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) at least 51% of the
securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the
Company;

  



  

(ii) the acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company or beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 25% or more of the outstanding
securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors by any person or by any persons acting in concert, or approval by
the stockholders of the Company of any transaction which would result in such
an acquisition;

  



  

(iii) a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company;

  



  

(iv) the occurrence of any event if, immediately following such event, at
least 50% of the members of the Board of the Company do not belong to any of
the following groups

  



  

(A) individuals who were members of the Board of the Company on the date
of this Agreement; or

  



  

(B) individuals who first became members of the Board of the Company
after the date of this Agreement either:

  



  

   

12 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  



  

(I) upon election to serve as a member of the Board of the Company by
affirmative vote of three-quarters of the members of such Board, or of a
nominating committee thereof, in office at the time of such first election;
or

  



  

(II) upon election by the stockholders of the Company to serve as a
member of the Board of the Company, but only if nominated for election by
affirmative vote of three-quarters of the members of the Board of the
Company, or of a nominating committee thereof; in office at the time of such
first nomination;

  



  

 _provided, however, _ that such individual's election or nomination did not
result from an actual or threatened election contest or other actual or
threatened solicitation of proxies or consents other than by or on behalf of
the Board of the Company; or

  



  

(v) any event which would be described in section 12(a)(i), (ii), (iii)
or (iv) if the term "Bank" were substituted for the term "Company" therein.

  



  

In no event, however, shall a Change of Control be deemed to have occurred as
a result of any acquisition of securities or assets of the Company, the
Bank, or a subsidiary of either of them, by the Company, the Bank, or a
subsidiary of either of them, or by any employee benefit plan maintained by
any of them. For purposes of this section 12(a), the term "person" shall have
the meaning assigned to it under sections 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the
Exchange Act.

  



  

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, a "Pending Change of Control"
shall mean: (i) the signing of a definitive agreement for a
transaction which, if consummated, would result in a Change of Control; (ii)
the commencement of a tender offer which, if successful, would result in a
Change of Control; or (iii) the circulation of a proxy statement seeking
proxies in opposition to management in an election contest which, if
successful, would result in a Change of Control.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
the Executive's employment with the Bank and the Company terminates due
to death or disability within one (1) year after the occurrence of a Pending
Change of Control and if a Change of Control occurs within two (2) years
after such termination of employment, she (or in the event of her death, her
estate) shall be entitled to receive the benefits described in section 9(b)
that would have been payable if a Change of Control had occurred on the date
of her termination of employment and she had resigned pursuant to section
9(a)(i) immediately thereafter; _provided,_ that payment shall be
deferred without interest until, and shall be payable immediately upon, the
actual occurrence of a Change of Control.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary: (i)
in the event of the Executive's resignation within sixty (60) days after the
occurrence of a Change of Control, she shall be entitled to receive the
benefits described in section 9(b) that would be payable if her resignation
were pursuant to section 9(a)(i), without regard to the actual circumstances
of her resignation; and (ii) for a period of one (1) year after the
occurrence of a Change of Control, no discharge of the Executive shall be
deemed a discharge with Cause unless the votes contemplated by section 11(a)
of this Agreement are supported by at least two-thirds of the members of the
Board of Directors of the Company at the time the vote is taken who were also
members of the Board of Directors of the Company immediately prior to the
Change of Control.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for
purposes of computing the benefits described in section 9(b) due upon a
termination of employment that occurs, or is deemed to have occurred, after a
Change of Control, the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period shall be deemed
to be three (3) full years.

  



  

 _Section 13. _Covenant Not To Compete.__

  

 _ _

  

The Executive hereby covenants and agrees that, in the event of her
termination of employment with the Bank prior to the expiration of the
Employment Period, for a period of one (1) year following the date of her
termination of employment with the Bank (or, if less, for the
Remaining Unexpired Employment Period), she shall not, without the written
consent of the Bank, become an officer, employee, consultant, director or
trustee of any savings bank, savings and loan association, savings and loan
holding company, bank or bank holding company, credit union, or any direct or
indirect subsidiary or affiliate of any such entity, that entails working
within Hampden county or any other county in which the Company or the Bank
maintains an office; _provided, however,_ that this section 13 and section 15
shall not apply if the Executive is entitled to benefits under section 12.

  



  

 _Section 14. _Confidentiality. __

  

 _ _

  

Unless she obtains the prior written consent of the Bank, the Executive shall
keep confidential and shall refrain from using for the benefit of herself, or
any person or entity other than the Company or any entity which is a
subsidiary of the Company or of which the Company is a subsidiary, any
material document or information obtained from the Company, or from its parent
or subsidiaries, in the course of her employment with any of them concerning
their properties, operations or business (unless such document or information
is readily ascertainable from public or published information or trade
sources or has otherwise been made available to the public through no fault
of her own) until the same ceases to be material (or becomes so ascertainable
or available); _provided, however,_ that nothing in this section 14 shall
prevent the Executive, with or without the Bank's consent, from participating
in or disclosing documents or information in connection with any judicial or
administrative investigation, inquiry or proceeding to the extent that such
participation or disclosure is required under applicable law.

  



  

 _Section 15. _Solicitation. __

  

 _ _

  

The Executive hereby covenants and agrees that, for a period of one (1) year
following her termination of employment with the Bank, she shall not, without
the written consent of the Bank, either directly or indirectly:

  



  

(a) solicit, offer employment to, or take any other action intended,
or that a reasonable person acting in like circumstances would expect, to have
the effect of causing any officer or employee of the Company, the Bank or any
of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates to terminate his or her
employment and accept employment or become affiliated with, or provide
services for compensation in any capacity whatsoever to, any savings bank,
savings and loan association, bank, bank holding company, savings and loan
holding company, or other institution engaged in the business of accepting
deposits, making loans or doing business within the counties specified in
section 13;

  



  

   

14 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  



  

(b) provide any information, advice or recommendation with respect to
any such officer or employee of any savings bank, savings and loan company,
bank, bank holding company, savings and loan holding company, or other
institution engaged in the business of accepting deposits, making
loans, providing wealth management services, or doing business within the
counties specified in section 14; that is intended, or that a reasonable
person acting in like circumstances would expect, to have the effect of
causing any officer or employee of the Company, the Bank, or any of their
respective subsidiaries or affiliates to terminate his or her employment and
accept employment or become affiliated with, or provide services for
compensation in any capacity whatsoever to, any savings bank, savings and loan
association, bank, bank holding company, savings and loan holding company, or
other institution engaged in the business of accepting deposits, making loans
or doing business within the counties specified in section 13;

  



  

(c) solicit, provide any information, advice or recommendation or
take any other action intended, or that a reasonable person acting in like
circumstances would expect, to have the effect of causing any customer of the
Company, the Bank or any of their respective subsidiaries to terminate an
existing business or commercial relationship with any of them.

  



  

 _Section 16. _No Effect on Employee Benefit Plans or Programs.__

  

 _ _

  

The termination of the Executive's employment during the term of this
Agreement or thereafter, whether by the Bank or by the Executive, shall
have no effect on the rights and obligations of the parties hereto under the
Bank's qualified or non-qualified retirement, pension, savings, thrift,
profit-sharing or stock bonus plans, group life, health (including
hospitalization, medical and major medical), dental, accident and long term
disability insurance plans or such other employee benefit plans or programs,
or compensation plans or programs, as may be maintained by, or cover
employees of, the Bank from time to time; _provided, however,_ that
nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to duplicate any compensation or
benefits provided under any agreement, plan or program covering the Executive
to which the Bank is a party and any duplicative amount payable under any such
agreement, plan or program shall be applied as an offset to reduce the
amounts otherwise payable hereunder.

  



  

 _Section 17. _Successors and Assigns.__

  

 _ _

  

This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the
Executive, her legal representatives and testate or intestate distributees,
and the Bank, and their respective successors and assigns, including any
successor by merger or consolidation or a statutory receiver or any other
person or firm or corporation to which all or substantially all of the assets
and business of the Bank may be sold or otherwise transferred. Failure of the
Bank to obtain from any successor its express written assumption of the Bank's
obligations hereunder at least sixty (60) days in advance of the scheduled
effective date of any such succession shall be deemed a material breach
of this Agreement.

 _Section 19. _Indemnification for Attorneys ' Fees. __

  

 _ _

  

The Bank shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend the Executive against
reasonable costs, including legal fees and expenses, incurred by her in
connection with or arising out of any action, suit or proceeding in which she
may be involved, as a result of her efforts, in good faith, to defend or
enforce the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that the Executive
shall have substantially prevailed on the merits pursuant to a judgment,
decree or order of a court of competent jurisdiction or of an arbitrator in an
arbitration proceeding. The determination whether the Executive shall have
substantially prevailed on the merits and is therefore entitled to such
indemnification, shall be made by the court or arbitrator, as applicable. In
the event of a settlement pursuant to a settlement agreement, any
indemnification payment under this section 19 shall be made only after a
determination by the members of the Board (other than the Executive and any
other member of the Board to which the Executive is related by blood or
marriage) that the Executive has acted in good faith and that such
indemnification is in the best interests of the Bank. For purposes of this
Agreement, any such indemnification payments will occur promptly following a
request therefor, and in any event not later than the last day of the calendar
year following the calendar year in which the indemnified expense is incurred
or in which the Executive's legal right thereto is finally determined.

A determination that any provision of this Agreement is invalid or
unenforceable shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision hereof.

  



  

 _Section 21. _Waiver_._

  

 _ _

  

Failure to insist upon strict compliance with any of the terms, covenants or
conditions hereof shall not be deemed a waiver of such term, covenant,
or condition. A waiver of any provision of this Agreement must be made in
writing, designated as a waiver, and signed by the party against whom its
enforcement is sought. Any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power
hereunder at any one (1) or more times shall not be deemed a waiver or
relinquishment of such right or power at any other time or times.

  



  

 _Section 22. _Counterparts. __

This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, and all of which shall constitute one and the
same Agreement.

  



  

 _Section 23. _Governing Law.__

unless otherwise stated.

  



  

 _Section 25. _Entire Agreement: Modifications.__

  

 _ _

  

This instrument contains the entire agreement of the parties relating to the
subject matter hereof, and supersedes in its entirety any and all prior
agreements, understandings or representations relating to the subject matter
hereof including the Change in Control Agreement. No modifications of this
Agreement shall be valid unless made in writing and signed by the parties
hereto. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
construed and administered in such manner as shall be necessary to effect
compliance with Section 409A and shall be subject to amendment in the future,
in such manner as the Company and the Bank may deem necessary or appropriate
to effect such compliance; provided that any such amendment shall preserve
for the Executive the benefit originally afforded pursuant to this Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, Executive hereby agrees that the Closing shall not
be considered a "Change In Control" for purposes of the Change in Control
Agreement and the occurrence of the Closing shall not entitle Executive to
receive any payments, benefits or rights that would or could have been paid or
provided under the Change in Control Agreement in connection with a Change In
Control as defined therein nor shall any amounts be due under this Agreement
related to the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, this Agreement shall be subject to consummation of the Merger in
accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, as the same may be amended
by the parties thereto in accordance with its terms. In the event the Merger

 _Section 26. _Non-duplication. __

  

 _ _

  

In the event that the Executive shall perform services for the Company or any
other direct or indirect subsidiary or affiliate of the Company or the Bank,
any compensation or benefits provided to the Executive by such other employer
shall be applied to offset the obligations of the Bank hereunder, it being
intended that this Agreement set forth the aggregate compensation and benefits
payable to the Executive for all services to the Company, the Bank and all of
their respective direct or indirect subsidiaries and affiliates.

  



  

 _Section 27. _Dispute Resolution.__

  

 _ _

  

(a) The Executive acknowledges and agrees that upon any breach by
the Executive of her obligations under sections 13, 14 or 15 hereof, the
Company and Bank will have no adequate remedy at law, and accordingly will be
entitled, in addition to monetary damages, to specific performance and other
appropriate injunctive and equitable relief.

  



  

(b) Excluding only requests for equitable relief by the Company or
Bank under section 28(a) of this Agreement, in the event that there is any
claim or dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach
thereof, and the parties hereto shall not have resolved such claim or dispute
within sixty (60) days after written notice from one (1) party to the other
setting forth the nature of such claim or dispute, then such claim or dispute
shall be settled exclusively by binding arbitration in Boston, Massachusetts
in accordance with the Employment Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association by an arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the
parties hereto or, in the absence of such agreement, by an arbitrator
selected according to such Rules. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if either
the Company and Bank or the Executive shall request, such arbitration shall be
conducted by a panel of three (3) arbitrators, one (1) selected by the
Company and Bank, one (1) selected by the Executive and the third selected by
agreement of the first two (2), or, in the absence of such agreement, in
accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such
arbitrator(s) shall be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof upon
the application of either party.

  



  

 _Section 28. _Survival_. _

  

 _ _

  

Any provision of this Agreement which, by its terms, contemplates performance
after the expiration of the Employment Period or other termination of this
Agreement shall be deemed to survive the expiration of this Agreement.

 _Section 29. _Required Regulatory Provisions.__

  

 _ _

  

The following provisions are included for the purposes of complying with
various laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Bank:

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, in no
event shall the aggregate amount of compensation payable to the Executive
under section 9(b) hereof exceed the three (3) times the Executive's average
annual compensation (within the meaning of the regulatory guidelines of the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") or any successor thereto)
for the last five (5) consecutive calendar years to end prior to her
termination of employment with the Bank (or for her entire period of
employment with the Bank if less than five (5) calendar years). The
compensation payable to the Executive hereunder shall be further reduced (but
not below zero) if such reduction would avoid the assessment of excise taxes
on excess parachute payments (within the meaning of section 280G of the
Code).

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, any
payments to the Executive by the Bank, whether pursuant to this Agreement or
otherwise, are subject to and conditioned upon their compliance with section
18(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act ("FDI Act"), 12 U.S.C. §1828 (k),
and any regulations promulgated thereunder.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, if
the Executive is suspended from office and/or temporarily prohibited from
participating in the conduct of the affairs of the Bank pursuant to a notice
served under section 8(e)(3) or 8(g)(1) of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. §1818(e)(3)
or 1818(g)(1), the Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall be suspended
as of the date of service of such notice, unless stayed by appropriate
proceedings. If the charges in such notice are dismissed, the Bank, in its
discretion, may (i) pay to the Executive all or part of the compensation
withheld while the Bank's obligations hereunder were suspended and (ii)
reinstate, in whole or in part, any of the obligations which were suspended.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, if the
Executive is removed and/or permanently prohibited from participating in
the conduct of the Bank 's affairs by an order issued under section 8(e)(4)
or 8(g)(I) of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. §1818(e)(4) or (g)(I), all obligations
of the Bank under this Agreement shall terminate as of the effective date of
the order, but vested rights of the Bank and the Executive shall not be
affected.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, if the
Bank is in default (within the meaning of section 3(x)(1) of the FDI Act,
12 U.S.C. §1813(x)(1), all obligations of the Bank under this Agreement shall
terminate as of the date of default, but vested rights and obligations of the
Bank and the Executive shall not be affected.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, all
obligations of the Bank hereunder shall be terminated, except to the extent
that a continuation of this Agreement is necessary for the continued
operation of the Bank: (i) by the Director of the OCC or his designee or the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), at the time the FDIC enters
into an agreement to provide assistance to or on behalf of the Bank under the
authority contained in section 13(c) of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. §1823(c); (ii)
by the Director of the OCC or his designee at the time such Director or
designee approves a supervisory merger to resolve problems related to the
operation of the Bank or when the Bank is determined by such Director to be in
an unsafe or unsound condition. The vested rights of the parties shall not be
affected by such action.

  



  

   

19 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  



  

If and to the extent that any of the foregoing provisions shall cease to be
required or by applicable law, rule or regulation, the same shall become
inoperative as though eliminated by formal amendment of this Agreement.

  



  

 _Section 30. _Payments to Key Employees.__

  

 _ _

  

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent
required under Section 409A, no payment to be made to a key employee (within
the meaning of Section 409A) shall be made sooner than six (6) months after
such termination of employment; provided, however, that to the extent such
six (6)-month delay is imposed by Section 409A as a result of a Change of
Control as defined in Section 12(a), the payment shall be paid into a rabbi
trust for the benefit of the Executive as if the six (6)-month delay was not
imposed with such amounts then being distributed to the Executive as soon as
permissible under Section 409A.

  



  

 _Section 31. _Involuntary Termination Payments to Employees (Safe
Harbor).__

  

 _ _

  

In the event a payment is made to an employee upon an involuntary termination
of employment, as deemed pursuant to this Agreement, such payment will not be
subject to Section 409A provided that such payment does not exceed two (2)
times the lesser of (i) the sum of the Executive's annualized compensation
based on the taxable year immediately preceding the year in which termination
of employment occurs or (ii) the maximum amount that may be taken into
account under a qualified plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(17) of the Code for
the year in which the Executive terminates service (the "Safe Harbor
Amount"). However, if such payment exceeds the Safe Harbor Amount, only the
amount in excess of the Safe Harbor Amount will be subject to Section 409A. In
addition, if such Executive is considered a key employee, such payment in
excess of the Safe Harbor Amount will have its timing delayed and will be
subject to the six (6)-month wait-period imposed by Section 409A as provided
in Section 30 of this Agreement. The Executive, the Company and the Bank
agree that the termination benefits described in this Section 31 are intended
to be exempt from Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) as the safe harbor for separation pay due to involuntary
separation from service.

  



  

 _Section 32. _Section 280G Cut-Back_. _

  

 _ _

  

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any payments
or benefits provided for in this Agreement, together with any other
payments which the Executive has the right to receive from the Company, the
Bank, Seller, Chicopee Savings Bank, or any corporation which is a member of
an "affiliated group" (as defined in Code Section 1504(a), without regard to
Code Section 1504(b)) of which Company, the Bank, Seller, or Chicopee Savings
Bank is a member, would constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined
in Code Section 280G(b)(2)), payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be
reduced to the extent necessary to ensure that no portion of such payments
will be subject to the excise tax imposed by Code Section 4999. Any
determination required under this section 32 shall be made by the Bank and
its tax advisors, whose determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the
Executive.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Bank has caused this Agreement to be executed and the
Executive has hereunto set her hand, all as of the day and year first above
written.

APPENDIX A

  



  

 _RELEASE OF CLAIMS_

  



  

I, Darlene M. Libiszewski, of [City], [County], Massachusetts, (hereinafter,
the "Employee"), in consideration of the severance described below, on behalf
of herself and her heirs and assigns, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
releases and forever discharges, individually and collectively, WESTFIELD
BANK, a federally-chartered savings bank, with a place of business at 141 Elm
Street, Westfield, Hampden County, Massachusetts (hereinafter, the "Bank"),
its affiliated companies, and each of their respective officers, directors,
employees, shareholders, representatives, parent companies, subsidiaries,
predecessors, successors, assigns, attorneys and all persons acting by,
through or in concert with them, of and from any and all charges, claims,
complaints, demands, liabilities, causes of action, losses, costs or expenses
of any kind whatsoever (including related attorneys' fees and costs), known or
unknown, suspected or unsuspected, that Employee may now have or has ever had
against the Bank by reason of any act, omission, transaction, or event
occurring up to and including the date of the signing of this Agreement.

  



  

This waiver, release and discharge includes without limitation, claims
related to any wrongful or unlawful discharge, discipline or retaliation,
whether express or implied, any promotions or demotions, compensation, the
Bank's benefit plan(s) and the management thereof, defamation, slander,
libel, invasion of privacy, misrepresentation, fraud, infliction of emotional
distress, stress, breach of any covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and
any other claims relating to the Employee's employment with the Bank and the
termination thereof. This waiver, release and discharge further applies but
is not limited to any claims based on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, the Post Civil War Civil Rights Act (41 U.S.C. ss. 1981 - 88), the
Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Equal Pay Act, the Age
Discrimination Employment Act, the Older Workers' Benefit Protection Act, the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Vietnam
Era Veterans' Readjustment Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Workers
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, Executive Order 11246, the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the Family and Medical Leave
Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B (all as they may be amended), and any other
applicable federal, state or local laws, ordinances and regulations
including those relating to discrimination to the extent permitted by law.
Employee expressly waives all claims, including those which she does not know
or suspect to exist in his favor as of the date of this Agreement against the
Bank. As used herein, the Employee understand the word "claims" to include
all actions, claims, and grievances, whether actual or potential, known
or unknown, and specifically but not exclusively including all claims against
the Bank or otherwise arising from Employee's employment with the Bank, the
termination thereof or any other conduct occurring on or prior to the date the
Employee signs this Release of Claims. All such claims are forever barred by
this Release of Claims whether they arise in contract or tort or under a
statute or any other law.

  



  

 _SEVERANCE_. In return for Employee's execution of and adherence to this
Release of Claims, the Bank shall pay the Employee the [Salary Severance
Payment, Bonus Severance Payment, Incentive Severance Payment, Pension
Severance Payment and Defined Contribution Severance Payment], as defined in
and described in the Employment Agreement between the Bank and the Employee,
dated April ___, 2016, in the total amount of _____________ ($______) (the
"Severance Payment"). Payments shall be made in a lump sum subject to usual
and customary deductions required by law and Bank policy.

  



  

   

22 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

 _CONFIDENTIAL TERMS._ Employee and the Bank agree that each will keep the
contents of this Release of Claims (including its existence and the terms and
provisions hereof) and the negotiations leading to it completely
confidential, that neither will hereafter publish or disclose any information
concerning such matters to anyone, and that each shall take every reasonable
precaution to prevent the direct or indirect disclosure of such information
to third parties, provided that the foregoing provisions shall not be
construed to prevent Employee from disclosing such matters to her accountant
or to prevent the Bank from disclosing such matters to its accountants, and
provided further that Employee may also make such disclosures as are finally
compelled by law provided Employee gives the Bank immediate notice of
such legal process in order that the Bank shall have the opportunity to
object to the disclosure of such information.

  



  

 _INJUNCTIVE RELIEF_. Employee acknowledges and recognizes that a violation
of this Release of Claims and its covenants will cause irreparable damage to
the Bank and the Bank will have no adequate remedy at law for such violation.
Accordingly, Employee agrees that the Bank will be entitled, as a matter of
right, to an injunction from any court of competent jurisdiction restraining
any further violation of this Release of Claims or the terms and conditions
provided herein. This right to injunctive relief will be cumulative and in
addition to whatever remedies the parties may otherwise have at law.

  



  

 _CONSIDERATION AND REVOCATION PERIOD_. I acknowledge that I am hereby
advised to consult with an attorney before signing this Release of Claims. I
further understand that I may consider this Release of Claims for up to
twenty-one (21) days before deciding whether to sign it. If I signed
this Release of Claims before the expiration of that twenty-one (21) day
period, I acknowledge that such decision was entirely voluntary. I understand
that if I do not sign and return this Release of Claims to the Bank by the end
of that twenty-one (21) day period, the Severance Payment described above
will expire. I understand that for a period of seven (7) days after I execute
this General Release, I have the right to revoke it by a written notice to be
received by the Bank by the end of that period. I also understand that this
Release of Claims shall not be effective or enforceable until the expiration
of that seven (7) day period. I further represent and agree that I have
carefully read and fully understand all of the provisions of this Release of
Claims and that I am voluntarily agreeing to those provisions. I acknowledge
that I have not been induced to sign this Release of Claims by any
representatives of any released party other than the Severance Payment as
stated above.

  



  

Employee understands and agrees that Employee has carefully read and fully
understands all of the provisions of this Agreement and knowingly and
voluntarily agrees to all of the terms set forth in this Release of Claims.
Employee knowingly and voluntarily intends to be legally bound by the same.

Exhibit D-1

  



  

Form of Settlement Agreement with William J. Wagner

  



  

   

 



    

  



    

  

  

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

  



  

This Settlement Agreement (the " _Agreement_ ") is entered into as of April
4, 2016 by and among William J. Wagner (the " _Executive_ "), Westfield
Financial, Inc., a bank holding company (" _Buyer_ "), Westfield Bank, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer (" _Buyer Bank_ "), Chicopee Bancorp, Inc.,
a bank holding company (" _Seller_ "), and Chicopee Savings Bank, a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Seller (" _Seller Bank_ ").

  



  

WITNESSETH:

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller
are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 4, 2016
(the " _Merger Agreement_ "), and all capitalized terms not defined herein
shall have the meaning set forth in the Merger Agreement; and

  



  

WHEREAS, Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, Seller Bank, and the Executive desire to
enter into this Agreement, which shall supersede the Executive
Employment Agreement by and among Seller and the Executive, dated November
20, 2008, as amended on December 31, 2008, and the Executive
Employment Agreement by and among Seller Bank and the Executive, dated
November 20, 2008, as amended on December 31, 2008 (collectively, the "
_Employment Agreements_ "), effective immediately prior to the Effective Time
of the Merger, and in lieu of any rights and payments under the Employment
Agreements, the Executive shall be entitled to the rights and payments set
forth herein irrespective of whether the Executive terminates employment
(which for the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree shall be the rights and
payments to which the Executive is entitled in the event of the Executive's
termination of employment without "Cause" or for "Good Reason" following a
"Change of Control" (as such terms are defined in the Employment
Agreements) as contemplated by Sections 11 and 12 of the Employment
Agreements).

  



  

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other good and valuable
consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the Executive, Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, and Seller Bank agree
as follows:

  



  

1. _Settlement Amount_.

  



  

1.1 _Employment Agreements Amount_. On the Closing Date, provided
the Executive has remained employed with the Seller and Seller Bank to
and including the Closing Date, Seller shall, or shall cause an affiliate to,
pay to the Executive a lump-sum cash amount equal to the total of $1,300,059,
in full satisfaction of the payment obligations of Seller and Seller Bank
under the Employment Agreements, less applicable tax withholdings (the total
of such sum, the " _Employment Agreements Amount_ ") with such amount to be
further reduced pursuant to _Section 1.2_ hereof as may be needed.

  



  

   


--- 

 


--- 

    



  

For the avoidance of doubt, the payment of the Employment Agreements Amount
under this Agreement shall not release Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, or Seller
Bank, as applicable, from any of the following obligations: (a) obligations to
pay to the Executive accrued but unpaid wages, and make payments for accrued
but unused vacation, earned up to the Effective Time of the Merger to the
extent required by applicable law; (b) the payment of any of the Executive's
vested benefits under the tax-qualified and non-qualified plans of Seller or
Seller Bank, including any benefits that become vested as a result of the
Merger; (c) obligations regarding accelerated vesting of equity awards and
phantom stock awards, if any, under any equity awards or phantom stock unit
awards granted by Seller to the Executive and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time; (d) the payment of the Merger Consideration with
respect to the Executive's common stock of Seller as contemplated by Section
2.01 of the Merger Agreement; (e) obligations regarding vested benefits and
benefits which become vested as a result of the Merger under a supplemental
executive retirement plan; or (f) rights to indemnification under applicable
corporate law, the organizational documents of Seller or Seller Bank, as an
insured under any director's and officer's liability insurance policy new or
previously in force, or pursuant to Section 5.12 of the Merger Agreement. For
the avoidance of doubt, the parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the
Merger constitutes a "change of control" for purposes of the Seller Bank
Amended and Restated Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and Seller Bank
2012 Phantom Stock Unit Award and Long-Term Incentive Plan, and Seller Bank
will pay out all cash amounts under such agreements at the Closing Date.

  



  

1.2 _Section 280G Cut-Back_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if the Employment Agreements Amount provided
for in this Agreement, together with any other payments which the Executive
has the right to receive from Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, Seller Bank, or any
corporation which is a member of an "affiliated group" (as defined in Code
Section 1504(a), without regard to Code Section 1504(b)) of which Buyer,
Buyer Bank, Seller, or Seller Bank is a member, would constitute an
"excess parachute payment" (as defined in Code Section 280G(b)(2)), payments
pursuant to this Agreement shall be reduced to the extent necessary to ensure
that no portion of such payments will be subject to the excise tax imposed by
Code Section 4999. It is hereby understood that the Employment Agreements
Amount as determined under this _Section 1.2_ will be subject to further
adjustment upon the consummation of the Merger. Any determination required
under this _Section 1.2_ shall be made by Seller and Buyer and their
respective tax advisors, whose determination shall be conclusive and binding
upon the Executive, Seller, and Seller Bank, and it is hereby understood that
such determination will follow the same methodology for calculating the Code
Section 280G limitation in order to avoid an "excess parachute payment" as
provided in Seller Bank Disclosure Schedule 3.18(f) to the Merger Agreement.

  



  

1.3 _Section 280G Waiver_. Executive acknowledges and
specifically waives his rights under Section 15 of the Employment Agreements,
including, but not limited to, any right to indemnification for any excise
tax imposed under Code Section 4999.

  



  

1.4 _No Further Adjustment_. The parties hereby agree that the
Employment Agreements Amount as determined in the manner provided under 
_Section 1.1_ and _Section 1.2_ hereof is final and binding on all parties
and shall not otherwise be subject to further adjustment.

  



  

1.5 _Employment with Buyer_. Concurrently with the signing of
this Agreement Buyer and Buyer Bank shall each enter into employment
agreements attached hereto as _Appendix A_ and _Appendix B_ with the
Executive with such employment agreements to be effective as of the Closing
Date at a base salary rate of $350,000 per year.

  



  

   


--- 

 


--- 

    



  

1.6 _Complete Satisfaction_. In consideration of the payment of
the Employment Agreements Amount, the employment by Buyer and/or Buyer
Bank following the Closing Date and the other provisions of this Agreement,
the Executive, Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, and Seller Bank hereby agree that
effective immediately following the Effective Time of the Merger, the
Executive agrees that the full payment of the Employment Agreements Amount,
as determined in accordance _Section 1.1_ and _Section 1.2_ , shall be in
complete satisfaction of all rights to payments due to Executive under the
Employment Agreements.

  



  

2. _Code Section 409A Compliance_. The intent of the parties is that payments under this Agreement either be exempt from or comply with Code Section 409A and the Treasury Regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance therewith. To that end, Executive, Buyer, Seller, and Seller Bank agree that the payment described in _Section_ _1 _ is intended to be excepted from compliance with Code Section 409A as a short-term deferral pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4).

  



  

3. _General_.

  



  

3.1 _Heirs, Successors, and Assigns_. The terms of this
Agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective heirs,
successors, assigns and legal representatives.

  



  

3.2 _Final Agreement_. This Agreement represents the entire
understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes all prior understandings, written or oral, except as set forth
in a separate written employment agreement by and between Buyer, Buyer Bank
and the Executive. The terms of this Agreement may be changed, modified, or
discharged only by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties
hereto.

  



  

3.3 _Withholdings_.  Seller, Seller Bank, Buyer, and Buyer Bank
may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such federal,
state, or local taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to
applicable law or regulation.

  



  

3.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed,
enforced, and interpreted in accordance with and governed by the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without reference to its principles of
conflicts of law, except to the extent that federal law shall be deemed to
preempt such state laws.

  



  

3.5 _Regulatory Limitations_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, neither Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, nor Seller
Bank shall be obligated to make, and Executive shall have no right to
receive, any payment under this Agreement which would violate any
law, regulation, or regulatory order applicable to Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller,
or Seller Bank, as applicable, at the time such payment is due, including,
without limitation, Section 1828(k)(1) of Title 12 of the United States Code
and any regulation or order thereunder of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation.

  



  

   


--- 

 


--- 

    



  

3.6 _Voluntary Action and Waiver_. The Executive acknowledges
that by his free and voluntary act of signing below, the Executive agrees
to all of the terms of this Agreement and intends to be legally bound
thereby. The Executive acknowledges that he has been advised to consult with
an attorney prior to executing this Agreement.

  



  

3.7 _Counterparts_.  This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

  



  

4. _Effectiveness_.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this Agreement shall be subject to consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, as the same may be amended by the parties thereto in accordance with its terms. In the event the Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason or the Merger does not occur, this Agreement shall be deemed null and void.

Form of Settlement Agreement with Maria J.C. Aigner

  



  

   

 



    

  



    

    

  

  

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

  



  

This Settlement Agreement (the " _Agreement_ ") is entered into as of April
4, 2016 by and among Maria J.C. Aigner (the " _Executive_ "), Westfield
Financial, Inc., a bank holding company (" _Buyer_ "), Westfield Bank, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer (" _Buyer Bank_ "), Chicopee Bancorp, Inc., a
bank holding company (" _Seller_ "), and Chicopee Savings Bank, a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Seller (" _Seller Bank_ ").

  



  

WITNESSETH:

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller
are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 4, 2016
(the " _Merger Agreement_ "), and all capitalized terms not defined herein
shall have the meaning set forth in the Merger Agreement; and

  



  

WHEREAS, Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, Seller Bank, and the Executive desire to
enter into this Agreement, which shall supersede the Change in Control
Agreement by and among Seller, Seller Bank and the Executive, dated November
20, 2008, as amended on February 28, 2013 (the " _CIC Agreement_ "),
effective immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, and in lieu
of any rights and payments under the CIC Agreement, the Executive shall be
entitled to the rights and payments set forth herein and shall terminate
employment with Seller and Seller Bank (which for the avoidance of doubt, the
parties agree shall be the rights and payments to which the Executive is
entitled in the event of the Executive's termination of employment for "Good
Reason" following a "Change in Control" (as such terms are defined in the CIC
Agreement)).

  



  

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other good and valuable
consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged,
the Executive, Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, and Seller Bank agree as follows:

  



  

1. _Settlement Amount_.

  



  

1.1 _CIC Agreement Amount_. On the Closing Date, provided the
Executive has remained employed with the Seller and Seller Bank to and
including the Closing Date and has executed the release attached as _Exhibit
A_ hereto at least eight days prior to the Closing Date (and any revocation
period has elapsed), Seller shall, or shall cause an affiliate to, pay to the
Executive a lump-sum cash amount equal to the total of $383,629, in full
satisfaction of the payment obligations of Seller and Seller Bank under the
CIC Agreement, less applicable tax withholdings (the total of such sum, the "
_CIC Agreement Amount_ ") with such amount to be further reduced pursuant to
_Section 1.2_ hereof as may be needed.

  



  

   


--- 

 


--- 

    



  

For the avoidance of doubt, the payment of the CIC Agreement Amount under
this Agreement shall not release Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, or Seller Bank,
as applicable, from any of the following obligations: (a) obligations to pay
to the Executive accrued but unpaid wages, and make payments for accrued but
unused vacation, earned up to the Effective Time of the Merger to the extent
required by applicable law; (b) the payment of any of the Executive's vested
benefits under the tax-qualified and non-qualified plans of Seller or Seller
Bank, including any benefits that become vested as a result of the Merger; (c)
obligations regarding accelerated vesting of equity awards and phantom stock
awards, if any, under any equity awards or phantom stock unit awards
granted by Seller to the Executive and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time; (d) the payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to
the Executive's common stock of Seller as contemplated by Section 2.01 of the
Merger Agreement; or (e) rights to indemnification under applicable corporate
law, the organizational documents of Seller or Seller Bank, as an insured
under any director's and officer's liability insurance policy new or
previously in force, or pursuant to Section 5.12 of the Merger Agreement;
provided, however, that any "change of control" benefit provided under any
split dollar plan in force between Executive and Seller or Seller Bank are
hereby waived by Executive in full. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties
to this Agreement acknowledge that the Merger constitutes a "change of
control" for purposes of the Seller Bank 2012 Phantom Stock Unit Award and
Long-Term Incentive Plan, and Seller Bank will pay out all cash amounts under
such agreements at the Closing Date.

  



  

1.2 _Section 280G Cut-Back_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if the CIC Agreement Amount provided for in this
Agreement, together with any other payments which the Executive has the right
to receive from Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, Seller Bank, or any corporation
which is a member of an "affiliated group" (as defined in Code Section
1504(a), without regard to Code Section 1504(b)) of which Buyer, Buyer Bank,
Seller, or Seller Bank is a member, would constitute an "excess parachute
payment" (as defined in Code Section 280G(b)(2)), payments pursuant to this
Agreement shall be reduced to the extent necessary to ensure that no portion
of such payments will be subject to the excise tax imposed by Code Section
4999. It is hereby understood that the CIC Agreement Amount as determined
under this _Section 1.2_ will be subject to further adjustment upon the
consummation of the Merger. Any determination required under this _Section
1.2_ shall be made by Seller and Buyer and their respective tax advisors,
whose determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Executive,
Seller, and Seller Bank, and it is hereby understood that such determination
will follow the same methodology for calculating the Code Section
280G limitation in order to avoid an "excess parachute payment" as provided
in Seller Bank Disclosure Schedule 3.18(f) to the Merger Agreement.

  



  

1.3 _No Further Adjustment_. The parties hereby agree that the
CIC Agreement Amount as determined in the manner provided under  _Section
1.1_ and _Section 1.2_ hereof is final and binding on all parties and shall
not otherwise be subject to further adjustment.

  



  

1.4 _Complete Satisfaction_. In consideration of the payment of the
CIC Agreement Amount and the other provisions of this Agreement,
the Executive, Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, and Seller Bank hereby agree that
effective immediately following the Effective Time of the Merger, the
Executive agrees that the full payment of the CIC Agreement Amount, as
determined in accordance _Section 1.1 _ and _Section 1.2_ , shall be in
complete satisfaction of all rights to payments due to Executive under the CIC
Agreement. 

  



  

2. _Code Section 409A Compliance_. The intent of the parties is that payments under this Agreement either be exempt from or comply with Code Section 409A and the Treasury Regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance therewith. To that end, Executive, Buyer, Seller, and Seller Bank agree that the payment described in _Section_ _1_ is intended to be excepted from compliance with Code Section 409A as a short-term deferral pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4).

  



  

   


--- 

 


--- 

    



  

3. _General_.

  



  

3.1 _Heirs, Successors, and Assigns_. The terms of this Agreement
shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective
heirs, successors, assigns and legal representatives.

  



  

3.2 _Final Agreement_. This Agreement represents the entire
understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all prior understandings, written or oral, except as set forth in a
separate written employment agreement by and between Buyer, Buyer Bank and
the Executive. The terms of this Agreement may be changed, modified, or
discharged only by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties
hereto.

  



  

3.3 _Withholdings_. Seller, Seller Bank, Buyer, and Buyer Bank may
withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such federal, state,
or local taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to applicable law
or regulation.

  



  

3.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed, enforced,
and interpreted in accordance with and governed by the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without reference to its principles of
conflicts of law, except to the extent that federal law shall be deemed to
preempt such state laws.

  



  

3.5 _Regulatory Limitations_. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, neither Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, nor Seller Bank
shall be obligated to make, and Executive shall have no right to receive, any
payment under this Agreement which would violate any law, regulation, or
regulatory order applicable to Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, or Seller Bank, as
applicable, at the time such payment is due, including, without limitation,
Section 1828(k)(1) of Title 12 of the United States Code and any regulation or
order thereunder of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

  



  

3.6 _Voluntary Action and Waiver_. The Executive acknowledges that
by her free and voluntary act of signing below, the Executive agrees to all
of the terms of this Agreement and intends to be legally bound thereby. The
Executive acknowledges that she has been advised to consult with an attorney
prior to executing this Agreement.

  



  

3.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

  



  

4. _Effectiveness_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this Agreement shall be subject to consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, as the same may be amended by the parties thereto in accordance with its terms. In the event the Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason or the Merger does not occur, this Agreement shall be deemed null and void.

the Executive has signed this Agreement, effective as of the date first above
written.

EXHIBIT A

  



  

 _RELEASE OF CLAIMS_

  



  

I, Maria J.C. Aigner, of [City], [County], Massachusetts, (hereinafter, the
"Employee"), in consideration of the Employment Agreements Amount as
described below, on behalf of herself and her heirs and assigns, hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally releases and forever discharges, individually
and collectively, Westfield Financial, Inc., a bank holding company
("Buyer"), Westfield Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer ("Buyer Bank"),
Chicopee Bancorp, Inc., a bank holding company ("Seller"), and Chicopee
Savings Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Seller ("Seller Bank"), their
affiliated companies, and each of their respective officers, directors,
employees, shareholders, representatives, parent companies,
subsidiaries, predecessors, successors, assigns, attorneys and all persons
acting by, through or in concert with them (collectively, the
"Released Parties"), of and from any and all charges, claims, complaints,
demands, liabilities, causes of action, losses, costs or expenses of any kind
whatsoever (including related attorneys' fees and costs), known or unknown,
suspected or unsuspected, that Employee may now have or has ever had against
the Released Parties by reason of any act, omission, transaction, or
event occurring up to and including the date of the signing of this
Agreement.

  



  

This waiver, release and discharge includes without limitation, claims
related to any wrongful or unlawful discharge, discipline or retaliation,
whether express or implied, any promotions or demotions, compensation, the
Seller or Seller Bank's benefit plan(s) and the management thereof,
defamation, slander, libel, invasion of privacy, misrepresentation, fraud,
infliction of emotional distress, stress, breach of any covenant of good
faith and fair dealing, and any other claims relating to the
Employee's employment with the Seller or Seller Bank and the termination
thereof. This waiver, release and discharge further applies but is not
limited to any claims based on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the
Post Civil War Civil Rights Act (41 U.S.C. ss. 1981 - 88), the Civil Rights
Act of 1991, the Equal Pay Act, the Age Discrimination Employment Act, the
Older Workers' Benefit Protection Act, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the
Americans with Disabilities Act, the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Act,
the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Workers Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act, Executive Order 11246, the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, the Family and Medical Leave Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch.
151B (all as they may be amended), and any other applicable federal, state or
local laws, ordinances and regulations including those relating to
discrimination to the extent permitted by law; provided, however, that,
notwithstanding anything in this Release of Claims to the contrary,
this Release of Claims does not apply to any of the items described in the
second paragraph of Section 1.1 of the Settlement Agreement between the
Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, and Seller Bank and the Employee, dated April 4,
2016. Employee expressly waives all claims, including those which she does
not know or suspect to exist in her favor as of the date of this Agreement
against the Released Parties. As used herein, the Employee understand the
word "claims" to include all actions, claims, and grievances, whether actual
or potential, known or unknown, and specifically but not exclusively including
all claims against the Seller or Seller Bank or otherwise arising from
Employee's employment with the Seller Bank, the termination thereof or any
other conduct occurring on or prior to the date the Employee signs this
Release of Claims. All such claims are forever barred by this Release of
Claims whether they arise in contract or tort or under a statute or any other
law.

  



  

   


--- 

 


--- 

    



  

 _CIC AGREEMENT AMOUNT_. In return for Employee's execution of and adherence
to this Release of Claims, the Seller Bank shall pay the Employee the CIC
Agreement Amount, as set forth in the Settlement Agreement between the Buyer,
Buyer Bank, Seller, and Seller Bank and the Employee, dated April 4, 2016, in
the total amount of _____________ ($______). Payment of the CIC
Agreement Amount shall be made in a lump sum subject to usual and customary
deductions required by law and Seller Bank policy.

  



  

 _CONFIDENTIAL TERMS._ Employee and the Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, and Seller
Bank agree that each will keep the contents of this Release of Claims
(including its existence and the terms and provisions hereof) and the
negotiations leading to it completely confidential, that neither will
hereafter publish or disclose any information concerning such matters to
anyone, and that each shall take every reasonable precaution to prevent the
direct or indirect disclosure of such information to third parties, provided
that the foregoing provisions shall not be construed to prevent Employee from
disclosing such matters to her accountant or to prevent the Buyer, Buyer
Bank, Seller, and Seller Bank from disclosing such matters to its accountants,
and provided further that Employee may also make such disclosures as are
finally compelled by law provided Employee gives the Buyer, Buyer Bank,
Seller, and Seller Bank immediate notice of such legal process in order that
the Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, and Seller Bank shall have the opportunity to
object to the disclosure of such information.

  



  

 _INJUNCTIVE RELIEF_. Employee acknowledges and recognizes that a violation
of this Release of Claims and its covenants will cause irreparable damage to
the Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, and Seller Bank and the Buyer, Buyer Bank,
Seller, and Seller Bank will have no adequate remedy at law for such
violation. Accordingly, Employee agrees that the Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller,
and Seller Bank will be entitled, as a matter of right, to an injunction from
any court of competent jurisdiction restraining any further violation of this
Release of Claims or the terms and conditions provided herein. This right to
injunctive relief will be cumulative and in addition to whatever remedies the
parties may otherwise have at law.

  



  

 _CONSIDERATION AND REVOCATION PERIOD_. I acknowledge that I am hereby
advised to consult with an attorney before signing this Release of Claims. I
further understand that I may consider this Release of Claims for up to
twenty-one (21) days before deciding whether to sign it. If I signed this
Release of Claims before the expiration of that twenty-one (21) day period, I
acknowledge that such decision was entirely voluntary. I understand that if I
do not sign and return this Release of Claims to the Seller Bank by the end
of that twenty-one (21) day period, the CIC Agreement Amount described above
will expire. I understand that for a period of seven (7) days after I execute
this Release of Claims, I have the right to revoke it by a written notice to
be received by the Seller Bank by the end of that period. I also understand
that this Release of Claims shall not be effective or enforceable until the
expiration of that seven (7) day period. I further represent and agree that I
have carefully read and fully understand all of the provisions of
this Release of Claims and that I am voluntarily agreeing to those
provisions. I acknowledge that I have not been induced to sign this Release
of Claims by any representatives of any released party other than the CIC
Agreement Amount as stated above.

Employee understands and agrees that Employee has carefully read and fully
understands all of the provisions of this Agreement and knowingly and
voluntarily agrees to all of the terms set forth in this Release of Claims.

Form of Settlement Agreement with Russell J. Omer

  



  

   

 



    

  



    



  

  

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

  



  

This Settlement Agreement (the " _Agreement_ ") is entered into as of April
4, 2016 by and among Russell J. Omer (the " _Executive_ "), Westfield
Financial, Inc., a bank holding company (" _Buyer_ "), Westfield Bank, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer (" _Buyer Bank_ "), Chicopee Bancorp, Inc.,
a bank holding company (" _Seller_ "), and Chicopee Savings Bank, a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Seller (" _Seller Bank_ ").

  



  

WITNESSETH:

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller
are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 4, 2016
(the " _Merger Agreement_ "), and all capitalized terms not defined herein
shall have the meaning set forth in the Merger Agreement; and

  



  

WHEREAS, Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, Seller Bank, and the Executive desire to
enter into this Agreement, which shall supersede the Executive
Employment Agreement by and among Seller and the Executive, dated June 18,
2010, and the Executive Employment Agreement by and among Seller Bank and the
Executive, dated June 18, 2010 (collectively, the " _Employment Agreements_
"), effective immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, and in
lieu of any rights and payments under the Employment Agreements, the
Executive shall be entitled to the rights and payments set forth herein and
shall terminate employment with Seller and Seller Bank (which for the
avoidance of doubt, the parties agree shall be the rights and payments to
which the Executive is entitled in the event of the Executive's termination
of employment without "Cause" or for "Good Reason" following a "Change of
Control" (as such terms are defined in the Employment Agreements) as
contemplated by Sections 11 and 12 of the Employment Agreements).

  



  

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other good and valuable
consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the Executive, Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, and Seller Bank agree
as follows:

  



  

1. _Settlement Amount_.

  



  

1.1 _Employment Agreements Amount_. On the Closing Date,
provided the Executive has remained employed with the Seller and Seller Bank
to and including the Closing Date and has executed the release attached as
_Exhibit A_ hereto at least eight days prior to the Closing Date (and any
revocation period has elapsed), Seller shall, or shall cause an affiliate to,
(a) pay to the Executive a lump-sum cash amount equal to the total of
$642,269, less applicable tax withholdings and (b) provide health and dental
coverage to the Executive for a thirty-six (36) month period commencing on
the Closing Date, with the Executive responsible for the employee portion of
the applicable insurance premium payments (the total of such lump sum and
health and dental coverage, the " _Employment Agreements Amount_ "), in full
satisfaction of the payment obligations of Seller and Seller Bank under the
Employment Agreements. The Employment Agreements Amount shall be subject to
further reduction pursuant to _Section 1.2_ hereof as may be needed.

  



  

   



 



    

  



  

For the avoidance of doubt, the payment of the Employment Agreements Amount
under this Agreement shall not release Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, or Seller
Bank, as applicable, from any of the following obligations: (a) obligations to
pay to the Executive accrued but unpaid wages, and make payments for accrued
but unused vacation, earned up to the Effective Time of the Merger to the
extent required by applicable law, including any benefits that become vested
as a result of the Merger; (b) the payment of any of the Executive's vested
benefits under the tax-qualified and non-qualified plans of Seller or Seller
Bank; (c) obligations regarding accelerated vesting of equity awards and
phantom stock awards, if any, under any equity awards or phantom stock unit
awards granted by Seller to the Executive and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time; (d) the payment of the Merger Consideration
with respect to the Executive's common stock of Seller as contemplated by
Section 2.01 of the Merger Agreement; (e) obligations regarding vested
benefits and benefits which become vested as a result of the Merger under a
supplemental executive retirement plan; or (f) rights to indemnification
under applicable corporate law, the organizational documents of Seller or
Seller Bank, as an insured under any director's and officer's liability
insurance policy new or previously in force, or pursuant to Section 5.12 of
the Merger Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties to this
Agreement acknowledge that the Merger constitutes a "change of control" for
purposes of the Seller Bank Amended and Restated Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan and Seller Bank 2012 Phantom Stock Unit Award and Long-Term
Incentive Plan, and Seller Bank will pay out all cash amounts under such
agreements at the Closing Date.

  



  

1.2 _Section 280G Cut-Back_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if the Employment Agreements Amount provided
for in this Agreement, together with any other payments which the Executive
has the right to receive from Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, Seller Bank, or any
corporation which is a member of an "affiliated group" (as defined in Code
Section 1504(a), without regard to Code Section 1504(b)) of which Buyer,
Buyer Bank, Seller, or Seller Bank is a member, would constitute an
"excess parachute payment" (as defined in Code Section 280G(b)(2)), payments
pursuant to this Agreement shall be reduced to the extent necessary to ensure
that no portion of such payments will be subject to the excise tax imposed by
Code Section 4999. It is hereby understood that the Employment Agreements
Amount as determined under this _Section 1.2_ will be subject to further
adjustment upon the consummation of the Merger. Any determination required
under this _Section 1.2_ shall be made by Seller and Buyer and their
respective tax advisors, whose determination shall be conclusive and binding
upon the Executive, Seller, and Seller Bank, and it is hereby understood that
such determination will follow the same methodology for calculating the Code
Section 280G limitation in order to avoid an "excess parachute payment" as
provided in Seller Bank Disclosure Schedule 3.18(f) to the Merger Agreement.

  



  

1.3 _Section 280G Waiver_. Executive acknowledges and
specifically waives his rights under Section 15 of the Employment Agreements,
including, but not limited to, any right to indemnification for any excise
tax imposed under Code Section 4999.

  



  

1.4 _No Further Adjustment_. The parties hereby agree that the
Employment Agreements Amount as determined in the manner provided under 
_Section 1.1_ and _Section 1.2_ hereof is final and binding on all parties
and shall not otherwise be subject to further adjustment.

  



  

   



 



    

  



  

1.5 _Restrictive Covenants_. In addition to the Employment
Agreements Amount, Buyer shall pay, or cause Buyer Bank to pay, a total
aggregate amount of $675,000, less any applicable tax withholdings, in equal
monthly installments over the two-year period following the Closing Date in
exchange for Executive's adherence to the restrictive covenants contained in
this _Section 1.5_ , with such payments reported to the Executive on a Form
1099-Misc. The Executive hereby covenants and agrees that for a period of
two years following Closing Date, he shall not, without the written consent
of the Buyer, become an officer, employee, consultant, director or trustee of
any savings bank, savings and loan association, savings and loan holding
company, bank or bank holding company, credit union or any direct or indirect
subsidiary or affiliate of any such entity, that entails working within
Hampden county or any other county in which the Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller or
Seller Bank maintains an office as of the Closing Date. Unless he obtains the
prior written consent of the Buyer, the Executive shall keep confidential and
shall refrain from using for the benefit of himself, or any person or entity
other than the Buyer or any entity which is a subsidiary of the Buyer or of
which the Buyer is a subsidiary, any material document or information
obtained from the Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller or Seller Bank concerning their
properties, operations or business (unless such document or information is
readily ascertainable from public or published information or trade
sources or has otherwise been made available to the public through no fault
of his own) until the same becomes so ascertainable or available;  _provided,
however,_ that nothing in this _Section 1.5_ shall prevent the Executive, with
or without the Buyer's consent, from participating in or disclosing documents
or information in connection with any judicial or administrative
investigation, inquiry or proceeding to the extent that such participation or
disclosure is required under applicable law. Further, the Executive hereby
covenants and agrees that, for a period of two year's following the Closing
Date, he shall not, without the written consent of the Company, either
directly or indirectly:

  



  

(a) solicit, offer employment to, or take any other action
intended, or that a reasonable person acting in like circumstances would
expect, to have the effect of causing any officer or employee of the Buyer,
Buyer Bank, Seller or Seller Bank or any of their respective subsidiaries or
affiliates to terminate his or her employment and accept employment or become
affiliated with, or provide services for compensation in any
capacity whatsoever to, any savings bank, savings and loan association, bank,
bank holding company, savings and loan holding company, or other institution
engaged in the business of accepting deposits, making loans or doing business
within the counties specified in this _Section 1.5_ ;

  



  

(b) provide any information, advice or recommendation with
respect to any such officer or employee of any savings bank, savings and loan
company, bank, bank holding company, savings and loan holding company, or
other institution engaged in the business of accepting deposits, making loans
providing wealth management services or doing business within the counties
specified in this _Section 1.5_ ; that is intended, or that a reasonable
person acting in like circumstances would expect, to have the effect of
causing any officer or employee of the Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller or Seller
Bank, or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates to terminate his
or her employment and accept employment or become affiliated with, or provide
services for compensation in any capacity whatsoever to, any savings
bank, savings and loan association, bank, bank holding company, savings and
loan holding company, or other institution engaged in the business of
accepting deposits, making loans or doing business within the county specified
in this _Section 1.5_ ;

  



  

   



 



    

  



  

(c) solicit, provide any information, advice or recommendation or
take any other action intended, or that a reasonable person acting in like
circumstances would expect, to have the effect of causing any customer of the
Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller or Seller Bank or any of their respective
subsidiaries to terminate an existing business or commercial relationship
with any of them.

  



  

The Executive agrees that the relevant public policy and legal aspects of
covenants not to compete have been discussed with him and that every effort
has been made to limit the restrictions placed upon the Executive to those
that are reasonable and necessary to protect Buyer's legitimate
interests. The Executive hereby acknowledges that, based upon his education,
experience, and training, the non-compete and non-solicitation provisions of
this _Section 1.5_ will not prevent him from earning a livelihood and
supporting and his family during the relevant time-period. The existence of a
claim, charge, or cause of action by the Executive against Buyer, Buyer Bank,
Seller or Seller Bank or any of their affiliates shall not constitute a
defense to the enforcement by Buyer or Buyer Bank of the foregoing
restrictive covenants, but such claim, charge, or cause of action shall be
litigated separately. If any restriction set forth in this _Section 1.5_ is
found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it
extends for too long a period of time or over too great a range of activities
or in too broad a geographic area, the court is hereby expressly authorized to
modify this Agreement or to interpret this Agreement to extend only over the
maximum period of time, range of activities, or geographic areas as to which
it may be enforceable.

  



  

1.6 _Complete Satisfaction_. In consideration of the payment of
the Employment Agreements Amount and the other provisions of this
Agreement, the Executive, Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, and Seller Bank hereby
agree that effective immediately following the Effective Time of the Merger,
the Executive agrees that the full payment of the Employment Agreements
Amount, as determined in accordance _Section 1.1_ and _Section 1.2_ , shall
be in complete satisfaction of all rights to payments due to Executive under
the Employment Agreements.

  



  

2. _Code Section 409A Compliance_. The intent of the parties is that payments under this Agreement either be exempt from or comply with Code Section 409A and the Treasury Regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance therewith. To that end, Executive, Buyer, Seller, and Seller Bank agree that the payment described in _Section_ _1_  is intended to be excepted from compliance with Code Section 409A as a short-term deferral pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4).

  



  

3. _General_.

  



  

3.1 _Heirs, Successors, and Assigns_. The terms of this
Agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective heirs,
successors, assigns and legal representatives.

  



  

   



 



    

  



  

3.2 _Final Agreement_. This Agreement represents the entire
understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes all prior understandings, written or oral, except as set forth
in a separate written employment agreement by and between Buyer, Buyer Bank
and the Executive. The terms of this Agreement may be changed, modified, or
discharged only by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties
hereto.

  



  

3.3 _Withholdings_. Seller, Seller Bank, Buyer, and Buyer Bank
may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such federal,
state, or local taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to
applicable law or regulation.

  



  

3.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed,
enforced, and interpreted in accordance with and governed by the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without reference to its principles of
conflicts of law, except to the extent that federal law shall be deemed to
preempt such state laws.

  



  

3.5 _Regulatory Limitations_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, neither Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, nor Seller
Bank shall be obligated to make, and Executive shall have no right to
receive, any payment under this Agreement which would violate any
law, regulation, or regulatory order applicable to Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller,
or Seller Bank, as applicable, at the time such payment is due, including,
without limitation, Section 1828(k)(1) of Title 12 of the United States Code
and any regulation or order thereunder of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation.

  



  

3.6 _Voluntary Action and Waiver_. The Executive acknowledges
that by his free and voluntary act of signing below, the Executive agrees
to all of the terms of this Agreement and intends to be legally bound
thereby. The Executive acknowledges that he has been advised to consult with
an attorney prior to executing this Agreement.

  



  

3.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of

EXHIBIT A

  



  

 _RELEASE OF CLAIMS_

  



  

I, Russell J. Omer, of [City], [County], Massachusetts, (hereinafter, the
"Employee"), in consideration of the Employment Agreements Amount as described
below, on behalf of himself and his heirs and assigns, hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally releases and forever discharges, individually and
collectively, Westfield Financial, Inc., a bank holding company ("Buyer"),
Westfield Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer ("Buyer Bank"), Chicopee
Bancorp, Inc., a bank holding company ("Seller"), and Chicopee Savings Bank,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Seller ("Seller Bank"), their affiliated
companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
shareholders, representatives, parent companies, subsidiaries, predecessors,
successors, assigns, attorneys and all persons acting by, through or in
concert with them (collectively, the "Released Parties"), of and from any and
all charges, claims, complaints, demands, liabilities, causes of action,
losses, costs or expenses of any kind whatsoever (including related
attorneys' fees and costs), known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, that
Employee may now have or has ever had against the Released Parties by reason
of any act, omission, transaction, or event occurring up to and including
the date of the signing of this Agreement.

  



  

This waiver, release and discharge includes without limitation, claims
related to any wrongful or unlawful discharge, discipline or retaliation,
whether express or implied, any promotions or demotions, compensation, the
Seller or Seller Bank's benefit plan(s) and the management thereof,
defamation, slander, libel, invasion of privacy, misrepresentation, fraud,
infliction of emotional distress, stress, breach of any covenant of good
faith and fair dealing, and any other claims relating to the Employee's
employment with the Seller or Seller Bank and the termination thereof. This
waiver, release and discharge further applies but is not limited to any claims
based on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Post Civil War Civil
Rights Act (41 U.S.C. ss. 1981 - 88), the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Equal
Pay Act, the Age Discrimination Employment Act, the Older Workers' Benefit
Protection Act, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with
Disabilities Act, the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Act, the Fair Labor
Standards Act, the Workers Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act,
Executive Order 11246, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, the Family and Medical Leave Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B (all as they
may be amended), and any other applicable federal, state or local laws,
ordinances and regulations including those relating to discrimination to the
extent permitted by law; provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything in
this Release of Claims to the contrary, this Release of Claims does not apply
to any of the items described in the second paragraph of Section 1.1 of the
Settlement Agreement between the Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, and Seller Bank
and the Employee, dated April 4, 2016. Employee expressly waives all claims,
including those which he does not know or suspect to exist in his favor as of
the date of this Agreement against the Released Parties. As used herein, the
Employee understand the word "claims" to include all actions, claims, and
grievances, whether actual or potential, known or unknown, and specifically
but not exclusively including all claims against the Seller or Seller Bank or
otherwise arising from Employee's employment with the Seller Bank, the
termination thereof or any other conduct occurring on or prior to the
date the Employee signs this Release of Claims. All such claims are forever
barred by this Release of Claims whether they arise in contract or tort or
under a statute or any other law.

  



  

   



 



    



  

 _EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS AMOUNT_.  In return for Employee's execution of and
adherence to this Release of Claims, the Seller Bank shall pay the Employee
the Employment Agreements Amount, as set forth in the Settlement Agreement
between the Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, and Seller Bank and the Employee,
dated April 4, 2016, in the total amount of _____________ ($______). Payment
of the Employment Agreements Amount shall be made in a lump sum subject to
usual and customary deductions required by law and Seller Bank policy.

  



  

 _CONFIDENTIAL TERMS._ Employee and the Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, and
Seller Bank agree that each will keep the contents of this Release of Claims
(including its existence and the terms and provisions hereof) and the
negotiations leading to it completely confidential, that neither
will hereafter publish or disclose any information concerning such matters to
anyone, and that each shall take every reasonable precaution to prevent the
direct or indirect disclosure of such information to third parties, provided
that the foregoing provisions shall not be construed to prevent Employee from
disclosing such matters to his accountant or to prevent the Buyer, Buyer Bank,
Seller, and Seller Bank from disclosing such matters to its accountants, and
provided further that Employee may also make such disclosures as are finally
compelled by law provided Employee gives the Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, and
Seller Bank immediate notice of such legal process in order that the Buyer,
Buyer Bank, Seller, and Seller Bank shall have the opportunity to object to
the disclosure of such information.

  



  

 _INJUNCTIVE RELIEF_. Employee acknowledges and recognizes that a violation
of this Release of Claims and its covenants will cause irreparable damage to
the Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, and Seller Bank and the Buyer, Buyer Bank,
Seller, and Seller Bank will have no adequate remedy at law for such
violation. Accordingly, Employee agrees that the Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller,
and Seller Bank will be entitled, as a matter of right, to an injunction from
any court of competent jurisdiction restraining any further violation of this
Release of Claims or the terms and conditions provided herein. This right to
injunctive relief will be cumulative and in addition to whatever remedies the
parties may otherwise have at law.

  



  

 _CONSIDERATION AND REVOCATION PERIOD_. I acknowledge that I am hereby
advised to consult with an attorney before signing this Release of Claims. I
further understand that I may consider this Release of Claims for up to
twenty-one (21) days before deciding whether to sign it. If I signed this
Release of Claims before the expiration of that twenty-one (21) day period, I
acknowledge that such decision was entirely voluntary. I understand that if I
do not sign and return this Release of Claims to the Seller Bank by the end of
that twenty-one (21) day period, the Employment Agreements Amount described
above will expire. I understand that for a period of seven (7) days after I
execute this Release of Claims, I have the right to revoke it by a written
notice to be received by the Seller Bank by the end of that period. I also
understand that this Release of Claims shall not be effective or enforceable
until the expiration of that seven (7) day period. I further represent and
agree that I have carefully read and fully understand all of the provisions
of this Release of Claims and that I am voluntarily agreeing to
those provisions. I acknowledge that I have not been induced to sign this
Release of Claims by any representatives of any released party other than the
Employment Agreements Amount as stated above.

  



   



 



    



  

  

Employee understands and agrees that Employee has carefully read and fully
understands all of the provisions of this Agreement and knowingly and
voluntarily agrees to all of the terms set forth in this Release of Claims.
Employee knowingly and voluntarily intends to be legally bound by the same.

Form of Settlement Agreement with Guida R. Sajdak

  



  

   

 



    

  



    

  

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

  



  

This Settlement Agreement (the " _Agreement_ ") is entered into as of April
4, 2016 by and among Guida R. Sajdak (the " _Executive_ "), Westfield
Financial, Inc., a bank holding company (" _Buyer_ "), Westfield Bank, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer (" _Buyer Bank_ "), Chicopee Bancorp, Inc.,
a bank holding company (" _Seller_ "), and Chicopee Savings Bank, a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Seller (" _Seller Bank_ ").

  



  

WITNESSETH:

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller
are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 4, 2016
(the " _Merger Agreement_ "), and all capitalized terms not defined herein
shall have the meaning set forth in the Merger Agreement; and

  



  

WHEREAS, Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, Seller Bank, and the Executive desire to
enter into this Agreement, which shall supersede the Executive
Employment Agreement by and among Seller, Seller Bank and the Executive,
dated October 28, 2015 (the " _Employment Agreement_ "), effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, and in lieu of any
rights and payments under the Employment Agreement, the Executive shall be
entitled to the rights and payments set forth herein irrespective of whether
the Executive terminates employment (which for the avoidance of doubt, the
parties agree shall be the rights and payments to which the Executive is
entitled in the event of the Executive's termination of employment without
"Cause" or for "Good Reason" following a "Change of Control" (as such terms
are defined in the Employment Agreement) as contemplated by Sections 11 and
12 of the Employment Agreement).

  



  

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other good and valuable
consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the Executive, Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, and Seller Bank agree
as follows:

  



  

1. _Settlement Amount_.

  



  

1.1 _Employment Agreement Amount_. On the Closing Date,
provided the Executive has remained employed with the Seller and Seller Bank
to and including the Closing Date, Seller shall, or shall cause an affiliate
to, pay to the Executive a lump-sum cash amount equal to the total of
$406,394, in full satisfaction of the payment obligations of Seller and Seller
Bank under the Employment Agreement, less applicable tax withholdings (the
total of such sum, the " _Employment Agreement Amount_ ") with such amount to
be further reduced pursuant to _Section 1.2_ hereof as may be needed.

  



  

For the avoidance of doubt, the payment of the Employment Agreement Amount
under this Agreement shall not release Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, or
Seller Bank, as applicable, from any of the following obligations: (a)
obligations to pay to the Executive accrued but unpaid wages, and make
payments for accrued but unused vacation, earned up to the Effective Time of
the Merger to the extent required by applicable law; (b) the payment of any
of the Executive's vested benefits under the tax-qualified and non-qualified
plans of Seller or Seller Bank, including any benefits that become vested as
a result of the Merger; (c) obligations regarding accelerated vesting of
equity awards and phantom stock awards, if any, under any equity awards or
phantom stock unit awards granted by Seller to the Executive and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time; (d) the payment of the Merger
Consideration with respect to the Executive's common stock of Seller as
contemplated by Section 2.01 of the Merger Agreement; or (e) rights to
indemnification under applicable corporate law, the organizational documents
of Seller or Seller Bank, as an insured under any director's and officer's
liability insurance policy new or previously in force, or pursuant to Section
5.12 of the Merger Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties to this
Agreement acknowledge that the Merger constitutes a "change of control" for
purposes of Seller Bank 2012 Phantom Stock Unit Award and Long-Term Incentive
Plan, and Seller Bank will pay out all cash amounts under such agreements at
the Closing Date.

  



  

   



 



    



  

1.2 _Section 280G Cut-Back_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if the Employment Agreement Amount provided for in
this Agreement, together with any other payments which the Executive has the
right to receive from Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, Seller Bank, or any
corporation which is a member of an "affiliated group" (as defined in Code
Section 1504(a), without regard to Code Section 1504(b)) of which Buyer,
Buyer Bank, Seller, or Seller Bank is a member, would constitute an
"excess parachute payment" (as defined in Code Section 280G(b)(2)), payments
pursuant to this Agreement shall be reduced to the extent necessary to ensure
that no portion of such payments will be subject to the excise tax imposed by
Code Section 4999. It is hereby understood that the Employment Agreement
Amount as determined under this _Section 1.2_ will be subject to further
adjustment upon the consummation of the Merger. Any determination required
under this _Section 1.2_ shall be made by Seller and Buyer and their
respective tax advisors, whose determination shall be conclusive and binding
upon the Executive, Seller, and Seller Bank, and it is hereby understood that
such determination will follow the same methodology for calculating the Code
Section 280G limitation in order to avoid an "excess parachute payment" as
provided in Seller Bank Disclosure Schedule 3.18(f) to the Merger Agreement.

  



  

1.3 _No Further Adjustment_. The parties hereby agree that the
Employment Agreement Amount as determined in the manner provided under 
_Section 1.1_ and _Section 1.2_ hereof is final and binding on all parties
and shall not otherwise be subject to further adjustment.

  



  

1.4 _Employment with Buyer_. Buyer and Buyer Bank anticipate
that Executive will be an at-will employee of Buyer and/or Buyer Bank
following the Closing Date as Executive Vice President, Chief Risk Officer at
a base salary rate of $210,000 per year.

  



  

1.5 _Complete Satisfaction_. In consideration of the payment
of the Employment Agreement Amount, the employment by Buyer and/or Buyer
Bank following the Closing Date and the other provisions of this Agreement,
the Executive, Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, and Seller Bank hereby agree that
effective immediately following the Effective Time of the Merger, the
Executive agrees that the full payment of the Employment Agreement Amount, as
determined in accordance _Section 1.1_ and _Section 1.2_ , shall be in
complete satisfaction of all rights to payments due to Executive under the
Employment Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, to the extent that the loyalty and confidentiality provisions in
Section 10 of the Employment Agreement are not superseded by a separate
written employment agreement by and between the Buyer, Buyer Bank and the
Executive, these provisions shall survive termination of the Employment
Agreement.

  



  

   



 



    



  

2. _Code Section 409A Compliance_. The intent of the parties is that payments under this Agreement either be exempt from or comply with Code Section 409A and the Treasury Regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance therewith. To that end, Executive, Buyer, Seller, and Seller Bank agree that the payment described in _Section_ _1 _ is intended to be excepted from compliance with Code Section 409A as a short-term deferral pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4).

  



  

3. _General_.

  



  

3.1 _Heirs, Successors, and Assigns_. The terms of this
Agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective heirs,
successors, assigns and legal representatives.

  



  

3.2 _Final Agreement_. This Agreement represents the entire
understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes all prior understandings, written or oral, except as set forth
in a separate written employment agreement by and between Buyer, Buyer Bank
and the Executive. The terms of this Agreement may be changed, modified, or
discharged only by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties
hereto.

  



  

3.3 _Withholdings_.  Seller, Seller Bank, Buyer, and Buyer Bank
may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such federal,
state, or local taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to
applicable law or regulation.

  



  

3.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed,
enforced, and interpreted in accordance with and governed by the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without reference to its principles of
conflicts of law, except to the extent that federal law shall be deemed to
preempt such state laws.

  



  

3.5 _Regulatory Limitations_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, neither Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, nor Seller
Bank shall be obligated to make, and Executive shall have no right to
receive, any payment under this Agreement which would violate any
law, regulation, or regulatory order applicable to Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller,
or Seller Bank, as applicable, at the time such payment is due, including,
without limitation, Section 1828(k)(1) of Title 12 of the United States Code
and any regulation or order thereunder of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation.

  



  

3.6 _Voluntary Action and Waiver_. The Executive acknowledges
that by her free and voluntary act of signing below, the Executive agrees
to all of the terms of this Agreement and intends to be legally bound
thereby. The Executive acknowledges that she has been advised to consult with
an attorney prior to executing this Agreement.

  



  

3.7 _Counterparts_.  This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

  



  

4. _Effectiveness_.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this Agreement shall be subject to consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, as the same may be amended by the parties thereto in accordance with its terms. In the event the Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason or the Merger does not occur, this Agreement shall be deemed null and void.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other good and valuable

acknowledged, the Executive, Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, and Seller Bank agree
as follows:

  



  

1. _Settlement Amount_.

Section 280G limitation in order to avoid an "excess parachute payment" as
provided in Seller Bank Disclosure Schedule 3.18(f) to the Merger Agreement.

  



  

1.3 _No Further Adjustment_. The parties hereby agree that the
CIC Agreement Amount as determined in the manner provided under _Section
1.1_ and _Section 1.2_ hereof is final and binding on all parties and shall
not otherwise be subject to further adjustment.

that Executive will be an at-will employee of Buyer and/or Buyer Bank
following the Closing Date as Senior Vice President of Retail Banking at a
base salary rate of $175,000 per year.

  



  

1.5 _Complete Satisfaction_. In consideration of the payment
of the CIC Agreement Amount, the employment by Buyer and/or Buyer Bank
following the Closing Date and the other provisions of this Agreement, the
Executive, Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, and Seller Bank hereby agree that
effective immediately following the Effective Time of the Merger, the
Executive agrees that the full payment of the CIC Agreement Amount, as
determined in accordance _Section 1.1_ and _Section 1.2_ , shall be in
complete satisfaction of all rights to payments due to Executive under the
CIC Agreement.

  



  

2. _Code Section 409A Compliance_. The intent of the parties is that payments under this Agreement either be exempt from or comply with Code Section 409A and the Treasury Regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance therewith. To that end, Executive, Buyer, Seller, and Seller Bank agree that the payment described in _Section_ _1_  is intended to be excepted from compliance with Code Section 409A as a short-term deferral pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4).

  



  

   



 



    



  

3. _General_.

  



  

3.1 _Heirs, Successors, and Assigns_. The terms of this
Agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective heirs,
successors, assigns and legal representatives.

  



  

3.2 _Final Agreement_. This Agreement represents the entire
understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes all prior understandings, written or oral, except as set forth
in a separate written employment agreement by and between Buyer, Buyer Bank
and the Executive. The terms of this Agreement may be changed, modified, or
discharged only by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties
hereto.

  



  

3.3 _Withholdings_.  Seller, Seller Bank, Buyer, and Buyer Bank
may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such federal,
state, or local taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to
applicable law or regulation.

  



  

3.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed,
enforced, and interpreted in accordance with and governed by the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without reference to its principles of
conflicts of law, except to the extent that federal law shall be deemed to
preempt such state laws.

  



  

3.5 _Regulatory Limitations_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, neither Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller, nor Seller
Bank shall be obligated to make, and Executive shall have no right to
receive, any payment under this Agreement which would violate any
law, regulation, or regulatory order applicable to Buyer, Buyer Bank, Seller,
or Seller Bank, as applicable, at the time such payment is due, including,
without limitation, Section 1828(k)(1) of Title 12 of the United States Code
and any regulation or order thereunder of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation.

  



  

3.6 _Voluntary Action and Waiver_. The Executive acknowledges
that by her free and voluntary act of signing below, the Executive agrees
to all of the terms of this Agreement and intends to be legally bound
thereby. The Executive acknowledges that she has been advised to consult with
an attorney prior to executing this Agreement.

  



  

3.7 _Counterparts_.  This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
