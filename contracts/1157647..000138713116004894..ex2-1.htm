shall be made by the court or arbitrator, as applicable. In the event of a settlement pursuant to a settlement agreement, any indemnification
payment under this section 19 shall be made only after a determination by the members of the Board (other than the Executive and
any other member of the Board to which the Executive is related by blood or marriage) that the Executive has acted in good faith
and that such indemnification is in the best interests of the Bank. For purposes of this Agreement, any such indemnification payments
will occur promptly following a request therefor, and in any event not later than the last day of the calendar year following the
calendar year in which the indemnified expense is incurred or in which the Executive&rsquo;s legal right thereto is finally determined.</P>
