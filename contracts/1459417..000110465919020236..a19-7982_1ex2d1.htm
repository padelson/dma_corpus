 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION**

 



 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION (this " _Agreement_ ") is
dated as of April 7, 2019, among 2U, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_
"), Skywalker Purchaser, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Purchaser_ "), Skywalker Sub, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Sub_ "),
Trilogy Education Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "),
and Fortis Advisors LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "
_Stockholder Representative_ ").

 



 

WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, each of (i) the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and Sub,
(ii) the sole member of Purchaser and (iii) the Board of Directors of the
Company (the " _Company Board_ ") have approved this Agreement and the
acquisition of the Company by Parent (including the Mergers) on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, (a) Sub will merge with and into the Company, upon which: (i) the
separate corporate existence of Sub will cease; and (ii) the Company will
continue as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
(the " _First Merger_ "); and (b) immediately following the First Merger, the
Company, as the surviving corporation of the First Merger, will merge with and
into Purchaser, upon which: (i) the separate corporate existence of the
Company will cease; and (ii) Purchaser will continue as the surviving company
and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the " _Second Merger_ " and, together
with the First Merger, the " _Mergers_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition
to the willingness of the Company, Parent, Purchaser and Sub to enter into
this Agreement, (i) Parent and the Stockholders identified therein have
executed and delivered Stockholder Support Agreements, dated as of the date
hereof (collectively, the " _Stockholder Support Agreement_ ") and (ii) each
Key Employee has entered into an employment agreement with Parent or one of
its affiliates (collectively, the " _Employment Agreements_ "), which
Employment Agreements shall become effective as of the Closing;

 



 

WHEREAS, each of the parties intends that, (i) for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, the Mergers, taken together, constitute an integrated plan described
in Rev. Rul. 2001-46, 2001-2 C.B. 321 (the " _Integrated Transaction_ "), (ii)
the Integrated Transaction will qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ ") and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder to which
each of Parent and the Company are to be parties under Section 368(b) of the
Code and (iii) this Agreement is intended to be, and is hereby adopted as, a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (clauses (i), (ii) and (iii),
collectively, the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ "); and

     

 

 



 

WHEREAS, Parent, Purchaser, Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Mergers and also to prescribe various conditions to the Mergers.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE I _

SECTION 1.01 _The Mergers_.

 



 

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware,
as amended (the " _DGCL_ ") and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, as
amended (the " _DLLCA_ "), (i) at the First Effective Time, Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company and, as a result of the First Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease, and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation of the First Merger and as a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent (the " _First Surviving Corporation_ ") and (ii)
immediately thereafter, and as part of the same plan, at the Second Effective
Time, the First Surviving Corporation shall be merged with and into Purchaser
and, as a result of Second Merger, the separate existence of the First
Surviving Corporation shall cease and Purchaser shall continue as the
surviving company and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the " _Surviving
Company_ ") and continue to be disregarded as an entity separate from Parent
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The First Merger shall be effected
pursuant to Section 251 of the DGCL and shall have the effects set forth in
the applicable provisions of the DGCL, and the Second Merger shall be effected
pursuant to Section 264 of the DGCL and Section 18-209 of the DLLCA. Without

under the DGCL, and (y) at the Second Effective Time, all of the property,
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the First Surviving
Corporation and Purchaser shall vest in the Surviving Company, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the First Surviving Corporation and Purchaser shall
become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company, all as
provided under the DGCL and the DLLCA.

 



 

(b) At the First Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without the
necessity of further action by the Company, Sub or any other person, the
certificate of incorporation of the First Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated in the form of the certificate of incorporation of Sub,
as in effect immediately prior to the First Effective Time, and as so amended,
shall be the certificate of incorporation of the First Surviving Corporation
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.
In addition, the Company and the First Surviving Corporation shall take all
necessary action such that, at the First Effective Time, the bylaws of the
First Surviving Corporation shall be amended so as to read in their entirety
as the bylaws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the First Effective
Time and, as amended, such bylaws shall be the bylaws of the First Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.

 



     

 

 



 

(c) Subject to Section 6.07, (i) the certificate of formation of the Surviving
Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Second Effective Time, shall be
the certificate of formation of the Surviving Company at the Second Effective
Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with the DLLC and as provided in
such certificate of formation and (ii) the limited liability company agreement
of the Surviving Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Second
Effective Time, shall be the limited liability company agreement of the
Surviving Company at the Second Effective Time, until thereafter amended in
accordance with the DLLC and as provided in such limited liability company
agreement.

 



 

(d) _Directors and Officers_.

 



 

(i) At the First Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without the
necessity of further action by the Company, Sub or any other person, the
directors of Sub immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall become
the directors of the First Surviving Corporation, each to hold office, from
and after the First Effective Time, in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the First Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified,
or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the First Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(ii) The officers of Sub immediately prior to the First Effective Time, from
and after the First Effective Time, shall continue as the officers of the
First Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the First Surviving Corporation
until their respective successors shall have been duly elected, designated or
qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the First Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

(iii) At the Second Effective Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and without
the necessity of further action by Purchaser, the First Surviving Corporation
or any other person, the managers of Purchaser immediately prior to the Second
Effective Time shall become the managers of the Surviving Company, each to
hold office, from and after the Second Effective Time, in accordance with the
certificate of formation and limited liability company operating agreement of
the Surviving Company until their respective successors shall have been duly
elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the certificate of formation and limited liability
company operating agreement of the Surviving Company.

 



 

(iv) The officers of Purchaser immediately prior to the Second Effective Time,
from and after the Second Effective Time, shall continue as the officers of
the Surviving Company, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate
of formation and limited liability company operating agreement of the

company operating agreement of the Surviving Company.

 



 

(e) If, at any time after the Second Effective Time, the Surviving Company
shall determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be advised, that any deeds,

of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in
the Surviving Company its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of either of the First Surviving Corporation or
Purchaser acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Company as a result of,
or in connection with, the Second Merger or otherwise to carry out this
Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Company shall be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the
First Surviving Corporation or Purchaser, all such deeds, bills of sale,
instruments of conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such
other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm any and all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights,
properties or assets in the Surviving Company or otherwise to carry out this
Agreement.

that by their nature are to be satisfied by deliveries made at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by Law)
thereof at the Closing), at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 555 Eleventh

SECTION 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 



 

(a) At the First Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without any
further action on the part of any party hereto or any holder of any shares of
Company Capital Stock or any shares of capital stock of Sub:

 



 

(i) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective
Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share, par value $0.001 per share, of common stock of the First

(ii) _Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of
Company Capital Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent, Purchaser or Sub
immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. Each
share of Company Capital Stock owned by a Company Subsidiary or Parent
Subsidiary, if any, immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be
converted into such number of shares of common stock of the First Surviving
Corporation, such that each such Company Subsidiary or Parent Subsidiary, as
applicable, owns the same percentage of the outstanding capital stock of the
First Surviving Corporation immediately following the First Effective Time as
such Company Subsidiary or such Parent Subsidiary, as applicable, owned in the
Company immediately prior to the First Effective Time, and no consideration
shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

the Surviving Company and (ii) all shares of common stock of the First
Surviving Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second
Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist without any consideration being payable

(c) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any shares of Company Capital Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the First Effective Time and that are held by a holder
who has not voted to adopt this Agreement or consented thereto in writing, has
the right to demand and has properly demanded payment for and an appraisal of
such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") and
perfected such holders demand for appraisal rights with respect to such
shares (such shares, " _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the applicable portion of the Closing Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 2.01(a)(iii) or Section 2.01(a)(iv), but rather such
holder shall be entitled only to payment of the appraisal value of such
Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262. At the First Effective Time,
all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except rights afforded to
holders of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section
262\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder fails to perfect or
otherwise, prior to the judicial appraisal determination, waives, withdraws or
loses the right to appraisal under Section 262 (whether occurring before, at
or after the First Effective Time) or if a court of competent jurisdiction
determines that such holder is not entitled to relief provided by Section
2.02, then the rights of such holder under Section 262 shall cease and each
such Appraisal Share shall be deemed to have been converted as of the First
Effective Time (" _Converted Appraisal Shares_ ") into, and shall have become
exchangeable solely for, the right to receive (without interest thereon) the
applicable portion of the Closing Merger Consideration as provided in Section
2.01(a)(iii) or Section 2.01(a)(iv), plus any amounts or other consideration,
if any, to be paid in respect of Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement
(including Section 2.02(d), Section 6.09(f) or Section 9.07) or the Escrow
Agreement. The Company shall serve prompt written notice to Parent of any
written demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company
Capital Stock, any attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments relating to stockholders rights of appraisal under the DGCL, in
each case, received by the Company in writing prior to the Closing, and the
Company shall provide Parent the opportunity to reasonably participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the First
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. The Company shall enforce
to the extent necessary any contractual waivers that any holder of shares of
Company Capital Stock may have granted regarding appraisal rights that would
apply to the First Merger or otherwise with respect to the Transactions.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if there are
Appraisal Shares at Closing, Parent may reduce the amount of any payment to
the Exchange Agent or the Escrow Agent at the Closing by an amount equal to
the consideration otherwise due to such Appraisal Shares pursuant to Section
2.01(a) (and subsequently make payment to the Exchange Agent or Escrow Agent
for any Converted Appraisal Shares).

 



     

 

 



 

SECTION 2.02 _Merger Consideration Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) _Estimated Price Components._ Not less than five (5) Business Days prior
to the anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a
certificate (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ") prepared in good faith
(and in consultation with Parent), and signed on behalf of the Company by the
chief financial officer of the Company, setting forth in reasonable detail
(including all work sheets, account reconciliations and roll-forward schedules
used in the preparation of the estimates reflected in the Estimated Closing
Statement, and, promptly upon request, other reasonable supporting
documentation showing the calculation of such estimates) the Companys best
estimates of (i) the estimated amount of Company Cash and Cash Equivalents as
of the Close of Business on the Closing Calculation Date (such estimate,
subject to the last sentence of this Section 2.02(a), the " _Estimated Cash_
"), (ii) the estimated amount of Indebtedness outstanding as of the Close of
Business on the Closing Calculation Date (such estimate, subject to the last
sentence of this Section 2.02(a), the " _Estimated Indebtedness_ "), (iii) the
estimated amount of Deferred Revenue as of the Close of Business on the
Closing Calculation Date (such estimate, subject to the last sentence of this
Section 2.02(a), the " _Estimated Deferred Revenue_ "), (iv) the estimated
amount of Transaction Expenses as of the Close of Business on the Closing
Calculation Date, including, for the avoidance of doubt, all amounts for
Transaction Expenses that will become payable in connection with the
consummation of the Mergers on the Closing Date (such estimate, subject to the
last sentence of this Section 2.02(a), the " _Estimated Transaction Expenses_
"), (v) the estimated Net Working Capital as of the Close of Business on the
Closing Calculation Date (such estimate, subject to the last sentence of this
Section 2.02(a), the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ " and, together with
the Estimated Cash, Estimated Indebtedness, Estimated Deferred Revenue and
Estimated Transaction Expenses, " _Estimated Price Components_ ") and (vi)
based on the Estimated Price Components, a calculation of the Closing Merger
Consideration, in each case prepared on a basis consistent with the Balance
Sheet Principles. In the event that Parent notifies the Company prior to the
Closing that Parent in good faith disputes the Companys estimate of any
Estimated Price Component, then the Company shall consider in good faith to
resolve any such dispute as promptly as practicable, and, if so resolved,
modify the Estimated Price Components as appropriate to reflect any agreed
adjustments thereto, and the Estimated Price Components (and corresponding
calculation of the Closing Merger Consideration) shall be deemed to reflect
any such agreed modifications; _provided_ , that the Closing shall not be
delayed in the event of any dispute about such Estimated Price Components.

 



 

(b) _Closing Price Components_. As promptly as practicable, but in any case no
later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause to be
prepared in accordance with the Balance Sheet Principles, signed on behalf of
Parent by a duly authorized officer of Parent and delivered to the Stockholder
Representative a closing statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") and a
certificate based on such Closing Statement setting forth Parents good faith
calculation of (i) the Company Cash and Cash Equivalents as of the Close of
Business on the Closing Calculation Date (" _Closing Cash_ "), (ii) the amount
of Indebtedness outstanding as of the Close of Business on the Closing
Calculation Date (" _Closing Indebtedness_ "), (iii) the amount of Deferred
Revenue as of the Close of Business on the Closing Calculation Date (the "
_Closing Deferred Revenue_ "), (iv) the Transaction Expenses as of the Close
of Business on the Closing Calculation Date, including, for the avoidance of
doubt, all amounts for Transaction Expenses that will become payable in
connection with the consummation of the Mergers on the Closing Date ("
_Closing Transaction Expenses_ "), (v) Net Working Capital as of the Close of
Business on the Closing Calculation Date (the " _Closing Net Working Capital_
" and, together with the Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Deferred
Revenue and Closing Transaction Expenses, the " _Price_

 



     

 

 



 

 _Components_ "), in each case calculated in accordance with the Balance Sheet
Principles and (vi) a calculation of the Final Merger Consideration. If Parent
fails to deliver the Closing Statement within ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, then the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to
specific performance pursuant to Section 10.09 to cause Parent to promptly
deliver the Closing Statement pursuant to this Section 2.02(b).

 



 

(c) _Disputes_. (i) If the Stockholder Representative disagrees with the
Closing Statement or Parents calculation of Closing Cash, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Deferred Revenue, Closing Transaction Expenses or
Closing Net Working Capital in the Closing Statement, the Stockholder
Representative may, within forty-five (45) days after receipt by the
Stockholder Representative of the Closing Statement and such calculations,
deliver a notice (if timely delivered in accordance with this sentence, a "
_Disagreement Notice_ ") to Parent providing reasonable detail of the reason
for any disagreement and setting forth the Stockholder Representatives
calculation of such disputed amount, which Disagreement Notice shall set forth
in reasonable detail the items contained in the Closing Statement that the
Stockholder Representative disputes in good faith and the reason for disputing
such disputed item; provided that the Disagreement Notice may only include
disputes (and changes to the Price Components may only be) based on (A) a
failure of the Price Components to be determined in accordance with this
Agreement, the Balance Sheet Principles or the applicable defined terms of (or
incorporated into) the Price Components or (B) mathematical errors in the
Closing Statement. The Stockholder Representative shall be deemed to have
agreed with all items and amounts contained in the Closing Statement that are
not properly disputed in a timely delivered Disagreement Notice and (subject
to any such disputes) the calculation of Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness,
Closing Transaction Expenses and Closing Net Working Capital delivered
pursuant to Section 2.02(b).

 



 

(ii) In connection with the determination of the Price Components pursuant to
Section 2.02(b), during the forty-five (45)-day period following the
Stockholder Representatives receipt of the Closing Statement, Parent shall
afford, and shall cause the Surviving Company to afford, to the Stockholder
Representative and its Representatives, at the Stockholder Representatives
expense (on behalf of the Securityholders) and upon reasonable request,
reasonable access during Parents normal business hours (or such other times
as the parties may agree) to the appropriate personnel, outside advisors,
books and records and other information (including, working papers) of Parent
and Parents independent accountant as they may reasonably require for the
purposes of resolving any disputes or responding to any matters or inquiries
raised concerning the Closing Statement or the calculation of the Price
Components (subject to the execution of customary work paper access letters if
requested by Parents accountant).

 



 

(iii) If a Disagreement Notice is delivered in accordance with this Section
2.02(c), the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall, during the thirty
(30)-day period following such delivery, seek in good faith to reach agreement
on the properly disputed items or amounts in order to determine, as may be
required, the amount of each Price Component subject to such Disagreement
Notice and any written resolutions, signed by each of Parent and the
Stockholder Representative, of such disputed items or amounts shall be final,
conclusive and binding, upon Parent, the Stockholder Representative and the
Securityholders. At the end of such period, if the Stockholder Representative
and Parent are unable to reach such agreement, they shall as promptly as
practicable thereafter cause FTI Consulting, Inc. (the " _Designated Referee_
"), or if the Designated Referee is unwilling or unable to serve in such
capacity, such other nationally

 



     

 

 



 

recognized independent public accounting firm or financial consulting firm as
shall be agreed upon in writing by the Stockholder Representative and Parent
(such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (the
Designated Referee or such other nationally recognized independent accounting
firm or financial consulting firm engaged pursuant to this Section
2.02(c)(iii), the " _Referee_ "). The Stockholder Representative and Parent
shall enter into a customary engagement letter with the Referee and instruct
the Referee to review the relevant portions of this Agreement, the Closing
Statement and the properly disputed items or amounts for the purpose of
calculating the Price Components (and Parent shall not advocate any positions
more adverse to Securityholders than the amounts reflected in the Closing
Statement and the Stockholder Representative shall not advocate any positions
more adverse to Parent than the amounts reflected in the Disagreement Notice).
In making such calculation, the Referee shall consider only those items or
amounts in the Closing Statement, and Parents calculation of the Price
Components, as to which the Stockholder Representative has properly disagreed
in a Disagreement Notice and which have not been resolved pursuant to the
first sentence of this Section 2.02(c)(iii), and shall apply the relevant
provisions of this Agreement to such properly disputed amounts. The
Stockholder Representative and Parent shall instruct the Referee to deliver to
the Stockholder Representative and Parent, as promptly as practicable (but in
no event later than thirty (30) days from the date of engagement of the
Referee), a report setting forth its calculation (in accordance with this
Section 2.02) of the applicable Price Components; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Referee may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value claimed by a party for such item or less than the smallest value claimed
by a party for such item, in the case of Parent, in the Closing Statement, or
in the case of the Stockholder Representative, in the Disagreement Notice.
Such report shall be final and binding upon the parties (and the
Securityholders) and non-appealable with respect to the determination of the
Price Components and any adjustments to the Merger Consideration pursuant to
this Section 2.02(c) absent fraud, bad faith or manifest error. The costs and
expenses of the Referee shall be borne in the same proportion that the
aggregate dollar amount of such remaining disputed items so submitted to the
Referee that are unsuccessfully disputed by Parent, on the one hand, and the
Stockholder Representative, on the other hand, as finally determined by the
Referee, bears to the total dollar amount of such remaining disputed items so
submitted.

 



 

(iv) The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Referee shall be limited
to (A) whether the Price Components reflected in the Closing Statement (in
each case, as adjusted to reflect any agreements between Parent and
Stockholder Representative) were calculated in accordance with this Agreement,
including the Balance Sheet Principles and the applicable defined terms of (or
incorporated into) the Price Components with respect to the matters that were
submitted for resolution to the Referee and (B) whether there were
mathematical errors in the Closing Statement with respect to such Price
Components. The Referee is not authorized to, and shall not, make any other
determination, including any determination with respect to any matter included
in the Closing Statement or the Disagreement Notice that was not submitted for
resolution to the Referee.

 



 

(d) _Final Merger Consideration_. Upon final resolution of the Price
Components in accordance with Section 2.02(b) and (c), the parties shall
calculate the Final Merger Consideration. " _Final Merger Consideration_ "
means, consideration in an amount equal to the (a) sum of (i) the Base
Consideration, (ii) the Closing Cash, (iii) the Aggregate Option Exercise
Price and (iv) the amount, if any, by which the Closing Net Working Capital is
over the Target Net

 



      

 

 



 

Working Capital, minus (b) the sum of (i) Closing Indebtedness, (ii) the
Deferred Revenue Adjustment, (iii) the Closing Transaction Expenses, (iv) the
amount, if any, by which the Closing Net Working Capital is below the Target
Net Working Capital, (v) the Escrow Amount and (vi) Stockholder Representative
Expense Fund Amount paid by Parent at Closing in accordance with Section
6.09(f).

 



 

(i) If the Final Merger Consideration is less than the Closing Merger
Consideration (such amount, the " _Deficiency Amount_ "), Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
distribute to Parent promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days
after the Final Merger Consideration being finally determined pursuant to this
Section 2.02) an amount equal to such Deficiency Amount from the Escrow Funds;
provided, that Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall jointly
instruct the Escrow Agent to distribute such amount first from the Escrow
Funds that is cash and then from the Escrow Funds that is not in the form of
cash. For the avoidance of doubt, Parents sole and exclusive source of
recovery with respect to any Deficiency Amount shall be recovery from the
Escrow Funds and neither Parent nor the Surviving Company nor any of their
respective affiliates shall have any claim against any Securityholder in
respect thereof with respect to such adjustment following the release of the
Escrow Funds, and none of the Securityholders, the Stockholder Representative
or any of their respective affiliates shall have any liability for any amounts
due pursuant to this Section 2.02, except to the extent of the Escrow Funds.

 



 

(ii) If the Final Merger Consideration is greater than the Closing Merger
Consideration (such amount, the " _Surplus Amount_ "), (x) Parent shall
promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days after the Final
Merger Consideration being finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.02)
pay the Surplus Amount, in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the Exchange Agent (such amount, the " _Final Surplus_ ") and Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay (A) to each person that immediately
prior to the First Effective Time held Company Capital Stock (other than any
Appraisal Shares) that has surrendered Certificates in accordance with Section
2.05, an amount equal to the product of (1) such persons percentage ownership
as set forth on the Funding Consideration Schedule and (2) the Final Surplus,
(B) to the Surviving Company for the purpose of making payments pursuant to
Section 2.04 to the former holders of In-the-Money Options that were canceled
as provided in Section 2.04, an amount equal to the product of (1) the
aggregate percentage ownership, as set forth on the Funding Consideration
Schedule, of the former holders of the In-the-Money Options so canceled and
(2) the Final Surplus, and (C) to the Surviving Company, any amounts remaining
unpaid after giving effect to the foregoing payments. With respect to amounts
payable pursuant to this Section 2.02(d) in respect of In-the-Money Options,
payment shall be made in accordance with Section 2.04(b).

 



 

(iii) Any payments made pursuant to this Section 2.02(d) shall be treated as
an adjustment to the aggregate Merger Consideration for all applicable Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



 

(e) _Funding Consideration Schedule; Payoff Letters; Invoices_. Not less than
two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
Parent:

 



 

(i) a certificate (prepared in good faith by the Company in consultation with
Parent) executed on behalf of the Company by the chief financial officer of
the Company in

 



     

 

 



 

substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ (the " _Funding
Consideration Schedule_ "), that sets forth with respect to each holder of
Equity Interests in the Company a correct and complete list of (A) all
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock held by each such person (as of
immediately prior to the First Effective Time) and whether such holder has
provided the Investor Suitability Documentation and whether such holder has
been determined to be an Accredited Investor or an Unaccredited Investor, (B)
any other Equity Interests of the Company held by such person (as of
immediately prior to the First Effective Time), including the exercise price
of each In-the-Money Option, (C) consistent in all respects with the Estimated
Price Components and the Closing Merger Consideration, the aggregate
consideration (and form thereof) payable to each such person from and after
the First Effective Time under this Agreement (other than pursuant to Section
2.02(d) or Section 9.07 or the Escrow Agreement, and before withholding Taxes,
if any), subject to any further modification with respect to amounts paid to
Optionholders required if the Parent Common Stock Value is greater than the
Parent Common Stock Closing Reference Value, such modifications to be
reflected in an update promptly following the determination of the Parent
Common Stock Closing Reference Value; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
allocation of the payment of the Merger Consideration shall be paid in
accordance with the following: (i) subject to (and taking into account) the
portion of the cash consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.04 and Section
2.06, the Closing Merger Consideration shall be payable (x) 46.67% in the form
of Parent Common Stock, valued at the Parent Common Stock Value and (y) 53.33%
in the form of cash, in each case as set forth on the Funding Consideration

Merger Consideration Allocation_ "), (D) each Securityholders Pro Rata Share
of the Escrow Amount, the number of Escrow Shares contributed to the Stock
Escrow Account on behalf of each Securityholder, each Securityholers Escrow

to Section 2.04 shall be payable (x) 30.0% in the form of Parent Common Stock,
valued at the Parent Common Stock Value; provided, that if the aggregate
Option Payment payable to the Optionholders in accordance with Section
2.04(a)(ii) with shares of Parent Common Stock valued based on the Parent
Common Stock Value is greater than the aggregate Option Payment payable to the
Optionholders with shares of Parent Common Stock valued based on the Parent
Common Stock Closing Reference Value, then the portion of such Closing Merger
Consideration payable to the such Optionholders shall be determined in
accordance with the Parent Common Stock Closing Reference Value in lieu of the
Parent Common Stock Value and (y) 70.0% in the form of cash, in each case as
set forth on the Funding Consideration Schedule; and (iii) the aggregate
number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable by Parent to the
Securityholders as consideration in the First Merger (including shares
deposited in the Stock Escrow Account, whether or not released to the
Securityholders) shall equal the quotient of Three Hundred Fifty Million
Dollars ($350,000,000) divided by the Parent Common Stock Value, rounded to
the nearest share of Parent Common Stock; provided, that, shares of Parent
Common Stock deposited in the Stock Escrow Account may be returned to Parent

Escrow Shares (except (x) the right of possession thereof and (y) the right to
sell, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of or encumber such
shares or any interest therein) unless and until such Escrow Shares are
released to the Optionholders.

 



 

(b) The parties hereto agree that Parent is the owner of the Cash Escrow
Account for tax purposes and that all interest on or other taxable income, if
any, earned from the investment of such cash in the Cash Escrow Account
pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for tax purposes as earned by
Parent. The parties intend that the rights of the Securityholders to the Cash
Escrow Account in respect of their Company Capital Stock are eligible for
installment sale reporting under Section 453 of the Code (and any
corresponding provision of foreign, state or local Law, as appropriate). In no
event shall the payments under the Escrow Agreement from the Cash Escrow
Account to the Securityholders in respect of their Company Capital Stock
exceed their Escrow Cash Pro Rata Share of $14,700,000.

 



 

(c) The parties hereto agree that (i) with respect to the Escrow Shares
deposited in the Escrow Stock Account in respect of Company Capital Stock, the
Stockholders shall be treated as receiving such Escrow Shares on the Closing
Date for tax purposes, and no interest shall be imputed on any such Escrow
Shares released to such Stockholders from the Stock Escrow Account, and (ii)
with respect to the Escrow Shares deposited in the Escrow Stock Account in
respect of In-the-Money Options, the Optionholders shall not be treated as
receiving such Escrow Shares for Tax purposes unless and until such Escrow
Shares are released to the Optionholders from the Stock Escrow Account.

 



 

SECTION 2.04 _Treatment of Options_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company Board (or an appropriate
committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions providing for and shall take all
actions necessary to cause the following:

 



     

 

 



 

(i) The vesting, as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time, of (x)
the portion of any outstanding Option issued under the Trilogy Education
Services, Inc. 2018 Equity Incentive Plan that is unvested and otherwise
scheduled to vest on or before the first anniversary of the Closing Date and
(y) the entirety of any other outstanding, unvested Option.

 



 

(ii) The cancelation, as of the First Effective Time, of each In-the-Money
Option then outstanding, at which time each holder of one or more In-the-Money
Options shall become entitled to receive from the Surviving Company, with
respect to each In-the-Money Option held by such holder immediately prior to
the First Effective Time, an amount (x) 100% in the form of cash (in the case
of Optionholders described in Section 2.06 that Parent elects to pay in cash)
or (y) 30% in the form of Parent Common Stock (valued at the Parent Common
Stock Value, and treating the Escrow Shares as delivered to the Optionholders
at Closing) and 70% in the form of cash (in the case of all other
Optionholders) equal to (A) the product of (I) the excess of (a) the aggregate
value of the portion of the Closing Merger Consideration (with shares of
Parent Common Stock valued based on the Parent Common Stock Value) allocable
to a Common Share over (b) the exercise price per share of such In-the-Money
Option, and (II) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
In-the-Money Option, plus (B) any amounts or other consideration, if any, to
be paid in respect of such In-the-Money Option pursuant to Section 2.02(d) or
Section 9.07, in each case less applicable withholding Taxes, to be paid in
accordance with the remainder of this Section 2.04 (each such payment is
referred to as an " _Option Payment_ "); provided, however, that to the extent
the cash consideration received by an Optionholder is insufficient to cover
the applicable withholding Taxes, the tax withholding obligations for such
Optionholder shall be satisfied by the Company withholding from issuance the
minimum number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (with shares of Parent
Common Stock valued based on the closing price per share of Parent Common
Stock on the last trading day that precedes the Closing Date) as is
sufficient, together with such cash consideration, to satisfy such withholding
obligation; and

 



 

(iii) The cancellation, as of the First Effective Time, of each Option that is
not an In-the-Money Option (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Options
that remain unvested after giving effect to the Option vesting required
Section 2.04(a)(i)) for no consideration.

 



 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the
aggregate Option Payment payable to the Optionholders in accordance with
Section 2.04(a)(ii) with shares of Parent Common Stock valued based on the
Parent Common Stock Value is greater than the aggregate Option Payment payable
to the Optionholders with shares of Parent Common Stock valued based on Parent
Common Stock Closing Reference Value (the " _Alternative Option Payment
Amount_ " and such difference is the " _Option Excess Amount_ "), then (i) the
Optionholders will be entitled to receive the Alternative Option Payment
Amount at the First Effective Time in lieu of the Option Payment calculated in
accordance with Section 2.04(a)(ii) and (ii) Parent shall increase the amount
of value included in the Parent Retention Program by an amount equal to the
Option Excess Amount, in an amount not to exceed the amount set forth on
Schedule 2.04(a)(iv), for distribution to the Company Employees following the
Closing in a manner set forth on Schedule 2.04(a)(iv). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the aggregate Option Payment
payable to the Optionholders in accordance with Section 2.04(a)(ii) with
shares of Parent Common Stock valued based on the Parent Common Stock Value is
less than the aggregate Option Payment payable to the Optionholders with
shares of Parent Common Stock

 



     

 

 



 

valued based on the Parent Common Stock Closing Reference Value, then the
Optionholders shall be entitled to receive the aggregate Option Payment in
accordance with Section 2.04(a)(ii) with shares of Parent Common Stock valued
based on the Parent Common Stock Value).

 



 

(b) On or prior to the first regular payroll date of the Surviving Company
following the Closing Date (or in the case of any amounts payable pursuant to
Section 2.02(d) or Section 9.07, on or prior to the first regular payroll date
that is at least five (5) Business Days following the receipt of such payment
by the Surviving Company), the Surviving Company shall pay (or, if prior to
the Second Effective Time, the First Surviving Corporation shall pay), as set
forth on the Funding Consideration Schedule to each Securityholder holding an
In-the-Money Option, the cash portion of its applicable Option Payment and
Parent shall issue, as set forth on the Funding Consideration Schedule to each
Securityholder holding an In-the-Money Option, the Parent Common Stock portion
of its applicable Option Payment. With respect to the cash consideration
portion of the Option Payment, such payments shall be made (x) in the case of
amounts payable in respect of Employee Options, through the payroll systems of
the First Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company or the applicable
Company Subsidiary, as applicable, and (y) in the case of amounts payable in
respect of Non-Employee Options, through the accounts payable of the First
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company or the applicable Company
Subsidiary, as applicable. All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.04
shall be subject to Section 2.05(f). For the avoidance of doubt, (i) for the
purpose of determining the amount of Taxes to be deducted and withheld from
any Option Payments hereunder, the per share value of Parent Common Stock will
be based on the closing price for Parent Common Stock on the last trading day
that precedes (x) the Closing Date (in the case of Closing Merger
Consideration) or (y) any date of release from the Escrow Funds in accordance
with Section 9.07 (in the case of Escrow Shares) and (ii) to the extent the
cash consideration received by an Optionholder is insufficient to cover the
applicable withholding Taxes, the tax withholding obligations for such
Optionholder shall be satisfied by the Company withholding from issuance the
minimum number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (with shares of Parent
Common Stock valued based on the closing price per share of Parent Common
Stock on the last trading day that precedes the Closing Date) as is
sufficient, together with such cash consideration, to satisfy such withholding
obligation. All shares of Parent Common Stock issued in respect of In-the-
Money Options shall be subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth on
Schedule 2.04(b).

 



 

SECTION 2.05 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent._ Wilmington Trust, N.A. shall act as Parents exchange
and paying agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of certificates that immediately prior to the
First Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock
that were converted in accordance with Section 2.01(a) into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (" _Certificates_ "). Subject to Section
2.05(b), on the Closing Date and as set forth in the Funding Consideration
Schedule, Parent shall, in connection with the Closing, (i) provide to the
Exchange Agent all of the cash in U.S. dollars necessary to enable the
Exchange Agent to pay the aggregate cash consideration included in the Closing
Merger Consideration and (ii) issue to the Exchange Agent, solely for the
account and benefit of the persons who held, immediately prior to the First
Effective Time, Series B Preferred Shares, Series A Preferred Shares and/or
Common Shares that were converted into the right to receive a portion of the
Closing Merger Consideration in accordance with this Agreement a number of
shares of

 



     

 

 



 

Parent Common Stock necessary to enable the Exchange Agent to pay the
aggregate cash consideration included in the Closing Merger Consideration;
provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate number of shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable by Parent as consideration in the Mergers
(including shares deposited in the Stock Escrow Account, whether or not
released to the Securityholders) shall equal the quotient of Three Hundred
Fifty Million Dollars ($350,000,000) divided by the Parent Common Stock Value,
rounded to the nearest share of Parent Common Stock (subject to Section 2.04
and Section 2.05(b), the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the date
hereof, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Exchange Agent
to and the Exchange Agent shall provide to each holder of Certificates as of
immediately prior to the First Effective Time (i) a letter of transmittal
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ "), which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancelation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed and
validly executed Letter of Transmittal, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent and subject to Section 2.05(g),
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive from the Exchange
Agent in exchange therefor (and in accordance with the applicable Letter of
Transmittal), as promptly as practicable following the First Effective Time,
the applicable portion of the Closing Merger Consideration set forth on the
Funding Consideration Schedule, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.05,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the First Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the applicable portion of the Closing
Merger Consideration set forth on the Funding Consideration Schedule, payable
in accordance with Section 2.02(d), this Section 2.05(b) and the Escrow
Agreement. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any payment to holders
of Certificates pursuant to this Article II. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, (i) compliance with this Section 2.05(b) by the
relevant holder of Certificates is a condition to such holder receiving any
portion of the Merger Consideration, which shall be payable only in the manner
set forth in this Agreement and (ii) the terms and conditions of the Letter of
Transmittal (including the waivers and releases therein) were specifically
negotiated by Parent, Purchaser and Sub as an inducement for Parent, Purchaser
and Sub to enter into this Agreement and such terms and conditions are an
integral part of the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. The amounts paid
and to be paid in respect of shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance
with the terms hereof shall be deemed to be paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to any and all shares of the Company Capital Stock, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Company of shares of Company Capital Stock or any other capital
stock of the Company that were outstanding immediately prior to the First
Effective Time. If, after the First Effective Time, any Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. From and after
the First Effective Time, holders of Certificates shall cease to have any
rights as shareholders of the Company, except (i) with respect to Appraisal
Shares, as provided in this Agreement and by applicable Law and (ii) other
than with respect to Appraisal Shares, to surrender such Certificates in
accordance with Section 2.05(b).

 



     

 

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates six (6) months after the
First Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Company, upon demand,
and any holder of Certificates who has not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company for payment of
its claim for Merger Consideration.

 



 

(e) _No Liability_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by
the holders of Certificates immediately prior to such time as such amounts
would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity
will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Company or an affiliate thereof designated by the Surviving Company,
free and clear of any claim or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Purchaser, Sub, the
Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent or their respective affiliates will be
liable to any holder of a Certificate for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 



 

(f) _Withholding Rights for Taxes_. Each of Parent, Sub, Purchaser, the First
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent, the Escrow
Agent and their respective affiliates (without duplication) shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any payment made hereunder, under the Exchange
Agent Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, such amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of any payment contemplated
by this Agreement under the Code, or under any other provision of Federal,
state, local or foreign Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and
paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority in accordance with Law, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the person in respect of which Parent, Purchaser, Sub, the First
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent, the Escrow
Agent or any of their respective affiliates, as the case may be, made such
deduction or withholding.

 



 

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and
subject to such other reasonable conditions as the Surviving Company may
impose, and, if required by the Surviving Company, the posting by such person
of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Company may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Exchange
Agent to issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company
Capital Stock represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this Article
II.

 



 

SECTION 2.06 _Unaccredited Investors._ Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in Section 2.01, Section 2.02, Section 2.04 or otherwise in this
Agreement, in no event shall Parent be required to issue any shares of Parent
Common Stock to any person (i) that does not provide duly completed and
executed Investor Suitability Documentation at least five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing, or (ii) that is an Unaccredited Investor. To the extent
such Investor Suitability Documentation is not timely provided by a
Securityholder or Parent has made such determination regarding Unaccredited
Investor status, Parent shall inform the Company of such determination prior
to the Closing and the Company shall indicate on the Funding Consideration
Schedule that such Securityholder has not provided the Investor Suitability

 



     

 

 



 

Documentation or is an Unaccredited Investor. To the extent any Securityholder
would otherwise have been entitled to be issued shares of Parent Common Stock
as consideration in connection with the First Merger or upon any release of
Escrow Funds, Parent shall be entitled, in its sole discretion, to pay in cash
that Securityholders share of the Closing Merger Consideration and the Escrow
Amount, rather than issuing shares of Parent Common Stock, with the amount of
cash payable equal to the value of the shares of Parent Common Stock (having a
value per share equal to (x) the Parent Common Stock Value or (y) solely with
respect to amounts compromising Option Payments, the lesser of the Parent
Common Stock Value and the Parent Common Stock Closing Reference Value) that
would have otherwise been issuable had such Securityholder provided the
Investor Suitability Documentation and been determined to be an Accredited
Investor. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the payment in cash in
lieu of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock result in either an
increase or decrease in the aggregate Merger Consideration (assuming that each
share of Parent Common Stock is valued at a value per share equal to the
Parent Common Stock Value).

 



 

ARTICLE III _ 
Representations and Warranties of the Company_

 



 

The Company represents and warrants to Parent, Purchaser and Sub as of the

Governmental Authorizations, and has made, currently and during the past three

of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws relating to or affecting
creditors rights generally and general equitable principles (whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

Governmental Filings set forth in Section 3.05(b) have been obtained or made
(and any waiting

 



     

 

 



 

periods required in connection therewith have expired), the execution and
delivery by the Company of this Agreement and the other documents contemplated
herein to be executed and delivered by the Company do not, and the
consummation of the Mergers and the other Transactions in accordance with the
terms hereof and thereof will not conflict with, or result in any violation or
breach of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under
or give rise to a right of termination, cancelation or acceleration of any
obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation
of any material Lien upon any of the Equity Interests, properties or assets of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary under, any provision of (i) the Company
Charter, the Company Bylaws or the comparable charter or organizational
documents of any Company Subsidiary, (ii) Material Contract or (iii) subject
to the filings and other matters referred to in Section 3.05(b), any Law
applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or their respective Equity
Interests, properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and
(iii) above, any such items that, individually or in the aggregate, have not
and would not reasonably be expected to result in material liability to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or otherwise materially impair the conduct
of the business of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as currently
conducted.

ARTICLE VI _ 
Additional Agreements_

 



 

SECTION 6.01 _Stockholder Consent and Related Matters_.

 



 

(a) In order to consummate the Mergers, as promptly as reasonably practicable
following execution of this Agreement, the Company shall submit the Action by
Written Consent in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit G_ (the
" _Stockholder Consent_ ") to the holders of Company Capital Stock, including
with such submission the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the
Company that the holders of Company Capital Stock give the Company Stockholder
Approval. As soon as practicable thereafter, the Company shall deliver to
Parent a copy of the Stockholder Consent duly executed by holders of Company
Capital Stock representing a sufficient number of outstanding shares
constituting the Company Stockholder Approval.

 



 

(b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the executed
Stockholder Consent from holders of Company Capital Stock constituting at
least the Company Stockholder Approval as soon as practicable following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement in accordance with all Laws, and the
Company Charter and Company Bylaws, and the Company may, to the extent
necessary to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval, enforce (and may
cooperate with holders of Company Capital Stock providing Stockholder Consents
to enforce) all "drag along" and similar rights against other holders of
Company Capital Stock in connection with the Transactions, including in order
to cause such other holders to execute and deliver Stockholder Consents to the
Company prior to the Closing. In furtherance of the foregoing, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, and
in any event within the period required by Law so as to maintain the
effectiveness of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company shall prepare
(and shall provide Parent with reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on) and deliver notice of such approval to those holders of Company Capital
Stock who have not consented and such other persons as required under
applicable Law (the " _Consent Notice_ "). Such notice and the delivery
thereof shall comply with

 



     

 

 



 

Section 228 of the DGCL and other applicable Law. Parent shall furnish to the
Company such information as the Company may reasonably request for inclusion
in the Consent Notice. The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, provide to Parent a copy of each executed Stockholder Consent
received by it.

 



 

(c) The information provided by each of Parent and the Company specifically
for use in the Consent Notice shall not, with respect to the information
supplied by such person, on the date upon which the Consent Notice is
distributed to the holders of Company Capital Stock, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of
Parent and the Company agrees (i) to correct, as promptly as practicable, any
such information provided by such person that shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect and (ii) to take all steps necessary to
amend or supplement the Consent Notice so as to correct the same. The Company
shall cause the Consent Notice as so corrected to be disseminated to the
holders of Company Capital Stock to the extent required by Law.

 



 

SECTION 6.02 _Access to Information_.

 



 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall, and shall cause each
Company Subsidiary to, upon reasonable notice, afford to Parent, Purchaser and
Sub and their respective Representatives, reasonable access during normal
business hours during the period prior to the First Effective Time to all
their respective properties, books, contracts, personnel, agents and records
and shall furnish Parent, Purchaser and Sub (and their respective
Representatives and the Debt Financing Sources) with such financial, operating
and other data and information as Parent, Purchaser and Sub, through their
officers employees or agents, may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any such access shall be conducted in a manner so as not to unreasonably
interfere with the business or operations of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Company may withhold, and may cause the Company Subsidiaries to withhold (a)
such portions of documents or information relating to pricing or other matters
that are highly sensitive if the exchange of such documents (or portions
thereof) or information, as determined based on the advice of the Companys
legal counsel (which may be in-house), would violate any antitrust Law
applicable to the Company or its affiliates, (b) any document or information,
if access or disclosure thereto, as determined based on the advice of the
Companys legal counsel (which may be in-house), would jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege or attorney work-product protection of the Company
or any of its affiliates, (c) any document or information, if access or
disclosure thereto would, as determined based on the advice of the Companys
legal counsel (which may be in-house), violate applicable Law, including with
respect to classified information or (d) any information or documents prepared
by the Company or its Representatives in connection with the Transactions
concerning the valuation of the Company or the negotiation of this Agreement.
If any material is withheld by the Company pursuant to the proviso in the
preceding sentence, the Company shall inform Parent as to the general nature
of what is being withheld, and the Company shall cooperate with Parent to find
a way to allow disclosure of such information described in clauses (a) through
(c) to the extent doing so would not, as determined based on the advice of the
Companys legal counsel (which may be in-house), reasonably be likely to
violate any Law or result in the loss of such a privilege. All information
provided by the Company pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be subject

 



     

 

 



 

to the confidentiality agreement dated December 10, 2018 between the Company
and Parent, as amended hereby (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 



 

(b) The Confidentiality Agreement is hereby amended, as of the date of this
Agreement to allow, without the consent of the Company or its affiliates,

connection with the Transactions.

Closing Date, including the applicable comparison period, which will have been
reviewed by the Companys independent accountants; provided, that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, in any event, prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver or cause to be
delivered unaudited quarterly interim financial statements for the quarter
ended March 31, 2019, including the applicable comparison period, which will
have been reviewed by the Companys independent accountants.

_Data Room_ ") as at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on April 6, 2019, and (2)
separately identified, each document added to the Data Room after such time;
provided, however, that, in lieu of delivering the documents referenced in
this sentence via secure file transfer or flash drives, the Company may, at
its option, maintain the Data Room such that, as of immediately after the

included in the Data Room for due diligence purposes in connection with the
Merger as at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on April 6, 2019 and (x) each document
added to the Data Room after such time.

 



 

(e) From and after the Closing, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving
Company and their respective Representatives to, provide the Stockholder
Representative and its Representatives with reasonable access during normal
business hours, upon reasonable notice and in such a manner so as to not
unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the business, to the
personnel and books and records of the Company with respect to periods or
occurrences prior to the Closing Date that are necessary in connection with
any Proceeding or for Tax or financial reporting obligations, in each case,
subject to the execution of customary work paper access letters if reasonably
requested by Parents accountants.

to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing all things

the most expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions, including (i) the
obtaining of all necessary consents, (ii) the defending of any Proceedings
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, including
seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court
or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and (iii) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall
not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, and Parent, Purchaser
and Sub shall not be required to, directly or indirectly, make or agree to any
payments or other consideration to any third party, or agree to modify the
terms of any Contract, waive any right or grant any concession, in each case,
to obtain any consent or release, except that (i) the Company may elect to pay
cash amounts that will be paid in full prior to the Closing Date and the
payment of which is fully reflected in the calculation of the Closing Merger
Consideration, and (ii) the parties shall pay normal filing or recordation
fees payable to a Governmental Entity.

United States Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ ") in
connection with the Transactions. Parent and the Company shall each use

possible date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not, without the
prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative and the Company, take
any action pursuant to this Section 6.03 that would bind the Company to take
any action (including paying money or entering into any other obligation)
irrespective of whether the Closing occurs. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent or any of its affiliates
be required, and in no event shall the Company or any of its affiliates or its
or their respective Representatives be permitted, to (i) propose, negotiate,
commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order, undertaking or

product lines or assets of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries (including, after

subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, acquire or agree to acquire any
assets, business or any person, whether by merger, consolidation, purchasing a
substantial portion of the assets of or equity in any person or by any other
manner or engage in any other transaction or take any other action, if the
entering into of an agreement relating to or the consummation of such
acquisition, merger, consolidation or purchase or other transaction or action
would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any delay in the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period or impose any delay in the
obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorization,
consent, clearance, approval or order of a Governmental Entity necessary to
consummate the contemplated transactions, including any approvals and
expiration of waiting periods pursuant to the HSR Act or any other applicable
Law, (ii) increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering, or increase
the risk of not being able to remove or successfully challenge, any permanent,

otherwise delay or impede the consummation of the contemplated transactions.

 



 

(e) Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, will furnish

request in connection with its preparation of any filings or notifications
necessary under the provisions of the HSR Act, any applicable foreign
competition law or as contemplated by Section 6.03(d); _provided_ , _however_
, that in no event will Parent be required to share with the Company any
information that (I) does not relate to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, (II) reveals Parents valuation or negotiating strategy with
respect to the Transactions, or (III) is otherwise confidential or proprietary
information of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and in no event will Company

the other apprised of the status of matters relating to the filings, notices
and requests contemplated or required by this Section 6.03. In that regard,

practicable, consult with the other with respect to, provide any necessary
information with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the
other (or its counsel) copies of), all filings, notices, requests for approval
or consent made by it with any Governmental Entity pursuant to this Section
6.03 or any other information supplied by it to, or correspondence with, a
Governmental Entity in connection with its obligations described above in this
Section 6.03. In respect of any such filings, notices or requests, each of the
Company and Parent shall, as promptly as practicable, inform the other, or if
in writing, furnish the other with copies, or, in the case of material oral
communications, advise the other orally, of any communication from any
Governmental Entity regarding any of such filings, notices or requests, and
permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith
the views of the other in connection with, any proposed written (or any
material proposed oral) communication with any such Governmental Entity in
respect of any such filing, notice or request. None of the Company and Parent
shall participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in connection
with any such filing, notice or request (or make oral submissions at meetings
or in telephone or other conversations in respect thereto) unless it consults
with the other in advance and to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Entity gives the other the opportunity to attend and participate thereat. Each
of the Company and Parent shall furnish the other with copies of all
correspondence,

 



      

 

 



 

filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof)
between it and any such Governmental Entity with respect to such filings,
notices and requests, and furnish the other with such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection
with its preparation of such filings, notices or requests. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 6.03(f), in no event will Parent be
required to share with the Company any information that (I) does not relate to
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, (II) reveals Parents valuation or
negotiating strategy with respect to the Transactions, or (III) is otherwise
confidential or proprietary information of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
and in no event will Company be required to share with Parent any information
that reveals Companys valuation or negotiating strategy with respect to the
Transactions. Moreover, no party shall be required to provide the other party
with any information that it reasonably considers to be competitively
sensitive; _provided_ , that in such circumstance, the disclosing party shall
provide the information to the receiving partys external legal counsel on an
"external counsel only basis" (prior to doing so, the disclosing party may
seek an assurance from the receiving partys external legal counsel that it
will not provide such information to the receiving party) and, where
reasonably necessary and practicable, shall provide a redacted version to the
receiving party.

 



 

(g) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent, Purchaser or
Sub shall give prompt notice to the Company, of the discovery of the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any change, condition or event which
discovery, change, condition, occurrence or failure would cause (i) the breach
or failure to be true and correct of any representation or warranty made by it
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to be true and correct
would give rise to a condition in Section 7.02(a) or Section 7.03(a), as
applicable, not being satisfied as of the Closing, or (ii) the failure by it
to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, which
failure would give rise to a condition in Section 7.02(b) or Section 7.03(b),
as applicable, not being satisfied as of the Closing. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, (A) no notification, or other investigation or
knowledge of Parent or any of its Representatives shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representations or warranties of the Company set forth in this
Agreement (or the Company Disclosure Letter) for the conditions to the
obligations of Parent to consummate the Transactions or the remedies available
to the parties hereunder and (B) the failure to give notice under Section
6.03(g)(i) will be deemed to be a breach of a covenant if and only if the
Company knowingly and willfully fails to provide such notice; provided, that
the foregoing limitation shall not modify or in any way limit the right of any
Parents Indemnified Person to seek indemnification for a breach of the
underlying representation or warranty.

 



 

SECTION 6.04 _Public Announcements_. So long as this Agreement is in effect,
Parent, Purchaser and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other,
shall not issue any press release or make any public statement with respect to
the Mergers or this Agreement without the prior written consent of Company or
Parent, respectively (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by applicable Law or the
rules or regulations of any applicable United States securities exchange or
regulatory or governmental body to which the relevant party is subject, in
which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to allow each other party reasonable time
to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance. The
press release announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be
a joint release of, and shall not be issued prior to the written approval of
each of, the Company and Parent.

 



     

 

 



 

SECTION 6.05 _Benefits_.

 



 

(a) For the one-year period following the Closing Date (the " _Covered
Period_ "), Parent shall or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Company) to provide to each individual employed by the Company or a
Company Subsidiary as immediately prior to the Closing Date (each a " _Company
Employee_ "), during his or her employment with Parent or its subsidiary, (i)
a base salary or wage rate that is no less than the base salary or wage rate
provided to such Company Employee by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the First Effective Time and (ii) other compensation and
employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those
Parent provides to its similarly situated employees during such period
(excluding any transaction, retention or change in control bonuses and
benefits under any defined benefit pension, retiree welfare, non-qualified
deferred compensation, equity-based incentive compensation or any similar
plan, program or agreement).

 



 

(b) During the Covered Period, with respect to any "employee benefit plan," as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, maintained by Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary (including the Surviving Company) (excluding any defined benefit
pension, retiree welfare, non-qualified deferred compensation, equity-based
incentive compensation or any similar plan, program or agreement), for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting and solely with
respect to severance, vacation and paid time-off plans, for benefit accrual
purposes, each Company Employees service with the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor employer of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary) to the extent such service was recognized
by the Company or such Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the First
Effective Time, shall be treated as service with Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company); _provided_ , _however_ , that
such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in any duplication of benefits.

 



 

(c) During the Covered Period, Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company) to use reasonable efforts to
waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any
welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its subsidiaries in which
Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to
participate from and after the First Effective Time, except to the extent that
such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work
requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under
the comparable Benefit Plan immediately prior to the First Effective Time.

 



 

(d) Parent shall establish an equity-based retention bonus program for Company
Employees in respect of the value and in the manner specified in Section
6.05(d) of the Parent Disclosure Letter (the " _Parent Retention Program_ ").
Parent shall grant awards to the eligible Company Employees with respect to
the Parent Retention Program on or about July 1, 2019, on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Section 6.05(d) of the Parent Disclosure Letter,
and the vesting of the recipients with respect to such awards shall begin on
the Closing Date.

 



 

(e) From and after the Second Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Company to, pay any employee bonuses pursuant to the annual cash incentive
program of the Company that are accrued and unpaid as of the Closing Date with
respect to any Company Employee as such bonuses become payable in accordance
with and subject to the terms and

 



     

 

 



 

conditions of such annual cash incentive program in effect as of the Closing
Date and identified on Section 6.05(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter, but
only to the extent such bonuses are included as Closing Indebtedness and the
employer portion of any related payroll or similar Taxes are included as
Current Liabilities in Closing Net Working Capital.

 



 

(f) If requested by Parent at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall take all necessary action (including the
adoption of resolutions and plan amendments and the delivery of any required
notices) to terminate, effective as of no later than the day before the
Closing Date, and subject to the consummation of the Transactions, any Benefit
Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (the "
_Company 401(k) Plan_"). The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the
resolutions, plan amendments, notices and other documents prepared to
effectuate the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, which amendments,
notices and other documents will be subject to Parents prior review and
approval (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and prior
to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with the final
documentation evidencing that the Company 401(k) Plan has been terminated.

 



 

(g) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain from (i) each individual listed on Annex 3.03(c) to the
Company Disclosure Letter or identified on Section 3.03(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter as having entered into an agreement with the Company
regarding performance-based equity grants and (ii) each Optionholder who will
hold Options that (after giving effect to Section 2.04(a)(i)) will remain
unvested and be cancelled at the Effective Time (such options, the "
_Cancelled Options_ "), a written consent and waiver of all claims arising
from or related to (x) in the case of clause (i), any unissued Company equity
awards or Options (" _Unissued Awards_ ") or (y) in the case of clause (ii),
any Cancelled Options, in each case, in a form approved by Parent (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Additionally, the Company shall take such action as necessary to accelerate
the vesting in accordance with Section 2.04(a)(i), as of the First Effective
Time, of any Shares held by a Continuing Employee that are subject to vesting
or forfeiture conditions.

 



 

(h) Nothing contained in this Section 6.05, or any other provision of this
Agreement, shall be construed to create any third-party beneficiary rights in
any employee or former employee (including any dependent thereof) of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their affiliates or any person
other than the parties to this Agreement, or any right to employment or
continued employment for any specified period or to a particular term or
condition of employment with Parent, the Company or any of their subsidiaries
or affiliates, or to limit the ability of Parent, Purchaser, Sub, the Company
or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates to terminate the employment of any
employee (including any Company Employee) at any time and for any reason or to
establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
or alter or limit Parents, the Surviving Companys or any of their
subsidiaries ability to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement.

 



 

SECTION 6.06 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) All stock transfer, real estate transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, recording, value added and other similar Taxes incurred in
connection with the First

 



     

 

 



 

Merger (" _First Merger Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne by the party
responsible for such Transfer Taxes under applicable Law. All stock transfer,
real estate transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, recording,
value added and other similar Taxes incurred in connection with the Second
Merger (" _Second Merger Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne 50% by Parent and
50% by the Securityholders. The party responsible under applicable Law for
filing any Tax Return with respect to the First Merger Transfer Taxes or
Second Merger Transfer Taxes shall, at its own expense, prepare and file such
Tax Returns.

 



 

(b) _Intended Tax Treatment_.

 



 

(i) The Company, Parent, Purchaser and Sub intend that the First Merger and
the Second Merger, will be considered together as a single integrated
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and will qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code to which
each of the Company and Parent are parties pursuant to Section 368(b) of the
Code. Except as provided in the penultimate sentence of this Section 6.06(b),
each of the Company, Parent, Purchaser and Sub shall, and shall cause its
respective affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to cause the First
Merger and the Second Merger to so qualify, and none shall take any action, or
fail to take any action, that could reasonably be expected to prevent or
impede the Mergers from so qualifying. Except as provided in the penultimate
sentence of this Section 6.06(b)(i), each of the Company, Parent, Purchaser
and Sub shall, and shall cause its respective affiliates to, file all Tax
Returns consistent with such treatment (including attaching the statement
described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-3(a) on or with the U.S.
federal income Tax Returns of the Company and Purchaser for the taxable year
that includes the Mergers), and take no position inconsistent with such
treatment (whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) unless otherwise
required by a "determination" (within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code). Notwithstanding the foregoing covenants, the parties hereby acknowledge
and agree that Parent shall not be required to make any payments in Parent
Common Stock under this Agreement other than those payments specified in
Section 2.02(e)(i) and Section 2.02(f)(v) (and, by extension, Section 9.07),
and in the event the aggregate Parent Common Stock (valued at the Parent
Common Stock Value) received by the holders of Company Capital Stock in
respect of their Company Capital Stock in the First Merger (for the avoidance
of doubt, excluding any such Parent Common Stock forfeited pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement) is less than forty percent
(40%) of the value of the aggregate consideration paid (or deemed paid for
applicable income Tax purposes) to such holders in respect of their Company
Capital Stock under this Agreement (including payments pursuant to Section
2.02(d)(ii), Section 2.06 and Section 9.02, and valuing the Parent Common
Stock at the Parent Common Stock Value), none of the parties shall be required
to file any Tax Returns or take any position in accordance with the Intended
Tax Treatment. Each of the parties further agrees to notify the other party as
promptly as practicable of any challenge to the Intended Tax Treatment by any
Governmental Entity.

 



 

(ii) The Company, Parent, Purchaser and Sub intend to treat, and hereby adopt,
this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368
of the Code and Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) to
which each of the Parent and the Company are to be parties under Section
368(b) of the Code.

 



 

(c) At the Closing, the Company shall have delivered to Parent in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, an affidavit of the Company duly executed
by a responsible

 



     

 

 



 

corporate officer of the Company under penalties of perjury, issued pursuant
to and in compliance with Treasury Regulations Sections 1.897-2(h) and
1.1445-2(c)(3) and dated as of the Closing Date, certifying that an interest
in the Company has not been a "United States real property holding company"
within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during the five (5) year
period ending on the Closing Date (or if shorter, the longest period in which
interests in the Company were held by any of its present holders). The parties
hereto agree and consent that after the Closing, Parent shall cause the
Company to provide notice of such certification to the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulations Section
1.897-2(h)(2).

 



 

(d) Parent shall prepare and timely file, or shall cause to be prepared and
timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for
Pre-Closing Tax Periods that, unless filed prior to the Closing Date, are
first due after the Closing Date (taking into account applicable extensions)
(" _Parent Prepared Returns_ "), and subject to terms of this Agreement,
including Parents rights to indemnification for Seller Taxes, Parent shall
timely pay any Taxes shown on such Tax Returns. Parent Prepared Returns,
including any Tax Return of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for a
taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, shall be
prepared on a basis consistent with prior positions and practices of the
Company or Company Subsidiary, as applicable, except to the extent Parent
reasonably determines that it is otherwise required by applicable Law. In the
case of any Parent Prepared Return that (1) is an income Tax Return of the
Company, or (2) shows Taxes for which the Securityholders are required to
indemnify Parents Indemnified Persons pursuant to Section 9.01, Parent shall
deliver a draft of such Parent Prepared Return to the Stockholder
Representative at least twenty (20) days (or, for non-income Taxes, such
shorter period as is reasonable taking into account the due date, taxable
period and Taxes at issue) prior to the due date (taking into account
applicable extensions) for the filing of such Parent Prepared Return to
Stockholder Representative for review and comment. Within fifteen (15)
Business Days of receipt of any such Parent Prepared Return, the Stockholder
Representative shall notify Parent of any comments to such Parent Prepared
Return and Parent shall incorporate any reasonable comments with respect to
any item related to Taxes the Securityholders are responsible for in
accordance with this Agreement provided by the Stockholder Representative in
good faith prior to filing such Parent Prepared Return. To the extent the
Stockholder Representative agrees that any portion of Taxes shown as due on a
Parent Prepared Return constitute Seller Taxes, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall execute joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to pay Parent or the Company (as directed by
Parent) within three (3) Business Days, or, if later, five (5) Business Days
prior to the due date (after giving effect to extensions), an amount equal to
such agreed Seller Taxes plus any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket the
third party expenses for the preparation of such Parent Prepared Return that
is for a taxable period that ends on or prior to the Closing Date. If and to
the extent Parent and the Stockholder Representative do not agree that Taxes
shown as due on a Parent Prepared Return constitute Seller Taxes or the Escrow
Funds are insufficient to satisfy the agreed Seller Taxes, Parent shall
initiate an indemnification claim pursuant to Section 9.01 for such Seller
Taxes plus any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket third party expenses
for the preparation of such Parent Prepared Return that is for a taxable
period that ends on or prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(e) Prior to the final determination of the Final Merger Consideration
pursuant to Article 2 of this Agreement (and thereafter, to the extent such
action could reasonably be expected to reduce amounts payable to (or give rise
to an indemnification obligation for)

 



     

 

 



 

Securityholders pursuant to this Agreement), the Parents Indemnified Persons
and, following the First Effective Time, the Company and Company Subsidiaries,
will not (and will not permit their affiliates to) (i) except for the Parent
Prepared Returns prepared and filed in accordance with Section 6.06(d), file
any Tax Returns of the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) amend any Tax Return that was prepared and filed
in accordance with Section 6.06(d), (iii) make or change any Tax election or
change any method of accounting of or with respect to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary that has retroactive effect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
(iv) initiate examinations or voluntary disclosures with any Tax authority
regarding Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period (provided nothing in this Section 6.06(e), clause (iv)
shall restrict or prevent Parent and its Affiliates from complying with
applicable Law with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period), or (v) engage in
any transaction on the Closing Date after the Closing outside the ordinary
course of the Companys business other than any actions taken in connection
with the Transactions, in each such case except (A) with the prior written
consent of Stockholder Representative (which will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed, or conditioned) or (B) if such action could not reasonably
be expected to form the basis for a claim of indemnification against the
Securityholders pursuant to Section 9.01. For the avoidance of doubt, it shall
be unreasonable for the Stockholder Representative to withhold, delay or
condition consent to any action that is required by applicable Law.

 



 

(f) If either the Stockholder Representative, on the one hand, and any of the
Parents Indemnified Persons or any of their affiliates (including, following
the First Effective Time, the Company and any Company Subsidiary), on the
other hand, receives notice of any Third Party Claims, inquiries, assessments,
audits or similar events with respect to Taxes of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or the Intended Tax Treatment (any such Third Party Claim, inquiry,
assessment, audit or similar event, a " _Tax Contest_ ") then each such party
shall promptly notify the other upon receipt of written notice thereof (but
any failure to so notify the other party shall not relieve such other party
from any liability with respect to such Tax Contest other than to the extent
such party was materially prejudiced thereby). With respect to any such Tax
Contest that the Stockholder Representative does not or cannot elect to
control pursuant to Section 9.03: (i) Parent shall permit the Stockholder
Representative to participate in such Tax Contest (using counsel of its own
choosing) with respect to matters in such Tax Contest for which the
Securityholders could reasonably be expected to have any liability (including
pursuant to this Agreement), (ii) Parent shall keep Stockholder Representative
reasonably informed of all material developments on a timely basis with
respect to any such matters in such Tax Contest, and (iii) Parent shall not
enter into any settlement of, otherwise compromise or abandon any such matters
in such Tax Contest without the prior written consent of Stockholder
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. In the event of any conflict or overlap between the provisions of
this Section 6.06(f) and Section 9.03, the provisions of this Section 6.06(f)
shall control.

 



 

(g) After the date hereof, the Company, Stockholder Representative, Parents
Indemnified Persons and their respective affiliates shall each provide the
other (or cause the other to be provided) with reasonable access to all
relevant documents, data and other information, properties, books, records and
auditors to the extent reasonably necessary for the purpose of financial
reporting, preparation of Tax Returns, supporting the Intended Tax Treatment,
responding to any audit by any Taxing Authority or replying to any Third Party
Claim or any claim

 



     

 

 



 

or demand by any Governmental Entity concerning the Parent, the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or their respective affiliates relating to Taxes. Each such
party shall reasonably cooperate with all reasonable requests the other party
makes in connection with contesting the imposition of any Taxes and reporting
the Tax treatment of the Transactions.

 



 

(h) In the case of any taxable period of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
for any Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes attributable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall (i) in the case of _ad valorem_ or property Taxes, be
deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days during the Straddle Period before and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the total number of calendar days in the Straddle
Period, and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes, be determined based on an
interim closing of the books as of the end of the day on the Closing Date.

 



 

SECTION 6.07 _D andO Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, cause the Surviving
Company to honor all the Companys obligations to indemnify (including all
obligations to advance funds for expenses) the current or former (in each
case, as of the First Effective Time) directors or officers of the Company as
of the date of this Agreement (the " _D andO Indemnified Persons_") for acts or
omissions by such directors or officers occurring prior to the First Effective
Time to the extent that such obligations of the Company exist on the date of
this Agreement, whether pursuant to the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or
individual indemnity agreements made available to Parent prior to the date
hereof, and such obligations shall survive the Mergers and shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with the terms of the Company Charter, the
Company Bylaws and such individual indemnity agreements as of the date hereof
for a period of not less than six (6) years from the First Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and fully pay
(as a Transaction Expense) the premium for a non-cancelable "tail" policy
extension of the directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys
existing directors and officers insurance policies for the benefit of each
person covered by the directors and officers insurance policies of the
Company in effect as of the date of this Agreement, for a claims reporting or
discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the First Effective
Time with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to
the First Effective Time.

 



 

(c) In the event that Parent, the Company or the Surviving Company or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall
use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the successors and assigns of
Parent, the Company or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 6.07.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.07 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable
by, each of the DandO Indemnified Persons and their successors, assigns and
heirs and (ii) in addition to, and not in

 



     

 

 



 

substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such DandO Indemnified Person may have by contract or otherwise. This Section
6.07 may not be amended, altered or repealed after the First Effective Time
without the prior written consent of the affected DandO Indemnified Person.

 



 

SECTION 6.08 _Fees and Expenses_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Mergers and the other Transactions shall be
paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Mergers
are consummated.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of Parent
and the Company shall be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of (w) the filing
fees associated with the filing of the HSR Act notification and report form
and any filings with or notifications required under foreign competition laws
that are required under or contemplated by Section 6.03 and any expenses,
including attorneys fees and expenses, of Parent relating to such filings and
notifications, (x) any Second Merger Transfer Taxes, (y) the fees and expenses
of the Escrow Agent relating to the Escrow Agreement and (z) any fees related
to obtaining any third-party consents in connection with the Transactions.

 



 

SECTION 6.09 _Stockholder Representative_.

 



 

(a) By virtue of the approval of the Mergers and this Agreement by the
Securityholders and without any further action of any of the Securityholders
or the Company, Fortis Advisors LLC will act as Stockholder Representative and
as the true and lawful attorney-in-fact and exclusive agent for all purposes
under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. As promptly as practicable
after the date of this Agreement, the Company will exercise its rights under
Section 3 of the Voting Agreement to request each holder of Company Capital
Stock to execute and deliver an instrument confirming the appointment of
Fortis Advisors LLC as the Stockholder Representative and agreeing to be bound
by the provisions of this Section 6.09.

 



 

(b) The Stockholder Representative shall have the authority, for and on behalf
of Securityholders (except for the holders, if any, of Appraisal Shares) to
take such actions and exercise such discretion as are required of the
Stockholder Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the
Stockholder Representative Engagement Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, and
any such actions shall be binding on each such holder and shall include the
following: (i) to execute the Escrow Agreement on behalf of such holder; (ii)
to receive, hold and deliver to Parent Certificates and any other documents
relating thereto on behalf of such holder; (iii) to give and accept
communications and notices on behalf of such holder; (iv) to defend,
negotiate, agree to, enter into settlements and compromises of, and comply
with orders and awards of courts with respect to, claims against such holder;
(v) to defend, negotiate, agree to, enter into settlements and compromises of,

disputes related to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement on behalf of such
holder; (vi) to receive payments on behalf of such holder due and owing
pursuant to this Agreement and acknowledge receipt thereof; (vii) to amend,
supplement, change or waive any provision hereof or of the Escrow Agreement;
(viii) to receive service of process on behalf of such holder in connection
with any claims under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any related

or instrument; (ix) to determine whether the conditions to the Companys
obligations have been satisfied, including waiving any such conditions if the
Stockholder Representative in its sole discretion determines that such waiver
is appropriate; and (x) to take any and all actions necessary or appropriate
in the sole discretion of the Stockholder Representative to accomplish any of
the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholder Representative
shall have no obligation to act on behalf of the Securityholders, except as
expressly provided herein, in the Escrow Agreement and in the Stockholder
Representative Engagement Agreement, and for purposes of clarity, there are no
obligations of the Stockholder Representative in any other ancillary
agreement, schedule, exhibit or the Company Disclosure Letter. As the
representative of such holders, the Stockholder Representative shall act as
agent for each such holder and shall have authority to bind each such holder
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and
Parent, Purchaser and Sub may rely (without independent investigation or
further evidence of any kind) on such appointment and authority. The powers,
immunities and rights to indemnification granted by the Securityholders to the
Stockholder Representative Group hereunder: (i) are coupled with an interest
and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetence, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any Securityholder and shall be binding on any successor
thereto, and (ii) shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any
Securityholder of the whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in the
Escrow Funds.

 



 

(c) Certain Securityholders have entered into an engagement agreement (the "
_Stockholder Representative Engagement Agreement_ ") with the Stockholder
Representative to provide direction to the Stockholder Representative in
connection with its services under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and
the Stockholder Representative Engagement Agreement (such Securityholders,
including their individual representatives, collectively the " _Advisory
Group_ "). Neither the Stockholder Representative nor its members, managers,
directors, officers, contractors, agents and employees nor any member of the
Advisory Group (collectively, the " _Stockholder Representative Group_ ")
shall be liable to any Securityholder for any act done or omitted to be taken
as Stockholder Representative except expressly as set forth herein. Each
person who immediately prior to the First Effective Time was a Securityholder
and who received, or is entitled to receive, the Merger Consideration shall,
in proportion to the number of shares and Options held as compared to the
total number of such shares and Options outstanding (and with respect to any
such Options, only to the extent of such proportionate share of the Escrow
Funds), indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Stockholder Representative
Group from and against all losses, liabilities, claims, damages, fees, fines,
costs, judgments, amounts paid in settlement or expenses (including fees,
disbursements and costs of counsel and other skilled professionals and in
connection with seeking recovery from insurers) incurred or suffered by the
Stockholder Representative Group as a result of, or arising out of, or
relating to any and all actions taken or omitted to be taken by the
Stockholder Representative under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the
Stockholder Representative Engagement Agreement or in connection with the
incurrence, payment, discharge or settlement of any of the obligations of such
holders (collectively the " _Stockholder Representative Expenses_ "), except
for any such Stockholder Representative Expenses that arise on account of the
Stockholder Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct as
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final adjudication. Such
Stockholder Representative Expenses may be recovered first, from the
Stockholder Representative Expense Fund, second, from any distribution of the
Escrow Funds otherwise distributable to the Securityholders at the time of
distribution, and third, directly from the Securityholders. None of the
Stockholder Representative Group shall be liable to any person who immediately
prior to the

 



     

 

 



 

First Effective Time was a Securityholder in respect of such arrangements or
actions or omissions in connection therewith, except to the extent that such
acts or omissions constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Securityholders acknowledge that the Stockholder Representative shall not be
required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial
liability in the exercise or performance of any of its powers, rights, duties
or privileges or pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the
Stockholder Representative Engagement Agreement or the Transactions.
Furthermore, the Stockholder Representative shall not be required to take any
action unless the Stockholder Representative has been provided with funds,
security or indemnities which, in its determination, are sufficient to protect
the Stockholder Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities
which may be incurred by the Stockholder Representative in performing such
actions.

 



 

(d) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative
under or relating to this Agreement shall constitute a decision for all
persons who immediately prior to the First Effective Time were
Securityholders, and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such
person, and each such persons successors as if expressly confirmed and
ratified in writing by such person, and all defenses which may be available to
any person to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the Stockholder
Representative taken in good faith under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement,
or the Stockholder Representative Engagement Agreement are waived. The Parent
Parties and their Related Persons may rely (without independent investigation
or further evidence of any kind) upon any such decision, act, consent, notice,
communication or instruction of such Stockholder Representative as being the
decision, act, consent, notice, communication or instruction of each such
person. The Parent Parties and their Related Persons are hereby relieved from
any and all liability to any person for any acts done by (i) the Stockholder
Representative or (ii) them in accordance with or based upon any decision,
act, consent, notice, communication or instruction of the Stockholder
Representative. The Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to: (i) rely
upon the Funding Consideration Schedule, (ii) rely upon any signature believed
by it to be genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has proper
authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Securityholder or other
party.

 



 

(e) If Fortis Advisors LLC resigns or becomes unable to serve as Stockholder
Representative, other person or persons may be designated by the holders of a
majority of the shares of Company Common Stock and In-the-Money Options, and
such person or persons shall succeed as the Stockholder Representative. The
immunities and rights to indemnification shall survive the resignation or
removal of the Stockholder Representative or any member of the Advisory Group
and the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement.

 



 

(f) On the Closing Date, Parent shall pay to the Stockholder Representative by
wire transfer to an account or accounts designated by the Stockholder
Representative in writing at least two Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, immediately available funds in the amount of $500,000 (the "
_Stockholder Representative Expense Fund Amount_ "). The Stockholder
Representative Expense Fund Amount shall be held by the Stockholder
Representative in a segregated client account and shall be used (i) for the
purposes of paying directly or reimbursing the Stockholder Representative for
any Stockholder Representative Expenses incurred pursuant to this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement or the Stockholder Representative Engagement Agreement,
or (ii) as otherwise determined by the Advisory Group (the " _Stockholder_

 



      

 

 



 

 _Representative Expense Fund_ "). The Stockholder Representative is not
providing any investment supervision, recommendations or advice and shall have
no responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of the Stockholder
Representative Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The Stockholder Representative is not acting as a
withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection with the
Stockholder Representative Expense Fund, and has no tax reporting or income
distribution obligations. The Securityholders will not receive any interest on
the Stockholder Representative Expense Fund and assign to the Stockholder
Representative any such interest. Subject to Advisory Group approval, the
Stockholder Representative may contribute funds to the Stockholder
Representative Expense Fund from any consideration otherwise distributable to
the Securityholders. As soon as reasonably determined by the Stockholder
Representative that the Stockholder Representative Expense Fund is no longer
required to be withheld, the Stockholder Representative shall distribute the
remaining Stockholder Representative Expense Fund (if any) to the Exchange
Agent and/or Parent, as applicable, for further distribution to the
Securityholders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares.

 



 

SECTION 6.10 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Each of Parent, Purchaser and Sub shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to consummate and obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing on
the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter (as replaced,
amended, supplemented, modified, waived or superseded to the extent not
prohibited by Section 6.10(b)) on a timely basis to facilitate the Closing
when required by this Agreement, including: (i) to maintain in effect the Debt
Commitment Letter until the Closing has occurred (other than to the extent
amended or replaced in accordance with its terms and subject to Section
6.10(b)), (ii) enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter or any
alternate Debt Financing, and (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the
Debt Commitment Letter (or on the terms of the definitive documentation
related to any alternate Debt Financing). In the event that all the conditions
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter have been satisfied (or upon funding
will be satisfied), each of Parent, Purchaser and Sub shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt Financing Sources party
to the Debt Commitment Letter to comply with their respective obligations,
including to fund the Debt Financing at the Closing (and in any event on or
prior to the Outside Date). Each of Parent, Purchaser and Sub shall use
reasonable best efforts to comply with their respective obligations, and use
reasonable best efforts to enforce their respective rights, under the Debt
Commitment Letter, in each case in a timely and diligent manner.

 



 

(b) None of Parent, Purchaser or Sub shall agree to any amendments or
modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any condition or other provision or
remedy under the Debt Commitment Letter or Debt Financing Agreements without
the prior written consent of the Company (which may be granted or withheld in
the Companys sole discretion), to the extent such amendments, modifications
or waivers would reasonably be expected to impose new or additional conditions
precedent to the Debt Financing or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of
the conditions precedent to the Debt Financing in a manner that would be
reasonably expected to (A) prevent or delay or impair the ability of Parent,
Purchaser and Sub to consummate the Transactions to be consummated on the
Closing Date pursuant to this Agreement, (B) adversely impact the ability of
Parent, Purchaser or Sub to enforce its rights or remedies against the other
parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or Debt Financing Agreements (or, if
applicable, any documentation

 



     

 

 



 

related to an alternate Debt Financing) or (C) make the funding of the Debt
Financing on the Closing Date or satisfaction of the conditions precedent to
obtaining the Debt Financing on the Closing Date materially less likely to
occur; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent may also amend (or
amend and restate) the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Fee Letter and any fee
credit or discount and engagement letters or any Debt Financing Agreements to
add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or any person
with similar roles or titles who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter
as of the date hereof and amend titles, allocations and fee sharing
arrangements with respect to the existing and additional lenders, arrangers,
bookrunners, agents, managers or similar entities) in all material respects in
accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the
date hereof. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such
amendment, modification or waiver of any of the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Debt Financing Agreements. Parent shall release or consent to the termination
of the obligations of the lenders and other Persons under the Debt Commitment
Letter or Debt Financing Agreements, except for replacements of the Debt
Commitment Letter with alternative financing commitments pursuant to Section
6.10(c).

 



 

(c) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable in
the manner contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter (other than as a result
of the termination of the Debt Commitment Letter pursuant to the terms
thereof), Parent shall reasonably promptly so notify the Company. Upon the
occurrence of any circumstance referred to in the preceding sentence, Parent,
Purchaser and Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
arrange and obtain in replacement thereof, and to negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to, alternative financing from the same or
alternative financial institutions or other persons (which such alternative
financing shall be in an amount, when combined with Parents, Purchasers and
Subs other sources of funds, equal to not less than the Merger Consideration)
on terms and conditions that are not less favorable to Parent, Purchaser and
Sub than those in the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof.
In the event any new Debt Commitment Letter is obtained as permitted or
required in accordance herewith, (A) any reference in this Agreement to the "
_Debt Financing_ " means the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced pursuant to this
Section 6.10, and (B) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing
Agreements" or the "Debt Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include the
Debt Commitment Letter that is not superseded in accordance herewith by a new
Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and the new Debt Commitment
Letter to the extent then in effect.

 



 

(d) Parent shall (i) furnish the Company complete, correct and executed copies
of any alternative financing agreement entered into in accordance (in each
case of the foregoing, in the case of any fee letters, to the extent required
by the terms of the applicable Debt Commitment Letter, redacted in a manner
consistent with the Debt Fee Letter) promptly upon their execution, (ii)
without limiting the generality of the immediately following subclause (iii),
give the Company reasonably prompt written notice, of (A) any breach of which
any of Parent, Purchaser or Sub is or becomes aware by any party of any of the
Debt Commitment Letter, any alternative financing commitment, the Debt
Financing Agreements, or any alternative financing agreement entered into in
accordance with this Section 6.10 or any termination thereof and (B) if
Parent, Purchaser or Sub or any of their respective Representatives receives
(1) any written notice or (2) other written communication, in each case from
any Debt Financing Source with respect to any actual breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to any of the Debt Commitment Letter
or Debt

 



     

 

 



 

Financing Agreements of any provisions of the Debt Commitment Letter or Debt
Financing Agreements (in each case of the foregoing subclauses (A) and (B),
provided, however, subject to the rules of discovery otherwise applicable,
that none of Parent, Purchaser or Sub shall be required to provide any
information that is privileged if Parent, Purchaser or Sub (as applicable)
shall have used its reasonable best efforts to communicate, to the extent
feasible, the applicable information in a way that would not violate the
applicable rule or risk waiver of such privilege), and (iii) otherwise,
promptly upon request of the Company, keep the Company reasonably informed on
a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its
efforts to arrange the Debt Financing (or any alternative financing under this
Section 6.10).

 



 

(e) Subject to Section 6.02 and Section 6.02(f), the Company shall provide,
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to provide, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause any Representatives retained by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to provide customary and necessary cooperation, at Parents
sole expense, in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing as may
be reasonably requested by Parent, including (i) making appropriate senior
executive officers and additional employees of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries reasonably available for participation in meetings, due diligence
sessions, presentations, sessions with rating agencies and prospective
financing sources, (ii) executing and delivering any pledge and security
documents (which will not be effective until the Closing Date) and otherwise,
(iii) facilitating the pledging of collateral, (iv) using reasonable bet
efforts to obtain accountants legal opinions, as reasonably requested by
Parent, including issuant any customary representations letters to
accountants, (v) using reasonable best efforts to satisfy the conditions
precedent set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive
documentation with respect to the Debt Financing, to the extent the
satisfaction of such conditions requires the cooperation of or is within the
control of the Company, (vi) reasonably promptly responding to any diligence
inquiries of the lenders in such Debt Financing, (vii) furnishing Parent and
its financing sources with such financial and operating data and other
information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as is
reasonably requested by Parent or any prospective lender to Parent and is
customarily required for completion of debt financings similar to the Debt
Financing and (viii) providing and executing documents as may be reasonably
requested by Parent, including (A) documents requested by Parent or its
financing sources relating to the repayment of the existing Indebtedness of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and the release of related Liens,
including the Payoff Letters and (to the extent required) evidence that notice
of such repayment has been timely delivered to the holders of such
Indebtedness, and (B) at least four (4) Business days prior to the Closing
Date, all documentation and other information required by bank regulatory
authorities under applicable "know-your-customer," anti-money laundering rules
and regulations, including the Patriot Act, and applicable beneficial
ownership regulations in each case for this clause (B) requested by the Debt
Financing Sources and which request is received by the Company in writing at
least ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pledge any assets
as collateral, pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other
liability in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Closing. Parent
shall promptly reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs incurred by the Company or any Company Subsidiary (including
reasonable attorneys fees, but excluding all fees incurred in connection with
the preparation, review, audit and delivery of historical financial
statements) in connection with any cooperation contemplated by this Section
6.10 (the " _Debt Financing Cooperation Expenses_ "). Parent shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their

 



     

 

 



 

respective Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the Debt Financing,
arrangement of the Debt Financing and any information utilized in connection
therewith (other than with respect to any historical information provided by
the Company or its subsidiaries and except to the extent such losses, damages,
costs or expenses arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives).

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(including this Section 6.10): (i) nothing in this Agreement (including this
Section 6.10) shall require any such reasonable best efforts to the extent
that it would (a) require the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or
their respective Representatives, as applicable, to waive or amend any terms
of this Agreement or agree to pay any commitment or other fees or reimburse
any expenses in connection with the Debt Financing that are not contingent
upon the Closing or incur any actual or potential liability or obligation or
give any indemnities in connection with the Debt Financing that are not
contingent upon the Closing, (b) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
business or operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or create
an unreasonable risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (c) require the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries to take any action that will conflict with or violate
the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys Company Charter, Company Bylaws or

approve any financing prior to the Closing, (e) result in any significant
interference with the prompt and timely discharge of the duties of any of the
Companys executive officers or senior management, (f) result in or reasonably
be expected to result in any officer or director of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or any Representative of any of the foregoing incurring personal
liability that with respect to any matters relating to the Debt Financing, (g)
require any of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to consent to the pre-
filing of UCC-1 financing statements or any other grant of Lien or other
encumbrances prior to the Closing, (h) require any of the boards of directors
(or equivalent bodies) of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to
enter into any resolutions or take similar action to approve or authorize the
execution thereof or (i) require the Company or any Company Subsidiaries to
provide (w) any financial information (other than the financial statements
referenced in _Section 3.06(a)_) concerning the Company that the Company does
not maintain in the ordinary course of business, (x) any other information
with respect to the Company not reasonably available to the Company under its
current reporting systems, (y) trade secrets or information to the extent that
the provision thereof would violate any law, rule or regulation, binding
agreement, fiduciary duty, or any obligation of confidentiality (so long as
such confidentiality obligation was not entered into in contemplation of this
Agreement or to obtain the Debt Financing) binding upon, or waive any
privilege that may be asserted by the Company or any of its affiliates or (z)
any information to the extent that the provision thereof would impact the
position taken in any consolidated, combined or unitary tax return filed by
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or affect in any way the
Companys obligation to file, or assertion that it is not obligated to file,
any such tax return and (ii) none of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives shall have any
liability or incur any losses, damages or penalties with respect to the Debt
Financing in connection therewith in the event the Closing does not occur.

 



     

 

 



 

(g) Parent, Purchaser and Sub acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the
Companys obligations under this Section 6.10, neither the obtaining of the
Debt Financing (or any alternative Debt Financing) nor the performance by any
party to any Debt Commitment Letter of its obligations thereunder is a
condition to the Closing, and reaffirm their obligation to consummate the
Transactions irrespective and independently of the availability of the Debt
Financing or an alternative Debt Financing, subject to the applicable
conditions set forth in Section 7.01 and Section 7.02.

 



 

SECTION 6.11 _No Solicitation_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall not,
and shall cause each of its affiliates not to, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause its and its affiliates respective Representatives not to,
solicit, initiate or engage in negotiations with, or provide any material
information to, any person (other than Parent and its affiliates and
Representatives), concerning any merger, sale of substantial assets, sale of
Equity Interests or similar transactions involving the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries or a substantial portion of their assets, or enter into any
agreement with respect thereto.

 



 

SECTION 6.12 _Section 280G_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall:
(i) obtain waivers from each person who has or may have a right to any
payments or benefits that could reasonably be expected to constitute "excess
parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) as a
result of or in connection with the Transactions of the right to some or all
of such any payments or benefits so that no remaining portion of the payments
or benefits will be of any "excess parachute payment" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code); and (ii) solicit the approval of the Stockholders
in a manner that complies with Sections 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) and 280G(b)(5)(B) of
the Code of all payments or benefits (including payments and benefits waived
pursuant to the preceding clause) that would, as a result of, or in connection
with, Transactions, be deemed to constitute "excess parachute payments." To
the extent required to comply with the provisions of the preceding sentence,
the Company shall deliver, among other items, to its stockholders a disclosure
statement intended to satisfy the stockholder approval requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code. The form of waiver, solicitation of approval, and
disclosure materials shall be subject to the prior review and approval of
Parent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

SECTION 6.13 _Accredited Investor Status_. Promptly after the date hereof,
Company shall request each Securityholder to deliver all documentation, in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, necessary to determine
whether or not such Securityholder is an Accredited Investor, including the
accredited investor questionnaire attached to _Exhibit I_ (collectively, the
" _Investor Suitability Documentation_ "). If a Securityholder fails to
properly deliver the Investor Suitability Documentation at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing, such Securityholder shall be deemed an
"Unaccredited Investor" for purposes of this Agreement. If a Securityholder
properly delivers the Investor Suitability Documentation at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing, Parent shall determine in good faith,
based on the information provided by such Securityholder in the Investor
Suitability Documentation and any further documents provided by such
Securityholder to Parent, whether such Securityholder is an "Accredited
Investor" or an "Unaccredited Investor" for purposes of this Agreement and
provide the Company with written notice of such determinations.

 



     

 

 



 

SECTION 6.14 _Securities Law Exemption_. Parent and the Company shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cause the issuance of all shares of Parent
Common Stock contemplated by this Agreement in connection with the Mergers to
qualify for an exemption from the registration and prospectus delivery
requirements of the Securities Act and the equivalent state "blue sky" laws.

(b) by either Parent or the Company:

 



 

(i) if the Mergers are not consummated on or before August 7, 2019 (the "

Agreement (including one or more inaccuracies of any of its representations or
warranties), which breach or failure to perform (i) would (if not cured) give

applicable conditions set forth in Section 7.01 or Section 7.03 within thirty

SECTION 9.03 _Defense of Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) If any legal proceedings shall be instituted or any claim is asserted by
any third party that is not party to this Agreement (a " _Third Party Claim_
") against an Indemnified Party in respect of which any party to this
Agreement may have an obligation to indemnify such Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party shall give the party from whom indemnity is sought (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") written notice thereof to within 20 days after receipt
by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third Party Claim and shall
describe in reasonable detail (to the extent known by the Indemnified Party)
the facts constituting the basis for such Third-Party Claim and the amount of
the claimed Losses, together with all documents and materials supporting such
claim as are reasonably available to the Indemnified Party, but any failure to
so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any liability that
it may have to the Indemnified Party other than to the extent (i) the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby or (ii) if such notice is
delivered after the expiration of the survival period in Section 9.05(a)
applicable to the matter set forth in such notice. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, with respect to any notices to be delivered pursuant to this
Section 9.03, such notices shall be delivered (x) to Parent in the event that
the Indemnified Party is a Securityholders Indemnified Person and (y) to the
Stockholders Representative in the event that the Indemnified Party is a
Parents Indemnified Person.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, upon written notice to the Indemnified
Party within 30 days of receipt of a notice from the Indemnified Party
properly delivered in accordance with Section 9.03(a), to assume the defense
thereof at its expense and with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party;
_provided_ that (i) such counsel is not reasonably objected to by the
Indemnified Party and (ii) in order for the Indemnifying Party to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim, (x) the amount of potential indemnification
available to the Indemnified Party under this Article IX (after taking into
account the limitations in Section 9.06) with respect to such Third Party
Claim (net of the amount of any other pending claims against the Indemnifying
Party or the Escrow Funds, if applicable) must exceed 50% of the Losses
reasonably likely to arise from such Third Party Claim and (y) with respect to
any Tax Contest, such Third Party Claim relates solely to Taxes for which the
Indemnifying Party has an indemnification obligation under this Agreement.
Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in such defense
but the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for
any expenses legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with such participation; _provided_ that notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable fees,
costs and expenses of separate counsel of the Indemnified Party if (i) the
Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded, based upon reasonable
advice of outside counsel, that (A) there may be a conflict of interest
(including one or more legal defenses or counterclaims available to it which
are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying
Party) that would make it inappropriate, in the reasonable judgment of the
Indemnified Party, for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party, or (B) the Third Party Claim seeks
nonmonetary relief which, if granted, could materially and adversely affect
the Indemnified Party or its affiliates (and in such case of this clause (B)
the Indemnified Party may elect to assume such defense), (ii) the Indemnifying
Party shall not have (A) employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnified Party within a reasonable time after notice of such Third Party
Claim is received by the Indemnifying Party and (B) continued to diligently
conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim or (iii) the Third Party Claim
involves a dispute with any Governmental Entity. The assumption of the defense
of any Third-Party Claim by the Indemnifying Party can be made with a
reservation of the right to contest the right of the Indemnified Party to be
indemnified with respect to such claim under this Agreement.

 



 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in the
defense and prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the Indemnifying Partys request) the provision to the Indemnifying
Party, upon reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours, of all
pertinent records and information that are reasonably required by the
Indemnifying Party for the defense of such Third Party Claim, and making
appropriate employees on a mutually convenient basis available upon reasonable
advance notice and during normal business hours to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

 



 

(d) The Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written approval of the
Indemnified Party before compromising, discharging or entering into any
settlement of, or ceasing to defend against, any Third Party Claim (with such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_
, _however_ , that, other than with respect to a Tax Contest, such

 



     

 

 



 

approval of the Indemnified Party shall not be required if (i) there is no
finding or admission of any violation of Law or the violation of any rights of
any party, (ii) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid by
the Indemnifying Party concurrently with the settlement, compromise or
discharge and (iii) such settlement, compromise or discharge releases the
Indemnified Party and its Related Persons fully, completely and irrevocably
from all Losses in connection with such Third Party Claim and does not impose
or purport to impose any obligation or restriction on such Indemnified Party.
The Indemnifying Partys consent to any settlement of a Third-Party Claim
shall not be used as evidence of the truth of the allegations in any Third-
Party Claim or the merits of such Third-Party Claim. Furthermore, the
existence of any Third-Party Claim shall not create a presumption of any
breach by a party to this Agreement of any of its representations, warranties
or covenants set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

(e) Whether or not the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the
Indemnifying Partys prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld).

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if (x) the Indemnifying
Party does not assume control of the defense of any Third Party Claim as
provided in this Section 9.03, (y) at any subsequent date the Indemnifying
Party is not diligently prosecuting the defense with counsel that is
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party of any Third Party Claim or
(z) the Third Party Claim seeks nonmonetary relief which, if granted, could
materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to defend such Third Party Claim in such manner as it may
deem appropriate at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, subject,
in the case of clause (z), to the consent of Parent or the Stockholder
Representative, as applicable, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned (and thereafter the Indemnifying Party will
reimburse the Indemnified Party therefor as promptly as practicable, in
accordance with this Section 9.03).

 



 

SECTION 9.04 _Other Claims_. A claim for indemnification for any matter not
involving a Third Party Claim shall be asserted by the party seeking
indemnification hereunder (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") to (x) Parent in the
event that the Indemnified Party is a Securityholders Indemnified Person and
(y) the Stockholders Representative in the event that the Indemnified Party is
a Parents Indemnified Person, in each case, in writing with reasonable
promptness, alleging in good faith a breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant or other right to indemnification and setting forth the obligation
with respect to which the claim is made and, with reasonable specificity to
the extent known, the facts giving rise to and the alleged basis for such
claim and, to the extent reasonably estimable, an estimate of the amount of
the Losses (or if known, the amount of the Losses) asserted by reason thereof
(an " _Indemnification Claim Notice_ "), but any failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability
that it may have to the Indemnified Party other than to the extent (i) the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby or (ii) such notice is
delivered after the expiration of the survival period in Section 9.05(a)
applicable to the matter set forth in such notice. In the event the
Indemnifying Party disputes its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party
under this Article IX, the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days after receipt
of an Indemnification Claim Notice under this Section 9.04 to give written
notice of such objection, and (with reasonable specificity) the grounds
therefor. If the Indemnifying Party delivers an Indemnification Claim Notice,
then the Indemnified

 



     

 

 



 

Party and the Indemnifying Party shall attempt in good faith to resolve any
such objections raised by the Indemnifying Party in such Indemnification Claim
Notice. No payment on the disputed portion of the claim will be made to the
Indemnified Party until such dispute is resolved, whether by adjudication of
such matter, agreement between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party or otherwise. If the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party agree
to a resolution of such objection, then a writing setting forth the matters
conclusively determined by the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall be prepared and signed by both parties, and shall be binding and
conclusive upon the parties hereto.

 



 

SECTION 9.05 _Survival_.

 



 

(a) The representations and warranties of each party contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing until the date that is twelve (12) months
after the Closing Date, at which time such representations and warranties
shall terminate and thereafter be of no force and effect; provided that the
Fundamental Representations and the representations and warranties set forth
in Section 3.09 shall survive until ninety (90) days following the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations. All covenants and agreements
contained herein shall remain in full force and effect for a period of twelve
(12) months following the Closing Date, except for those covenants and
agreements that by their terms are to be performed in whole or in part at or
after the Closing, which shall remain in full force and effect until performed
in accordance with this Agreement. The date on which any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement expires or terminates hereunder is referred to
herein as a " _Survival Expiration Date_ ". Any claim for indemnity under
Section 9.01 or Section 9.02 with respect to any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement must be asserted in writing on or prior to the
applicable Survival Expiration Date.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 9.05(a), a partys rights to indemnification under
this Article IX, and the other provisions of this Article IX, shall not
terminate with respect to any claim with respect to which the Indemnified
Party has delivered (x) an Indemnification Claim Notice to the Indemnifying
Party in accordance with Section 9.04 or (y) a notice with respect to a Third
Party Claim to the Indemnifying Party in accordance with Section 9.03, in each
case, prior to the applicable Survival Expiration Date; in which case such
claim and the applicable representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or
right to indemnification under this Article IX shall survive until the full
and final resolution of the matters covered by all such notices related
thereto.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the rights of Parents
Indemnified Persons to be indemnified pursuant to (i) Section 9.01(c) shall
expire on the Appraisal Share Expiration Date, (ii) Section 9.01(g) shall
expire on the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date; (iii)
Section 9.01(d), Section 9.01(e), Section 9.01(h) and Section 9.01(i) shall
expire on the twelve (12)-month anniversary of the Closing Date; and (iv)
Section 9.01(f) shall expire on the date that is ninety (90) days following
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations; provided, that any
indemnification claim that is asserted in accordance with this Agreement on or
before the applicable expiration date by proper written notice in accordance
with this Article IX shall continue to be subject to indemnification hereunder
until the resolution of such indemnification claim in accordance with this
Article IX.

 



     

 

 



 

SECTION 9.06 _Indemnification Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement:

 



 

(a) (i) None of Parents Indemnified Persons may assert any claim for Losses
under Section 9.01(a) (A) unless the Losses with respect to such claim or
series of directly related claims exceeds two hundred fifty thousand dollars
($250,000) (in which case all of such Losses shall be recoverable, or shall
count toward the Deductible (as defined below), in accordance with this
Article IX) and (B) unless and until the aggregate amount of the Losses with
respect to all such claims by such Parents Indemnified Persons under this
Agreement exceeds two million five hundred thousand dollars ($2,500,000) (the
" _Deductible_ "), and then Parents Indemnified Persons may recover Losses
only for the excess of such aggregate Losses over the Deductible, _provided_
that none of the limitations on remedies in this Section 9.06(a)(i) shall
apply to (x) any claim relating to any breach or inaccuracy of one or more
Fundamental Representations or the representations and warranties in Section
3.09 (Taxes) (or, in each case, Losses related thereto), (y) any claim by
Parents Indemnified Persons in connection with Fraud by the Company or any
claim by Securityholders Indemnified Persons in connection with Fraud by
Parent or (z) any claim by Securityholders Indemnified Persons in connection
with Parents payment of the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(ii) In no event shall the aggregate liability of the Securityholders for (A)
any claim pursuant to Section 9.01(a) solely with respect to Fundamental
Representations or the representations and warranties in Section 3.09 (Taxes)
or any claim pursuant to Section 9.01(f) exceed the Final Merger Consideration
actually received by the Securityholders and (B) any claim pursuant to (x)
Section 9.01(a) with respect to any of the other representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in Article III or (y) Sections 9.01(b) 
9.01(e), 9.01(h) and 9.01(i) exceed the amount of the Escrow Funds. Recovery
from the Escrow Funds shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parents
Indemnified Persons for claims pursuant to (1) Section 9.01(a), except for
claims pursuant to Section 9.01(a) solely with respect to Fundamental
Representations and the representations and warranties set forth in Section
3.09 (Taxes) and (2) Sections 9.01(b)  9.01(e), 9.01(h) and 9.01(i).

 



 

(iii) Any and all payments to any Parents Indemnified Person pursuant to this
Article IX shall be made first from the Escrow Funds (in accordance with
Section 9.07(a)(iii)); _provided_ that if the Stockholder Representative or
any Securityholder is entitled to receive payment pursuant to this Article IX
or Section 2.02(d), such Parents Indemnified Party may set-off against any
such liability to the Stockholder Representative or Securityholder, any
amounts of Losses to which such Parents Indemnified Party is entitled
pursuant to this Article IX (without regard to the amount of remaining Escrow
Funds). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, from and
after the Closing, no Parents Indemnified Person shall have any liability to
any Securityholders Indemnified Persons in respect of, and no
Securityholders Indemnified Person shall have (and each Securityholders
Indemnified Person hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees
not to assert) any right (whether at law or in equity, based in Contract, tort
or otherwise) against, or recourse to, any Parents Indemnified Person in
respect of any amounts paid by any Securityholder Indemnified Person to any
Parent Indemnified Person as a result of any indemnification claim made under
this Agreement.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) Nothing in this Article IX shall be deemed to override any obligations
with respect to the mitigation of damages under applicable Law. The amount of
any Losses for which indemnification is provided for under this Article IX
shall be offset by any amounts actually recovered in cash by the Indemnified
Party as a result of any indemnification by any third party with respect to
such Losses and any insurance proceeds or other amounts received by the
Indemnified Party from third parties with respect to such Losses (net of the
deductibles, coinsurance, costs of recovery or other expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Party in obtaining any such amounts, indemnification and
proceeds). Parent and the Company agree to (and agree to cause the other
applicable Indemnified Party to) use commercially reasonable efforts (which
shall not include the initiation of any litigation proceedings) to mitigate
any Losses, including to make any claims for insurance; _provided_ that the
Indemnified Party shall not be required to maintain any insurance.
Notwithstanding the proviso in the preceding sentence, Parent shall not, and
shall cause the Surviving Company not to, terminate any fully pre-paid
insurance policies in place prior to the Closing prior to the expiration of
such policy; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not be
required to incur any expense to maintain any such insurance policies.

 



 

(c) Any indemnification payments made pursuant to Section 9.01 or Section 9.02
shall be treated as an adjustment to the aggregate Merger Consideration for
all applicable Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



 

(d) The amount of the Loss arising out of any item included as a liability in
calculating Closing Net Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant to
Section 2.02, shall be calculated net of the amount so included. The amount of
the Loss arising out of any reduction in value of any Current Asset acquired
at the Closing shall be calculated net of any amount specifically reserved for
against the reported value of such Current Asset included in calculating
Closing Net Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.02.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, none of
Parents Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to any recovery in respect of a
Loss (or a part thereof) to the extent the amount of such Loss has been taken
into account as a liability in the Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Deferred Revenue, Closing Transaction Expenses or Closing Net Working Capital
as finally determined under this Agreement resulting in a Final Merger
Consideration that is lower than if such amount had not been included.

 



 

(e) No party shall be entitled to make any claim for indemnification under
this Article IX with respect to any Loss to the extent such Indemnified Party
has been indemnified or reimbursed for such Loss under any other provision of
this Agreement.

 



 

(f) The parties agree that, the amount of Losses any Parents Indemnified
Person shall be entitled to recover in each instance in which a Parents
Indemnified Party has a valid indemnification claim pursuant to Section
9.01(g) shall be determined in accordance with the amounts and procedures set
forth on Schedule 9.06(f). Any and all payments to any Parents Indemnified
Person pursuant to this Section 9.06(f) shall be made from the Escrow Funds.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, other than to the extent
paid from the Escrow Funds, no Securityholder shall have any responsibility or
liability for the breach of any other Securityholder.

 



     

 

 



 

SECTION 9.07 _Release of Escrow Funds_.

 



 

(a) In the event that any Parents Indemnified Person is determined to be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to Article IX of this Agreement, Parent
shall be entitled to payment from the Escrow Funds in the amount of the Losses
with respect to which such Parents Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnification. In the event that any Parents Indemnified Person is
determined to be entitled to recover from the Escrow Funds pursuant to Article
IX, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall promptly issue joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent authorizing distribution of the
amount of such Losses to Parent or (as directed by Parent) such Parents
Indemnified Person.

 



 

(i) Promptly, but in any event within three (3) Business Days, following the
date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall cooperate to prepare and deliver a joint
instruction to the Escrow Agent to release an amount of Escrow Funds to the
Exchange Agent (on behalf of the Stockholders for payment in accordance with
Section 2.05) and the Surviving Company (on behalf of the Optionholders for
payment in accordance with Section 2.04(b)) with an aggregate value equal to
the amount, if any, by which the value of the Escrow Funds as of such date
exceeds the sum of (x) the amount required to be reserved in respect of the
matters set forth on Schedule 9.01(g), in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Section 9.06(f), and then the amounts required to be reserved
pursuant to this clause (x) shall be reduced by the amount of the damages
received by the Parents Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 9.06(f) prior
to such date, plus (y) the Claimed Indemnity Amount (such notice, the "
_Initial Escrow Release Notice_ "). To the extent any claims for
indemnification in respect of the Claimed Indemnity Amount are resolved prior
to the date that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, promptly
following resolution of such claims, the Stockholder Representative and Parent
shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release an amount of Escrow Funds
to the Exchange Agent (on behalf of the Stockholders for payment in accordance
with Section 2.05) and the Surviving Company (on behalf of the Optionholders
for payment in accordance with Section 2.04(b)) with an aggregate value equal
to the amount, if any, by which the value of the Escrow Funds which is related
to such resolved claims exceeds the amount required to be reserved pursuant to
clause (x) of the immediately the first sentence of this Section 9.07(a), as
applicable, pursuant to the second sentence of this Section 9.07(a) or
pursuant to Section 9.07(a)(i). The term " _Claimed Indemnity Amount_ " means
the aggregate amount of Losses, as of any date, in respect of claims that have
been timely asserted but not finally resolved by such date.

 



 

(ii) During the period between twelve (12) months after the Closing Date and
eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, the remaining Escrow Funds (other
than Escrow Funds in respect of the Claimed Indemnity Amount for claims
asserted prior to twelve (12) months after the Closing Date) shall be released
only in the event any Parent Indemnified Person is determined to be entitled
to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.01(g). Promptly, but in any event
within three (3) Business Days, following the date that is eighteen (18)
months after the Closing Date, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall
cooperate to prepare and deliver a joint instruction to the Escrow Agent to
release an amount of Escrow Funds to the Exchange Agent (on behalf of the
Stockholders for payment in accordance with Section 2.05) and the Surviving
Company (on behalf of the Optionholders for payment in accordance with Section
2.04(b)) with an aggregate value equal to the amount, if any, by which the
value of the Escrow Funds as of such date exceeds the Claimed Indemnity Amount
(such notice, the " _Second Escrow_

 



     

 

 



 

 _Release Notice_ "). Promptly following resolution of all claims for
indemnification in respect of the Claimed Indemnity Amount from the Escrow
Funds, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall jointly instruct the
Escrow Agent to release the Escrow Funds, as applicable, to the Exchange Agent

is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right, neither the
Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis
that the other parties hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in
equity. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the

 



     

 

 



 

terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 10.09
shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with
any such order or injunction, and the party opposing such injunction or
injunctions hereby agrees that it shall not contest the amount or absence of
any such bond or other security requested or offered by the party seeking such
injunction or injunctions.

 



 

SECTION 10.10 _Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process_. All actions and
proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and
determined in the Court of Chancery of Delaware sitting in New Castle County,
or solely if none of those courts have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting
in the State of Delaware (and, in each case, any appellate court thereof)
(collectively, the " _Chosen Courts_ "). In addition, each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably (i) submits to the jurisdiction of such Chosen
Courts in any such action or proceeding and irrevocably waives the defense of
an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such action or proceeding,
(ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such Chosen Courts,
(iii) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or
the Transactions in any court other than the Chosen Courts and (iv) waives any
right to trial by jury with respect to any action related to or arising out of
this Agreement or the Transactions (including any dispute arising out of or
relating to the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive
documentation with respect to the Debt Financing with respect to the Debt
Financing or the performance thereof). Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of
the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause
of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against the Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or
any of the Transactions, including but not limited to any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or
any definitive documentation with respect to the Debt Financing or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of
New York, County of New York, Borough of Manhattan, or, if under applicable
law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts
thereof). The consents to jurisdiction set forth in this paragraph shall not
constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware.
The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.

 



 

SECTION 10.11 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement may only be brought against, the persons who are expressly named as
parties hereto and then only with respect to the specific obligations set
forth herein with respect to such person. None of the Debt Financing Sources
(or any Related Person of any Debt Financing Source), and no Related Person,
or Related Person of a Related Person, of any party hereto shall have any
liability for any obligations or liabilities of any party hereto under this
Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
Transactions, including, but not limited to, any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof.

 



     

 

 



 

SECTION 10.12 _Privilege_.

 



 

(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that (i) Cooley LLP ("
_Sellers  Counsel_") has acted as counsel to the Company in various matters
involving a range of issues and as counsel to the Company in connection with
the negotiation of this Agreement and consummation of the Transactions, and
(ii) except for the Company, Sellers Counsel has not acted as counsel for any
other person in connection with the Transactions and no other party or person
has the status of a client of Sellers Counsel for conflict of interest or any
other purpose as a result thereof.

 



 

(b) None of Parent, Purchaser, Sub, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective subsidiaries shall assert that any communication occurring prior to
the First Effective Time between Sellers Counsel (and any other counsel to
the Company or a Company Subsidiary), on the one hand, and the Company or a
Company Subsidiary (including any one or more officers, directors, employees
or Securityholder of the Company or its Subsidiaries), on the other hand, that
is attorney-client privileged, constitutes attorney work product or other
attorney-client confidential information arising from communications related
to or arising out of the preparation, negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the Transactions (the " _Privileged Communications_ ")
constitute attorney-client confidences that belong solely to the Company. Each
of Parent, Purchaser, Sub and the Surviving Company (including on behalf of
the Company and its Subsidiaries) hereby acknowledges and agrees all
Privileged Communications shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences
that belong solely to the Securityholders and their affiliates (and not the
Company or its Subsidiaries). Following the First Effective Time, the
Stockholder Representative and the Securityholders will be permitted to use
Privileged Communications in connection with the defense of any claim by
Parent or any other Indemnified Party under Article IX. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (x) in the event that a dispute
arises between Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries and a third party after the Closing, Parent, the Surviving
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent disclosure of any Privileged Communications by Sellers
Counsel to such third party, (y) neither the Stockholder Representative nor
any of the Securityholders or their respective affiliates may waive such
attorney-client privilege or disclose such communications or files other than
in connection with the enforcement or defense of their respective rights or
obligations under this Agreement; and (z) none of the Securityholders or their
respective affiliates may waive such privilege or exercise such property
rights without the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative, on
behalf of all of the Securityholders.

 



 

SECTION 10.13 _Non-Reliance_.

 



 

(a) Parent, Purchaser and Sub have conducted their own independent
investigation, review and analysis of the business, results of operations,
prospects, condition (financial or otherwise) or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and acknowledges that they have been provided adequate access to
the personnel, properties, assets, premises, books and records, and other
documents and data of the Company and its Subsidiaries for such purpose.
Parent, Purchaser and Sub acknowledge and agree that: (i) in making their
decision to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions,
Parent, Purchaser and Sub have relied solely upon its own investigation and
the express representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article
III of this Agreement (including the related portions of the Company
Disclosure Letter), the representations and warranties of the Company
stockholders party to a Stockholder Support Agreement and the other agreements
contemplated by this Agreement and disclaims reliance on

 



     

 

 



 

any other representations and warranties of any kind or nature express or
implied (including, but not limited to, any relating to the future or
historical financial condition, results of operations, assets or liabilities
or prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries); and (ii) none of the
Securityholders, the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries or any other person
has made any representation or warranty as to a Securityholder, the Company,
the Companys Subsidiaries or the accuracy or completeness of any information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished or made available to
Parent, Purchaser, Sub or any of their respective Representatives, except as
expressly set forth in Article III of this Agreement, the Stockholder Support
Agreements or any of the other agreements contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) In connection with the due diligence investigation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries by Parent, Purchaser, Sub and their affiliates and respective
Representatives, Parent, Purchaser, Sub and their subsidiaries and respective
Representatives have received and may continue to receive after the date
hereof from the Company or any Company Subsidiary, their affiliates and
respective representatives certain estimates, projections, forecasts and other
forward-looking information, as well as certain business plan information,
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries and their businesses and
operations. Parent, Purchaser and Sub hereby acknowledge that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as well as in such business
plans, that actual results may differ materially from such estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking statements, and that Parent,
Purchaser and Sub are not relying upon and will have no claim against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their affiliates or respective
Representatives, or any other person, with respect thereto, including as to
the accuracy or completeness of any information provided, except to the extent
expressly set forth in Article III of this Agreement, the Stockholder Support
Agreements or any of the other agreements contemplated by this Agreements.

 



 

(c) The Company and the Securityholders have conducted their own independent
investigation, review and analysis of the business, results of operations,
prospects, condition (financial or otherwise) or assets of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, and acknowledges that they have been provided adequate access to
the personnel, properties, assets, premises, books and records, and other
documents and data of Parent and its Subsidiaries for such purpose. The
Company agrees that: (i) in making its decision to enter into this Agreement
and to consummate the Transactions, the Company has relied solely upon its own
investigation and the express representations and warranties of Parent set
forth in Article IV of this Agreement (including the related portions of the
Parent Disclosure Letter) and the other agreements contemplated by this
Agreement and disclaims reliance on any other representations and warranties
of any kind or nature express or implied; and (ii) none of Parent or any other
person has made any representation or warranty as to Parent, the Parent
Subsidiaries or the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding
Parent and its Subsidiaries furnished or made available to the Company or any
of their respective Representatives, except as expressly set forth in Article
IV of this Agreement.
