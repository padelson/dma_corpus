the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the
"DGCL").   2.3 CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME. The consummation of the

otherwise determined by Parent, with advance written notice to the Company,

Closing.   8    2.5 CONVERSION OF SHARES.   (a) Subject to Section
2.10, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any Stockholder:  
(i) each share of the Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (but after giving effect to the conversion of all Preferred
Stock into Common Stock and the exercise of Options pursuant to Section 2.7),
other than any shares of Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section
2.5(a)(iii), shall be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration (as defined in Section 2.5(b));   (ii) the
issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of
Merger Sub ("Sub Common Stock"), all of which are held by Parent, shall
remain outstanding and, following the Merger, shall represent all of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation; and  
(iii) each share of Common Stock held by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled
and extinguished without any conversion thereof, and no cash, securities of
Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.  
(b) For purposes of this Agreement, the "Per Share Merger Consideration"
shall be the following:   (i) a cash amount equal to a fraction, (A) the
numerator of which of which shall equal (x) the Closing Date Cash Amount,
plus (y) the amount by which the Net Working Capital of the Company as of the
Closing (the "Actual Net Working Capital") is greater than $10,000,000 (the
"Target Net Working Capital"), minus (z) the amount by which the Actual Net
Working Capital is less than the Target Net Working Capital (such sum or
difference, as the case may be, the "Cash Merger Consideration"), and (B) the
denominator of which shall equal the aggregate number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (but after giving
effect to the conversion of all Preferred Stock into Common Stock and the
exercise of Options pursuant to Section 2.7) (including any shares that are
subject to a repurchase option or risk of forfeiture under any restricted
stock purchase agreement or other agreement), but excluding shares of Common
Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.5(a)(iii) (the "Outstanding
Shares");   (ii) a percentage interest in the Merger Consideration
Escrow Funds (as defined in Section 2.9(e)) equal to 1 divided by the number
of Outstanding Shares; and   (iii) a percentage interest in the Indemnity
Escrow Funds (as defined in Section 2.10) equal to 1 divided by the number of
Outstanding Shares.   (c) For purposes of this Agreement, the "Closing Date
Cash Amount" shall mean (i) $100,000,000, minus (ii) the sum of the Merger
Consideration Escrow Amount (as defined in Section 2.9(b)), the Indemnity
Escrow Amount (as defined in Section 2.9(b)), the amount necessary to repay
in cash and discharge in full all Indebtedness of the Company and the  
9   Company Subsidiaries as of the Closing and any unpaid Transaction Fees
and Expenses of the Company as of the Closing.   (d) The Per Share Merger
Consideration payable to any Merger Stockholder pursuant to this Section
2.5(a) shall be rounded to the nearest one cent ($0.01), provided that all
shares of Common Stock held by a Merger Stockholder shall be aggregated for
purposes of such calculations.   2.6 NET WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT.   (a)
At least three (3) business days prior to the Closing, the Company shall, in
good faith and in consultation with Parent, prepare and deliver to Parent a
good faith estimate of the Actual Net Working Capital (the "Estimated Net
Working Capital"), together with an estimated balance sheet of the Company,
on a consolidated basis, as of the Closing (the "Estimated Closing Balance
Sheet"), prepared in accordance with GAAP, with GAAP to be
applied consistently in the manner in which GAAP was applied in the
preparation of the Balance Sheet. The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet shall
be prepared as if the Closing Date was the last day of the Company\'s fiscal
year. The Estimated Net Working Capital shall be calculated based on the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet. In the event that Parent disagrees with the
Company\'s calculation of the Estimated Net Working Capital, then prior to
the Closing, Parent shall deliver to the Company its good faith estimate of
the Actual Net Working Capital (the "Parent Estimate"). Until the Actual Net
Working Capital is finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.6,
the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be determined using the Estimated
Net Working Capital instead of the Actual Net Working Capital.   (b) Within
ninety (90) days after the Closing, Parent shall, in good faith, cause to be
prepared and delivered to the Stockholders\' Agent (i) a balance sheet of the
Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the Closing (the "Closing
Date Balance Sheet") and (ii) a reasonably detailed calculation (the "Parent
Net Working Capital Calculation") of the Actual Net Working Capital. The
Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with this
Agreement and GAAP, with GAAP to be applied consistently in the manner
in which GAAP was applied in the preparation of the Balance Sheet. The
Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be prepared as if the Closing Date was the
last day of the Company\'s fiscal year. Each party acknowledges and agrees
that the purpose of the Parent Net Working Capital Calculation is to finalize
the calculation of Net Working Capital based on a closing of the Company\'s
books as of the Closing. Following the delivery of the Closing Date Balance
Sheet and Parent Net Working Capital Calculation to the Stockholders\' Agent,
Parent shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, afford the
Stockholders\' Agent and its Representatives the opportunity to examine the
calculation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Parent Net Working Capital
Calculation and such underlying records and work papers as are reasonably
necessary and appropriate. Parent shall cooperate reasonably promptly with
the Stockholders\' Agent and its Representatives in such examination.   (c)
The Stockholders\' Agent may, on behalf of the Merger Stockholders, dispute
any amounts reflected in the Parent Net Working Capital Calculation but only
on the basis that such amounts were not calculated in accordance with this
Agreement or that such calculations are mathematically inaccurate; provided,
that the Stockholders\' Agent shall notify   10   Parent in writing of
each disputed amount and shall specify the amount thereof in dispute (in the
aggregate, the "Disputed Amounts"), within thirty (30) days of Parent\'s
delivery of the Parent Net Working Capital Calculation. If the Stockholders\'
Agent does not dispute any amounts reflected in the Parent Net Working
Capital Calculation within such thirty (30) day period, the Parent
Net Working Capital Calculation shall be deemed to be and shall be final,
binding and conclusive on the parties hereto.   (d) In the event of such a
dispute, Parent and the Stockholders\' Agent shall attempt in good faith to
reconcile their differences and any resolution by them as to any Disputed
Amounts shall be in writing and shall be final, binding and conclusive on the
parties, and shall be used to determine the Actual Net Working Capital. If
Parent and the Stockholders\' Agent are unable to reach a resolution with
respect to all Disputed Amounts within thirty (30) days of the Stockholders\'
Agent\'s written notice of dispute to Parent, Parent and the Stockholders\'
Agent shall submit the remaining Disputed Amounts for resolution to the
Independent Accounting Firm which shall be requested to determine and report
to the parties upon such remaining Disputed Amounts within thirty (30) days
after submission, and such report shall be final, binding and conclusive
on the parties hereto, and shall determine the Actual Net Working Capital.
The Independent Accounting Firm will have exclusive jurisdiction over the
parties hereto against one another or any other Person with respect to
disputes over the calculation of Actual Net Working Capital. Each party will
furnish to the Independent Accounting Firm such work papers and other
documents and information relating to the disputed issues as the Independent
Accounting Firm may request and are reasonably available to that party or its
Subsidiaries (or its independent public accountants) and will be afforded the
opportunity to present to the Independent Accounting Firm (to the extent
permitted by the Independent Accounting Firm) any material relating to the
determination of the matters in dispute and to discuss such determination
with the Independent Accounting Firm. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be allocated between Parent and the Merger
Stockholders (such allocation to be finally determined by the Independent
Accounting Firm) in such a way that Parent shall be responsible for that
portion of the fees and expenses equal to the total amount of such fees and
expenses multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Disputed
Amounts submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm that are resolved
against Parent, and the denominator of which is the Disputed Amounts so
submitted, and the Stockholders\' Agent shall be responsible for
the remainder of such fees and expenses.   (e) If the Actual Net Working
Capital, as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.6, exceeds the
Estimated Net Working Capital, the Merger Consideration shall be increased by
an amount equal to such excess (such excess being the "Post-Closing Increase
Amount"). If the Actual Net Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant
to this Section 2.6, is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital, the
Merger Consideration shall be decreased by an amount equal to such shortfall
(such shortfall being the "Post-Closing Decrease Amount"). If the Actual Net
Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital, (i) Parent shall
pay to each Merger Stockholder, in the method set forth in the Letter of
Transmittal for such Merger Stockholder, such Merger Stockholder\'s Pro Rata
Share of (x) the Post-Closing Increase Amount plus (y) interest on such Post-
Closing Increase Amount (for the period commencing on the Closing Date and
ending on the date of payment) at a rate equal to the average interest rate
earned on the Merger Consideration Escrow Amount during such period and (ii)
Parent and the Stockholders\' Agent shall execute and the Stockholders\'
Agent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent   11   an instruction to release
the Merger Consideration Escrow Amount and any interest earned thereon (the
"Merger Consideration Escrow Funds") to the Merger Stockholders in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement. If the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds the
Actual Net Working Capital, Parent and the Stockholders\' Agent shall execute
and Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent an instruction (i) to release an
amount of the Merger Consideration Escrow Funds equal to the Post-Closing
Decrease Amount plus any interest earned on such amount to Parent and (ii) to
release the remaining (after application of clause (i) of this sentence)
Merger Consideration Escrow Funds, if any, to the Merger Stockholders in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement. In the event that the Post-Closing
Decrease Amount exceeds the Merger Consideration Escrow Funds, Parent shall
be entitled to recover from the Indemnity Escrow Funds (x) such excess plus
(y) interest on such excess (for the period commencing on the Closing Date
and ending on the date of recovery) at a rate equal the average interest rate
earned on the Merger Consideration Escrow Amount during such period. Each of
the items to be paid or delivered pursuant to this Section 2.6(e) shall be so
paid or delivered within three (3) business days of the final determination
of the Actual Net Working Capital.   2.7 EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS.   (a)
Subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.7, prior to the Closing,
the Company shall make an offer to the holder (the "Holder") of each
outstanding stock option (each an "Option") heretofore granted under
the Company\'s 1999 Stock Option Plan or any other stock option plan
maintained by the Company (the "Company Stock Plan") for the Holder to
exercise such Option in full or in part prior to the Closing, with the
exercise price therefor paid (wholly or partially) either in cash or in the
form of a recourse note issued to the Company that is payable in full from
the Merger Consideration payable to such Holder pursuant to the Merger if the
Closing occurs, and if the Closing does not occur, payable in any event in
accordance with its terms (the "Option Note"). The form of the Option Note is
attached hereto as Exhibit F. If any Holder does not accept such offer,
either in full or in part, and does not otherwise exercise the Options held
by such Holder at or prior to the Closing, each such unexercised Option shall
expire at the Effective Time (with no consideration therefor). The Letter of
Transmittal for each Holder who acquired shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the exercise of an Option (whether pursuant to such offer or
otherwise, at any time) shall provide that all amounts payable to the Company
under Option Notes shall be paid and withheld by Parent (together with any
other amounts required to be withheld by applicable law upon such exercise
("Option Withholding Amount")) from the Merger Consideration otherwise
payable to such Holder on the Closing Date.   (b) The principal and interest
owed on any other note between the Company and a Holder or any other prior
Option recipient which was used to previously exercise an Option ("Prior
Option Note") will be satisfied by offsetting such amount from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable to the Holder or other prior Option
recipient. The Company shall take all such actions necessary, including the
amendment of any existing notes, to effect the foregoing.   (c)
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.7 to the contrary, if the
aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration received by any Holder minus the sum
(i) of the principal and interest owed on any Option Note made by such Holder
and (ii) the principal and   12   interest owed on any Prior Option Note
made by such Holder does not at least equal the withholding owed upon the
purported exercise of any outstanding unexercised Options in accordance with
Section 2.7(a), then the Holder may not exercise his Option using an Option
Note, and must exercise his Option by paying cash. In the event that the
Holder cannot or does not pay the required cash prior to the Closing, the
unexercised Options shall expire immediately prior to the Closing.   (d)
The Company shall not take any action to directly or indirectly reprice any
outstanding Option prior to the Closing.   (e) As provided herein, the
Company Stock Plan and any other plan, program or arrangement providing for
the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock
of the Company shall terminate upon the Effective Time. Prior to the Closing,
the Company shall have taken all steps necessary to ensure that neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary is or will be bound at the Effective Time
by any Options, other options, warrants, rights or agreements which would
entitle any Person to acquire any capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
or any Company Subsidiary or, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
to receive any payment in respect thereof. The Company shall provide
reasonable evidence of compliance with this Section 2.7 to Parent at least
three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date.   2.8 CLOSING OF THE
COMPANY\'S TRANSFER BOOKS. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of such capital stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of
any such shares of the Company\'s capital stock shall be made on such stock
transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a
valid certificate previously representing any of such shares of
the Company\'s capital stock (a "Company Stock Certificate") is presented to
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall
be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section 2.9.   2.9
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; ESCROW.   (a) At the Closing, Parent shall, for
each Merger Stockholder who surrenders a Company Stock Certificate for
cancellation to Parent, together with the letter of transmittal in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit G ("Letter of Transmittal"), duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, pay to each such
Merger Stockholder, without interest, the cash amount set forth in Section
2.5(b)(i) for the number of shares of Common Stock previously represented by
such Company Stock Certificate, payable as set forth in the Letter of
Transmittal. If any Merger Stockholder fails to surrender a Company Stock
Certificate or Letter of Transmittal at or prior to Closing, Parent shall not
pay the portion of the Merger Consideration applicable to the related shares
of Common Stock and Parent shall deposit such portion of the Merger
Consideration in a segregated account maintained by the Surviving Corporation
for the benefit of such Merger Stockholder. Promptly upon delivery of such
Company Stock Certificate and Letter of Transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
Surviving Corporation shall pay to such Merger Stockholder, without interest,
the cash   13   amount set forth in Section 2.5(b)(i) for the number of
shares of Common Stock previously represented by such Company Stock
Certificate, payable as set forth in the Letter of Transmittal. Parent may,
in its sole and reasonable discretion, waive the requirement of a Company
Stock Certificate or Letter of Transmittal for any or all such Merger
Stockholders. Immediately prior to the Closing, each Company Stock
Certificate representing shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to
represent the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares
of Preferred Stock have converted, without the necessity of any reissuance of
such Company Stock Certificate; it being understood that, pursuant to the
Charter Amendment, each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible into
one share of Common Stock.   (b) At the Closing, Parent shall deliver to
The Bank of New York, as escrow agent, or, if The Bank of New York shall not
agree to serve as escrow agent, to such other bank or trust company as may be
mutually agreed by Parent and the Company (the "Escrow Agent"), pursuant to
an Escrow Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit H,
subject to reasonable changes required by Escrow Agent and reasonably
acceptable to Parent, the Company and the Stockholders\' Agent (the "Escrow
Agreement"), (i) $5,000,000 of the Merger Consideration (the "Indemnity
Escrow Amount") and (ii) $1,000,000 of the Merger Consideration or such
greater amount as is determined in accordance with the following sentence
(the "Merger Consideration Escrow Amount"), each by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. If Parent has delivered the Parent Estimate to
the Company pursuant to Section 2.6(a), the Merger Consideration Escrow
Amount shall be increased in an amount equal to the difference between the
Estimated Net Working Capital and the Parent Estimate; provided,
however, that the Merger Consideration Escrow Amount shall in no event exceed
$3,000,000.   (c) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.9,
each Company Stock Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Effective
Time, to represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the delivery of the Per Share Merger Consideration to the owner of such
Company Stock Certificate, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Company Stock Certificate to make an affidavit of that fact and to
deliver an appropriate indemnity or surety bond as security against any claim
that may be made against Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to
such Company Stock Certificate.   (d) Each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable or otherwise deliverable to any holder or former holder of capital
stock of the Company pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent or the
Surviving Corporation is required to deduct or withhold therefrom under the
Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent
such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom
such amounts would otherwise have been paid.   (e) Neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder or former holder of
capital stock of the Company for any cash amounts delivered to any public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.   14    2.10 DISSENTING SHARES. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, any shares ("Dissenting Shares") of
Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands
payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the "DGCL Appraisal
Procedures") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, in accordance with Sections 2.5
and 2.9, but rather the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to
payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
DGCL Appraisal Procedures; provided, however, that if any such holder shall
fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
receive payment of the fair value of such holder\'s Dissenting Shares under
the DGCL Appraisal Procedures, then the right of such holder to be paid the
fair value of such holder\'s Dissenting Shares shall cease and such
Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective
Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration, in accordance with Sections 2.5 and 2.9.
The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub of any demands
received by the Company for payment of the fair value of any shares of Common
Stock (including a copy of each demand). Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to or settle or offer to settle, any such demands or
agree to do any of the foregoing. From and after the Effective Time, the
Merger Stockholders, joint and severally, shall be responsible for all
payments, solely through and to the extent of the Indemnity Escrow Amount and
any interest earned thereon (the "Indemnity Escrow Funds"), with respect to
Dissenting Shares, including without limitation, all expense associated with
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal required
under the DGCL, in excess of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration
that would have been payable to the holders of Dissenting Shares.   2.11
FURTHER ACTION. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action
is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation or Parent
with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of
Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub,
in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.   ARTICLE
III  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   The Company represents
and warrants to and for the benefit of the Parent and Merger Sub as
follows:   3.1 ORGANIZATION OF THE COMPANY.   (a) The Company is a

Merger Consideration.   10.3 INDEMNIFICATION BY PARENT. Subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article X, from and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall hold harmless and indemnify each of the Stockholder Indemnitees
from and against, and shall compensate and reimburse each of the Stockholder
Indemnitees for, any Damages which are suffered or incurred by any of the
Stockholder Indemnitees or to which any of the Stockholder Indemnitees may
otherwise become subject (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to
any third-party claim) and which arise from or as a result of, or are
connected with: (a) any misrepresentation in, inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement or any agreement,
certificate or instrument furnished or to be furnished to the Company or the
Stockholders\' Agent pursuant hereto or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby; (b) any breach of any covenant or obligation of Parent
or Merger Sub (including the covenants set forth in Article V); or (c) any
Legal Proceeding relating to any inaccuracy or breach of the type referred to
in clause (a) or (b) above (including any Legal Proceeding commenced by any
Stockholder Indemnitee for the purpose of enforcing any of its rights under
this Article X). Any amount of Damages required to be indemnified pursuant to
this Section 10.3 shall be deemed, to the extent permitted by law, an
adjustment in the Merger Consideration. Any claims for indemnification
pursuant to this Section 10.3 shall be made by the Stockholders\' Agent on
behalf of any Stockholder Indemnitee. The Stockholder Indemnitees may not
make any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 10.3(a) (except
for claims with respect to Sections 4.1, 4.2(a) and 4.4) until the aggregate
Damages incurred by the Stockholder Indemnitees for which indemnification may
be sought exceeds $750,000, at which point the Stockholder Indemnitees shall
only be entitled to seek indemnification for the amount by which such Damages
exceed $750,000.   10.4 NO CONTRIBUTION. Each Stockholder Indemnitor
waives, and acknowledges and agrees that such Stockholder Indemnitor shall
not have and shall not exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert),
any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy
against Merger Sub, the Company or the Surviving Corporation in connection
with any indemnification obligation or any other liability to which he may
become subject under or in connection with this Agreement, other than as
contemplated by Section 5.10.   10.5 OFFSET.   (a) The amount of Damages
pursuant to this Article X shall be is reduced by the amount of any insurance
coverage (net of (i) any out-of-pocket expenses, (ii) any increase in
premiums or (iii) any deductible incurred in obtaining such reduction).
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement including this Section
10.5, there shall be no affirmative obligation or duty on the part of any
party to obtain insurance (other than pursuant to Section 5.10(b)) with
respect to any aspect of their respective businesses, operations or assets.
In connection with any Damages for which an Indemnitee may
seek indemnification under this Article X, such Indemnitee shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to seek and pursue any   57   available
insurance coverage or other claims against third parties that such Indemnitee
may have in respect of such Damages. If the Indemnitee receives any such
amounts subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnitor in respect
of such Damages, then such Indemnitee shall promptly reimburse the Indemnitor
up to the above amounts so received by the Indemnitee, net of any Taxes and
collection costs. In computing the amount of any Damages for purposes of
determining the liability of an Indemnitor under this Article X, the
amount of any Tax benefit actually realized in cash by the Indemnitee arising
from the incurrence or payment of any such Damages shall be deducted from
such Damages and Damages shall include any Tax detriment incurred.   (b)
For purposes of calculating the amount of any Damages, any reserve for the
specific matter that gave rise to such Damages shall be taken into account in
calculating such Damages (to the extent that such reserve is not otherwise
taken in account in such calculation) if and to the extent that such reserve
was set forth on the Closing Date Balance Sheet and taken into account as a
current liability in the calculation of Actual Net Working Capital.   10.6
DEMANDS. If any Indemnitee believes such Indemnitee is entitled to
be indemnified by any Indemnitor pursuant to this Article X with respect to
any demand, assertion, claim, action or proceeding, judicial or otherwise, by
any third party (such third party demand, assertion, claim, action or
proceeding being referred to herein as a "Third Party Claim"), such
Indemnitee agrees that, promptly upon its discovery of facts giving rise to a
claim for indemnity under the provisions of this Agreement with respect to
such Third Party Claim, such Indemnitee will give prompt notice thereof in
writing to Parent, if the Indemnitee is any Stockholder Indemnitee, or to the
Stockholders\' Agent on behalf of the Merger Stockholders, if the Indemnitee
is any Parent Indemnitee, together with a statement of such information
respecting any of the foregoing as such party shall have. Such notice shall
include a formal demand for indemnification under this Agreement. Failure of
the Indemnitee to give such notice in a timely manner shall not relieve the
Indemnitor from any liability which it may have on account of this Article X
or otherwise, except to the extent that the Indemnitor is materially
prejudiced thereby.   10.7 RIGHT TO CONTEST AND DEFEND. The Indemnitor shall
be entitled at its cost and expense to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim for which it has received notice from the Indemnitee under
Section 10.6 and, subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 10.7,
shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel (reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnitee) for such defense; provided that the
Indemnitor shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel only if (i)
the claim involves (and continues to involve) solely monetary damages, (ii)
the Indemnitor expressly agrees in writing to the Indemnitee that, as between
the two, the Indemnitor is solely obligated to satisfy and discharge the
claim and (iii) the Indemnitor makes reasonably adequate provision to satisfy
the Indemnitee of the Indemnitor\'s ability to satisfy and discharge the
claim (the foregoing collectively, the "Litigation Conditions"); provided,
however, that the Indemnitor shall forfeit the right to control the defense
or settlement of any such claim if, at any time after assuming the defense or
settlement thereof, the Indemnitor no longer satisfies the Litigation
Conditions; provided, further, that notice of the intention to so control the
defense or settlement shall be delivered by the Indemnitor to the Indemnitee
within twenty (20) days (or sooner, if the nature of the Third Party claim so
requires) from the date of receipt by the Indemnitor of notice by
the Indemnitee of the assertion of the Third Party Claim. Any such contest
may be conducted in the name and on behalf of the Indemnitor or the  
58   Indemnitee, as may be appropriate. Such contest shall be conducted by
reputable counsel employed by the Indemnitor, but the Indemnitee shall have
the right, but not the obligation, to participate in such proceedings and to
be represented by counsel of its own choosing at its sole cost and expense.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the election by the Indemnitor to assume
the defense, the Indemnitor shall be liable for the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnitee, if and only to the extent
that (i) the Indemnitor has not employed counsel to assume the defense of
such action within a reasonable time after receiving notice of the
commencement of the action, (ii) the employment of counsel and the amount
reimbursable therefor by the Indemnitee has been authorized in writing by the
Indemnitor or (iii) representation of the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee by
the same counsel would, in the reasonable opinion of such counsel, constitute
a conflict of interest under applicable standards of professional conduct.
The Indemnitor shall have full authority to determine all action to be taken
with respect to a Third Party Claim the defense of which it has assumed in
accordance with this Section 10.7; provided, however, that the Indemnitor
will not have the authority to subject the Indemnitee to any non-monetary
relief whatsoever, other than the performance of purely ministerial tasks,
and any settlement of a claim must include a full release of the Indemnitee.
If the Indemnitor does not elect to assume the control of the defense of any
such Third Party Claim, fails to notify the Indemnitee of its election as
herein provided or fails to satisfy the Litigation Conditions, the Indemnitee
may pay, compromise or defend such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that
the Indemnitee shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitor
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before
entering into any settlement of such Third Party Claim.   10.8 COOPERATION.
The Indemnitor and the Indemnitee agree to cooperate with each other and
their respective counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim or, if
appropriate, in making any counterclaim against the Person asserting
the Third Party Claim, or any cross-complaint against any other Person,
including giving each other reasonable access to all information relevant
thereto, subject to receipt of a reasonable confidentiality agreement. The
Indemnitor shall be obliged to reimburse the Indemnitee for the reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses related to such cooperation.   10.9 LIMITATIONS ON
INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS; SOLE RECOURSE. The aggregate indemnification
obligations of the Merger Stockholders pursuant to Section 10.2(a) shall not
exceed the Indemnity Escrow Funds (it being understood that Parent may
recover the Merger Consideration Escrow Funds to the extent provided in
Section 2.6). Subject to the rights of Parent to recover the
Merger Consideration Escrow Funds to the extent provided in Section 2.6, the
Indemnity Escrow Funds shall be the sole and exclusive source of funding for
any claims for indemnification by any Parent Indemnitee hereunder and once
the Indemnity Escrow Funds have been released from escrow pursuant to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement, such funds shall cease to be subject to any
claims for indemnification by any Parent Indemnitee; provided, however, that
such limitations shall not apply to Damages resulting from fraud or
intentional misrepresentation on the part of the Company or any Stockholder
Indemnitor, as applicable. The aggregate indemnification obligations of
Parent pursuant to Section 10.3 shall not exceed $5,000,000; provided,
however, that such limitation shall not apply to Damages resulting from fraud
or intentional misrepresentation on the part of Parent. The Stockholder
Indemnitees\' right to seek indemnification pursuant to this Article X shall
expire on the Parent Expiration Date; provided, however, that if, at any time
prior to the Parent Expiration Date, any Stockholder   59   Indemnitee
(acting in good faith) delivers to Parent a written notice alleging the
existence of any matter for which such Stockholder Indemnitee is entitled
to recovery under Section 10.3 (and setting forth in reasonable detail the
basis for such Stockholder Indemnitee\'s belief that such Stockholder
Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification) and asserting a claim for recovery
under Section 10.3, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the
applicable Parent Expiration Date until such time as such claim is fully and
finally resolved. From and after the Effective Time, other than with respect
to claims under Sections 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.9, 5.10 and 12.2, the remedies set
forth in this Article X shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedies for
monetary Damages for breach of this Agreement, except for fraud or
intentional misrepresentation.   10.10 MISCELLANEOUS.   (a) For purposes
of determining whether there has been any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in this
Agreement or in any agreement, certificate or instrument furnished or to be
furnished pursuant hereto or in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and for purposes of calculating the amount of Damages to which an
Indemnitee is entitled as a result of any such inaccuracy or breach, such
representation or warranty shall not be deemed qualified by any concept of
"material," "materiality," "Material Adverse Effect" or other
similar qualification; provided, however, that this Section 10.10(a) shall
not apply to the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.6(a),
3.6(d), 3.9, 3.11(a), 3.12(b), 3.12(c) and 3.15(b)(vii) and the first
sentence of Section 3.26(a).   (b) No right of indemnification hereunder
shall be limited by reason of any investigation or audit conducted before or
after the Closing or the knowledge of any party of any breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement by the other party at any
time, or the decision of any party to complete the Closing.   (c)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, no limitation or
condition of liability or indemnity shall apply to any rights or claims based
upon fraudulent or intentional misrepresentation.   (d) The limitations on
the indemnification obligations set forth in Sections 10.2 and 10.3 shall not
apply to any covenants or agreements of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in
this Agreement.   ARTICLE XI  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS   11.1 SCHEDULES.
The Schedules attached to this Agreement (i) shall not be construed as
indicating that any matter disclosed therein is required to be disclosed, as
some matters stated therein are given for informational purposes only, nor
shall such disclosure be construed as an admission that such information is
material to the Company or Parent, as the case may be, and (ii) shall be
deemed to disclose any matter disclosed on any particular schedule on any
other schedule where it is apparent on the face of the disclosure and without
reference to any separate or independent document or information (other than
the Schedules) that such disclosure would be specifically applicable to such
other schedule.   60    11.2 FURTHER ASSURANCES. Each party hereto shall
execute and cause to be delivered to each other party hereto such instruments
and other documents, and shall take such other actions, as such other party
may reasonably request (prior to, at or after the Closing) for the purpose of
carrying out or evidencing any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   11.3 FEES AND EXPENSES. Each of the Company, the Stockholders,
the Stockholders\' Agent and Parent (with respect to itself and Merger Sub),
shall bear and pay all fees, costs and expenses (including legal fees and
accounting fees) that have been incurred or that are incurred by such party
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
all fees, costs and expenses incurred by such party in connection with or by
virtue of (a) the investigation and review conducted by Parent and its
Representatives with respect to the Company\'s business (and the furnishing
of information to Parent and its Representatives in connection with such
investigation and review), (b) the negotiation, preparation and review of
this Agreement (including the Schedules hereto) and all agreements,
certificates, opinions and other instruments and documents delivered or to be
delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(c) the preparation and submission of any filing or notice required to be
made or given in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the obtaining of any consent required to be obtained in
connection with any of such transactions, and (d) the consummation of the
Merger, including any retention bonuses, "success" fees, change of control
payments and any other payment obligations payable as a result of the
consummation of the Merger (other than, with respect to the Company, any
retention bonuses, success fees or similar employee retention payment put in
place after the date hereof at the written request of Parent and any
severance obligations owed to an employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary as a result of the termination of employment of such
employee by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Company Subsidiary after
the Effective Time, which shall be deemed to be Transaction Fees and Expenses
of Parent) (collectively, the "Transaction Fees and Expenses").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any filing fees payable in connection with
filings made pursuant to the HSR Act shall be split equally between Parent
and the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, one half of any fees payable
at the Closing to the Escrow Agent shall be considered Transaction Fees and
Expenses of Parent and one half of any fees payable at the Closing to the
Escrow Agent shall be considered Transaction Fees and Expenses of the
Company.   11.4 ATTORNEYS\' FEES. If any action or proceeding relating to
this Agreement or the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement is
brought against any party hereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover reasonable attorneys\' fees, costs and disbursements (in addition to
any other relief to which the prevailing party may be entitled).   11.5
NOTICES. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be
delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall

by this Agreement, time is of the essence.   11.8 HEADINGS. The underlined
headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only,
shall not be deemed to be a part of this Agreement and shall not be referred
to in connection with the construction or interpretation of this
Agreement.   11.9 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original and all of which,

CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. This Agreement, and all agreements, documents and
instruments delivered pursuant hereto or incorporated herein, unless
otherwise expressly provided therein, shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York (without giving
effect to principles of conflicts of laws); provided, however, that with
regard to issues and questions of corporate law where the laws of the State
of New York are not applicable, such issues and questions concerning
the application, construction, validity, interpretation and enforcement of
this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law or
conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of any other laws. Each
party hereto, for itself and its successors and assigns, irrevocably agrees
that any Legal Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall
be instituted only in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York located in the City of New York or, in the absence of
jurisdiction, the Supreme Court of New York located in the City of New York,
and generally and unconditionally accepts and irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and irrevocably agrees to be
bound by any final judgment rendered thereby from which no appeal has been
taken or is available in connection with this Agreement. Each party, for
itself and its successors and assigns, irrevocably waives any objection it
may have now or hereafter to the laying of the venue of any such Legal
Proceeding, including, without limitation, any objection based on the grounds
of forum non conveniens, in the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties, for
itself and its successors and assigns, irrevocably agrees that all process in
any such Legal Proceedings in any such court may be effected by mailing a

11.5 or at such other address of which the other parties shall have been
notified in accordance with the provisions of   63   Section 11.5, such
service being hereby acknowledged by the parties to be effective and binding
service in every respect. Nothing herein shall affect the right to serve

Merger Sub shall be deemed to apply to such Subsidiary and such Subsidiary
shall be made a party signatory hereto. Except as set forth in the previous

available to it) to (a) a decree or order of specific performance or mandamus
to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant, obligation or
other provision, and (b) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened
breach.   11.13 WAIVER.   (a) No failure on the part of any Person to
exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no
delay on the part of any Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or
remedy under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right,
privilege or remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power,
right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy.   (b) No Person
shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of this Agreement or any
power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of
such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a
written instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such Person; and
any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the
specific instance in which it is given.   11.14 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. Each
of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by

Merger Stockholders); and (b) after the Closing Date, on behalf of Parent and
the Stockholders\' Agent (acting exclusively for and on behalf of all of
the Merger Stockholders).   11.16 SEVERABILITY. In the event that any
provision of this Agreement or the application of any such provision to any
Person or set of circumstances, shall be determined to be invalid, unlawful,
void or unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of this Agreement, and the
application of such provision to Persons or circumstances other than those as
to which it is determined to be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable,
shall not be impaired or otherwise affected and shall continue to be valid
and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.   11.17 PARTIES IN
INTEREST. Except for the provisions of Sections 2.5, 2.6, 2.9 and 5.10 and
Articles X and XII, none of the provisions of this Agreement is intended to
confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns (if any)) any rights or remedies of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.   11.18 ENTIRE
AGREEMENT. This Agreement and the other agreements referred to herein set

matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements

its terms until the earlier of (a) the Effective Time or (b) the date on

used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and variations
thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."   (d) Except as
otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to "Articles,"
"Sections," "Schedules" and "Exhibits" are intended to refer to Articles and
Sections of this Agreement and Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement.
