 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations and warranties and mutual covenants contained in this Agreement and of other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, do hereby agree as follows: 

  

    
ARTICLE I 

  

  _The Offer 
_

  

 SECTION 1.01 _ The Offer_ (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with _Section 8.01_ hereof and provided further that the Company is prepared (in accordance with _Section 1.02(c)_) to file the Schedule 14D-9 on the same date as Merger Sub commences the Offer, as promptly as practicable after the Agreement Date (and in any event, subject to the Company being prepared to file the Schedule 14D-9, no later than ten (10) Business Days after the date of initial public announcement of this Agreement), Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ ")), the Offer to purchase any and all of the outstanding Shares at the Offer Price. The obligation of Merger Sub to      

accept for payment or pay for any Shares validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to (i) the condition
that there shall be validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the
Offer, prior to the scheduled expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended
hereunder) and not properly withdrawn, a number of Shares that, together with
the Shares then directly or indirectly owned by Parent, represents at least a
majority of all Fully Diluted Shares immediately prior to the Share Acceptance
Time (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") and (ii) the conditions set forth in Annex
II and no other conditions (together with the Minimum Condition, the "
_Offer Conditions_ "). Merger Sub, or Parent on behalf of Merger Sub,
expressly reserves the right to waive, in its sole discretion, in whole or in
part, any of the Offer Conditions and to make any change in the terms of or
conditions to the Offer; provided that unless otherwise provided by this
Agreement or previously approved by the Company in writing (which approval may
be granted or withheld by the Company in its sole discretion), (A) the
Minimum Condition may not be waived or amended, (B) no change may be made that
changes the form of consideration to be paid pursuant to the Offer, decreases
the Offer Price or the number of Company Shares sought in the Offer, imposes
conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth in Annex II, or
otherwise amends or modifies the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders
of Shares, and (C) the Offer may not be extended except as set forth in this
_Section 1.01_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Offer shall expire at midnight, New York City time, on the date that
is twenty (20) business days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
under the Exchange Act) following the commencement of the Offer (such time,
the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ," and such time, or such subsequent time to
which the expiration of the Offer is extended in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with _Section 8.01_, Merger Sub (i) may, in its sole discretion,
without consent of the Company, without limiting Parent\'s or Merger
Sub\'s obligations under the following sentence, extend the Offer on one or
more occasions, in consecutive increments of up to ten (10) Business Days
each, for any period up to and including the Outside Date if on any then-
scheduled Expiration Date any of the Offer Conditions have not been satisfied
or waived in writing by Merger Sub (or Parent on its behalf), until
such Expiration Date on which all Offer Conditions shall then be satisfied
or, to the extent permitted, waived and (ii) shall extend the Offer for any
period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or The NASDAQ Stock Market
applicable to the Offer. Parent and Merger Sub agree that except to the
extent otherwise agreed in writing by the Company prior to any then-scheduled
Expiration Date, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to)
extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive increments of up to
ten (10) Business Days each, up to and including the Outside Date, if on any
then-scheduled Expiration Date any of the Offer Conditions have not been
satisfied or waived in writing by Merger Sub (or Parent on its behalf), until
such Expiration Date on which all Offer Conditions shall then be satisfied
or, to the extent permitted, waived; _provided_ , _however_ , that Merger Sub
shall not be required to extend the Offer pursuant to this sentence beyond
the Outside Date or after the Company delivers, or is required to deliver, to
Parent a notice in accordance with _Section 5.02_ with respect to a Takeover
Proposal that has been received at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the
then-scheduled Expiration Date by the Company, its Subsidiaries, or any
Representative of the Company, except to the extent that prior to the then-
scheduled Expiration Date (i) the Takeover Proposal giving rise to such notice
has been withdrawn or the Company Board has rejected the Takeover Proposal
giving rise to such notice, (ii) the Company Board has reconfirmed the Board
Recommendation, and (iii) the withdrawal or rejection of such Takeover
Proposal or the reconfirmation of the Board Recommendation shall have been
publicly announced by the Company. Following expiration of the Offer, Merger
Sub (or Parent on its behalf) may, in its sole discretion, provide a
subsequent offering period or one or more extensions thereof (a " _Subsequent
Offering Period_ ") in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act, if, as
of the commencement of such period, there shall not have been validly
tendered (without regard to Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery
procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of
such guarantee), and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that

        

number of Shares necessary to permit the Merger to be effected without a
meeting of stockholders of the Company in accordance with Section 253(a) of
the DGCL. Subject to the foregoing, including the requirements of Rule 14d-11
of the Exchange Act, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the
Offer, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept for
payment and pay for, as promptly as practicable, (1) after the Expiration
Date, all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer and/or (2) all Shares validly tendered in any Subsequent Offering
Period. The Company agrees that no Shares held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries will be tendered pursuant to the Offer. Merger Sub shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to the Offer to any holder of Shares such amounts as Merger Sub is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Laws relating to
Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Tax authority by Merger Sub, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made by
Merger Sub. Merger Sub shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled
Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01_. If this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01_, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, promptly, irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the
Offer and shall not acquire the Shares pursuant thereto. If the Offer is
terminated by Merger Sub, or this Agreement is terminated prior to the
purchase of Shares in the Offer, Merger Sub shall promptly return, and shall
cause any depositary acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, in accordance
with applicable Law, all tendered Shares that have not then been purchased in
the Offer to the registered holders thereof.

  

  

 (b) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) file a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, and supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_") with the SEC, which shall contain an Offer to Purchase reflecting the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and a form of the letter of transmittal and summary advertisement and other ancillary Offer documents and instruments, if any, in respect of the Offer (together with the Schedule TO, collectively, together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "), and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub in writing all information concerning the Company that may be required by applicable Law or reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Merger Sub agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO, as so corrected or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents, as so corrected or supplemented, to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as, and to the extent, required by applicable Law. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule TO before it is filed with the SEC, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly provide the Company and its counsel with copies of any written comments or communications, and shall inform them of any oral comments or communications, that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive after the Agreement Date from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of those comments or other communications. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any written responses to such SEC comments and Parent and Merger Sub shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. 

  

      

  

 (c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

 (b) The Company shall promptly after the Agreement Date and from time to time thereafter as requested by Parent or its agents, furnish Parent with an updated list of its stockholders, non-objecting beneficial owners, mailing labels and any available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories, in each case as of the most recent practicable date, and shall provide to Parent such additional information (including updated lists of stockholders, non-objecting beneficial holders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such assistance as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the Offer. In addition, in connection with the Offer, the Company shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any third parties to, cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub to disseminate the Offer Documents to holders of Shares held in or subject to any Company Stock Plan or other Company Benefit Plan, and to permit such holders of Shares to tender Shares in the Offer. 

  

 (c) On the date the Schedule TO is filed with the SEC, or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the Company shall file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of Shares a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with any amendments or supplements thereto and including any exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") that shall reflect the terms and conditions of this Agreement and, subject to _Section 5.02(d)_ and _Section 5.02(e)_, shall reflect the Board Recommendation and shall include a description of the other Board Actions. The Company shall also include in the Schedule 14D-9, and represents that it has obtained all necessary consents of the Company Financial Advisor to permit the Company to include in the Schedule 14D-9, in its entirety, the Fairness Opinion, together with a summary thereof. The Company also hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of a description of the Board Actions, the other approvals set forth in _Section 1.02(a)_, the Fairness Opinion and, to the extent that no Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred in accordance with _Section 5.02(d)_, the Company consents to the inclusion of the Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect. The Company agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as, and to the extent, required by applicable Law. Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company shall give due consideration to

counsel.

After the Share Acceptance Time, the Company shall also use its best efforts to cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the number of members, rounded up to the next whole number, on (i) each committee of the Company Board and (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of each of the Company\'s Subsidiaries (and each committee (or similar body) thereof, if any) that represents the same percentage as such individuals represent on the Company Board. After the Acceptance Time, the Company shall also, upon Merger Sub\'s request, take all action necessary to elect to be treated as a "controlled company" as defined by NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5615 and make all necessary filings and disclosures associated with such status.

A " _Continuing Director_ " shall mean a person who is a member of the Company Board as of the Agreement Date or a person selected by the Continuing Directors then in office, each of whom shall be an "independent director" as defined by Rule 5605 (a)(2) of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules and eligible to serve on the Company\'s audit committee under the Exchange Act and NASDAQ Marketplace Rules and, at least one of whom shall be an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto; _provided_ , _however_ that if the number of Continuing Directors is reduced to less than three (3) prior to the Effective Time, any remaining Continuing Directors (or Continuing Director, if there shall be only one (1) remaining) shall be entitled to designate a person to fill such vacancy who is not an officer, director, stockholder or designee of Parent or any of its Affiliates and who shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for all purposes of this Agreement, or, if no Continuing Directors then remain, the other directors shall designate three (3) persons to fill such 

        

vacancies who are not officers, directors, stockholders or designees of
Parent or any of its Affiliates, and such persons shall be deemed to be
Continuing Directors for all purposes of this Agreement.

  

  

 (b) The Company\'s obligations to appoint Parent\'s designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this _Section 1.03_ including mailing to stockholders of the Company the information required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to enable Parent\'s designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board, provided that Parent or Merger Sub shall have provided to the Company on a timely basis all information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. Parent shall supply to the Company in writing and be solely responsible for any information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 under the Exchange Act. 

  

 (c) Following the election or appointment of Parent\'s designees pursuant to _Section 1.03(a)_ and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall be required to authorize (and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Company Board and, in the case of the following clauses (i) through (iii), inclusive, no other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any other director of the Company, shall be required to authorize) any of the following actions (which actions may be effected only if there are then in office one (1) or more Continuing Directors): (i) any amendment or termination of this Agreement by or with the consent of the Company, (ii) any extension of time for performance of any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Merger Sub, (iii) any waiver or exercise of any of the Company\'s rights or remedies under this Agreement, including the granting of any approval or consent of the Company required pursuant to the terms hereof and the waiver of compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company, and (iv) the taking of any action by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would prevent or would materially delay the consummation of the Merger in accordance with this Agreement. 

  

  

 SECTION 1.04 _ Top-Up Option._ (a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this _Section 1.04_, to purchase that number of newly issued Shares (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares directly or indirectly owned by Parent at the time of such exercise, constitutes one share more than ninety percent (90%) of the Fully Diluted Shares immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares at a price per share equal to the Offer Price; provided that in no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable to the extent the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up Option would exceed the Company\'s then authorized and unissued Shares (giving effect to Shares reserved for issuance under the options then outstanding under the Company Stock Plans, as if such Shares were outstanding). 

  

  

 (b) Merger Sub may exercise the Top-Up Option in whole but not in part, on one or more occasions at any time after the Share Acceptance Time and prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. In the event that Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, it shall notify the Company in writing, and shall set forth in such notice: (A) the number of Shares that will be owned by Parent and Merger Sub immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, (B) the denominations of the certificate or certificates evidencing the Top-Up Option Shares and (C) the place and time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares by Merger Sub, which shall not be more than five (5) Business Days after delivery of such notice (the " _Top-Up Closing_ "). The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, notify Merger Sub of the number of Shares then outstanding, the number of Fully Diluted Shares, the number of 

  

      

  

Top-Up Option Shares and the aggregate purchase price therefor (calculated by
multiplying the number of such Top-Up Option Shares by the Offer Price). In
addition, upon Parent\'s request, the Company shall cause its transfer agent
to certify in writing to Parent the number of Shares issued and outstanding as
of immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option and after giving
effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. At the Top-Up Closing,
Parent or Merger Sub shall pay the Company the aggregate purchase price for
the Top-Up Option Shares and the Company shall cause to be issued to Merger
Sub a certificate or certificates representing the Top-Up Option Shares in
such denominations as was requested by Merger Sub. The aggregate purchase
price for the Top-Up Shares may be paid by Merger Sub or Parent in whole or in
part in cash and by executing and delivering to the Company an unsecured
promissory note having a principal amount equal to the balance of the
aggregate purchase price for the Top-Up Option Shares, provided that an
amount equal to at least the par value of the Top-Up Option Shares shall be
paid in cash. Any such promissory note shall bear interest at the applicable
federal rate as determined for U.S. income tax purposes, shall mature on the
first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such promissory
note and may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty.

  

 (c) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares is accomplished consistent with all applicable Law (provided that for purposes of this _Section 1.04_, applicable Law shall not include any rules or regulations of the NASDAQ Stock Market or any other stock exchange). Consistent therewith, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Shares that Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares an "accredited investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

ARTICLE III 

  

  _Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Corporations; 
Exchange Fund; Company Equity Awards 
_

   

 SECTION 3.01 _ Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any Shares or any shares of capital stock of Parent or Merger Sub: 

  

  

 (a) _ Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, no par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) _ Cancellation of Treasury Stock, Parent-Owned Stock_. Each Share that is directly owned of record by the Company, any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, by Parent or by Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

      

                                     

   

  

 (c) _ Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section 3.01(b)_ and, except as provided in _Section 3.01(d)_, the Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") payable net to the holder in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law. At the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of (x) a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ ") or (y) any such uncertificated Shares (collectively, the " _Uncertificated Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (d) _ Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.01(c)_, but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. At the Effective Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder of Appraisal Shares shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder\'s Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.01(c)_, without interest. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing. 

  

  

 SECTION 3.02 _ Exchange Fund_. 

  

  

 (a) _ Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration and, in connection therewith, shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company. Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent at the Effective Time cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). 

   

 (b) _ Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of Shares (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent and which shall otherwise be in customary form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and Parent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and the transfer of Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of record of Shares shall, (x) upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may 

  

      

  
  

reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, or (y) upon receipt of an
"agent\'s message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the amount of cash that the number of Shares previously represented
by such Certificate or the Uncertificated Shares, as applicable, shall have
been converted into the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_, and
any Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares which are not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered or
the Uncertificated Shares so transferred is registered if such Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and
the Person requesting such payment shall pay any fiduciary or surety bonds or
any transfer or other similar taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Uncertificated Shares
shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Uncertificated Shares are
registered. Until surrendered or transferred as contemplated by this _Section
3.02(b)_, each Certificate and each Uncertificated Share shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Merger Consideration that the holder thereof has the right
to receive in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares pursuant
to this _Article III_. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash
payable to holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article III_.

   

 (c) _ No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates or the transfer of Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article III _shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares, as applicable. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, they shall be canceled against delivery of cash to the holder thereof as provided in this _Article III_. 

  

 (d) _ Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Shares for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III _shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for, payment of their claims for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_. 

   

 (e) _ No Liability._ None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in compliance with any applicable state, Federal or other abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Uncertificated Shares shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which the related Merger Consideration would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such time become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (f) _ Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Paying Agent shall invest or hold the cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid solely to Parent. Nothing contained herein and no investment losses resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall diminish the rights of any holder of Shares 

  

      

  
  

to receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein and in the event the
funds on deposit with the Paying Agent are insufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with
the Paying Agent such additional funds to ensure that the Paying Agent has
funds sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration.

  

 (g) _ Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond or surety in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto. 

  

 (h) _ Withholding Rights._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares, any holder of a Company Stock Option or any holder of Company Restricted Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares, the holder of the Company Stock Option or the holder of Company Restricted Stock, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

  

  

 SECTION 3.03 _ Company Equity Awards_. (a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Agreement Date, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering any Company Stock Plan) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take all other actions as may be required to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) each unexercised Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, shall be canceled, and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of each such canceled Company Stock Option shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such Company Stock Option and in settlement therefor, an amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with _Section 3.02(h)_) equal to (A) the excess, if any, of (1) the Merger Consideration over (2) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock previously subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (B) the total number of Shares previously subject to such Company Stock Option, whether or not vested (such amount, the " _Option Amount_ "), and (ii) each share of Company Restricted Stock shall vest in full in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan and the Shares issued thereunder shall be canceled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_. All amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 3.03_ shall be paid as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, and in any event no later than ten (10) calendar days after the Effective Time, without interest, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make such payments as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time in accordance with the foregoing and the terms of the Company Stock Options or the applicable Company Stock Plans pursuant to which they were issued (as modified pursuant hereto). 

  

  

 (b) Prior to the Share Acceptance Time, except as otherwise agreed to by the parties, the Company shall take such action such that the Company Stock Plans shall terminate as of the Effective Time. As promptly as practicable following the Agreement Date, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering any Company Stock Plan) shall adopt such 

  

      

  

resolutions or take such other actions as are required to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this _Section 3.03_.

  

 (c) With respect to the ESPP, any offering period which had commenced prior to the Agreement Date shall continue, and the Shares shall be issued to participants of the ESPP on the next currently scheduled purchase date thereunder occurring after the Agreement Date and prior to the Effective Time as provided under, and in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. With respect to any offering period that would by its terms continue past the Effective Time, the Company Board (or an appropriate committee under the ESPP) shall take such action as is necessary to terminate the ESPP on the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date, and each participant\'s accumulated payroll deductions shall be used to purchase Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the ESPP, and the Shares purchased thereunder shall be canceled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.01(c) _.

Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable Law) in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 (b) _ Subsidiaries and Minority Investments._ (i) _Section 4.01(b)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists, as of the Agreement Date, each Subsidiary of the Company, the jurisdiction of organization thereof, and the directors and officers of each such Subsidiary.

immediately preceding clause (A).

  

 (iii) The Company has made available to Parent true, complete and correct copies of all Company Stock Plans and the forms of all stock option agreements and other award agreements evidencing outstanding Company Stock Options or shares of Company Restricted Stock. Each grant of Company Stock Options and shares of Company Restricted Stock was validly issued in all material respects in compliance with all applicable Law and properly approved by the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee or subcommittee thereof) and no such grants involved any "back dating," "forward dating" or similar practices with respect to the date of grant.

The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, subject, in the case of the Merger, to receipt of the Stockholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by each of the other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency and other Laws of general

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and compliance with the provisions
of this Agreement will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or

Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has and has had in effect all other Authorizations necessary for it to conduct its business as presently conducted, and all such Authorizations are in full force and effect, except for such Authorizations the absence of which or the failure of which to be in full force and effect, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. To the extent the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has assumed any Liability of PDL for prior periods, to the Company\'s Knowledge during the five (5) year period prior to the Agreement Date, PDL had all material Authorizations necessary for it to conduct its business during such period.

All Pharmaceutical Products of the Company and its Subsidiaries are being and have been developed, tested, manufactured, and stored by or, to the Knowledge of the Company, on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, to the Knowledge of the Company, by all Company Partners in compliance in all material respects with all applicable material requirements under all Drug Laws.

No clinical trial conducted by or on behalf of PDL during the five (5) year period prior to the Agreement Date, the Company or its Subsidiaries or any Company Partner with respect to Pharmaceutical Products of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been terminated or suspended by the FDA or any other Governmental Entity, and neither the FDA nor any other Governmental Entity has commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened to initiate, any action to place a clinical hold order on, or otherwise terminate, delay or suspend, any proposed or ongoing clinical trial conducted or proposed to be conducted by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (ii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, during the five (5) year period prior to the Agreement Date, PDL or any Company Partner has received any "regulatory letters" or "warning letters" and "Section 305 Notices" and similar letters or notices from any Governmental Entity concerning any Pharmaceutical Products of the Company and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, during the five (5) year period prior to the Agreement Date, PDL, or any Company Partner, is subject to, nor has received written notice of, any criminal,

 (iii) Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries have received, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, has any Company Partner received, any adverse drug experience reports that would make it reasonably likely that the Company\'s clinical studies, or clinical studies activities conducted on behalf of the Company, with respect to any Pharmaceutical Product should be discontinued for safety reasons or that would otherwise make the continuation of such studies commercially unreasonable or inadvisable. 

  

 (iv) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries (and, to the extent the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has assumed any Liability of PDL for prior periods, to the Company\'s Knowledge, during the five (5) year period prior to the Agreement Date, PDL), or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents or any other Persons acting on their behalf has violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78dd-1 et seq. or any other similar applicable foreign, federal, or state legal requirement, or has paid, accepted or received any unlawful contributions, payments, expenditures or gifts.

Separation Agreement. True and complete copies of all Company Material

Subsidiaries, nor to the Company\'s Knowledge any other party to a Company
Material Contract, has violated any provision of, or taken or failed to take
any action, which in any such case, with or without notice or lapse of time or

No Person leases, subleases, licenses or otherwise has a right to use or occupy any of the Leased Real Property except for the Company. No current use by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company of any Leased Real Property or any improvements thereon is dependent on a nonconforming use or other approval from a Governmental Entity, the absence of which would significantly limit the use of any of the 

  

      

  
  

properties or assets in the operation of the business of the Company as
currently conducted. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has assigned,
transferred, conveyed, mortgaged, deeded in trust or encumbered any interest
in the leasehold or subleasehold and the Company is not aware of any Lien,
other than a Permitted Lien, applicable to the Leased Real Property that would
reasonably be expected to materially impair the current uses or the occupancy
by the Company of the property subject thereto.

 (iv) Except as set forth in a Company Material Contract made available to Parent, none of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries has granted an exclusive license to any patents, patent applications or know how of the Company.

 SECTION 5.02 _ Solicitation._ (a) Subject to _Section 5.02(b)_:

purchase agreement, share exchange agreement, option agreement or other
similar Contract relating to an Takeover Proposal or enter into any Contract
or agreement in principle requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or

acquisition, purchase, or exclusive license of all or substantially all of
the Company\'s rights with respect to, in a single transaction or a series of
transactions, of (1) assets of the Company (including capital stock of the

combination of the foregoing, other than, in each case, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

 (ii) The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation, discussion or negotiation with any Person conducted theretofore by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives with respect to any actual or potential Takeover Proposal and request that all confidential information provided by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to such Person be returned or destroyed. 

    

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.02(a)_, if at any time from and after the Agreement Date and prior to the Share Acceptance Time, (i) the Company has received a written Takeover Proposal from a third party, (ii) the Company received such Takeover Proposal other than as a result of a material breach or violation of the terms of this _Section 5.02_, (iii) to the extent the Company is prohibited as a result of a confidentiality, non-disclosure or similar Contract from disclosing to Parent or its Representatives any discussions or negotiations between the Company or its Representatives and such Person, or any information that may be exchanged in connection with such discussions or negotiations, in each case as required by the provisions of this Agreement, such Person has provided the Company with a written acknowledgement that such discussions, negotiations and the information exchanged in connection therewith may be disclosed to Parent and its Representatives to the extent required by this Agreement (it being agreed that any inquiry by the Company, its Subsidiaries or the Company\'s Representatives made solely to determine whether such confidentiality, non-disclosure or similar Contract applies to discussions or negotiations between such Person and the Company shall not constitute a breach of the provisions of this _Section 5.02_) and (iv) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel, 

  

      

  

that (A) such Takeover Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead
to a Superior Proposal and (B) that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Company\'s stockholders
under applicable Law, then the Company may (x) furnish information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Takeover Proposal, and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with the
Person making such Takeover Proposal regarding such Takeover Proposal;
provided that (1) at least two (2) Business Days prior to engaging or
participating in any such discussions or negotiations with, or furnishing any
non-public information to, such Person, the Company gives Parent written
notice of the identity of such Person and all of the material terms and
conditions of such Takeover Proposal and of the Company\'s intention to engage
or participate in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish non-public
information to, such Person, (2) the Company does not, and does not allow its
Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives to, disclose any non-
public information to such Person without first entering into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, and (3) the Company contemporaneously provides, in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, to Parent any
material non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries
provided to such other Person which was not previously provided to Parent. As
used herein, the term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written
Takeover Proposal, except for any licensing transaction or agreement, (with
all of the percentages included in the definition of "Takeover Proposal"
increased to fifty percent (50%) for this purpose) which the Company Board
determines (after consultation with the Company Financial Advisor and outside
counsel), taking into account the various legal, financial and regulatory
aspects of the proposal, including the financing terms thereof, and the Person
making such proposal, if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated,
and if consummated would result in a transaction that is more favorable to the
Company\'s stockholders, from a financial point of view, than the Offer and
the Merger (after giving effect to all adjustments to the terms thereof which
may be offered by Parent (including pursuant to _Section 5.02(d)_).

  

 (c) From and after the Agreement Date until the Director Appointment Date, the Company shall as promptly as practicable, and in all cases within one (1) Business Day after its receipt, notify Parent in the event that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives receives any Takeover Proposal from any Person or group, which notice shall set forth the material terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent informed at Parent\'s request or otherwise as promptly as practicable (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) of any material change in the status of or material terms and conditions (including all material amendments or proposed material amendments conveyed to the Company or its Representatives) of any such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall provide Parent with at least forty-eight (48) hours prior notice of a meeting of the Company Board (or such lesser notice as is provided to the members of the Company Board) at which the Company Board is reasonably expected to consider any Takeover Proposal. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any Contract with any Person subsequent to the Agreement Date that prohibits the Company from providing the information described in this _Section 5.02(c) _ to Parent. The Company shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission under, any standstill, confidentiality agreement or similar Contract to which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is a party and that relates to any potential Takeover Proposal, and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enforce the provisions of any such Contract; _provided_ that if the Company has received a written Takeover Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel, constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, the Company may waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission under such agreement to the extent that 

  

      

  
  

the Company Board determines that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Company\'s stockholders
under applicable Law.

  

 (d) From and after the Agreement Date until the Director Appointment Date, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal, (ii) withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or otherwise make any statement or proposal that, in the context in which it was made, is inconsistent with, the Board Recommendation, or (iii) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing (any action or failure to act set forth in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, if at any time prior to the Director Appointment Date the Company receives a Takeover Proposal which the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Company Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal, after giving effect to all of the adjustments to the terms of this Agreement which may be offered by Parent (including pursuant to clause (2) below), the Company Board may at any time prior to the Share Acceptance Time, if it determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Company\'s stockholders under applicable Law, (x) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal and/or (y) terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless in advance of or concurrently with such termination the Company pays the Company Termination Fee and otherwise complies with the provisions of _Section 8.01(f)_ and _Section 6.08_; and _provided further_ that the Company Board may not effect an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) unless (A) the Company shall not have materially breached this _Section 5.02_, and (B): 

    

 (1) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least three (3) Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its intention to take such action with respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal and other material documents, including the definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (the " _Acquisition Agreement_ "); and 

  

 (2) prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal. 

   

  

In the event of any amendment to the financial terms or any other material
revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a
new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this
_Section 5.02(d)_ with respect to such new written notice.

       

                                     

   

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 5.02_, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, the Company Board may at any time prior to the Director Appointment Date and solely in response to an Intervening Event effect an Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company Board may not effect an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least three (3) Business Days in advance of its intention to take such action, which notice shall specify the facts, circumstances and other conditions giving rise thereto, and prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during such three (3) Business Day period, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that an Adverse Recommendation Change is no longer necessary; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company Board shall not be permitted to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 5.02(e)_ with respect to or in connection with any Takeover Proposal (which shall be covered by and subject in all respects to _Section 5.02(d)_). 

  

 (f) The Company agrees that any breach of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.02_ by any of its Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement (including this _Section 5.02_) by the Company. 

  

 (g) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.02_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board determines (after consultation with its outside counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, it being understood, however, that this clause (ii) shall not be deemed to permit the Company Board to make an Adverse Recommendation Change except to the extent permitted by _Section 5.02(d)_ or _Section 5.02(e)_.

No provision of this _Section 6.04_ or _Sections 4.01(j)_ or _(m) _ shall constitute an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or any employee benefit or compensation plan, policy agreement or arrangement of Merger Sub or any of its Affiliates. 

  

  

 SECTION 6.05 _ Section 16 Matters._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (" _Section 16_") of Shares or Company Stock Options pursuant to this Agreement, and the Offer and the Merger shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16\.

organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company or any
indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, as in effect on the Agreement Date).

any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such
Indemnified Party without the prior consent of the affected Indemnified Party.
If written notice of a claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Section
6.07_ has been given prior to the expiration of the six (6) year period

such claim.

 (c) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and other assets to any Person, or if Parent dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the applicable successors and assigns or transferees assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.07_. 

   

 (d) The provisions of this _Section 6.07_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. On and after the Share Acceptance Time, the provisions of this _Section 6.07_ may not be amended in a manner adverse to any Indemnified Party without his or her prior consent.

contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or
expenses, whether or not such transactions are consummated.

  

  

 (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(e)_ or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(f)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent immediately prior to such termination, in the case of a termination by the Company, or within two (2) Business Days thereafter, in the case of a termination by Parent, the Company Termination Fee. 

  

 (c) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ solely as a result of a failure to satisfy the Minimum Condition, _Section 8.01(b)(ii)_ solely as a result of a failure to satisfy the Minimum Condition or _Section 8.01(c)(i)_, (ii) prior to the date of termination of this Agreement, a Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly made to the Company or shall have been made directly to the stockholders of the Company generally or shall have otherwise become publicly known, and (iii) (A) within twelve (12) months after such termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement to consummate or consummates a transaction contemplated by any Takeover Proposal or (B) a tender or exchange offer or other Takeover Proposal is first publicly announced within twelve (12) months after such termination and is subsequently consummated, then in either such case, the Company shall pay Parent an aggregate fee equal to the Company Termination Fee, on the earlier of the date of entry into a definitive agreement or the date of consummation referred to in clause (iii). For purposes of this _Section 6.08(c)_, the term " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall have the meaning assigned to such term in _Section 5.02(a)(i)_, except that all references to fifteen percent (15%) therein shall be deemed to be references to thirty-five percent (35%). 

  

 (d) All payments under this _Section 6.08_ shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent.

The parties acknowledge and agree that the Company Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather constitutes damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub in the circumstances in which such Company Termination Fee is payable. 

  

  

 SECTION 6.09 _ Public Announcements_. Each of Parent and the Company agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior written consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required by applicable Law, court process or the rules and regulations of any national securities exchange or national securities quotation system and except for any matters referred to in _Section 5.02_, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, it being understood that the final form and content of any such release or announcement, to the extent required, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party.

 SECTION 8.02 _ Effect of Termination._ In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section 8.01_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any Liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, other than the provisions of _Section 4.01(v)_, _Section 4.02(h)_, the last sentence of _Section 6.02_, _Section 6.08_, this _Section 8.02_ and _Article IX_, which provisions shall survive such termination; _provided_ , _however_ that nothing herein shall relieve the Company, Parent or Merger Sub from liability for any fraud or willful breach of any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement.

pursuant hereto or waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights.

The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.

 SECTION 9.07 _ Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries._ This Agreement (including the Exhibits and Company Disclosure Schedule) and the Confidentiality Agreement and any agreements entered into contemporaneously herewith (a) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, _provided_ that the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and (b) are not intended to and do not confer upon any Person other than the parties any legal or equitable rights or remedies, the provisions set forth in _Section 6.07_ of this Agreement (from and after the Effective Time). 

  

 SECTION 9.08 _ GOVERNING LAW._ THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS (WHETHER OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION) THAT WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF DELAWARE. 

  

 SECTION 9.09 _ Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except that Parent may assign all or any of its rights and obligations hereunder to any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent without the Company\'s prior consent; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no assignment shall release Parent of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 SECTION 9.10 _ Specific Enforcement; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial._ 

  

  

 (a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that until such time as this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to the provisions of _Section 8.01_, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The pursuit of specific enforcement by either party will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy to which such party may be entitled. 

  

 (b) Each of the parties hereto hereby (i) irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (and if jurisdiction in the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, the Federal courts of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from such court, (iii) agrees that it will not bring any such action or proceeding in any court other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (and if jurisdiction in the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, the Federal courts of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), (iv) agrees that any Claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in Delaware Court of Chancery (and if jurisdiction in the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, the Federal courts of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), and any appellate court from any thereof, (v) waives, to the fullest extent it 

  

      

  

may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in the
Delaware Court of Chancery (and if jurisdiction in the Delaware Court of
Chancery shall be unavailable, the Federal courts of the United States of
America sitting in the State of Delaware), and (vi) waives, to the fullest
extent it may legally and effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in Delaware Court of
Chancery (and if jurisdiction in the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be
unavailable, the Federal courts of the United States of America sitting in the
State of Delaware). Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in
any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process
in the manner provided for notices in _Section 9.02_. Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve
process in any other manner permitted by Law.

  

 (c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.10(c)_. 

  

  

 SECTION 9.11 _ Severability._ If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. 

       

                                      
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have caused this
Agreement to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized,
all as of the date first written above.

 (ii) there shall be any Restraint or Law enacted, entered, enforced, promulgated or which is deemed applicable pursuant to an authoritative interpretation by or on behalf of a Government Entity of competent jurisdiction to the Offer or the Merger, that (x) has resulted, or is reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to result, directly or indirectly, in any of the consequences referred to in clauses (A) through (D) of paragraph (a)(i) above, or (y) has the effect of making the Offer or the Merger illegal or which has the effect of prohibiting or otherwise preventing the consummation of the Offer or the Merger;

giving effect to any references to any Material Adverse Effect or materiality
qualifications shall fail to be true and correct as of such Expiration Date
with the same force and effect as if made on and as of such date, except for
representations and warranties that relate to a specific date or time (which
need only be true and correct as of such date or time), except as has not had

aggregate with all other failures to be true or correct, a Material Adverse
Effect;

  

 (e) after the Agreement Date there shall have occurred a Material Adverse Effect; 

  

 (f) Merger Sub shall have not received a certificate of the Company, executed by the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, dated as of such Expiration Date, to the effect that the conditions set forth in paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of this Annex II have not occurred; 

  

 (g) The Collaboration Agreement, dated as of September 12, 2005, between the Company and Biogen Idec MA Inc., as amended, shall be in full force and effect in all material respects and shall not have been amended, modified or supplemented, or the terms thereof otherwise altered in any material respect, following the Agreement Date; or

Any reference in this Annex II or the Agreement to a condition or requirement being satisfied shall be deemed to be satisfied if such condition or requirement is so waived. The failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time. 

  

 Each of the foregoing conditions is independent of any of the other foregoing conditions; the exclusion of any event from a particular condition does not mean that such event may not be included in another condition. 

  

 The capitalized terms used in this Annex II and not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " _Agreement_ "), dated as of March 9, 2010, by and among Abbott Laboratories, Amber Acquisition Inc. and Facet Biotech Corporation.
