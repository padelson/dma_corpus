are outstanding (collectively, the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Shares</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), at a price of $27.00 per Share, net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon (such price, or any
higher price offered and paid by Merger Sub in the Offer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Offer Price</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"); </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
in furtherance of the transaction, it is proposed that, following the consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company with the Company continuing as

of Company Common Stock that is not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer will thereupon be canceled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,

accordance with the terms of the Offer, prior to the scheduled expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended hereunder) and not properly withdrawn, a number of Shares that, together with the Shares
then directly or indirectly owned by Parent, represents at least a majority of all Fully Diluted Shares immediately prior to the Share Acceptance Time (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Minimum
Condition</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") and (ii)&nbsp;the conditions set forth in Annex&nbsp;II and no other conditions (together with the Minimum Condition, the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Offer
Conditions</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). Merger Sub, or Parent on behalf of Merger Sub, expressly reserves the right to waive, in its sole discretion, in whole or in part, any of the Offer Conditions and
to make any change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer; provided that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement or previously approved by the Company in writing (which approval may be granted
or withheld by the Company in its sole discretion), (A)&nbsp;the Minimum Condition may not be waived or amended, (B)&nbsp;no change may be made that changes the form of consideration to be paid
pursuant to the Offer, decreases the Offer Price or the number of Company Shares sought in the Offer, imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth in Annex&nbsp;II, or otherwise
amends or modifies the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of Shares, and (C)&nbsp;the Offer may not be extended except as set forth in this </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;1.01</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight, New York City time, on the date that is
twenty (20)&nbsp;business days (calculated as set forth in Rule&nbsp;14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following the commencement of the Offer (such time, the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Initial Expiration Date</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>," and such time, or such subsequent time to which the expiration of the Offer is extended in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Expiration Date</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance
with </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;8.01</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, Merger Sub (i)&nbsp;may, in its sole discretion, without consent of the Company, without limiting Parent's or Merger Sub's
obligations under the following sentence, extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive increments of up to ten (10)&nbsp;Business Days each, for any period up to and including the
Outside Date if on any then-scheduled Expiration Date any of the Offer Conditions have not been satisfied or waived in writing by Merger Sub (or Parent on its behalf), until such
Expiration Date on which all Offer Conditions shall then be satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived and (ii)&nbsp;shall extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>SEC</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") or The NASDAQ Stock Market applicable to the Offer. Parent and Merger
Sub agree that except to the extent otherwise agreed in writing by the Company prior to any then-scheduled Expiration Date, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) extend
the Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive increments of up to ten (10)&nbsp;Business Days each, up to and including the
Outside Date, if on any then-scheduled Expiration Date any of the Offer Conditions have not been satisfied or waived in writing by Merger Sub (or Parent on its behalf), until such
Expiration Date on which all Offer Conditions shall then be satisfied or, to the extent permitted, waived; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, that Merger Sub shall not be
required to extend the Offer pursuant to this sentence beyond the Outside Date or after the Company delivers, or
is required to deliver, to Parent a notice in accordance with </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;5.02</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> with respect to a Takeover Proposal that has been received at least
ten (10)&nbsp;Business Days prior to the then-scheduled Expiration Date by the Company, its Subsidiaries, or any Representative of the Company, except to the extent that prior to the
then-scheduled Expiration Date (i)&nbsp;the Takeover Proposal giving rise to such notice has been withdrawn or the Company Board has rejected the Takeover Proposal giving rise to such
notice, (ii)&nbsp;the Company Board has reconfirmed the Board Recommendation, and (iii)&nbsp;the withdrawal or rejection of such Takeover Proposal or the reconfirmation of the Board Recommendation
shall have been publicly announced by the Company. Following expiration of the Offer, Merger Sub (or Parent on its behalf) may, in its sole discretion, provide a subsequent offering period or one or
more extensions thereof (a "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Subsequent Offering Period</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") in accordance with Rule&nbsp;14d-11 of the Exchange Act, if, as of the

including the requirements of Rule&nbsp;14d-11 of the Exchange Act, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
accept for payment and pay for, as promptly as practicable, (1)&nbsp;after the Expiration Date, all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer and/or (2)&nbsp;all
Shares validly tendered in any Subsequent Offering Period. The Company agrees that no Shares held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be tendered pursuant to the Offer. Merger Sub shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer to any holder of Shares such amounts as Merger Sub is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Laws relating to Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax authority by
Merger Sub, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made by Merger
Sub. Merger Sub shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;8.01</I></FONT><FONT

Agreement is terminated prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offer, Merger Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any depositary acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, in accordance with
applicable Law, all tendered Shares that have not then been purchased in the Offer to the registered holders thereof. </FONT></P>

amount of the Company Termination Fee from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to
be made. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Company Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather constitutes damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub in the
circumstances in which such Company Termination Fee is payable. </FONT></P>
