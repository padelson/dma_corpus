 _Section 4.2 Surrender and Payment_ 

   

 (a) Parent and Target shall authorize a transfer agent, commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to both parties to act as exchange agent under this Agreement (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of Stock Certificates and Book Entry Shares representing the Target Common Shares. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of Target Common Shares, cash in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration to which holders of Target Common Shares shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to _Section 4.1_ in exchange for outstanding Target Common Shares (such amounts being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration in exchange for surrendered Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares pursuant to _Section 4.1_ out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by _Section 4.2(d)_, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. 

   

 (b) Promptly but in any event within five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall cause the Exchange Agent to send to each holder of record of Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares a letter of transmittal for use in such exchange (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title with respect to the Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to Target), and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares for payment therefor in accordance herewith. Upon proper surrender of a Stock Certificate or Book Entry Shares for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Stock Certificate or Book Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of Merger Consideration provided in _Section 4.1(a)_, and the Stock Certificate or Book Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. 

   

 (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be issued or paid to a Person other than the registered holder of Target Common Shares represented by the 

   ##### 

  

   

Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares surrendered in exchange therefor, no
such issuance or payment shall be made unless (i) the Stock Certificates or
Book Entry Shares so surrendered have been properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such issuance has
paid to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result
of such issuance to a Person other than the registered holder or establish

 (d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of Target Common Shares one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be returned to Merger Sub, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged such holders Target Common Shares in accordance with this section prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company, as a general creditor thereof, to exchange such Target Common Shares or to pay amounts to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 4.1_. If outstanding Target Common Shares are not surrendered prior to six (6) years after the Effective Time (or, in any particular case, prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration issuable or payable upon the surrender of such Target Common Shares would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority), the Merger Consideration issuable or payable upon the surrender of such Target Common Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Company, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, Target or the Surviving Company shall be liable to any holder of Target Common Shares for any amount paid, or Merger Consideration delivered, to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

The consideration for the cancellation of each Target Option shall be (x) the amount by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the per share exercise price of such Target Option multiplied by (y) the number of Target Common Shares covered by the outstanding portion of the cancelled Target Option; provided that if the exercise price of such Target Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Target Option shall be cancelled without any cash payment being 

   ##### 

  

   

made in respect thereof. Any payment made pursuant to this _Section 4.3(a)_
shall be reduced by any income or employment Tax withholding required under
(i) any applicable state or local Tax laws or (ii) any other applicable
laws. Each Target Option shall be cancelled and no longer be outstanding at

such consideration to the holders of Target Options promptly after the
Effective Time, but in no event more than two (2) Business Days after the
Effective Time. Target will take any and all actions necessary on or
before the Effective Time to terminate all Excepted Options as provided in

Each Target Warrant shall be cancelled and no longer be outstanding at or immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Surviving Company shall pay such consideration to the holders of Target Warrants promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event more than two (2) Business Days after the Effective Time. 

   

 (c) With respect to the Excepted Options, each Excepted Option that is not fully exercisable and that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will automatically become fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, Target shall cause each holder of an Excepted Option to enter into a written agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_, pursuant to which the aggregate number of such Excepted Options will be canceled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive a $10.00 cash payment, without interest (the " _Option Waiver, Cancellation and Release Agreement_ "). Each optionholder who holds an Excepted Option that has been canceled (a " _Cancelled Excepted Option_ ") shall have no rights with respect to such Cancelled Excepted Option to receive any other consideration in connection with the Merger or otherwise. Any payments made to a holder of an Excepted Option will be reduced by any income or employment Tax withholding required under (x) the Code, (y) any applicable state or local Tax laws, or (z) any other applicable laws. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld, those amounts shall be treated as having been paid to the holder of a Cancelled Excepted Option for all purposes under this Agreement. Target shall make the payments in respect of the Cancelled Excepted Options as promptly as practicable following the cancellation of such Cancelled Excepted Options as contemplated by this _Section 4.3(c)._ 

   

 _Section 4.4 Dissenting Shares_ 

   

 (a) Notwithstanding Section 4.1(a), Target Common Shares that are held by any holder who has exercised such holders right to demand appraisal for such shares in accordance with the TBCA or TBOC (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal). Holders of Dissenting Shares shall have those rights, but only those rights, of holders who perfect their appraisal rights pursuant to the TBCA or TBOC, as applicable; provided, however, that any holder of 

   ##### 

  

   

Dissenting Shares who shall have failed to perfect or shall have withdrawn or
lost his rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, in each case under
the TBCA or TBOC, as applicable, shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such
Dissenting Shares, and such Dissenting Shares shall be treated as if they had
been converted into the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the
Merger Consideration, without interest. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this section, if the Merger is terminated, rescinded or
abandoned, then the right of any Target Shareholder to be paid the fair value
of such shareholders Dissenting Shares shall cease. The Surviving Company
shall comply with all of its obligations under the TBCA or TBOC,
as applicable, with respect to holders of Dissenting Shares. 

   

 (b) Target shall give the Parent Parties (i) prompt written notice of any demands for appraisal, any withdrawals of such demands received by Target and any other related instruments served pursuant to the TBCA or TBOC, as applicable, and received by Target, and (ii) the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the TBCA or TBOC, as applicable.

ARTICLE VIII. 
 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 

    

 _Section 8.1 Preparation of the Proxy Statement_ 

   

 (a) As promptly as is practicable following the date of this Agreement, Target shall prepare a proxy statement (together with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") in order to seek the Target Shareholders Approval. The Proxy Statement shall comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and other applicable law. Each of Parent and Target also agrees to use reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the Transactions. Target shall respond to any comments from the SEC as promptly as practicable following the receipt of such comments. Target will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the SEC to complete its review of the Proxy Statement as promptly as is practicable after such filing, and Target shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the holders of Target Common Shares as promptly as is practicable after the SEC shall have notified Target that it has no further comments regarding the Proxy Statement. 

   

 (b) No filing of or amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement and all responses to requests for additional information and replies to comments prior to these 

    ##### 

 

    

being filed with or sent to the SEC will be made by Target, without providing
Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon
prior to its being filed with the SEC. Target agrees, as to itself and its
Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement and any
amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to shareholders
and at the time of the Target Shareholder Meeting contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which such statement was made, not misleading. If at
any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to Target, or
any of its Affiliates, directors or officers, should be determined by Target
to have rendered the Proxy Statement misleading in any material way (whether
as a result of the misstatement of a material fact or the omission of a
material fact), Target shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Target
shall promptly notify the Parent of such material misstatement or omission
and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law,
disseminated to the shareholders of Target. Target shall notify Parent
promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC and of any request by
the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement or for additional information and shall supply Parent with (i)
copies of all correspondence and a description of all material oral
discussions between it or any of its respective Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to
the Proxy Statement or the Merger and (ii) copies of all orders of the
SEC relating to the Proxy Statement. 

  

 _Section 8.2 Shareholders Meeting; Recommendations_. Subject to _Section 8.4_, Target shall take all actions necessary under applicable law to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the Target Shareholders (the " _Target Shareholders Meeting_ ") as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement for the purpose of securing the Target Shareholders Approval. Target shall consult with Parent regarding the date of the meeting and use its reasonable best efforts to have the Target Shareholder Meeting be a date not more than forty-five (45) days following the mailing of the Proxy Statement. The Proxy Statement shall (i) state that the Target Board has unanimously (x) approved this Agreement and the Transactions, (y) determined that this Agreement and the Transactions are advisable and in the best interests of Target and its shareholders, and (z) include the Target Recommendation (except to the extent that Target effects a Change in the Target Recommendation in accordance with _Section 8.4_ of this Agreement) and (ii) include the written opinion of Morgan Keegan, a Target financial advisor, as of the date of this Agreement, as to the fairness from a financial perspective of the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of Target Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement. Target shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from shareholders of Target votes in favor of the Target Shareholders Approval. The Target Board shall not effect a Change in the Target Recommendation except pursuant to and solely as permitted by _Section 8.4_. Notwithstanding any Change in the Target Recommendation, unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, this Agreement shall be 

   ##### 

  

 

submitted to the shareholders of Target at the Target Shareholder Meeting and
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Target of
such obligation. In addition to the foregoing, during the term of this
Agreement, Target shall not submit to the vote of its shareholders any
Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger. 

   

 _Section 8.3 Access to Information; Confidentiality_. To the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to restrictions imposed upon the Target and any Target Subsidiary by any agreement of confidentiality with any Person, Target will provide and will cause Targets Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, investment bankers, advisors, and agents and other representatives (collectively, the " _Representatives_ ") to provide Parent and its authorized Representatives, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice access to the offices, employees, customers, suppliers, properties, books and records of Target (so long as such access does not unreasonably interfere with the operations of Target) as Parent may reasonably request. With respect to any information disclosed pursuant to this section, Parent shall comply with, and shall cause each of its Representatives to comply with, all of its obligations under the confidentiality agreement, dated September 1, 2009, previously executed by Parent and Target (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). Target shall not be required to provide access to or disclose any information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of such party or any Subsidiary of such party or contravene any contract, law or order (it being agreed that the parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not result in such jeopardy or contravention). Parent will use its reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption to the businesses of the Target and the Target Subsidiaries which may result from the requests for access, data and information hereunder. 

  

 _Section 8.4 No Solicitation_ 

   

 _(a) General Prohibitions. _Subject to _Section 8.4(b)_, Target shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or authorize any of its or their respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate, encourage or knowingly facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal for Target, (B) enter into or engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal for Target, furnish to any third party (or any Representative of any third party) any information (whether orally or in writing) in connection with, or in furtherance of, any Acquisition Proposal for Target, or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of Target or any of its Subsidiaries, otherwise cooperate in any way with, or knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by, any third party (or any Representative of any third party) that has made, is seeking to make or has informed Target of any intention to make, or has publicly announced an intention to make, an Acquisition Proposal for Target, (C) fail to make, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify or publicly propose to withdraw, qualify, amend or modify the Target Recommendation (it being understood that, subject to and without limitation of  _Section 8.4(f)_, taking a neutral position or no position with respect to any Acquisition Proposal for Target shall be considered an amendment or modification), or recommend, adopt or approve, or publicly propose to recommend, adopt or approve, an Acquisition Proposal for Target, or take any action or make any 

   ##### 

  

   

statement inconsistent with the Target Recommendation (any of the foregoing
in this clause (C), a " _Change in the Target Recommendation_ "), (D) take
any action to make the provisions of any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition," "business combination" or other similar anti-takeover
statute or regulation (including approving any transaction under, or a
third party becoming an "affiliated shareholder" under, Section 21.606 of
the TBOC), or any restrictive provision of any applicable anti-
takeover provision in Targets articles of incorporation or bylaws,
inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal, (E)
enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other contract or instrument constituting
or relating to an Acquisition Proposal for Target (other than a
confidentiality agreement of the type referred to in _Section 8.4(b)_), or
any contract or agreement in principle compelling Target to abandon,
terminate or breach any of its obligations hereunder, or fail to consummate
the Transactions (any of the foregoing agreements in this clause (E), a "
_Target Acquisition Contract_ "), (F) enter into any confidentiality or
similar agreement with any third party which prohibits Target from providing
or making available to Parent pursuant to _Section 8.4(b)_ any of the
information to be provided to such third party in the time periods provided
in _Section 8.4(b)_, (G) grant or permit any third party any waiver or
release under, or fail to enforce any provision of, any
confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement with respect to any class
of securities of Target or any of its Subsidiaries or (H) resolve, propose or
agree to do any of the foregoing. Without limiting the foregoing, it is
agreed that any violation of the restrictions on Target set forth in the
preceding sentence by any Representative of Target or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this section by Target. 

   

 _(b) Exceptions after Receipt of Certain Proposals. _Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Target Shareholders Approval (and in no event after obtaining the Target Shareholders Approval), the Target Board, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may, subject to compliance with  _Section 8.4(c)_, (A) (i) contact a third party or its Representatives for the purpose of clarifying any inquiry or Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof so as to determine whether such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal or (ii) engage in negotiations or discussions with any third party that the Target Board determines in good faith is credible and reasonably capable of consummating a Superior Proposal for Target, and that has made after the date of this Agreement a Superior Proposal for Target or a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal for Target that the Target Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, (B) thereafter, furnish to such third party nonpublic information relating to Target or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with terms in the aggregate at least as restrictive to such third party as those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and which contains a "standstill" or similar provision on terms no more materially favorable to such third party than the terms of any "standstill" or similar agreement, or provision in any agreement, applicable to Parent with respect to Target; provided, that the terms of such "standstill" or similar provision may allow such third party to make Acquisition Proposals to Target in connection with the negotiations or discussions permitted by this section (a copy of such 

   ##### 

  

   

confidentiality agreement shall, subject to _Section 8.4(c)_, be provided
promptly after its execution, and which copy and the terms and existence
thereof shall be subject to the confidentiality obligations imposed on the
Parent Parties pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement), provided, that,
subject to _Section 8.4(c)_, all such nonpublic information (to the extent
that such nonpublic information has not been previously provided or made
available to Parent) is provided or made available to Parent, as the case may
be, prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or
made available to such third party), and provided, further, that, if such
Superior Proposal for Target or Acquisition Proposal for Target is made by a
third party who or which, on the date hereof, is party to a confidentiality
agreement with Target which would prohibit Target from complying with any of
the terms of this section or _Section 8.4(c)_ requiring the provision by
Target of information, agreements or the documents to Parent, then Target
may take the actions described in clauses (A) and (B) of this section only if
such confidentiality agreement with such third party has been amended to (x)
allow Target to fully comply with such terms of this section and _Section
8.4(c)_ without violating such confidentiality agreement and (y) include, if
not already included, a "standstill" or similar provision on terms no more
materially favorable to such third party than the terms of any "standstill"
or similar agreement, or provision in any agreement applicable to Parent with
respect to Target; provided, that the terms of such "standstill" or similar
provision may allow such third party to make Acquisition Proposals to Target
in connection with the negotiations or discussions permitted by this section
and (C) subject to compliance with  _Section 8.4(d)_, make a Change in the
Target Recommendation; but in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses
(A), (B) and (C) only if the Target Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel to Target, that its failure to take
such action would likely be inconsistent with the Target Boards fiduciary
duties to the Target Shareholders. 

   

 _(c) Required Notices. _Target shall not take any of the actions referred to in  _Section 8.4(b)_ unless Target shall have delivered to Parent one (1) Business Days prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such action, and Target shall continue to advise Parent after taking such action, on a current basis, of the status and terms of any discussions and negotiations with the third party. In addition, Target shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than one (1) Business Day) after receipt by Target (or any of its Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification to any Acquisition Proposal, for Target or of any request for information relating to Target or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of Target or any of its Subsidiaries by any third party that, to the knowledge of Target, is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal for Target, which notice shall be provided orally and in writing and shall identify the third party making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal for Target, indication or request (including, in each case, any changes thereto). Target shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, of the status and details of any such Acquisition Proposal for Target, indication or request (including, in each case, any changes thereto) and shall promptly (but in no event later than one (1) Business Day after receipt) provide to Parent copies of (i) all drafts of the definitive documents relating to any Acquisition Proposal sent or provided to Target or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) 

   ##### 

  

   

from to time thereafter, all documents containing material changes to such
definitive documents. 

   

 _(d) Limitations on Ability to Change Recommendation or Terminate the Agreement._ Notwithstanding _Section 8.4(b)_, the Target Board shall not make any Change in the Target Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_   _11.1(h)_ unless and until (A) Target promptly notifies Parent, in writing, at least three (3) Business Days before taking that action, of its intention to do so, (B) if requested by Parent, during the three-Business-Day period, Target shall negotiate in good faith with Parent with respect to any revised proposal from Parent in respect of the terms of the Transactions and (C) if in response to an Acquisition Proposal for Target that constitutes a Superior Proposal for Target, Parent does not make, within such three-Business-Day period, an offer that is at least as favorable to the shareholders of Target, as determined by the Target Board in good faith (after considering the advice of Targets financial advisor), as such Superior Proposal (it being understood that, with respect to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 11.1(h)_, Target shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1(h)_ during such three-Business-Day period, and that any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new written notification from Target and an additional three-Business-Day period that satisfies this section). 

   

 _(e) Obligation to Terminate Existing Discussions. _Target shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing soliciting activities, discussions or negotiations and access to nonpublic information, if any, with, to or by any third party conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal for Target. Target shall promptly request that each third party, if any, in possession of Confidential Information (as such term is defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) about Target or any of its Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of Target or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with its consideration of any potential Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all Confidential Information heretofore furnished to such third party in compliance with the applicable confidentiality agreement entered into with such third party. 

   

 _(f) Certain Exceptions. _Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Target Board from (A) taking and disclosing to the Target Shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or other applicable law, or (B) making any disclosure to the Target Shareholders if the Target Board determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to so disclose such position would be reasonably likely to give rise to a violation of applicable laws; provided, however, that any such disclosure of a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, other than (x) a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, (y) an express rejection of an applicable Acquisition Proposal or (z) an express reaffirmation of its Target Recommendation, shall be deemed a Change in the Target Recommendation. In addition, it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement (including this 

   ##### 

  

   

 _Article VI_), a factually and materially accurate public statement by
Target that describes Targets receipt of an Acquisition Proposal for
Target and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be
deemed a Change in the Target Recommendation if Target affirmatively
reaffirms in such disclosure the Target Recommendation. 

  

 _Section 8.5 Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_ 

   

 (a) The organizational documents of the Merger Sub and of the Surviving Company shall, with respect to indemnification of directors, officers, employees and agents, not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the date of this Agreement in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Persons who at any time prior to the Effective Time were identified as prospective indemnitees under Targets articles of incorporation or the bylaws in respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the Transactions). 

   

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of Target or any of its Subsidiaries (each an " _Indemnified Party_ "), who was or is made or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, or investigative (a " _proceeding_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, liabilities, fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and experts and judgments, fines, losses, claims, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement (provided that any such settlement is effected with the prior written consent of Parent, which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Party based in whole or in part out of the fact the Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of Target or any Subsidiary of Target or of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise in which such Indemnified Party was serving at the request of the Target, and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Effective Time including any act or omission relating to this Agreement or the Transactions (the " _Indemnified Liabilities_ "), to the full extent permitted under Texas law. If an Indemnified Party makes or asserts any claim for Indemnified Liabilities, any determination required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified Partys conduct complies with the standards set forth under the TBCA or TBOC, as applicable, shall be made by independent counsel mutually acceptable to the Surviving Company and the Indemnified Party; provided, further, that nothing herein shall impair any rights or obligations of any Indemnified Party. If any claim or claims are brought against any Indemnified Party (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), counsel selected for the defense of such claim shall be reasonably acceptable to Target (if selected before the Effective Time) and the Surviving Company (if selected after the Effective Time). 

   

 (c) The Surviving Company shall promptly advance all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of each Indemnified Party in connection with any such action or proceeding described above, as such expenses are incurred, to the fullest extent permitted 

   ##### 

  

   

by the TBOC, subject to the receipt by the Surviving Company of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay such amount if
it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled
to be indemnified by the Surviving Company. 

   

 (d) The Surviving Company shall maintain Targets existing officers and directors liability insurance policy (" _D andO Insurance_") for a period of at least six (6) years after the Effective Time, but only to the extent related to actions or omissions prior to the Effective Time; provided, that the Surviving Company may substitute therefor policies of substantially similar coverage and amounts containing terms no less advantageous to such former directors or officers; provided further, that the aggregate amount of annual premiums to be paid with respect to the maintenance of such DandO Insurance for such six-year period shall not exceed one hundred seventy-five percent (175%) of the aggregate amount of annual premiums currently paid by Target for such DandO Insurance. 

   

 (e) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns or the Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any of its Affiliates and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any of its Affiliates, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as applicable, assume the obligations set forth in this section. 

   

 (f) The provisions of this _Section 8.5_ shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents and approvals and to do all other things necessary for the consummation of the Transactions. The parties shall take such further action to deliver or cause to be delivered to each other at the Closing and at such other times thereafter as shall be reasonably agreed by such parties such additional agreements or instruments as any of them may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out this Agreement and the Transactions. The parties shall afford each other access to all information, documents, records and personnel who may be necessary for any party to comply with laws or regulations (including the filing and payment of Taxes and handling Audits), to fulfill its obligations with respect to indemnification hereunder or to defend itself against suits or claims of others. Parent and Target shall duly preserve all files, records or any similar items of Parent or Target received or obtained as a result of the Transactions with the same care and for the same period of time as it would preserve its own similar assets. 

  

 _Section 8.7 Expenses_. Except as provided in _Section 11.3_, each party shall bear solely and entirely, all Expenses that they incur. 

  

 _Section 8.8 Cooperation_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, from the date hereof until the Effective Time, Target shall confer on a regular and frequent basis with one

without limitation, matters relating to drilling of wells, whether or not
within the ordinary course of business, and shall promptly provide Parent or
its counsel with copies of all filings made by Target with any Governmental
Authority in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions. 

  

 _Section 8.9 Publicity_. Neither Target, Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their respective Affiliates shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to the Transactions without the prior consultation with and consent of the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be reasonably determined to be required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange, and each party shall use reasonable efforts to provide copies of such release or other announcement to the other party hereto, and give due consideration to such comments as each such other party may have, prior to such release or other announcement.

such financing.

Each of the parties further acknowledges that the payment of the amounts by Parent and Target specified in this section is not a penalty, but in each case (except in the case of a Parent Breach or a Target Breach) are liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Target or Parent, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such fees are payable for the efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In no event shall Parent or Target, as applicable, be required to pay the Termination Fee more than once.

The parties further agree that (a) by seeking any particular remedy, the non-breaching party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to it, and (b) nothing contained in this _Section 12.14_ shall require the non-breaching party to institute any proceeding for (or limit the right of the non-breaching party to institute any proceeding for) specific performance or injunctive relief under this _Section 12.14_ before exercising any termination right arising from a Parent Breach or a Target Breach, as applicable (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any action pursuant to this _Section 12.14_ or anything contained in this _Section 12.14_ restrict or limit the right of the non-breaching party to terminate this Agreement as a result of a Parent Breach or a Target Breach, as applicable, or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

 B. In connection with the Merger, Target has agreed to solicit the votes of the shareholders of Target on certain actions, the approval of which by such shareholders is a condition precedent to the consummation of the Merger, and, in connection therewith, to deliver to the shareholders of Target a proxy statement soliciting their vote on such actions (the " _Proxy Statement_ "). 

  

 C. As of the date hereof, Shareholder Beneficially Owns (as defined below) the number of Shares (as defined below) of capital stock of Target as set forth on the signature page of this Agreement. 

  

 D.

 E. As a shareholder of Target, Shareholder will benefit from the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby.
