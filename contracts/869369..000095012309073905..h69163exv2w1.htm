pursuant to this section, interest shall accrue on such amount from the date such payment

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Parent Parties and Target have
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as may be amended from time to time, the &#147;<B><I>Merger
Agreement</I></B>&#148;), which provides that upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, at the
Effective Time, Target shall merge with and into Merger Sub and the separate corporate existence of

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;In connection with the Merger, Target has agreed to solicit the votes of the shareholders
of Target on certain actions, the approval of which by such shareholders is a condition precedent
to the consummation of the Merger, and, in connection therewith, to deliver to the shareholders of
Target a proxy statement soliciting their vote on such actions (the &#147;<B><I>Proxy Statement</I></B>&#148;).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;As of the date hereof, Shareholder Beneficially Owns (as defined below) the number of

Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.&nbsp;In order to induce the Parent Parties to execute the Merger Agreement, Shareholder desires
to restrict the transfer or disposition of, and desires to vote, his Shares as provided in this
Agreement, and the execution and delivery of this Agreement is a material condition to the Parent
Parties&#146; willingness to enter into the Merger Agreement.
</DIV>

Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby.
