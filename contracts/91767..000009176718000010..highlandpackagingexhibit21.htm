Amount that is a negative number and the absolute value of such calculation of

Purchaser and the Holders' Representative shall immediately deliver joint

Capital, the Closing Date Funded Debt Amount, the Closing Date Cash Amount
and/or the Closing Date Outstanding Company Expenses and, to the extent
relevant thereto, the Post-Closing Statement, in writing to the Independent

reasonable detail the basis for each such determination) as soon as reasonably
practicable (which the parties hereto agree should not be later than forty-
five (45) days following the day on which the disagreement is referred to the

remaining disagreements submitted to the Independent Accountant) in order to
be determined in accordance with Section 3.3(a) (including the definitions of
the defined terms used in Section 3.3(a)), and, with respect to each disputed
item, the Independent Accountant's determination, if not in accordance with
the position of either Purchaser or the Holders' Representative, shall not be
in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts presented in
Purchaser's calculation of the Adjustment Amount pursuant to Section 3.3(a) or
in the Holders' Representative's written notice of disagreement of such
calculation pursuant to this Section 3.3(b). The determination of the
Independent Accountant shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties
and no party shall seek further recourse to any Governmental Authority other
than to enforce the determination of the Independent Accountant. The parties
acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 3.3 are an integral

the Seller in accordance with this Section 3.3, or if either party fails to
give the joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent in accordance with
this Section 3.3 and, in order to obtain such payment or delivery of the joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent, a party commences an Action that
results in a judgment against the other party for such Adjustment Amount or
for the delivery of the joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent, the
losing party shall pay to the prevailing party (or deliver the joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent directing it to pay), together with such
Adjustment Amount, in accordance with Section 3.3(a) and Section 3.3(d),

on the date hereof. In addition the prevailing party shall be entitled to any
fees, costs and expenses (including legal fees) incurred by the prevailing
party in connection with any such Action. The date on which the Closing Date
Net Working Capital, the Closing Date Funded Debt Amount, the Closing Date
Cash Amount and the Closing Date Outstanding Company Expenses are finally

Accountant hereunder shall be borne one-half (50%) by Purchaser, on the one
hand, and one-half (50%) by the Holders' Representative, on the other hand.



(c) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then the Purchase Price

of the Adjustment Amount. The Adjustment Amount shall be paid in accordance
with Section 3.3(a) and Section 3.3(d).

(e) Except as otherwise required by Law, the parties hereto agree to treat for
all Tax purposes any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 3.3 as

Company shall provide to Purchaser a written report setting forth a list of
the following fees and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the
preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the other

the applicable Governmental Authority. Immediately prior to or commensurate
with the Closing, Purchaser shall pay to such third-parties as are directed by
the Seller with written evidence of the total amount due such third party, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to the
Outstanding Company Expenses. No amount shall be included on the Post-Closing

Credit Documents) and the holders of Holders Loan Documents (and any other
indebtedness for borrowed money to banks or financial institutions, if any),
which payoff letters shall state the amount of the applicable Funded Debt owed
to each such lender/holder and that, if such amount is paid to such respective
lender/holder on the Closing Date (or thereafter, if any applicable per diem
amounts are paid), such respective lender/holder will release any and all
Liens that it may have with respect to the Company and its assets. At the
Closing, the Purchaser shall pay in full (on behalf of the Company), or shall
cause the Company to pay in full (and shall provide sufficient funds to the
Company to enable it to make such payments), an amount equal to the Funded
Debt as set forth in such payoff letters for the Closing Date by wire transfer
of immediately available funds in the amounts and to the lenders identified in
such payoff letters.



Section 3.6Withholding. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement
to the contrary, any consideration payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby will be reduced by any Tax withholding required by Law,
and any amount so withheld in compliance with applicable Law will be treated
for all purposes hereof as having been paid to the Person with respect to
which the withholding was made. Any Person that expects to so withhold (or
expects its agent to so withhold) any such Tax (other than any such Tax that
is imposed on consideration that is properly treated as compensation for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes) will provide notice of the expected withholding
at least five (5) Business Days prior to the withholding to the Person with
respect to which the withholding is to be made (and the notice will include
the legal authority and the calculation method for the expected withholding),
and the parties hereto will use reasonable efforts to cooperate to minimize
the amount of the withholding.



Section 3.7RWI Policy. Purchaser shall pay the premium and all other costs
required for issuance of the RWI Policy at Closing. The RWI Policy shall
include a provision whereby insurer expressly waives, and agrees not to
pursue, directly or indirectly, any subrogation rights against the Seller or
any Holder with respect to any claim made by any insured thereunder (except
for intentional fraud in connection with the transaction by that Holder or
Seller).



Section 3.8Holders' Representative Fund At the Closing, the Purchaser shall
transfer the amount of the Holders' Representative Fund by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the

Section 3.9Contingent Purchase Price. In addition to the Closing Purchase
Price, the Holders shall be eligible for the Contingent Purchase Price
computed as follows:



(a)With respect to the first year after Closing, the Contingent Purchase Price
shall equal $5,000,000 if during the period from the Closing Date until the
first month end following the one year anniversary of the Closing Date (or the
month end if the one year anniversary occurs on a month end) (the "First
Period") the Company has been able to maintain substantive sales relationships
with substantially all of the customers listed on Schedule 3.9(a) (the
"Retained Customers").



(b)With respect to the second year after Closing, the Contingent Purchase
Price shall equal $2,500,000 if during the period beginning on the day
following the end of the First Period until the one year anniversary of the
last day of the First Period (the "Second Period") the Company has been able
to maintain substantive sales relationships with substantially all of the
Retained Customers.



(c)During the period from the Closing Date to the end of the Second Period and
in an effort to maintain substantive sales relationships with substantially
all of the Retained Customers, Purchaser and the Company will treat all
Retained Customers in a commercially reasonable manner and will not, directly
or indirectly, take any actions in bad faith that would have the purpose of
avoiding or reducing any of the Contingent Purchase Price hereunder.



(d)For purposes of determining whether the Company has maintained substantive
sales relationships with a particular Retained Customers, Purchaser and the
Company shall count a maintained relationship with such Retained Customer by
Parent Guarantor, by other Affiliates of Parent Guarantor and by any persons
who may have succeeded to any of the businesses of Purchaser, the Company,
Parent Guarantor or other Affiliates of Parent Guarantor.

On a quarterly basis during each of the First Period and the Second Period,
Purchaser, the Holders' Representative, Steven L. Maxwell, William Raymond
Clark, Jr. and John Allen Baird shall schedule a face to face meeting to
discuss (i) whether it appears that the Holders are on track to earn the
applicable Contingent Purchase Price, (ii) whether any Specified Force
Majeures have occurred, (iii) what effect such Specified Force Majeure may
have had on the ability to maintain substantive sales relationships with the
Retained Customers, (iv) whether there are any indications that a relationship
with any of the Retained Customers is in jeopardy and, if so, to discuss and
seek to implement an action plan to avoid the Company's losing such
relationship, and (iv) such other considerations and performance measures as
may be relevant to the analysis.

Within forty five (45) days after the end of each of the First Period and the
Second Period, Purchaser shall deliver to Holders' Representative a report
indicating whether the Company has been able to maintain substantive sales
relationships with substantially all of the Retained Customers during each
such period and its determination of whether the Contingent Purchase Price is
payable for such period. Following the delivery of each such report, Purchaser
shall provide the Holders' Representative and its representatives access to
the records, properties and personnel of Purchaser, the Company, the Parent
Guarantor and its Affiliates relating to the relationship with each of the
Retained Customers, and shall cause the personnel of the Purchaser,

| | 

|

| 

 



the Company, the Parent Guarantor and its Affiliates to cooperate with the
Holders' Representative in connection with the Holders' Representative's
review of such information. The Holders' Representative shall have forty five
(45) days to object in writing to the Purchaser's determination of whether a
Contingent Purchase Price is payable for such period. If the Holders'
Representative timely objects in writing to such determination by Purchaser
and the Parties cannot agree to a settlement of such issue in the following
thirty (30) days, the determination of whether the Contingent Purchase Price
is payable for the applicable period shall be resolved by an arbitration
process, as hereinafter provided. The Contingent Purchase Price shall be paid
to the Seller (or to the Holders' Representative for the benefit of the Seller
and the Holders or to the Holders, if and to the extent so directed by the
Holders' Representative in advance of such payment) within ten (10) days of
the final determination of whether the Contingent Purchase Price is due for
such period.

Any arbitration pursuant to this Section 3.9 shall be conducted in Wilmington,
Delaware or such other location as the parties may agree. The arbitration
shall be conducted by one arbitrator (if the parties can agree on a single
arbitrator) or, if not, by three arbitrators. If there is to be a panel of
three arbitrators, the Holders' Representative shall appoint its arbitrator in
its request for arbitration (a "Request"). The Purchaser shall appoint its
arbitrator within 20 days of receipt of the Request and shall notify the
Holders' Representative of such appointment in writing. If the Purchaser fails
to appoint an arbitrator within such 20 day period, the arbitrator named in
the Request shall decide the dispute over whether the Contingent Purchase
Price is payable as the sole arbitrator. Otherwise, the two arbitrators
appointed by the parties shall appoint a third arbitrator within 20 days after
the Purchaser has notified the Holders' Representative of the appointment of
the Purchaser's arbitrator. All of the arbitrators shall be attorneys who
practice business law or commercial litigation. When the arbitrators appointed
by the parties have appointed a third arbitrator and the third arbitrator has
accepted the appointment, the two arbitrators shall promptly notify the
parties of such appointment. If the two arbitrators appointed by the parties
fail or are unable to appoint a third arbitrator or to notify the parties of
such appointment, then the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the
President of the American Arbitration Association which shall promptly notify
the parties of the appointment of the third arbitrator. The third arbitrator
shall act as chairman of the panel. The arbitration decision shall be in
writing and shall be final and binding on the parties. Judgement upon the
decision may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof or having
jurisdiction over the parties or their assets.

For purposes of this Section 3.9, the term "Specified Force Majeure" shall
mean an act beyond the reasonable control of the Purchaser and the Retained
Customer, including: (a) acts of God, including weather events such as
hurricanes, tornados, drought and other weather events substantially impacting
crop production; (b) flood, fire, earthquake or explosion; (c) war, invasion,
hostilities (whether war is declared or not), terrorist threats or acts, riot
or other civil unrest; (d) government order or law; (e) actions, embargoes or
blockades in effect on or after the date of this Agreement; (f) action by any
governmental authority; (g) national or regional emergency; and (h) strikes,
labor stoppages or slowdowns or other industrial disturbances;.

Subsidiary free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens, and no

accounting or other statement provided for under this Agreement or otherwise;
provided, however, that access to such books, records, documents and employees
will not materially interfere with the normal operations of the Company and
the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Company incurred in connection
therewith will be paid by the Seller, the Holders' Representative and/or the
Holders, as the case may be. Purchaser will cause the Company to maintain and
preserve all such books, records and other documents for any applicable
statutory or regulatory retention period, as the same may be extended and, in
each case, shall offer to transfer such records to the Seller, the Holders'
Representative and/or the Holders at the end of any such period.



Section 7.4Conversion or Liquidation of Seller. Nothing herein shall be
considered as prohibiting or shall prohibit the Seller and the Holders, at any
time after the Closing (including prior to the end of calendar year 2018),
from either (i) converting the Seller to a limited liability company or (ii)
effectuating a dissolution and liquidation of the Seller. If the Seller is
converted to a limited liability company, obligations hereunder of Purchaser
and/or Parent Guarantor and/or the Escrow Agent to the Seller (including
without limitation obligations to pay to Seller any Adjustment Amounts and any
Contingent Purchase Price and obligations to distribute amounts to Seller from
the Adjustment Escrow Account and the Indemnification Escrow Account) shall
continue to be obligations to the Seller (but rather as a limited liability
company). If the Seller is dissolved and liquidated, the Seller may distribute
and assign any and all of its rights under this Agreement to the Holders
jointly or to a liquidating trust for the benefit of the Holders, and then
from and after the date thereof, obligations hereunder of Purchaser and/or
Parent Guarantor and/or the Escrow Agent to the Seller (including without
limitation obligations to pay to Seller any Adjustment Amounts and any
Contingent Purchase Price and obligations to distribute amounts to Seller from
the Adjustment Escrow Account and the

Indemnification Escrow Account) shall instead be obligations owing and payable
to the Holders jointly or to a liquidating trust for the benefit of the
Holders.

ARTICLE VIII

JOINT COVENANTS

Section 8.1Support of Transaction. Without limiting any covenant contained in
Article VI (including the obligations of the Company and Purchaser with
respect to the notifications, filings, reaffirmations and applications
described in Section 6.3 and Section 7.1, which obligations shall control to
the extent of any conflict with the succeeding provisions of this Section
8.1), the Company and Purchaser shall each, and shall each cause their
respective Subsidiaries to: (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to
assemble, prepare and file any information (and, as needed, to supplement such
information) as may be reasonably necessary to obtain as promptly as
practicable all governmental and regulatory consents required to be obtained
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all material consents and approvals of third-
parties that any of Purchaser, the Company, or their respective Affiliates are
required to obtain in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (c) take such other action as may reasonably be necessary
or as another party may reasonably request to satisfy the conditions of
Article IX or otherwise to comply with this Agreement and to consummate the
transaction contemplated hereby as soon as practicable. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall the Company or the Company Subsidiary or their
Affiliates be obligated to bear any expense or pay any fee or grant any
concession in connection with obtaining any consents, authorizations or
approvals pursuant to the terms of any Contract to which the Company or the
Company Subsidiary is a party in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, with the exception of any prepayment fee due
under the Credit Agreement upon prepayment of the amounts due and owing under
the Credit Agreement.



Section 8.2Escrow Agreement. Each of the Company, the Holders' Representative,
and Purchaser shall execute and deliver to one another the Escrow Agreement at
the Closing.



Section 8.3Tax Matters.



(a) Subject to Section 8.3(b), with respect to any Tax Return that is required
by Law to be filed by the Company (as opposed to by the Seller) following the
Closing Date, the Purchaser shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be
prepared and timely filed, such Tax Return (taking into account any applicable
extensions to file such Tax Return). To the extent such Tax Return relates to
a Pre-Closing Tax Period (including a Straddle Tax Period of the Company),
Purchaser agrees that (i) such Tax Return shall be prepared and timely filed
in a manner consistent with the most recent past practice of the Company and
the other agreements relating to Tax matters set forth in this Section 8.3
(except as otherwise required by Law); and (ii) such Tax Return shall be
delivered to the Holders' Representative for review at least twenty (20) days
prior to the intended filing date.



(b) Notwithstanding Section 8.3(a), the Seller and/or the Holders'
Representative shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, the IRS Form 1120S (and
any comparable state and local forms and related information returns such as
the IRS Form K-1 for each

| | 

|

| 

 



shareholder of the Seller or the Company) that includes for the Company any
period ending on or prior to the Closing Date and includes for the Seller any
period that includes operations of the Seller either prior to or after the
Closing Date (the "S Corporation Returns").



(c) Purchaser shall consider in good faith, any timely comments made by the
Holders' Representative to any Tax Return prepared under Section 8.3(a) or an
amendment to a Tax Return under Section 8.3(g). The Holders' Representative
and Purchaser shall work in good faith to resolve any disagreements relating
to any Tax Return of the Company for and/or including a Pre-Closing Tax Period
(including a Straddle Tax Period) that is to be filed following the Closing
Date. In the event that the parties cannot resolve their disagreement, the
matter shall be submitted to the Independent Accountant to resolve in
accordance with the principles provided for in Section 3.3, provided that if
such disagreement is not resolved by the Independent Accountant or otherwise
prior to the due date of such Tax Return (after taking into account applicable
extensions), the Purchaser shall timely file (or cause to be timely filed) the
Tax Return of the Company as prepared by Purchaser under Section 8.3(a)
(subject to whatever changes as may have been agreed upon by the Holders'
Representative and Purchaser prior to filing); and once the disagreement is
resolved, the Purchaser shall file, or cause to be filed, an amendment to such
Tax Return of the Company as necessary to reflect the final determination by
the Independent Accountant or otherwise. To the extent that any such amendment
shows a refund of a Tax that was paid out of the Indemnification Escrow Funds,
the Purchaser shall promptly return such amount to the Escrow Agent to be held
under the Escrow Agreement (or, if the Escrow Agreement has been terminated,
to the Seller for distribution to the Escrow Agent) and to the extent that any
such amendment shows a Tax for which the Purchaser Indemnified Party is to be
indemnified under Section 11.2(a), such amount shall be remitted to the
Purchaser in accordance with Article XI and other applicable agreements.



(d) The Company and Purchaser agree (A) for all Tax purposes that (i) the F
Reorganization shall be treated as an "reorganization" under Section
368(a)(1)(F) and the Seller shall succeed to the Company's election as an S
corporation; (ii) the acquisition of the Highland Interests shall be treated
as an acquisition by Purchaser, and a sale by the Seller, of all of the
Company's assets for the applicable purchase price and (iii) any income Tax
deductions associated with the Outstanding Company Expenses, the Stay Bonuses,
the 2017 Profit Sharing Plan Contributions, the 2018 Profit Sharing Plan
Contributions or the repayment of the Funded Debt that accrue or are paid on
or prior to the Closing Date or pursuant to the Closing shall be claimed on
the income Tax Returns of the Seller and/or the Company that include the pre-
Closing operations of the Company; and (B) to prepare and file all Tax Returns
consistently with the agreements set forth in clause (A) (except as otherwise
required by Law).



(e) Each party hereto agrees to, and agrees to cause their Affiliates to,
cooperate fully, as reasonably requested by the other parties, in connection
with the preparation of any Tax Return of the Company for a period ending on
or before the Closing Date or for any Straddle Tax Period of the Company and
the conduct of any Tax Contest Claim. Such cooperation shall include the
retention of and (upon the other party's request) the provision of records and
information reasonably relevant to the Tax matters and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide the additional
information.

(f) Purchaser shall promptly notify the Holders' Representative in writing
upon receipt by any Purchaser Indemnified Party or any of their Affiliates of
any written notice from any Governmental Authority of an Action with respect
to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or the Seller that could give rise to a
claim for indemnification under Section 11.2(a) or that relates to an S
Corporation Return (collectively, a "Tax Contest Claim"). Such notice shall
include a copy of any correspondence and any other written material received
from the applicable Governmental Authority. Purchaser and the Holders'
Representative shall in accordance with Section 8.3(e) cooperate with each
other in the conduct of a Tax Contest Claim and, as necessary or requested,
provide (or cause the applicable Purchaser Indemnified Party to provide) any
power of attorneys with respect to such Tax Contest Claim. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, the Holders' Representative shall have the
right to control any Tax Contest Claim with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period of the Company or with respect to any Tax Period of the Seller which
could result in a Tax that is subject to indemnification under Section 11.2(a)
or that relates to any S Corporation Return (any such claim, a "Holders' Tax
Contest Claim"); provided that if the resolution or settlement of such
Holders' Tax Contest Claim could have an adverse effect on any Purchaser
Indemnified Party in a Post-Closing Tax Period, (i) the Holders'
Representative shall keep the Purchaser informed regarding the progress and
substantive aspects of such Holders' Tax Contest Claim; (ii) Purchaser shall
be entitled at its expense to participate in such Holders' Tax Contest Claim;
and (iii) the Holders' Representative shall not compromise or settle any such
Holders' Tax Contest Claim without obtaining the Purchaser's prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or
conditioned). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Purchaser shall control the conduct of any Tax Contest Claim that the Holders'
Representative does not have the right to control, or has not yet elected to
control; provided that (x) Purchaser shall keep the Holders' Representative
informed regarding the progress and substantive aspects of such Tax Contest
Claim; (y) the Holders' Representative shall be entitled at its expense to
participate in such Tax Contest Claim; and (z) the Purchaser shall not, and
shall not allow the Purchaser Indemnified Party, to settle any such Tax
Contest Claim without obtaining the Holders' Representative's prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed). Holders' Representative shall be solely responsible for contesting
an Action with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Holders, including those
that relate to operations of the Company.

(g) After the Closing Date, except as required by Law or with the prior
written consent of the Holders' Representative (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), Purchaser shall not, and shall not cause or
allow any other Purchaser Indemnified Person, to take any of the following
actions with respect to a Tax Return of the Company that relates to a period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date or a Straddle Tax Period: (i) file an
amended Tax Return; (ii) make or change any Tax election; (iii) adopt or
change any Tax accounting method; (iv) change any Tax accounting period; (v)
agree to extend any statute of limitations with respect to Taxes of the
Company or that relates to a S Corporation Return; (vi) initiate any voluntary
disclosure with respect to any Tax matter; or (vii) take any similar action
relating to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company. Purchaser shall not, and
shall not allow any Purchaser Indemnified Person to make any election under
Code Sections 336 or 338 (or similar provisions of state or local or non-U.S.
laws) with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. After
the Closing Date, if the Holders' Representative requests that an amendment to
a Pre-Closing Tax Return be filed, Holders' Representative or the Seller shall
deliver to the


 

--- 
| | 

|

51

| 

 



Purchaser such amendment at least (20) days prior to the intended filing date
for Purchaser's review and filing pursuant to Section 8.3(c).



(h) The amount of any Income Tax or other Tax that is not a property or
similar ad valorem Tax for any Straddle Tax Period that is apportioned to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period of such Straddle Tax Period will be determined based on
an interim closing of the books as of the Closing Time on the Closing Date.
The amount of any property taxes or similar ad valorem Tax or franchise Tax
for a Straddle Tax Period that is apportioned to the Pre-Closing Tax Period of
such Straddle Tax Period shall equal the amount of the Tax for the entire
Straddle Tax Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days in the period ending before the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the days in the entire period.



(i) Within thirty (30) days after the final determination of the Adjustment
Amount, the Purchaser shall provide to the Holders' Representative a schedule
allocating the purchase price paid by the Purchaser for U.S. Federal income
taxes for the assets of the Company among the assets of the Company (the
"Purchase Price Allocation Schedule"). The Purchase Price Allocation Schedule
shall be prepared in accordance with Schedule 8.3(i) and consistent with the
preliminary purchase price allocation set forth in Schedule 8.3(i). If within
thirty (30) days of receiving the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, the
Holders' Representative has not objected, the Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule shall be final and binding. If the Holders' Representative objects
within the thirty (30) days, the Holders' Representative and Purchaser shall
work in good faith to resolve their differences; provided that if after the
Holders' Representative and Purchaser are unable to resolve their differences
within twenty (20) days of the dispute, the Independent Accountant shall be
retained to resolve the dispute. The determination of the Independent
Accountant shall be made in accordance with the requirements of the Code and
Schedule 8.3(i) and, absent manifest error, shall be final and binding. The
costs of the Independent Accountant shall be shared equally by the Holders'
Representative and Purchaser. Unless otherwise required by a determination of
a Governmental Authority that is final, the Purchaser shall for all Tax
purposes, and shall cause the Company and all of its other Affiliates for all
Tax purposes, to allocate the purchase price paid for the assets of the
Company among the assets of the Company consistently with the Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule as finalized and Purchaser, the Seller and the Holders
shall allocate their sales price for the Company's assets consistently with
the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule as finalized.

(j) If the aggregate amount allocated to the inventory of the Company (as
determined under Section 8.3(i) and/or ultimately by a Tax Authority) exceeds
the book value of the inventory of the company (as of the Closing Date) by
more than $1,000,000, the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller an amount equal to
27% of such excess (the "Additional Inventory Value Purchase Price").



(k) If the aggregate amount allocated to the property, plant, and/or equipment
of the Company in service as of November 30, 2017 exceeds $30,000,000 (as
determined under Section 8.3(i) and/or ultimately by a Tax Authority) the
Purchaser shall pay to the Seller an amount equal to 27% of such excess (the
"Additional PPandE Value Purchase Price"). For the avoidance of doubt, any
property, plant and equipment owned on or after December 13, 2017 by Spec-
Tacular, Inc. or subject to a capital lease under which Spec-Tacular, Inc. is
the lessee and which is acquired by the Company prior to the Closing shall not
be considered for purposes of

|

52

| 

 



this Section 8.3(k) as being in service on November 30, 2017 although it was
being used by the Company on November 30, 2017. The Additional Inventory Value
Purchase Price plus the Additional PPandE Value Purchase Price shall be referred
to herein as the "Additional Purchase Price."



(l) If payable, the Additional Purchase Price shall be paid in cash within ten
(10) days of the finalization of the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule.



(m) All refunds of Taxes of the Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (whether
in the form of cash received or a credit or offset against Taxes payable) to
the extent not reflected in the Closing Net Working Capital (as finally
determined) shall be for the benefit of the Seller and the Holders. To the
extent that the Purchaser or the Company or the Company Subsidiary receives a
refund, credit or offset after the Closing Date that is for the benefit of the
Seller and the Holders, the Purchaser shall pay an amount equal to such
refund, credit or offset to the Escrow Agent to be added to Indemnification
Escrow Fund or if at such time the Escrow Agreement has terminated, to the
Holders, in proportion to their respective Allocation Percentages. The amount
due shall be paid within ten (10) days of receiving the refund from the
Governmental Authority (or, in the case of a credit or offset, ten (10) days
after filing the Tax Return claiming such credit or offset).



(n) Except as otherwise required by Law, the parties agree to treat for all
Tax purposes all indemnification payments under Article XI or payments with
respect to refunds under this Article VIII as adjustments to the Purchase
Price and shall make appropriate adjustments to the final Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule to reflect those adjustments.

(a)Subject to Section 11.4, from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnified Parties") shall be
entitled to indemnification solely from the Indemnification Escrow Funds for
any and all Damages to the extent arising from (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty the Company has made in Article IV, (ii) any breach
of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement requiring performance
by the Company or the Holders prior to or at the Closing or by the Holders
after the Closing, (iii) any Pre-Closing Taxes (except to the extent amounts
with respect to such Taxes were taken into account in the calculation of the
Closing Date Net Working Capital), or (iv) any noncompliance with the
requirements of all applicable state and federal immigration laws, including
the Federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, as amended ("IRCA").



(b)Subject to Section 11.4, from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
indemnify, defend and hold the Holders harmless for any and all Damages to the
extent arising from (i) any breach of any representation or warranty Purchaser
has made in Article V, or (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement requiring performance by Purchaser prior to or at
the Closing or by Purchaser or the Company after the Closing.



(c)The amount of indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be
entitled under this Article XI shall be determined: (i) by the written
agreement between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final
judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any
other means to which the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree. The
judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal,
if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all
appeals taken shall have been finally determined. The Indemnified Party shall
have the burden of proof in establishing the amount of Damages suffered by it.



Section 11.3Indemnification Claim Procedures.



(a)Upon receipt of any notice of an Action that may give rise to an
Indemnification Claim by a Person entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement (each, an "Indemnified Party"), such Indemnified Party shall
promptly (i) notify or cause to be notified the Indemnitor and (ii) deliver or
cause to be delivered to the Indemnitor a written notice (A) describing in
reasonable detail the nature of the Action, (B) including a copy of all papers
served with respect to such Action, (C) including the Indemnified Party's best
estimate of the amount of Damages that may arise from such Action and (D)
describing in reasonable detail the basis for the Indemnified Party's request
for indemnification under this Agreement. Failure to notify the Indemnitor in
accordance with this Section 11.3(a) will not relieve the Indemnitor of any
liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent (1)
the defense of such Action is prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's failure to
give or cause to be given such notice or (2) the Indemnified Party fails to
notify or cause to be notified the Indemnitor of such Indemnification Claim in
accordance with this Section 11.3(a) prior to the Survival Expiration Date.

(b)An Indemnitor may elect at any time to assume and thereafter conduct the
defense of any Action subject to any such Indemnification Claim with counsel
of the

| 

 



Indemnitor's choice and to settle or compromise any such Action, and each
Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all respects with the conduct of such
defense by the Indemnitor (including the making of any related claims,
counterclaim or cross complaint against any Person in connection with the
Action) and/or the settlement of such Action by the Indemnitor; provided,
however, that the Indemnitor shall not agree to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to such Action without
the Indemnified Party's prior written approval (which must not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), unless the terms of such settlement provide for a
complete release of the claims that are the subject of such Action in favor of
the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party gives an Indemnitor notice of
an Indemnification Claim and the Indemnitor does not thereafter promptly
assume such defense, then the Indemnified Party may conduct the defense of
such Action; provided, however, that (A) the Indemnified Party will not agree
to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise with
respect to such Action without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and (B) the
Indemnitor may thereafter assume at any time the defense of such Action. To
the extent the defense of any Action subject to any Indemnification Claim is
assumed by the Seller, the Holders' Representative and/or the Holders as the
Indemnitor, at the election of the Indemnitor, the costs and expenses of such
defense of, and any payment in respect of, any Action, including any
settlement thereof, shall be paid from the Indemnification Escrow Funds and
Purchaser and the Seller, the Holders' Representative and/or the Holders, as
the case may be, shall promptly submit joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse such portion of the
Indemnification Escrow Funds as is reasonably requested in writing by the
Seller, the Holders' Representative and/or the Holders, as the case may be, to
pay such costs and expenses or other amounts; provided, however, that no
amounts will be payable from the Indemnification Escrow Funds, unless the
Indemnified Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder.



(c)At the reasonable request of the Indemnitor, each Indemnified Party shall
grant the Indemnitor and its representatives all reasonable access to the
books, records, employees and properties of such Indemnified Party to the
extent reasonably related to the matters to which the applicable
Indemnification Claim relates. All such access shall be granted during normal
business hours and shall be granted under the conditions which shall not
unreasonably interfere with the business and operations of such Indemnified
Party.



Section 11.4Limitations on Indemnification Liability. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any claims an Indemnified Party
makes under this Article XI will be limited as follows:



(a)Indemnification Cap. The aggregate amount of Damages for which the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Article XI will, subject to the immediately following sentence, not
exceed $1,500,000. The Indemnification Escrow Amount then remaining in escrow
shall serve as the sole and exclusive source of payment of any Indemnification
Claim pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(i) and as the sole and exclusive source of
payment of any Indemnification Claim pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(iv).

(b)Claims Basket. The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(i) (other than for claims for
breaches of Fundamental Representations) to the extent the aggregate amount of
all Damages incurred by the Purchaser

|

| 

 



Indemnified Parties for which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are entitled
to indemnification pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(i) (other than for claims for
breaches of Fundamental Representations) exceeds $1,500,000 (the "Basket
Amount"), and once the aggregate amount of such Damages exceeds the Basket
Amount, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to
indemnification for such Damages to the extent such Damages exceed the Basket
Amount. The Basket Amount shall not apply to any indemnification claims under
Section 11.2(a)(ii), Section 11.2(a)(iii), or Section 11.2(a)(iv), or for
claims for breaches of Fundamental Representations under Section 11.2(a)(i).



(c)Damages Net of Insurance Proceeds and Other Third-Party Recoveries. All
Damages for which any Indemnified Party would otherwise be entitled to
indemnification under this Article XI shall be reduced by the amount of
insurance proceeds (but not including any possible recovery under the RWI
Policy), indemnification payments and other third-party recoveries to which
any Indemnified Party is entitled in respect of any Damages incurred by such
Indemnified Party. In the event any Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates
may be entitled to any insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or any third-
party recoveries in respect of any Damages (or any of the circumstances giving
rise thereto) for which such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Article XI, such Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, receive or realize such proceeds, benefits,
payments or recoveries. In the event that any such insurance proceeds,
indemnity payments or other third-party recoveries are obtained, received or
realized by an Indemnified Party subsequent to receipt by such Indemnified
Party of any indemnification payment hereunder in respect of the claims to
which such insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or other third-party
recoveries relate, appropriate refunds shall be made promptly by the relevant
Indemnified Parties of all or the relevant portion of such indemnification
payment.

(d)Assignment of Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives any indemnification
payment pursuant to this Article XI, at the election of the Indemnitor, such
Indemnified Party shall assign to the Indemnitor all of its claims for
recovery against third Persons as to such Damages, whether by insurance
coverage, contribution claims, subrogation or otherwise.



(e)Calculation of Damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, for purposes of determining whether there has been a breach or an
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty, and for purposes of determining
the amount of Damages resulting therefrom, all qualifications or exceptions in
any representation or warranty relating to or referring to the terms
"material", "materiality", or "in all material respects" or any similar term
or phrase will be disregarded, it being the understanding of the Parties that
for the purposes of determining liability under this Article XI, the
representations and warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement will
be read as if such terms and phrases were not included in them; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not apply to (i) the term "Material Permit"
or when used as an adjective in any definition set forth in Section 1.1 and
(ii) any representation or warranty set forth in (A) the last sentence of
Section 4.7; (B) Sections 4.11(a)(viii), (xiii) and (xvi); (C) the first
sentence of Section 4.12(a); (D) Section 4.18(f); (E) Section 4.19(a); (F) the
first sentence of Section 4.21(a); (G) Section 4.21(f); (H) the first sentence
of Section 4.22; and (I) the second sentence of Section 4.23.

(f)Damages Reserved for on the Post-Closing Statement or Included in Purchase
Price. No Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for
any Damages (i) in respect of any liability or obligation accrued or reserved
for on the Post-Closing Statement or (ii) in respect of any liability included
in the calculation of the Purchase Price.



(g)No Duplicate Claims. In the event a Purchaser Indemnified Party or the
Seller, as the case may be, recovers Damages in respect of an Indemnification
Claim, no other Purchaser Indemnified Party or the Seller, as applicable, may
recover the same Damages in respect of a claim for indemnification under this
Agreement.



(h)Limitations on Tax Indemnification. No Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be
indemnified for the following Taxes (or related Damages): (i) any Tax with
respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period (other than such Taxes arising from a
breach of a representation in Section 4.14(l)); (ii) any Tax attributable to a
breach of the Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) of any provision of this Agreement; (iii) any Transfer Tax; or
(iv) any Tax to the extent included in the computation of the Purchase Price.



Section 11.5Mitigation of Damages. An Indemnified Party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to mitigate any Damages for which it is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Article XI.



Section 11.6Indemnification Sole and Exclusive Remedy. Each of the parties
hereto acknowledges and agrees that from and after the Closing, except for
intentional fraud, claims under this Article XI shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Indemnification Escrow
Funds shall be the sole source of recovery of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties. The parties recognize that any further recovery for breaches of
representations and warranties under this Agreement by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall be under the RWI Policy (subject to the terms and
conditions thereof). In furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser and each of
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties hereby waives, from and after the Closing,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights,
claims and causes of action it may have against any indemnifying party
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement based upon predecessor or
successor liability, contribution, tort, strict liability or any Law or
otherwise. All representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement are
contractual in nature only and subject to the sole and exclusive remedies set
forth in this Article XI. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:



(a)each of Purchaser hereby waives any statutory and common law remedies,
including remedies that may be available under Environmental Laws, with
respect to matters relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including with respect to any environmental, health or safety matters);



(b)after the Closing Date, none of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may seek
the rescission of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

| | 

|

61

| 

 



(c)the provisions of and the limited remedies provided in this Article XI were
specifically bargained for between the parties hereto and were taken into
account by the parties hereto in arriving at the Purchase Price;



(d)the parties hereto have voluntarily agreed to define their rights,
liabilities and obligations respecting the Transaction and the other
transactions contemplated hereby exclusively in contract pursuant to the
express terms and provisions of this Agreement;



(e)the sole and exclusive remedies for any breach of the terms and provisions
of this Agreement (including any representations and warranties set forth
herein, made in connection herewith or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement) or any claim or cause of action otherwise arising out of or related
to the Transaction or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be those remedies available at law or in equity for breach of contract
only (as such contractual remedies have been further limited or excluded
pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement); and the parties hereto
hereby agree that no party hereto shall have any remedies or cause of action
(whether in contract or in tort) for any statements, communications,
disclosures, failures to disclose, representations or warranties not set forth
in this Agreement;



(f)the parties hereto each hereby acknowledge that this Agreement embodies the
justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties derived from arm's-length
negotiations and the parties hereto specifically acknowledge that no party
hereto has any special relationship with another party hereto that would
justify any expectation beyond that of an ordinary buyer and an ordinary
seller in an arm's-length transaction; and



(g)for the avoidance of doubt, any adjustments made to the Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 3.3 shall not be considered "remedies" for purposes of
this Section 11.6 and shall not be limited by the terms of this Section 11.6.



Section 11.7Release of Escrow. The Escrow Agreement shall specify that the
Indemnification Escrow Funds (if any) shall be released to the Seller (or the
Holders, in proportion to their respective Allocation Percentages if so
directed in writing by the Holders' Representative) on the first Business Day
following the Survival Expiration Date; provided, however, that, if any
Indemnification Claim shall have been properly asserted by any Purchaser
Indemnified Party in accordance with this Agreement on or prior to the
Survival Expiration Date and remains pending on the Survival Expiration Date
(any such claim, a "Pending Claim"), (i) the Indemnification Escrow Funds
released to the Seller (or the Holders, in proportion to their respective
Allocation Percentages if so directed in writing by the Holders'
Representative) shall be the amount of Indemnification Escrow Funds then held
by the Escrow Agent, minus the aggregate amount of such Pending Claim and (ii)
any funds that remain in escrow following the Survival Expiration Date in
respect of any such Pending Claim shall be released to the Holders promptly
upon resolution or (if applicable) satisfaction of such Pending Claim. In each
case in which this Section 11.7 provides for the release of Indemnification
Escrow Funds, each of Purchaser and Seller (or the the Holders'
Representative, on behalf of the Holders) shall promptly submit joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute
the Indemnification Escrow Funds in accordance with this Section 11.7 and the
Escrow Agreement.

| 

 



otherwise proceed against any other Party in any other jurisdiction, in each
case, to enforce judgments obtained in any Action, suit or proceeding brought
pursuant to this Section 12.13. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF
THE PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT
HEREOF.

Section 12.14Enforcement. Each Party agrees that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would
occur in the event that the Parties do not perform their obligations under the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with
its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Each Party
acknowledges and agrees that (a) the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, without proof of damages, prior to the valid termination of
this Agreement in accordance with Section 10.1, in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, and (b) the right of
specific performance is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and without that right, none of the Parties would have entered
into this Agreement. Each Party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of
specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other
Parties have an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. Each
Party acknowledges and agrees that any Party seeking an injunction to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 12.14 shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
injunction. For the avoidance of doubt, while the Company may pursue both a
grant of specific performance in accordance with this Section 12.14 and
concurrently pursue the payment of any damages under Section 10.2, under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both (A) a
grant of specific performance that results in a Closing (and the payment of
any fees, costs and expenses (including legal fees) incurred by or on behalf
of the Company or the Company Subsidiary or Affiliates in connection with the
Company's pursuance of such grant of specific performance, which Purchaser
shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company (such payment shall be deemed to
have been made prior to 11:59 p.m. Florida time on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date) if the Company is actually granted specific
performance in accordance with this Section 12.14) and (B) damages under
Section 10.2.



Section 12.15Non-Recourse. Without limiting the rights of the Company under
and to the extent provided under Section 12.14, this Agreement may only be
enforced against, and any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of,
or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may only
be brought against, the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto
and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with
respect to such party. Without limiting the rights of the Company under and to
the extent provided under Section 12.14, except to the extent a named party to
this Agreement (and then only to the extent of the specific obligations
undertaken by such named party in this Agreement), (i) no past, present or
future director, officer, manager, employee, incorporator, member, partner,

| 

 



stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or
Affiliate of any named party to this Agreement and (ii) no past, present or
future director, officer, manager, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or
Affiliate of any of the foregoing shall have any liability (whether in
contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or
liabilities of any one or more of the Company or Purchaser under this
Agreement (whether for indemnification or otherwise) of or for any claim based
on, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.



Section 12.16Acknowledgement and Waiver.

(a)It is acknowledged by each of the parties hereto that each of the Company,
the Holders and the Seller has retained Trenam Law ("Trenam") and Branscomb,
P.C. ("Branscomb") to act as their counsel in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and that neither Trenam nor Branscomb has acted as counsel
for any other Person in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
for conflict of interest or any other purposes. Purchaser and the Company
agree that any attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client
confidence attaching as a result of either of Trenam's or Branscomb's
representation of the Company, any of the Holders and the Seller related to
the preparation for, and negotiation and consummation of, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including all communications among Trenam,
Branscomb, the Company, the Holders, the Seller and/or their respective
Affiliates related to the preparation for, and negotiation and consummation
of, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall survive the Closing
and shall remain in effect. Furthermore, effective as of the Closing, (i) all
communications (and materials relating thereto) between the Company and the
Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and Trenam or Branscomb related to the
preparation for, and negotiation and consummation of, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are hereby assigned and transferred to the
Seller, (ii) the Company hereby releases all of its rights and interests to
and in such communications and related materials and (iii) the Company hereby
releases any right to assert or waive any privilege related to the
communications referenced in this Section 12.16 and acknowledge and agree that

(b)Purchaser and its Affiliates (including, from and after the Closing, the
Company), agrees that, notwithstanding any current, prior or future
representation of the Company by Trenam or Branscomb, each of Trenam and
Branscomb shall be allowed to represent any of the Holders, the Seller or any
of their respective Affiliates in any matters and disputes adverse to
Purchaser or the Company that either is existing on the date hereof or arises
in the future and relates to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby; and Purchaser, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, from
and after the Closing, the Company), hereby waives any conflicts or claim of
privilege that may arise in connection with such representation. Further,
Purchaser, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, from and after
the Closing, the Company), agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises
after Closing between Purchaser or the Company, on the one hand, and any of
the Holders, the Seller or any of their respective Affiliates, on the other,
each of Trenam or Branscomb may represent such Holder, the Seller or any of
their respective Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of such
Holder, the Seller or any of their respective Affiliate may be directly
adverse to Purchaser

or the Company and even though Trenam or Branscomb may have represented the
Company in a matter substantially related to such dispute.



(c)Purchaser, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, from and
after the Closing, the Company), acknowledges that any advice given to or
communication with any Holders, the Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates (other than the Company) shall not be subject to any joint
privilege and shall be owned solely by such Holder, the Seller and any
Affiliate of each such party. Each of Purchaser and the Company hereby
acknowledges that it has had the opportunity to discuss and obtain adequate
information concerning the significance and material risks of, and reasonable
available alternatives to, the waivers, permissions and other provisions of
this Agreement, including the opportunity to consult with counsel other than
Trenam and Branscomb.



Section 12.17Parent Guarantee. Parent Guarantor hereby (i) agrees to take any
and all actions necessary to cause Purchaser to perform all of their
respective obligations under this Agreement in accordance with their
respective terms (including with respect to the consummation of the
Transaction, the payment of any and all amounts required pursuant to Article
III and, if applicable, any amounts payable pursuant to Section 10.2)
(collectively, the "Guaranteed Obligations") and (ii) absolutely,
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as primary obligor and not merely
as surety, the full and complete performance by Purchaser of the Guaranteed
Obligations, and Parent Guarantor shall be liable for any breach by Purchaser
of any of the Guaranteed Obligations. This is a guarantee of payment (not of
collection) and performance. The Company shall not be obligated to file any
claim relating to the Guaranteed Obligations in the event that Purchaser
becomes subject to bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceedings, and the
failure of the Company to so file shall not affect Parent Guarantor's
obligations hereunder. In the event that any payment to the Company in respect
of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for
any reason whatsoever (other than in circumstances where Parent Guarantor is
not liable to make such payment), Parent Guarantor shall remain liable
hereunder with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations as if such payment had
not been rescinded or returned. Parent Guarantor hereby waives promptness,
diligence, presentment, demand of performance, demand of payment, filing of
any claim, any right to require any proceeding first against Purchaser,
protest, notice of any kind and all demands whatsoever and all suretyship
defenses generally in connection with the performance of its covenants,
agreements and obligations set forth in this Section 12.17. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, to the extent Purchaser is relieved of all or any portion of
the Guaranteed Obligations by satisfaction thereof on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement or pursuant to any other agreement
with the Seller, Parent Guarantor shall be similarly relieved of its
corresponding obligations under this Section 12.17. Parent Guarantor
acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that the waivers set
forth in this Section 12.17 are knowingly made in contemplation of such
benefits.

on behalf of, each Holder, to do the following: (i) deliver and receive
notices, including service of process, with respect to any matter under this

dispute with Purchaser Indemnified Parties in respect thereof; (v) take, in
its discretion, any and all actions, and deliver and receive any and all

take all such other actions as the Holders' Representative shall deem
necessary or appropriate, in its discretion, for the accomplishment of the
foregoing and the consummation of the Transactions, and (viii) engage such
attorneys, accountants, consultants and other Persons as the Holders'

accomplish any action required or permitted of it hereunder.



(b)Any decision, act, consent, approval or instruction of the Holders'

decision, act, consent, approval or instruction of the Holders, and the
Purchaser and the Company shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon any

of any Holder or the occurrence of any other event or events. Any action taken
by the Holders' Representative on behalf of the Holders pursuant to this
Agreement shall be as valid as if any such death, incapacity, liquidation,
dissolution or other event had not occurred, regardless of whether or not the
Holders' Representative, the Company or the Purchaser shall have received
notice of any such death, incapacity, liquidation, dissolution or other event.

(c)The Holders' Representative shall have the sole and exclusive right to
handle the foregoing matters for which the Holders' Representative has been
appointed the exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact of the Holders. No Holder
(other than, if applicable, the Holders' Representative) shall have any right
to participate in the resolution with Purchaser or the Company of such matters
in any manner.



(d)Notwithstanding anything in this Section 13.1 to the contrary, (i) the
Holders' Representative shall not be permitted to enter into any amendment to
this Agreement or other Transaction Document that increases the amount of, or
extends the time limit with respect to, any liabilities or obligations of a
Holder hereunder or thereunder in any manner without the prior written consent
of such Holder, (ii) the Holders' Representative shall not be permitted to
bind any Holder or its Affiliates to a substantive, non-monetary obligation,
covenant or restriction without the prior written consent of such Holder, and

a Purchaser Indemnified Party against a specific Holder, such Holder (and not
the Holders' Representative) shall act as the Indemnifying Party hereunder for
all purposes, including with respect to the defense thereof; provided, that
nothing in this subclause (iii) shall be deemed to result in or create any
limitation whatsoever on the rights of any Purchaser Indemnified Party,
including with respect to the effectiveness of any notice given in accordance
with any notice provision in this Agreement.



Section 13.2Holders' Representative Fund.

(a)The Holders' Representative Fund will be available following the Closing
for use by the Holders' Representative in its discretion for the payment of
all costs and expenses incurred by the Holders' Representative in connection
with the exercise by it of the authority granted to it herein (including,
without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and expenses, the fees and
expenses of any accountants or other professional advisors retained by the
Holders' Representative and any portion of the fees and expenses of the
Neutral Accountant for which the Holders' Representative is liable hereunder).
The Holders' Representative in its discretion may also use the Holders'
Representative Fund to satisfy any finally determined obligations that are
required to be satisfied by the Holders.



(b)Any portion of the Holders' Representative Fund remaining after the
Expiration Date (or, if later, upon the final resolution of all claims
asserted against the Indemnification Escrow Amount), after payment of any
costs and expenses incurred by the Holders' Representative through such date
and of any other obligations of the Holders as of such date pursuant to this
Article XIII shall be distributed to the Seller (or to the Holders in
accordance with their respective Allocation Percentage if so directed in
writing by the Holders' Representative). Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, prior to the final distribution of any remaining portion of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount or the Adjustment Escrow Amount, as applicable,
to the Holders, the Holders' Representative shall be permitted to be


 

--- 
| | 

|

71

| 

 



reimbursed out of such remaining portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount
or the Adjustment Escrow Amount, as applicable, for any and all reasonable
costs and expenses of the Holders' Representative in excess of the remaining
portion of the Holders' Representative Fund at such time. In furtherance of
the foregoing, upon request of the Holders' Representative prior to the final
distribution of the remaining Indemnification Escrow Amount or Adjustment
Escrow Amount, as applicable, to the Holders, the Holders' Representative and
the Purchaser shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a written instruction to the
Escrow Agent to release to the Holders' Representative an amount equal to its
reasonable costs and expenses in excess of the remaining portion of the
Holders' Representative Fund out of funds otherwise distributable to the
Holders.



Section 13.3Substitute Appointment.

In the event of the death, incapacity, liquidation, or dissolution of the
Holders' Representative, as applicable, the Holders' Representative (or its
trustee, receiver or personal representative) shall promptly designate a
substitute and provide written notice to the Purchaser and the Holders of such
substitute, which substitute shall from the time of such designation have all
the rights and responsibilities of the Holders' Representative hereunder.



Section 13.4Reliance by Holders' Representative. As between the Holders'
Representative and the other Holders, the Holders' Representative shall be
entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected against the other Holders in
relying upon any statements furnished to it by any Holder, the Purchaser or,
following the Closing, the Company, and the Holders' Representative shall be
entitled to act on the advice of counsel selected by it and shall not be
liable to any Holder for any action or inaction done in good faith by the
Holders' Representative based on such advice.



Section 13.5No Liability of Holders' Representative. The Holders'
Representative will not be liable to the Holders for any action taken by the
Holders' Representative in good faith in the absence of intentional
misconduct, gross negligence, or bad faith and the Holders shall severally
(and not jointly), in accordance with their respective Allocation Percentages,
indemnify the Holders' Representative from any Losses arising out of service
in its capacity as the Holders' Representative hereunder or under the Escrow
Agreement, except to the extent such Losses are incurred due to the
intentional misconduct, gross negligence, or bad faith of the Holders'
Representative. The Holders' Representative is serving in such capacity solely
for purposes of administrative convenience, and is not personally liable in
such capacity for any of the obligations of the Holders hereunder, and the
Purchaser agrees on behalf of itself and all Purchaser Indemnified Parties not
to look to the assets of the Holders' Representative, in such capacity, for
the satisfaction of any obligations of the Holders hereunder. In no event
shall the Holders' Representative be liable to any Holder for indirect,
punitive, special or consequential damages.



IN WITNESS WHEREOF the parties have hereunto caused this Agreement to be duly
executed as of the date hereof.
