AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  


 

  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of August 8, 2015,
by and among Berkshire Hathaway Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), NW
Merger Sub Inc., an Oregon corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
("Merger Sub"), and Precision Castparts Corp., an Oregon corporation (the
"Company").

  


 

  

RECITALS

  


 

  

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company each have approved, and in the case of the Company and Merger Sub deem
it advisable and in the best interests of their respective shareholders to
consummate, the acquisition of the Company by Parent by means of a merger of
Merger Sub with and into the Company upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding
share of the Company's Common Stock (such issued and outstanding shares of the
Company's Common Stock, collectively, the "Shares"), other than Shares owned
by Parent or Participating Subsidiary Shares will be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration.

  


 

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows:

  


 

  

ARTICLE I 
  
  THE MERGER

  


 

  

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement and in accordance with Oregon Law, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"), the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and the Company will continue as
the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

  


 

  

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place at 10:00 a.m. on the third Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver
of all of the conditions (other than any condition that by its nature cannot
be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to satisfaction of any such
condition) set forth in _Article VII_ (the "Closing Date"), at the offices of
Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10019,
unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties to this
Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. The parties to this Agreement shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by filing articles of merger (the "Articles of
Merger"), which include the Plan of Merger attached hereto as Exhibit A, on
the Closing Date (or on such other date as Parent and the Company may agree in
writing) with the Secretary of State of the State of Oregon, in such form as
required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of
Oregon Law. The Merger shall become effective as of the date and time of the
filing of the Articles of Merger

  

 

-2-  

  

  

with the Secretary of State of the State of Oregon, or such later time as is
specified in the Articles of Merger and as is agreed to by Parent and the
Company in writing (the "Effective Time").

  

  

Section 1.4 _Effect of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the applicable provisions of Oregon Law. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all
the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises and authority
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

Section 1.5 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation and bylaws
of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
amended and restated as of the Effective Time to be in the form of (except
with respect to the name of the Company) the articles of incorporation and
bylaws of Merger Sub, and as so amended shall be the articles of incorporation
and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided
therein or by applicable Law (and subject to _Section 6.7_ hereof).

  


 

  

Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The
directors of Merger Sub immediately before the Effective Time will be the
initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and the officers of the Company
immediately before the Effective Time will be the initial officers of the
Surviving Corporation, in each case until their successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.

  


 

  

Section 1.7 _Subsequent Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills
of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary
or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the
Surviving Corporation, its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub vested in
or to be vested in the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection
with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all
such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such
other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm any and all right, title and interest in, to and under such rights,
properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out
this Agreement.

  


 

  

ARTICLE II 
  
  EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

  


 

  

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of Shares or securities of Parent or Merger Sub: 
 

  

 

-3-  

  

  

(a) Each Share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately before the
Effective Time (other than any Shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Section
2.1(b)_ ) will be cancelled and extinguished and be converted into the right
to receive $235.00 in cash payable to the holder of such Share, without
interest (the "Merger Consideration"), upon surrender of either certificates
formerly representing such Shares ("Certificates") or any book-entry Shares
("Book-Entry Shares") in the manner provided in _Section 2.2_. All such
Shares, when so converted, will no longer be outstanding and will be
automatically cancelled, retired and cease to exist. Each holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares will cease to have any rights with respect
to such Shares, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration for such
Shares upon the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in
accordance with _Section 2.2_ , without interest.

  


 

  

(b) Each Share owned by Parent immediately before the Effective Time and any
Participating Subsidiary Shares will be cancelled and extinguished, and no
payment or other consideration will be made with respect to such shares.

  


 

  

(c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time will thereafter
represent one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

Section 2.2 _Payment; Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books_.

  


 

  

(a) Before the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall designate a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the holders
of Shares in connection with the Merger (the "Paying Agent") to receive the
funds necessary to make the payments contemplated by _Section 2.1(a)_. When
and as needed, Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited,
in trust with the Paying Agent in a separate account for the benefit of
holders of Shares (the "Payment Fund") the aggregate Merger Consideration to
which such holders shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)_. If for any reason the cash in the Payment Fund shall be
insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in
cash by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into
the Payment Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount
of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.

  


 

  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than three Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ (i) a letter of transmittal
(which must specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares will pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon
adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, and will
be in such form and have such other provisions as the Company and Merger Sub
may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for surrendering Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares may thereafter until the first anniversary
of the Effective Time surrender such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the
Paying Agent under cover of the letter of transmittal, as agent for such
holder. Upon delivery of a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly
executed

  

 

-4-  

  

  

and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and the surrender
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on or before the first anniversary of the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall cause the Paying Agent to pay the holder of
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, in exchange for the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration,
multiplied by the number of Shares represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares. Until so surrendered, Certificates (other than Certificates
representing Shares held by Parent or any Participating Subsidiary Shares, all
of which Shares shall be cancelled as provided in _Section 2.1(b)_ ) or Book-
Entry Shares will represent solely the right to receive the aggregate Merger
Consideration relating to the Shares represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares.

  

  

(c) If payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of cancelled Shares is
to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name surrendered
Certificates are registered, it will be a condition to such payment that the
Certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment in a
name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered
or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such
Tax is not applicable. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_
will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to the Shares theretofore represented by such Certificates, subject, however,
to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any dividends or make any
other distributions, in each case with a record date (i) prior to the
Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Company on such
Shares in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or (ii) prior to the
date of this Agreement, and in each case which remain unpaid at the Effective
Time.

  


 

  

(d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be
closed and there will not be any further registration of transfers of any
Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares will cease to have any
rights with respect to any Shares, except as otherwise provided for in this
Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
(other than Certificates representing Shares held by Parent or Participating
Subsidiary Shares) or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they will be cancelled and exchanged for Merger Consideration as
provided in this _Article II_. No interest will accrue or be paid on any cash
payable upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares which
immediately before the Effective Time represented the Shares.

  


 

  

(e) Promptly following the date which is one year after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any cash, including any interest received with respect to such
cash, and any Certificates or other documents, in its possession relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Transactions"), which
had been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed
to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares or previously delivered to the
Surviving Corporation, and thereafter such holders will be entitled to look to
the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws) only as general creditors of the Surviving Corporation with respect to
the Merger Consideration, payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, without any interest on such Merger Consideration.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent will be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares for Merger Consideration

  

  

 

-5-  

  

  

delivered to a Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed
by holders of Shares immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent,
the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any
holder of Shares, and from amounts payable pursuant to _Section 2.3_ , such
amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code, the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of U.S. state or
local Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable
Governmental Entity, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares
or other securities in respect of which such deduction and withholding were
made.

  


 

  

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Stock Plans and Stock-Based Deferred Compensation
Plans_.

  


 

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or the applicable committee
thereof shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take such other actions as are
necessary or appropriate, including giving any required notices and amending
any Company Stock Plan or Stock-Based Deferred Compensation Plan:

  


 

  

(i) to cause each option to purchase Shares granted under the Company Stock
Plans (an "Option") that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to
the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) to be converted into the right
of the holder to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash
equal to the product of (A) the total number of Shares of Common Stock
previously subject to such Option and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share set forth in such Option, less
any required withholding Taxes (the "Option Cash Payment"), and as of the
Effective Time each holder of an Option shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive any Option Cash Payment. Any
Option Cash Payment shall be made promptly (and in any event within 15
Business Days) following the Effective Time.

  


 

  

(ii) to cause each non-employee director stock unit granted under the Company
Stock Plans (a "Share Unit") that is outstanding or payable immediately prior
to the Effective Time to be converted into the right of the holder to receive
from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash equal to the product of (A)
the total number of Shares underlying such Share Units, and (B) the Merger
Consideration, less any required withholding Taxes (the "Share Unit Payment").
As of the Effective Time, each holder of a Share Unit shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the applicable Share
Unit Payment. All Share Unit Payments shall be made promptly (and in any event
within 15 Business Days) following the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_
, in the event that such payment would cause any additional Taxes to be
payable pursuant to Section 409A of the Code with respect to a Share Unit, the

  

  

 

-6-  

  

  

payment shall instead be made at the time specified in the applicable Company
Stock Plan and related award document or applicable deferral election.

  

  

(iii) to cause all account balances with respect to amounts credited to a
"Phantom Stock Fund" under any Stock-Based Deferred Compensation Plan by
election of the participant after December 31, 2008 ("Post-2008 Phantom Stock
Units") to be converted into a right of the participant to receive an amount
in cash equal to the product of (A) the number of Shares deemed invested in or
otherwise referenced by such account immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (B) the Merger Consideration, less any required withholding Taxes (the
"Deferred Payment"), and shall cease to represent a right to receive a number
of Shares or cash equal to or based on the value of a number of Shares. The
Deferred Payment shall be made promptly (and in any event within 15 Business
Days) following the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , in the event that
such payment would cause any additional Taxes to be payable pursuant to
Section 409A of the Code with respect to a Deferred Payment, the Deferred
Payment shall instead be made at the time specified in the applicable Company
Stock-Based Deferred Compensation Plan and related award document or
applicable deferral election.

  


 

  

(iv) to remove the "Phantom Stock Fund" performance option from each Stock-
Based Deferred Compensation Plan such that the value of all account balances
in any Stock-Based Deferred Compensation Plan as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, other than with respect to Post-2008 Phantom Stock Units
(which are dealt with in clause (iii) above), and all future account balances
shall be determined by one of the other performance options provided under
such Stock-Based Deferred Compensation Plan and elected by the participant,
none of which performance options shall be based on the value of the equity of
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent (other than to the extent the
Parent's equity is part of a broad-based index of public company stocks that
is one of the performance options).

  


 

  

(b) The Company Board or Employee Stock Purchase Plan Committee will adopt
appropriate resolutions and take such other actions as are necessary or
appropriate to provide that (i) participants in the 2008 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") will be prohibited from increasing their payroll
elections under the ESPP or making separate non-payroll contributions
following the announcement of the execution of this Agreement; (ii) no person
shall be entitled to begin participating in the ESPP following the
announcement of the execution of this Agreement if such person is not already
a participant in the ESPP; (iii) if the Closing shall occur prior to the
scheduled purchase date, a special interim purchase date shall be set, and
such interim purchase date shall be as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and such interim purchase date or the scheduled purchase date, as
applicable, will be the final purchase date under the ESPP, on which date each
participant's accumulated payroll deductions shall be used to purchase Shares
in accordance with the terms of the ESPP; (iv) subsequent to the exercise of
purchase rights on such purchase date (in accordance with the terms of the
ESPP), such Shares shall be treated the same as all other Shares in accordance
with _Section 2.1(a)_ of this Agreement; (v) any accumulated contributions not
used to purchase Shares on the interim purchase date, or the scheduled
purchase date, as applicable, will be returned to the applicable participants;
and (vi) the ESPP will be terminated as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

  

  

 

-7-  

  

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or the applicable committee
thereof will adopt appropriate resolutions and take such other actions as are
necessary or appropriate to provide that (i) the Company Stock Plans and all
awards issued thereunder (including the Options and Share Units) will
terminate as of the Effective Time and (ii) the provisions in any other plan,
program, arrangement or agreement providing for the issuance or grant of any
other interest in respect of the equity of the Company shall be of no further
force or effect and shall terminate as of the Effective Time.

  


 

  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such lawful action
as may be necessary (which includes satisfying the requirements of Rule
16b-3(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act), without incurring any liability
in connection therewith, to provide for and give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this _Section 2.3_.

  


 

  

Section 2.4 _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date hereof and
the Effective Time, any change in the Shares shall occur, by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution thereon with a record date during such period,
but excluding any change that results from any exercise of Options, the Merger
Consideration, and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement, shall
be appropriately adjusted so that the aggregate amount payable with respect to
all Shares shall not be changed.

  


 

  

Section 2.5 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificates shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificates to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificates, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Shares represented by such Certificates, as contemplated by this _Article II_.

_Section 3.3_ , _Section 3.4_ (other than the representation set forth in the

other entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has all
requisite corporate or other power and authority and all necessary
governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and
to carry on its business as now being conducted, except (other than with
respect to the Company's due organization, valid existence and good standing)
where the failure to be so organized, existing and in good standing or to have
such power, authority and governmental approvals would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

  


 

  

(b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to
do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction in which the

conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where
the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in _Section 3.1(b)_ of the Company

corporate action on the part of the Company is necessary to authorize the
execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation
by it of the Transactions, except that the consummation of the Merger requires

by the Company and, assuming due and valid authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, is a valid and binding
obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable

relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court
before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

  


 

  

(b) Assuming the accuracy of the representation and warranty in _Section 4.4_
, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares
to approve this Agreement (the "Shareholder Approval") is the only vote or
consent of the holders of any class or series of the Company's capital stock,
or any of them, that is necessary in connection with the consummation of the
Merger.

-15-

Adverse Effect:

  


 

  

(i) Each Company Plan is in compliance with all applicable Laws, including, as
applicable, ERISA and the Code, including by being funded to the extent
required by applicable Law, and has been operated in accordance, and is in
compliance, with its terms. With respect to each Company Plan, adequate
provision has been made therefor on the accounting statements of the
applicable Company or Subsidiary of the Company.

  


 

  

(ii) Each Company Plan that is intended to be a qualified plan under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter to that
effect from the IRS and, the Company is not aware of any event occurring since
the date of such determination that would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect such determination.

  


 

  

(iii) No condition exists that is reasonably likely to subject the Company or
any of its ERISA Affiliates to any direct or indirect liability under Title IV
of ERISA or to a civil penalty under Section 502(j) of ERISA or liability
under Section 4069 of ERISA or Section 4975, 4976, or 4980B of the Code or
other liability with respect to the Company Plans.

  


 

  

(iv) No Actions are pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
with respect to any Company Plan.

  


 

  

(v) There is no (A) to the Knowledge of the Company, unfair labor practice
pending or threatened against or affecting the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (B) labor dispute or labor arbitration proceeding pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting the Company or

of ERISA to which any member of the ERISA Group contributes or has contributed
(in the six (6) years prior to the date hereof) for the benefit of an employee
of the ERISA Group ("Multiemployer Plan"), none of the members of the ERISA
Group has made or suffered a "complete withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal,"
as such terms are respectively defined in Sections 4203 and 4205 of ERISA, any
liability for which has not been satisfied in full. With respect to any
Multiemployer Plan, to the Knowledge of the Company: (A) no liability under
Section 4204 of ERISA has been imposed on any member of the ERISA Group in the
six (6) years prior to the date hereof, (B) none of the members of the ERISA
Group has received notice that any Multiemployer Plan is or will go into
"reorganization" or is "insolvent" as those terms are defined under ERISA, and

or is expected to be subject to Title IV of ERISA, is in "at risk" status
(within the meaning of Section 430 of the Code or Section 303 of ERISA). The

PBGC. No Encumbrance has been imposed on the assets of any member of the ERISA
Group under Section 303(k) of ERISA or Section 430(k) of the Code, and no
event or circumstance has occurred that is reasonably likely to result in the
imposition of any such Encumbrance on any such assets, on account of any
Company Plan pursuant to Section 303(k) of ERISA or Section 430(k) of the
Code.

  


 

  

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 3.12(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,

in this Agreement, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or
materially increase the amount of compensation due any such employee or
officer.

Intellectual Property Rights of any other Person by Company or its
Subsidiaries except for any of the foregoing that have since been fully and
finally resolved, (y) to the Knowledge of the Company, the operation of the

discharge, waiver or settlement of claims, liabilities or obligations (A) in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (B) reflected
or reserved against in, or contemplated by, the Financial Statements (or the
notes to the Financial Statements) for amounts not in excess of those so
reflected or reserved or (C) in an amount not to exceed $20 million in each
instance;

  


 

  

(viii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will materially change
any of the accounting methods, principles or practices used by it unless
required by a change in GAAP or Law;

  


 

  

(ix) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will (A) adopt a plan of
complete or partial liquidation, dissolution, merger, consolidation, business
combination, restructuring, recapitalization or other reorganization (other
than this Agreement), or (B) transfer, lease, license, sell, mortgage, pledge,
dispose of or encumber any material assets with a minimum value in excess of
$50 million, individually or in the aggregate, except that this clause (B)
shall not prohibit sales of inventory in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice; and

  


 

  

(x) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will enter into an
agreement, contract, commitment or arrangement to do any of the foregoing, or
to authorize, recommend, propose or announce an intention to do any of the

Section 5.2 _No Solicitation by the Company_.

  


 

  

(a) The Company shall immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with
any parties that may be ongoing with respect to a Takeover Proposal (as
hereinafter defined) and shall seek to have returned to the Company any
confidential information that has been provided in any such discussions or
negotiations. From the date hereof, the Company shall not, nor shall it permit
any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its
officers, directors or employees or any Affiliate, investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative
("Representatives") retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing information which has not been previously publicly disseminated),
or take any other action designed to facilitate, any inquiries or the making
of any proposal which constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Takeover Proposal or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding any Takeover Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, following
the receipt of a Superior Proposal (as hereinafter defined) or a proposal
which is reasonably expected to lead to a Superior Proposal that in either
case was unsolicited and made after the date hereof in

  

  

 

-24-  

  

  

circumstances not otherwise involving a breach of this Agreement, the Company
Board determines in good faith, after considering applicable provisions of
state Law and after consultation with outside counsel, that a failure to do so
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the
Company may, in response to such Takeover Proposal and subject to compliance
with _Section 5.2(b)_ and _Section 5.2(c)_ , (A) request information from the
party making such Takeover Proposal for the sole purpose of the Company Board
informing itself about the Takeover Proposal that has been made and the party
that made it, (B) furnish information with respect to the Company to the party
making such Takeover Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement, _provided_ that (1) such confidentiality agreement may not include
any provision calling for an exclusive right to negotiate with the Company and
(2) the Company advises Parent of all such nonpublic information delivered to
such person concurrently with its delivery to the requesting party, and (C)
participate in negotiations with such party regarding such Takeover Proposal.
It is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding
sentence by any executive officer, director or investment banker, attorney or
other advisor or representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.2(a)_ by the Company. The
Company agrees not to waive or fail to enforce any provision of any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a party relating to a
potential or actual Takeover Proposal, other than the waiver of or failure to
enforce any provision that would otherwise prevent a Takeover Proposal from
being made to the Company.

  

  

(b) Except as expressly permitted in this _Section 5.2(b)_ , neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or
propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the
approval, determination of advisability, or recommendation by the Company
Board or such committee of this Agreement, the Merger, and the other
Transactions, (ii) approve, determine to be advisable, or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve, determine to be advisable, or recommend, any
Takeover Proposal or (iii) cause the Company to enter into any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar
agreement (each, an "Acquisition Agreement") related to any Takeover Proposal
(other than a customary confidentiality agreement referred to in clause (B) of
the proviso to _Section 5.2(a)_ ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that the Company Board determines in good faith, in response to a Superior
Proposal that was unsolicited and made after the date hereof in circumstances
not otherwise involving a breach of this Agreement, after considering
applicable provisions of state Law and after consultation with outside
counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, the Company Board may (subject to compliance with
this sentence and to compliance with _Section 5.2(a)_ and _Section 5.2(c)_ )
(x) withdraw or modify its approval, determination of advisability, or
recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger, and the other Transactions or
(y) approve, determine to be advisable, or recommend a Superior Proposal, or
(z) cause the Company to enter into an Acquisition Agreement, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any actions described in clause (x), (y) or (z) may be taken
only (1) after the second (2nd) Business Day following Parent's receipt of
written notice from the Company advising Parent that the Company Board has
received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal, identifying the person making such Superior Proposal
and providing notice of the determination of the Company Board of what actions
described in clause (x), (y) or (z) the Company Board has determined to take,
(2) if the Company has negotiated in good faith with Parent during such notice
period, to the extent Parent requests to negotiate, to enable Parent to
propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement, (3) if, following the end of
such notice period, the Company Board

  

  

 

-25-  

  

  

shall have considered in good faith any written revisions to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent, and shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with financial advisors and receiving the advice of outside
counsel) that the Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute
a Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed by Parent were to be given
effect, and (4) if in the event of any change to any of the financial terms
(including the form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or any
other material terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each
case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that
described in clause (1) above of this proviso and a new notice period under
clause (1) of this proviso shall commence during which time the Company shall
be required to comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.2(b)_ anew with
respect to such additional notice pursuant to clauses (1) through (4) above of
this proviso; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company has complied in
all material respects with its obligations under _Section 8.1(c)_ and _Section
8.2(b)_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Company Board may at any time in response to an Intervening Event withdraw or
modify its approval, determination of advisability, or recommendation of this
Agreement, the Merger, and the other Transactions in the event it determines
in good faith, after considering applicable provisions of state Law and after
consultation with outside counsel, that such withdrawal or modification of its
approval, determination of advisability or recommendation is required in order
for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, _provided_ that the Company has provided to Parent five (5) Business
Days' prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such action
and specifying the Intervening Event in reasonable detail. 
 

  

  

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in _Section
5.2(a)_ and _Section 5.2(b)_ , the Company shall promptly advise Parent orally
and in writing of any request for confidential information in connection with
a Takeover Proposal or of any Takeover Proposal, the material terms and
conditions of such request or Takeover Proposal and the identity of the person
making such request or Takeover Proposal and shall keep Parent promptly
advised of all significant developments which could reasonably be expected to
culminate in the Company Board withdrawing, modifying or amending its
recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions, or in
exercising any of its other rights under _Section 5.2(a)_ or _Section 5.2(b)_.

  


 

  

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.2_ __ or _Section 6.6_ shall prohibit
the Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to its
shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any other disclosure to the
Company's shareholders if, in the Company Board's determination in good faith
after consultation with outside counsel, the failure so to disclose would be
inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_
, neither the Company nor the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall,
except as in accordance with _Section 5.2(b)_ , withdraw or modify, or propose
publicly to withdraw or modify, its approval, determination of advisability or
recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions or
approve, determine to be advisable, or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve, determine to be advisable, or recommend, a Takeover Proposal.

  ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

  


 

  

Section 6.1 _Preparation of Proxy Statement_.

  


 

  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement. The Company
will use reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to
the holders of the Shares, as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities Laws. Subject to _Section 5.2_ , the Proxy Statement will contain

to obtain the Shareholder Approval.

  


 

  

(b) Parent and Merger Sub will provide for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement of all required information relating to
Parent or its Affiliates. Parent and its counsel shall be given the
opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement before it is filed
with the SEC. In addition, the Company will provide Parent and its counsel, in
writing, any comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that
the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Proxy Statement promptly after the receipt of such
comments or other communications, and will provide Parent and its counsel the
opportunity to review and comment on the Company's proposed response thereto.
The Company will respond promptly to any such comments from the SEC or its
staff.

  


 

  

(c) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees to promptly (i) correct
any information provided by it specifically for use in the Proxy Statement if
and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect and (ii) supplement the information provided by it
specifically for use in the Proxy Statement to include any information that
shall become necessary in order to make the statements in the Proxy Statement,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
Company further agrees to cause the Proxy Statement as so corrected or
supplemented promptly to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the
holders of the Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities Laws.

  


 

  

Section 6.2 _Shareholders Meeting_.

  


 

  

(a) The Company shall take all actions in accordance with applicable Law, its
constituent documents and the rules of the New York Stock Exchange to duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of the Company's
shareholders (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the "Special
Meeting") for the purpose of considering and taking action upon the approval
of this Agreement as soon as practicable following the date hereof. The
Company shall include in the Proxy Statement the (i) recommendation of the
Company Board that the Company shareholders vote in favor of the approval of
the Merger and the approval of this Agreement, unless such recommendation has
been withdrawn, or as such recommendation has been modified or amended, in
each case in accordance with _Section 5.2_ , and (ii), subject to the consent
of the Financial Advisor, the opinion of the Financial Advisor described in
_Section 3.17_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, (x) the Company in its sole discretion may adjourn or postpone the
Special Meeting

  

  

 

-27-  

  

  

after consultation with Parent, to the extent necessary to ensure that any
required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the
shareholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time in advance of
the Special Meeting, and (y) the Company shall adjourn or postpone the Special
Meeting if, as of the time for which the Special Meeting is originally
scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient Shares
of Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Special Meeting.

  

  

(b) Parent shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Shares then owned by
it, Merger Sub or any of its other Subsidiaries and Affiliates (for the
avoidance of doubt, not including Shares owned by certain pension funds of its
Subsidiaries) in favor of the approval of the Merger and the approval of this
Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 6.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to _Section 6.3(e)_ :

  


 

  

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under any applicable Laws to consummate and make effective in the most
expeditious manner possible the Transactions including (i) the preparation and
filing of all forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to
consummate the Transactions, (ii) the satisfaction of the other parties'
conditions to consummating the Transactions, (iii) taking all reasonable
actions necessary to obtain (and cooperation with each other in obtaining) any
consent, authorization, Order or approval of, or any exemption by, any third
party, including any Governmental Entity (which actions shall include
furnishing all information required under the HSR Act and in connection with
approvals of or filings with any other Governmental Entity) required to be
obtained or made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions or the taking of any action
contemplated by the Transactions or by this Agreement, and (iv) the execution
and delivery by the Company of any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this
Agreement. Additionally, each of Parent and the Company shall use all
reasonable best efforts to fulfill all conditions precedent to the Merger and
shall not take any action after the date of this Agreement that would
reasonably be expected to materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not
obtaining, any permission, approval or consent from any Governmental Entity
necessary to be obtained prior to Closing.

  


 

  

(b) Prior to the Closing, each party shall promptly consult with the other
parties to this Agreement with respect to, provide any necessary information
with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other parties
(or their counsel) copies of), all filings made by such party with any
Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by such party to, or
correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement
and the Transactions. Each party to this Agreement shall promptly inform the
other parties to this Agreement of any communication from any Governmental
Entity regarding any of the Transactions. If any party to this Agreement or
any Affiliate of such parties receives a request for additional information or
documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Transactions, then such party will use reasonable best efforts to make, or
cause to be made, promptly and after consultation with the other parties to
this Agreement, an appropriate response in compliance with such request. To
the extent that transfers of any permits issued by any Governmental Entity are
required as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the

  

  


 

  

 

-28-  

  

  

consummation of the Transactions, the parties hereto shall use reasonable best
efforts to effect such transfers.

  

  

(c) The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to file antitrust
notifications as promptly as practicable in each relevant jurisdiction and
shall use reasonable best efforts to respond, as promptly as practicable, to
any inquiries received from the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice for additional information or
documentation and to respond, as promptly as practicable, to all inquiries and
information requests received from any state Attorney General or other
Governmental Entity in connection with antitrust matters.

  


 

  

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall use all reasonable best efforts to
resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity
with respect to the Transactions under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as
amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, and any other United States federal or state or foreign Laws that are
designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, "Antitrust
Laws"). In connection therewith, if any Action is instituted (or threatened to
be instituted) challenging any of the Transactions as violative of any
Antitrust Laws, each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and use all
reasonable best efforts to vigorously contest and resist any such Action, and
to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is
in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the
Merger or any other Transactions, including by vigorously pursuing all
available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal unless, by mutual
agreement, Parent and the Company decide that litigation is not in their
respective best interests. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, nothing in this _Section 6.3(d)_ shall limit the
right of any party hereto to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1_ , so long as such party hereto has, up to the time of termination,
complied in all material respects with its obligations under this _Section
6.3(d)_. Each of Parent and the Company shall use all reasonable best efforts
to take such action as may be required to cause the expiration of the notice
periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to the
Transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement.

  


 

  

(e) Notwithstanding _Section 6.3(a)_ through _Section 6.3(d)_ or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent or its
Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub and, after the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries) or Affiliates be required to agree to, or
the Company be permitted to agree to, (i) any prohibition of or limitation on
its or their ownership (or any limitation that would affect its or their
operation) of any portion of their respective businesses or assets, including
after giving effect to the Transactions, (ii) divest, hold separate or
otherwise dispose of any portion of its or their respective businesses or
assets, including after giving effect to the Transactions, (iii) any
limitation on its or their ability to effect the Merger, or the ability of the
Company (or Merger Sub) or its or their respective subsidiaries to acquire or
hold or exercise full rights of ownership of any capital stock of the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company, or (iv) any other limitation on its or their
ability to effectively control their respective businesses or any limitation
that would affect its or their ability to control their respective operations,
including after giving effect to the Transactions (any such action or
limitation described in clauses (i) through (iv) of this _Section 6.3(e)_, a
"Restriction"), other than Restrictions with respect to the Surviving

  

  

 

-29-  

  

  

Corporation and its Subsidiaries, individually or in the aggregate with all
other such Restrictions, for which the aggregate fair value of all businesses
or assets (including stock) affected, prior to giving effect to the Merger,
would not exceed $250,000,000. Nothing in this _Section 6.3(e)_ shall require
any party to take or agree to take any such action with respect to its
business or operations pursuant to this _Section 6.3(e)_ unless the
effectiveness of such agreement or action is conditioned upon the Closing.

  

  

(f) Without limiting the generality of the parties' obligations under _Section
6.3(a)_ through _Section 6.3(d)_ , Parent and the Company shall make such
informational filings and submissions as are reasonably required by any
Governmental Entity enforcing a foreign investment or similar Law, and shall
submit such affirmations or commitments with respect to the Company or its
Subsidiaries as are (i) of the same or similar nature, type and magnitude as
those that the Company or its Subsidiaries have made or submitted relating to
such Laws in connection with previous acquisitions of facilities or assets,
which affirmations or commitments are described on Section 6.3(f) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, and (ii) reasonably required by such Governmental
Entity. For the avoidance of doubt, such affirmations or commitments shall not
constitute Restrictions.

  


 

  

Section 6.4 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Subject to applicable Law, the
Company shall give prompt notice to Merger Sub and Parent, and Merger Sub and
Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of (a) the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event whose occurrence or non-occurrence would be reasonably
likely to cause either (i) any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate, in any respect that would cause any
condition to the Merger to be unsatisfied, at any time from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time or (ii) any condition to the Merger to be
unsatisfied in any material respect at the Effective Time and (b) any material
failure of the Company, Merger Sub or Parent, as the case may be, or any
officer, director, employee, agent or representative of the Company, Merger
Sub or Parent as applicable, to comply with or satisfy any covenant or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 6.4_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available under
this Agreement to the party receiving such notice.

  


 

  

Section 6.5 _Access; Confidentiality_. Subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement and applicable Law relating to the sharing of information, the
Company agrees to provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide, Parent
and its representatives, from time to time prior to the earlier of the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, reasonable access during
normal business hours to (i) the Company's and its Subsidiaries' respective
properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records, (ii) such
other information as Parent shall reasonably request with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses, financial
condition and operations. Parent shall and shall cause Parent's Affiliates and
representatives to keep confidential any non-public information received from
the Company, its Affiliates or representatives, directly or indirectly,
pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ and in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 6.6 _Publicity_. Neither the Company, Parent nor any of their
respective Affiliates shall issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other announcement with respect to this Agreement or the
Transactions without the prior consultation of the other party and giving the
other party the opportunity to review and comment on such press release or
other

  

  

 

-30-  

  

  

announcement, if practicable, except as such party reasonably believes, after
receiving the advice of outside counsel and after informing all other parties
to this Agreement, is required by Law or by any listing agreement with or
rules of any applicable national securities exchange, trading market or
listing authority and except as may be requested by a Governmental Entity.

  

  

Section 6.7 _Indemnification_.

  


 

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who
is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who
becomes such prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") against (i) any
and all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, fines, liabilities or
judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement with the approval of the
indemnifying party of or in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in whole
or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whether pertaining to any action or
omission existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and whether
asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time ("Indemnified
Liabilities"), and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part
on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to this Agreement or
the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the case of the Surviving
Corporation, such indemnification shall only be to the fullest extent a
corporation is permitted under Oregon Law to indemnify its own directors and
officers, and in the case of Parent, such indemnification shall not be limited
by Oregon Law but Parent shall not be required to indemnify the Indemnified
Parties if a final, non-appealable judgment or adjudication in an action
against such Indemnified Parties by a claimant (not including an action
brought by Parent, Surviving Corporation, or any insurer of either) with
respect to such claims establishes: (A) that the acts or omissions of such
Indemnified Parties were the result of deliberate criminal or fraudulent acts
by the Indemnified Parties seeking indemnification; or (B) that the claim
against such Indemnified Parties arises out of, is based upon, or is
attributable to the gaining in fact of any financial profit or other advantage
to which such Indemnified Parties were not legally entitled. Parent, Merger
Sub, and the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, will pay all expenses
of each Indemnified Party in advance of the final disposition of any such
action or proceeding, but in the case of Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation only to the fullest extent permitted by Oregon Law. Without
limiting the foregoing, in the event any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation is brought against any Indemnified Party (whether arising
before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Indemnified Parties may retain
counsel satisfactory to them and reasonably satisfactory to Parent, (ii)
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay all reasonable
fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as
statements therefor are received, and (iii) Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, use all reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous
defense of any such matter, _provided_ that none of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement of any claim effected
without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this
_Section 6.7_ , upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall notify Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation
(but the failure so to notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve it from
any liability which it may have under this _Section 6.7_ except to the extent
such failure materially prejudices such party). The Indemnified Parties (as a
group) may each retain only one law firm (in addition to local counsel in each
applicable jurisdiction if reasonably required) to represent

  

  


 

  

 

-31-  

  

  

them with respect to each such matter unless there is a conflict on any
significant issue between the positions of any two or more Indemnified
Parties.

  

  

(b) The articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain the provisions with respect to indemnification set forth in the
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company, which provisions shall
not be amended, modified or otherwise repealed for a period of six years from
the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder as of the Effective Time of any individual who at the Effective
Time is an Indemnified Party, unless such modification is required after the
Effective Time by Law and then only to the minimum extent required by such
Law.

  


 

  

(c) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this _Section 6.7_ shall be in
addition to any rights such individual may have under the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws (or other governing documents) of the Company and any
of its Subsidiaries, under Oregon Law or any other applicable Laws or under
any agreement of any Indemnified Party with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. The rights under this _Section 6.7_ shall survive consummation
of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party.

  


 

  

(d) In the event that the Parent or Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.7_.

  

  

(e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 6.7_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies; _provided_ , _however_
that following the Closing there shall be no obligation to continue or extend
such policies.

  

  

Section 6.8 _Merger Sub Compliance_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to comply
with all of its obligations under or related to this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 6.9 _Employee Matters_.

  


 

  

(a) For a period of one year from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide, or cause to be provided, to (i) the
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, "Company
Employees") as of immediately prior to the Effective Time whose employment is
terminated prior to such first anniversary of the Effective Time, severance
payments and severance benefits no less favorable than those that were made
available to terminated Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (ii) Company Employees as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
who remain employed by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries,
compensation and benefits that are no less favorable to the Company Employees,
in the aggregate, than the compensation and benefits

  

  

 

-32-  

  

  

provided such Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including in prior compensation and benefits the value of one year of annual
benefit accruals under each SERP, but excluding (I) the value of all
accelerated payments of accrued SERP benefits paid in connection with the
Merger, (II) the value of any other benefits that are accelerated in
connection with the Merger, and (III) any bonuses other than annual bonuses);
_provided_ , that the foregoing obligation shall not restrict Parent and the
Surviving Corporation from making changes that (A) are consistent with changes
currently planned or contemplated by the Company, (B) are in response to
business conditions which may exist at the time of such changes or (C) are
collectively bargained for. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
honor in accordance with their terms all Company Plans; _provided_ , _however_
, that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may amend, modify or terminate any
individual Company Plan in accordance with its terms and applicable Law
(including obtaining the consent of the other parties to and beneficiaries of
such Company Plan to the extent required thereunder). Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall not, after the Effective Time, provide
any form of equity-based compensation, including options to purchase shares of
capital stock in the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ that any equity-based compensation provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to the Company Plans immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be taken into account in determining whether the compensation and
benefits provided by Parent and the Surviving Corporation are less favorable
to the Company Employees, in the aggregate, than those provided by the Company
for purposes of the first sentence of this _Section 6.9(a)_ , unless the
Company grants cash-based performance awards prior to the Effective Time, in
which case such equity-based compensation shall not be taken into account.

  

  

(b) For purposes of all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA) and other employment agreements, arrangements and policies of the
Surviving Corporation under which an employee's benefits depend, in whole or
in part, on length of service, credit will be given to current employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries for service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or predecessors prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ that such
crediting of service does not result in duplication of benefits; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that such service would have been recognized under the
corresponding Company Plan.

  


 

  

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement, and nothing
in this _Section 6.9_ , express or implied, shall confer upon any Company
Employee, legal representative or beneficiary thereof, or any other person any
rights or remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment
for any specified period, or compensation or benefits, of any nature or kind
whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing contained in this _Section 6.9_ ,
express or implied (i) shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement or (ii) shall alter or limit
the ability of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement
or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by
any of such entities.

  


 

  

(d) With respect to matters described in this _Section 6.9_ , the Company will
not send any written notices or other written communication materials to the
Company Employees without the prior written consent of Parent.

Section 6.10 _Takeover Statutes; Shareholder Rights Agreement_. Each of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective boards of directors shall
grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render the restrictions of any
Takeover Statutes that become or are deemed to be applicable to the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub or the Transactions, to be inapplicable to the foregoing.
The Company covenants and agrees not to amend the Shareholder Rights Agreement
(as amended as described in clause (v) of _Section 3.2(c)_ ) without the
written consent of Parent and Merger Sub, and further agrees not to take any
steps to render the Shareholder Rights Agreement applicable to the
Transaction.

  


 

  

Section 6.11 _Shareholder Litigation_. Each party to this Agreement shall give
the other parties to this Agreement the opportunity to participate in the
defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation against any party and/or
its respective directors relating to the Transactions, whether commenced prior
to or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement. The Company agrees
that it shall not settle or offer to settle any litigation commenced prior to
or after the date hereof against the Company or any of its directors or
officers by any shareholder of the Company relating to this Agreement, the
Merger or any other Transaction or otherwise, where such settlement would
impose obligations (monetary or otherwise) on the Company or the Surviving
Corporation without the prior written consent of Parent.

other such Restrictions, for which the aggregate fair value of all businesses
or assets (including stock) affected, prior to giving effect to the Merger,
would not exceed $250,000,000.

nor the Company may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in _Section
7.1_ , _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_ , as the case may be, to be satisfied to
excuse it from its obligation to effect the Merger if such failure was caused
by such party's failure to comply with its obligations to consummate the
Merger and the other Transactions to the extent required by and subject to
_Section 6.3_.

  


 

  

ARTICLE VIII 
  
  TERMINATION

  


 

  

Section 8.1 _Termination_. Anything herein or elsewhere to the contrary
notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be
abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time (notwithstanding any
Shareholder Approval):

  


 

  

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company;

  


 

  

(b) by either Parent or the Company if:

  


 

  

(i) the Merger has not been consummated on or before March 8, 2016 (the
"Outside Date"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any
party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement results in the failure
of the Merger to be consummated by 
 

  

 

-36-  

  

such time; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that, if, on the Outside Date,
any of the conditions to the Closing set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ shall not
have been fulfilled but all other conditions to the Closing either have been
fulfilled or are then capable of being fulfilled, then the Outside Date shall,
without any action on the part of the parties hereto, be extended day-by-day
for each day during which any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_
remain unfulfilled, but in no event shall the Outside Date be extended to be
later than August 8, 2016;

  

  

(ii) a permanent injunction or other Order which is final and nonappealable
shall have been issued or taken restraining or otherwise prohibiting
consummation of the Merger or any of the other Transactions (any such
injunction or Order, a "Final Order"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the party
seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_
shall have used all reasonable best efforts to prevent the entry of such
permanent injunction or other Order to the extent required by and subject to
_Section 6.3_ ; or

  


 

  

(iii) if the Special Meeting (including any adjournments and postponements
thereof) shall have concluded without the Shareholder Approval having been
obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote of the holders
of Shares, _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company's right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ is subject to the Company's
compliance with clause (y) of the third sentence of _Section 6.2(a)_ ;

  


 

  

(c) by the Company prior to the receipt of the Shareholder Approval, if the
Company concurrently enters into a definitive agreement with respect to a

provisions of _Section 5.2_ and shall have previously paid or shall
concurrently with such termination pay the fee due under _Section 8.2(b)_ ;

  


 

  

(d) by Parent, if the Company Board or any committee thereof shall have
withdrawn or modified, or proposed publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner
adverse to Parent, the approval, determination of advisability or
recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions, or
approved, determined to be advisable or recommended, or proposed publicly to
approve, determine to be advisable or recommend, any Takeover Proposal, or the
Company Board or any committee thereof shall have resolved to take any of the
foregoing actions;

  


 

  

(e) by Parent, if the Company breaches or fails to perform or comply with any
of its representations, warranties, agreements or covenants contained in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform or comply (i) would give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_
and (ii) cannot be cured by the Outside Date ( _provided_ that Parent is not
then in material breach of any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant
contained in this Agreement); or

  


 

  

(f) by the Company, if Parent or Merger Sub breaches or fails to perform or
comply with any of its representations, warranties, agreements or covenants
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform or comply (i)
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or
_Section 7.3(b)_ and (ii) cannot be cured by the Outside 
 

  

 

-37-  

  

  

Date ( _provided_ that the Company is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, agreement or covenant contained in this Agreement).

  

  

A terminating party shall provide written notice of termination to the other
parties specifying with particularity the reason for such termination. If more
than one provision of this _Section 8.1_ is available to a terminating party
in connection with a termination, a terminating party may rely on any and all
available provisions in this _Section 8.1_ for any such termination.

  


 

  

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

  


 

  

(a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_ , this Agreement
shall become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any party
(or any shareholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or
representative of such party) to the other party hereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if such termination shall result from the (i) failure of
either party to fulfill a condition to the performance of the obligations of
the other party or (ii) failure of either party to perform an agreement or
covenant hereof, such party shall not be relieved of any liability to the
other party as a result of such failure or breach, and in the case of fraud or
a willful breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, the Company shall
have the right to pursue damages on behalf of its shareholders (which the
parties acknowledge and agree may include, to the extent proven, the benefit
of the bargain lost by such shareholders); _provided_ _further_ , _however_ ,
that the provisions of _Section 6.5_ relating to confidentiality, _Section
6.6_ , this _Section 8.2_ , _Article IX_ and _Article X_ hereof shall survive
such termination.

  


 

  

(b) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to the provisions of _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ , _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ or
_Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ , but in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)(ii)_ , only if the applicable Final Order is based on the existence of
a Takeover Proposal (whether or not modified after it is first made), and, in
the case of any termination under this clause (i), (A) prior to such
termination a Takeover Proposal shall have been made known to the Company or
generally to its shareholders or any Person shall have publicly announced an
intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Takeover Proposal, and (B) at
any time on or prior to the 12-month anniversary of such termination the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to any Takeover Proposal or the transactions contemplated by any
Takeover Proposal are consummated (provided that solely for purposes of this
_Section 8.2(b)_ , the term "Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning set
forth in the definition of "Takeover Proposal" except that all references to
20% shall be deemed to be references to 50%; _provided_ _further_ , _however_
, that with respect to any Person that makes a Takeover Proposal covered by
_Section 8.2(b)(i)(A)_ and then such Person or any of its Affiliates or
Associates enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates,
a Takeover Proposal within the time period specified in _Section 8.2(b)(i)(B)_
, the references to 20% in the term "Takeover Proposal" shall remain at 20%
for purposes of _Section 8.2(b)(i)(A)_ ), or (ii) by Parent pursuant to the
provisions of _Section 8.1(d)_ , or by the Company pursuant to the provisions
of _Section 8.1(c)_ , the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee by wire
transfer (to an account designated by Parent) in immediately available funds
(x) in the case of clause (i) of this _Section 8.2(b)_ , upon the earlier of
entering into such definitive agreement with respect to a Takeover Proposal or
consummation of the transactions contemplated by a Takeover Proposal, and (y)
in the case of clause (ii) of this _Section 8.2(b)_ , prior to or concurrently
with such termination. "Termination Fee" shall mean a cash amount equal to
$600 million.

  

  


 

  

 

-38-  

  

  

(c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in _Section 8.2(b)_
are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these agreements,
Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the
Company fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to _Section
8.2(b)_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub commences a
claim, action, suit or other proceeding that results in a judgment against the
Company, the Company shall pay to Parent interest on such amount from and
including the date payment of such amount was due to but excluding the date of
actual payment at the prime rate set forth in the Wall Street Journal in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus 2%, together with
reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with such claim,
suit, proceeding or other action.

  


 

  

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion,
whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable under more than one
provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and the
occurrence of different events. The Termination Fee, if paid, shall be
credited against any damages recovered by Parent or Merger Sub from the
Company arising from a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

Section 9.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original but all of which will
constitute one instrument.

  


 

  

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the schedules and annexes to this Agreement, including the Company
Disclosure Letter) and, prior to the Closing, the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement other than those referenced in clause (i) of the
last sentence of this _Section 9.6_ , (a) constitute the entire agreement and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, and
(b) except for the provisions in _Section 6.7_ , solely to the extent stated
therein, is not intended to and shall not confer upon any Person other than
the parties to this Agreement and their permitted assigns any rights, benefits
or remedies of any nature whatsoever, other than the right of the holders of
Shares of the Company to receive the Merger Consideration after the Closing (a
claim with respect to which may not be made unless and until the Effective
Time shall have occurred). In the event of any conflict or inconsistency
between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail. The parties hereby agree
that (i) Sections 3 and 7 and the last sentence of Section 9 of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect
as of the date hereof and (ii) the remaining provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect as of the
Effective Time.

  


 

  

Section 9.7 _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement is held
by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity to be
invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the remainder
of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, so long as

  

  

 

-41-  

  

  

the economic and legal substance of the Transactions, taken as a whole, are
not affected in a manner materially adverse to any party hereto.

Summary of the Material Terms and Conditions of the Merger, including Manner
and Basis of Converting Shares. The following summary is qualified in its
entirety by the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of August 8, 2015, by
and among Berkshire Hathaway Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Merger
Sub and the Company (the "Agreement"):

  


 

  

Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Agreement and in
accordance with the Oregon Business Corporation Act, at the Effective Time (as
defined below), Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the
"Merger"), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and the
Company will continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation"). The Merger shall become effective as of the date and time of
the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Oregon, or such later time as is specified in the Articles of Merger (the
"Effective Time").

  


 

  

Effect of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the
applicable provisions of the Oregon Business Corporation Act. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time,
all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises and
authority of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

  


 

  

Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of shares of common stock, without par value and with $1 stated value,
of the Company (the "Shares") or securities of Parent or Merger Sub:

  


 

  

Each Share issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time (other
than any Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 3.3(ii)) will be cancelled
and extinguished and be converted into the right to receive $235.00 in cash
payable to the holder of such Share, without interest (the "Merger
Consideration"), upon surrender of either certificates formerly representing
such Shares or any book-entry Shares. All such Shares, when so converted, will
no longer be outstanding and will be automatically cancelled, retired and
cease to exist. Each holder of certificates or book-entry Shares will cease to
have any rights with respect to such Shares, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration for such Shares upon the surrender of such certificate or
book-entry Share, without interest.

  

  

 

A-1  

  

  

Each Share owned by Parent immediately before the Effective Time and any
Shares held by wholly-owned subsidiaries of Parent that Parent has elected, by
written notice to the Company and the paying agent, to be cancelled, will be
cancelled and extinguished, and no payment or other consideration will be made
with respect to such shares.

  


 

  

Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time will thereafter
represent one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. At the
Effective Time, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated
as of the Effective Time to be in the form of (except with respect to the name
of the Company) the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub, and as
so amended shall be the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended.

  


 

  

Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. The directors of Merger
Sub immediately before the Effective Time will be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation and the officers of the Company immediately before the
Effective Time will be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in
each case until their successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified
or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.
