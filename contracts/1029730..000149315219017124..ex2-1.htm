the Company and Parent, the closing for the Merger (the "Closing") shall take

at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in

conditions), then the Closing shall occur instead on the date following the

Corporation shall be the by-laws of the Company as in effect immediately prior

Article IV _ 
 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; PAYMENT MECHANICS_

  



  

Section 4.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital
stock of the Company or on the part of the sole shareholder of Merger Sub:

  



  

(a)  _Merger Consideration_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.0001
per share (a "Share" or, collectively, the "Shares"), of the Company issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
(i) Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent and Shares owned by the Company and, in
each case, not held on behalf of third parties, (ii) Dissenting Shares and
(iii) Company Restricted Shares (each Share referenced in clauses (i), (ii)
or (iii), an "Excluded Share" and collectively, "Excluded Shares")) shall be
converted into the right to receive $3.50 per Share (the "Per Share Merger
Consideration"). Each Share (other than any Excluded Shares) shall cease to
be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the
Effective Time, and each certificate formerly representing any Shares (other
than Excluded Shares) (each, a "Certificate") and each book-entry account
formerly representing any non-certificated Shares (other than Excluded Shares)
(each, a "Book-Entry Share") shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest.

  



  

(b)  _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled without any payment of any consideration
thereof and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, subject to any
rights the holder thereof may have pursuant to _Section 4.4_ with respect to
any Excluded Shares that are Dissenting Shares or pursuant to _Section
4.5(b) _ with respect to any Excluded Shares that are Company Restricted
Shares.

  



  

(c)  _Company Preferred Stock_. Each share of the 8.00% Series A Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (a "Preferred Share"
or, collectively, the "Preferred Shares"), of the Company shall remain
outstanding.

  



  

(d)  _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

Section 4.2 _Payment Mechanics_.

  



  

(a)  _Deposit of Merger Consideration and Paying Agent_.

  



  

(i) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause
to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent (subject to the
consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, of the Company) (the "Paying
Agent"), an amount in cash in immediately available funds sufficient in the
aggregate to provide all funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make
payments in respect of the Shares pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_ and the
Company Equity Payments to be paid by the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section
4.5(d)_ (such cash, the "Exchange Fund").

  



    

-5- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(ii) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall enter into an agreement (the
"Paying Agent Agreement") pursuant to which Parent shall appoint the Paying
Agent, which shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company (such acceptance not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
delayed). Pursuant to the Paying Agent Agreement, among other things, the
Paying Agent shall (A) act as the paying agent for the payment and delivery
of the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and for the payment of the Company Equity Payments to be paid
by the Paying Agent pursuant to  _Section 4.5(d)_ and (B) invest the Exchange
Fund, if and as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any investment shall be in obligations of or guaranteed as to principal and
interest by the U.S. government in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or
P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's
Financial Services, LLC, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such
bank that are then publicly available), or in money market funds having a
rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit
rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing
and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding
three months. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such
investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the
level required to make prompt payment and delivery of the aggregate Per Share
Merger Consideration as contemplated by _Section 4.1(a) _ and the Company
Equity Payments to be paid by the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 4.5(d)_ ,
Parent shall promptly restore or cause the restoration of the cash in the
Exchange Fund diminished through such investments or other events so as to
ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all relevant times maintained at a level
sufficient to make such cash payments. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investment (if any) in excess of the amounts payable
pursuant to _Section 4.2(b)_ and _Section 4.5(d)_ shall be promptly returned
to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as determined by Parent in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Paying Agent Agreement.

  



  

(b)  _Procedures for Surrender_.

  



  

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the third business day following the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail or otherwise provide each holder
of record of Shares that are (A) Certificates or (B) Book-Entry Shares not
held, directly or indirectly, through DTC notice advising such holders of the
effectiveness of the Merger, which notice shall include (1) appropriate
transmittal materials (including a customary letter of
transmittal) specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates or such Book-Entry Shares shall pass only upon
delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates, as provided in _Section 4.3_ ) or the surrender of such Book-
Entry Shares to the Paying Agent (which shall be deemed to have been effected
upon the delivery of a customary "agent's message" with respect to such Book-
Entry Shares or such other reasonable evidence, if any, of such surrender as
the Paying Agent may reasonably request pursuant to the terms and conditions
of the Paying Agent Agreement), as applicable (such materials to be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably
agree), and (2) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates, as provided in _Section
4.3_ ) or such Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent in exchange for the Per
Share Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive as a
result of the Merger pursuant to this _Article IV_.

  



    

-6- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(ii) With respect to Book-Entry Shares held, directly or indirectly, through
the Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), Parent and the Company shall cooperate
to establish procedures with the Paying Agent, DTC, DTC's nominees and such
other necessary or desirable third-party intermediaries to ensure that the
Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time, upon surrender of Shares held of record by DTC or
its nominees in accordance with DTC's customary surrender procedures and such
other procedures as agreed by Parent, the Company, the Paying Agent, DTC,
DTC's nominees and such other necessary or desirable third-party
intermediaries, the Per Share Merger Consideration to which the
beneficial owners thereof are entitled to receive as a result of the Merger
pursuant to this _Article IV_.

  



  

(iii) Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of Shares that (A) are Certificates,
by physical surrender of such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
the Certificates, as provided in _Section 4.3_ ) together with the letter of
transmittal, duly completed and executed, and such other documents as may be
reasonably required by the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of the
materials and instructions provided by the Paying Agent, (B) are Book-Entry
Shares not held through DTC, by book-receipt of an "agent's message" by the
Paying Agent in connection with the surrender of Book-Entry Shares (or such
other reasonable evidence, if any, of surrender with respect to such Book-
Entry Shares, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request pursuant to the terms
and conditions of the Paying Agent Agreement), in each case of the foregoing
clauses (A) and (B) of this _Section 4.2(b)(iii)_ , pursuant to such
materials and instructions as contemplated by _Section 4.2(b)(i)_ , and (C)
are Book-Entry Shares held, directly or indirectly, through DTC, in
accordance with DTC's customary surrender procedures and such other procedures
as agreed by the Company, Parent, the Paying Agent, DTC, DTC's nominees and
such other necessary or desirable third-party intermediaries pursuant to
_Section 4.2(a)(ii)_ , the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay and deliver, out of the Exchange Fund, as promptly as
practicable to such holders, an amount in cash in immediately available funds
equal to the product obtained by __multiplying__ (1) the number of Shares
represented by such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the

resulting from any investments thereof (if any)) that remains unclaimed by
the holders of Shares entitled thereto for 12 months from and after the
Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
determined by Parent. Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who

contemplated by this _Section 4.2_ and any holder of Company Equity Awards

Certificate, issue a check in the amount equal to the product obtained by
__multiplying__ (i) the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate by (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

  



  

Section 4.4 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, if required by the FBCA (but only to the extent required
thereby), any Shares that are held by holders (i) that are entitled to and
properly demand and exercise their dissenters' rights and who comply in all
respects with the provisions of Section 607.1301 to 607.1333 of the FBCA and
(ii) who have not effectively withdrawn such demand (collectively, the
"Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive, as of
the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger Consideration as provided in
_Section 4.1(a)_ , unless and until such Person shall have effectively
withdrawn or otherwise lost or failed to perfect such Person's right to
appraisal or payment under the FBCA, at which time such Shares shall be
treated as if they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the
right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 4.1(a)_ , without interest, and
such Shares shall not be deemed Dissenting Shares, and such holder thereof
shall cease to have any other rights with respect to such Shares. Each holder
of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by
the provisions of Sections 607.1301 through 607.1333 of the FBCA with respect
to such Dissenting Shares, unless and until such Person shall have
effectively withdrawn or otherwise lost or failed to perfect such Person's
right to appraisal or payment under the FBCA. The Company shall give Parent
(i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, withdrawals or
attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to
shareholders' rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal under
the FBCA. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any
withdrawal of any such demands.

Qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan as Amended and Restated (the "ESPP"))
that may be necessary or required under the ESPP and applicable Laws to

commenced on October 1, 2019 (the "Final Offering"), no offering period shall
be authorized or commenced on or after the date of this Agreement, (B) the
Final Offering shall end on a date no later than the business day immediately
preceding the Closing Date (the earlier of the date the Final Offering ends
and the business day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the
"ESPP Termination Date"), (C) each ESPP participant's accumulated
contributions under the ESPP shall be used to purchase Shares in accordance
with the ESPP as of the end of the Final Offering, with any remaining
contributions returned to the participant (without interest) as soon as
administratively practicable thereafter, (D) the applicable purchase price for
Shares shall not be decreased below the levels set forth in the ESPP as of

amounts contemplated by this _Section 4.5_ and, for the avoidance of doubt,
any accrued but unpaid dividends with respect to any Company Equity Awards
(collectively, the "Company Equity Payments"); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that to the extent the holder of a Company Equity Award is not and was not at
any time during the applicable vesting period an employee of the Company or a
Subsidiary thereof, such amounts shall not be paid through the payroll system,
but shall be paid by the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 4.2_. Parent shall
ensure that the Surviving Corporation shall have an amount in cash
sufficient to pay all amounts required by the foregoing sentence.

  



  

(e)  _Corporate Actions._ At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board and the compensation committee of the Company Board, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are
necessary to effectuate the provisions of this _Section 4.5_.

  



  

Section 4.6 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if, from the execution and delivery
of this Agreement to the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of
this Agreement and abandonment of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ , the issued and outstanding Shares or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares shall

different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split, stock
dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange
offer, or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend with a record date
within such period shall have been declared, then the Per Share Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall
be equitably adjusted to provide the holders of Shares the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 4.6_ shall be

or covenant shall not be deemed an admission by the Company that such item
(or any non-disclosed item or information of comparable or greater
significance) represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstances
or that such item has had a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company
represents and warrants to Parent, as of the date hereof (except to the extent

or organization and has the requisite corporate or other organizational power
to own, operate or lease the properties and assets owned, operated or
leased by it and to conduct its business as presently conducted, except, in
each case, where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would

organizational power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under, and consummate the transactions contemplated by, this
Agreement. Subject only to the approval of this Agreement and the Merger and

transactions contemplated hereby, will not (i) violate or conflict with any
provision of the Constituent Documents of the Company or the Constituent
Documents of any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) violate or conflict with any Law

to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or
the Securities Act since December 31, 2016 (the "Applicable Date") (the
forms, statements, schedules, certifications, reports and documents filed or
furnished since the Applicable Date and those filed or furnished subsequent to

Reports"). Each of the Company Reports, at the time of its filing or being

of the staff of the SEC received by the Company relating to the Company
Reports. As of their respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date of
this Agreement, as of the date of such amendment), the Company Reports did
not, and any Company Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to
the date of this Agreement will not, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein

(c) The Company maintains internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act).
Such internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP and includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the asset of the Company, (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts
and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the Company, and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a
material effect on its financial statements. The Company has disclosed, based
on the most recent evaluation of its chief executive officer and its chief
financial officer prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Company's
auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (A) any significant
deficiencies in the design or operation of its internal controls over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and has identified for the Company's auditors and audit committee
of the Company Board any material weaknesses in internal control over
financial reporting and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Company has made
available to Parent (i) a summary of any such disclosure made by management to
the Company's auditors and audit committee since the Applicable Date and (ii)
any material communication since the Applicable Date made by management
or the Company's auditors to the audit committee required or contemplated by
listing standards of the NYSE, the audit committee's charter or professional
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Since the
Applicable Date, (i) no material complaints from any source regarding
accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters have been
received by the Company; and (ii) to the Company's Knowledge, no material
concerns from employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries regarding
questionable accounting or auditing matters or any whistle-blower complaints,
have been received by the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to, nor does it have any commitment to become a party
to, any off-balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract (including any
Contract relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the
Company or one of the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated affiliate, on the other hand) or any "off-balance
sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC).

  



  

(d) The Company has established and maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as such term is defined in paragraph (e) of Rule 13a-15 under
the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The
Company's disclosure controls and procedures are sufficient to ensure that
all information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company's management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Neither the Company nor any
of the Company Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has arranged any
outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers within
the meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

not required to be recorded or reflected in a balance sheet prepared in
accordance with GAAP), other than Liabilities: (i) disclosed, reflected or
reserved against in the financial statements included in the Company Reports
filed with the SEC and publicly available at least 24 hours prior to the date
of this Agreement or the notes thereto; (ii) that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had a Company Material Adverse Effect; or (iii) incurred
pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby in accordance with this Agreement.

  



  

(f) Each of the balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into
the Company Reports (including the related notes and schedules) fairly
presents, or, in the case of Company Reports filed after the date of this
Agreement, will fairly present the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the
statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows included
in or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including any
related notes and schedules) fairly presents, or in the case of Company
Reports filed after the date of this Agreement, will fairly present the
results of operations, retained earnings (loss) and changes in financial
position, as the case may be, of such companies for the periods set forth
therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to notes and normal
year-end audit adjustments that will not be material in amount or effect), in
each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods
involved, except as may be noted therein.

  



  

(g) Other than ordinary course director compensation, ordinary course
compensation and employee benefit entitlements, ordinary course reimbursement
of travel and entertainment expenses or advances regarding the same, in each
case that are payable in the ordinary course consistent with past practice
and/or that would be permitted by _Section 7.1(a)(xx)_ if taken after the date
hereof or as disclosed in the Company Reports or Section 5.18 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, since the Applicable Date neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has entered into any transaction or arrangement with any (A)
director or officer of the Company, (B) Person who is or was, since the
Applicable Date, a greater than 5% shareholder of the Company or (C) any of
their respective Affiliates.

with the SEC contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they

requirements of Section 409A of the Code. Except with respect to the actions
described in _Section 4.5_ and in Section 5.8(e)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or together with any other
event, including change in employment title or employment termination) will:
(i) entitle any current or former employee of the Company or any Subsidiary
to any payment or benefit, including any bonus, retention, severance,
retirement or job security payment or benefit; (ii) enhance any benefits or
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, or
increase the amount payable or trigger any other obligation under, any
Benefit Plan; or (iii) limit or restrict the right of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or, after the Closing, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Affiliates to merge, amend or terminate any Benefit Plan.
Except as set forth in Section 5.8(e)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummations of the
transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or together with any other

commitment under any Material Contract, nor, to the Company's Knowledge, is
any such party threatening to do so. The execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by it of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to which it is a party
will not violate, or result in a right to terminate, recapture, rescind or
modify, accelerate any rights under, any Material Contract or, as applicable,
any coverage provided by any party thereto. Except for matters which have not
had and would not reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, no Material Contract contains any provision providing that any party
thereto (other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) may terminate or
cancel the same by reason of the consummation of the Merger.

Merger Sub consists solely of 100 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per

and has no, and prior to the Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities
or obligations of any nature other than those incident to its formation and

transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.3 _Financial Ability_. The amount of funds contemplated to be
provided pursuant to the Commitment Letters (as defined below), together with
cash on hand and other readily available sources of cash, will be sufficient,
when funded, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and to otherwise pay all of Parent's and Merger Sub's payment obligations
under this Agreement, including payment of the payments pursuant to Article
IV and any fees and expenses (including any financing costs), and to redeem
(or pay the Conversion Consideration (as defined in the Articles of
Incorporation of the Company) with respect to) all outstanding Preferred
Shares (such amounts, the "Required Amount"). Parent has furnished the
Company with true, correct and complete copies of: (i) the executed letter
agreement, dated as of the date hereof, among Parent, Merger Sub, the Company,
the Investor and the Sponsors attached hereto as Exhibit A (including all
exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments thereto, the "Equity
Letter"), pursuant to which (x) each Sponsor and the Investor has committed,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to invest in the
Investor or Parent, as applicable, the cash amount set forth therein (the
"Equity Financing") and (y) each Sponsor has guaranteed, subject to the terms
and conditions set forth therein, to the Company the due and punctual
payment by Parent to the Company of such Sponsor's Pro Rata Percentage of the
Reverse Termination Fee in the event that the Reverse Termination Fee is
required to be paid by Parent pursuant to Section 9.5(d); and (ii) the
executed debt commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof between Parent
and each of the lenders and commitment parties party thereto from time to time
(collectively, the "Debt Financing Sources") and each executed fee letter
(subject to customary redactions with respect to fees, pricing caps and
similar commercially sensitive economic terms, provided that such redacted
information does not adversely affect the amount, availability or
conditionality of the funding of the Debt Financing) and attached hereto as
Exhibit B (such commitment letter, including all exhibits, schedules, annexes
and amendments thereto, and each such fee letter, collectively, the "Debt
Commitment Letter", and together with the Equity Letter, the "Commitment
Letters"), pursuant to which the Debt Financing Sources have committed,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to lend the amounts
set forth therein for the purposes of financing the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (the "Debt Financing" and, together with the Equity
Financing, the "Financing"). None of the Commitment Letters have been
amended, modified or supplemented prior to the date of this Agreement, and no
such amendment, modification or supplementation is contemplated or pending
except to the extent permitted in Section 7.15. To the Knowledge of Parent,
the respective commitments and/or guarantees contained in the Commitment
Letters have not been withdrawn, rescinded, terminated or repudiated in any
respect and no such withdrawal, rescission, termination or repudiation is
contemplated. Except for customary fee credit letters and engagement letters
with respect to the fees and related arrangements (in each case that do not
contain any conditions precedent to the funding of the Debt Financing and do
not adversely affect the amount, availability or conditionality of the funding
of the Debt Financing) contemplated by the Debt Financing, as of the date of
this Agreement, there are no side letters or other written Contracts related
to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the
Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters
delivered to the Company on or prior to the date hereof. As of the date of
this Agreement, there are no conditions precedent related to the funding of
the full amount of the Financing other than as expressly set forth in the
Commitment Letters delivered to the Company on or prior to the date hereof.
Assuming (i) the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1 and
Section 8.2, (ii) the accuracy in all material respects of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.2(a), Section 5.3(e) and
Section 5.5 and (iii) the completion of the Marketing Period, the aggregate
proceeds contemplated by the Commitment Letters will be sufficient when
funded, together with cash on hand and other readily available sources of
cash, to pay the Required Amount. As of the date hereof, the Commitment
Letters are in full force and effect. As of the date of this Agreement, the
Commitment Letters are (i) legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Investor, as applicable, and to the knowledge of Parent,
each of the other parties thereto and (ii) enforceable in accordance with
their respective terms against Parent, Merger Sub and the Investor, as
applicable, and to the knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto
subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. As of the date of this
Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Sub or the Investor is in breach of any of
its covenants or other obligations set forth in, or is in default under the
Commitment Letters, nor does Parent, Merger Sub or the Investor
have Knowledge of any breach of the Commitment Letters by any of the other
parties thereto, in each case in any respect that could reasonably be
expected to prevent, delay, impair or adversely affect the ability of Parent
to consummate the Closing. No event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both would or would reasonably be expected to (x)
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Investor or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other Person under any of
the Commitment Letters or (y) otherwise result in any portion of the
Financing not being available at or prior to Closing. As of the date of this
Agreement, all commitment and other fees required to be paid under the
Commitment Letters prior to the date hereof have been fully paid. As of the
date of this Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe (both before and after
giving effect to any "market flex" provisions contained in the Commitment
Letters): (i) that any of the conditions to the funding of the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letters will not be satisfied on a timely basis
and (ii) that the Financing will not be made available to Parent on or prior
to the Closing Date. Each of Parent and Merger Sub affirms that it is not a
condition to the Closing or to any of its other obligations under this
Agreement that Parent or Merger Sub obtains financing for or related to any
of the transactions contemplated hereby.

consummation of the Merger, other than, in each case, (1) the Required
Governmental Approvals and (2) the filing of the Articles of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Florida as provided in the FBCA and any
other filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by

operations or assets of Parent or its Affiliates which Parent has reason to
believe would be reasonably expected to cause any Required Governmental
Approval to be denied or unduly delayed.

  



  

Section 6.5 _No Litigation_. There is no Action by any Person pending or, to
Parent's Knowledge, threatened against Parent or its Affiliates (including
Merger Sub) and there are no unsatisfied or outstanding Government Orders
against Parent or any of the properties or business of Parent that would, in
each case, be reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

period three years prior to the date hereof (other than by reason of the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby), neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, including Merger Sub, nor, to the Knowledge of
Parent, an "interested shareholder" of the Company, as such term is defined
in Section 607.0901 of the FBCA, or was required to file a Schedule 13D or
Schedule 13G with respect to its ownership of securities of the Company
pursuant to the Exchange Act. Parent and Merger Sub have taken all the action
necessary to render inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the provisions of any state
anti-takeover Laws to the extent, if any, such Laws would otherwise be
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Merger Consideration, Company Equity Payments, the redemption or
conversion into Conversion Consideration (as defined in the Constituent
Documents of the Company) of the Preferred Shares and the payment of any
related fees and expenses, at and immediately after the Effective Time, will
be, Solvent, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into this
Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future
creditors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person.

(a) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Parent or Merger
Sub specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy

thereto is first mailed to the Company's shareholders or at the time of the

Section 7.3 _Acquisition Proposals_.

  



  

(a)  _No Solicitation or Negotiation_.

  



  

(i) The Company agrees that, except as permitted by this _Section 7.3_ ,
neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors
of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall instruct and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries' employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or
representatives (such directors, officers, employees, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives,
collectively, "Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly:

  



  

(A) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage any inquiries or the making of
any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Acquisition Proposal;

  



  

(B) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information or data to any
Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal; or

Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, prior to the
time, but not after, the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Company
may (A) provide non-public and other information in response to a request
therefor by a Person who has made an unsolicited _bona fide_ written
Acquisition Proposal if the Company receives from the Person so requesting
such information an executed confidentiality agreement on terms that, if
taken as a whole, are not materially less restrictive to the other party than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; _it being understood_ that
such confidentiality agreement need not contain a standstill provision or
otherwise prohibit the making, or amendment, of an Acquisition Proposal; and
promptly discloses (and, if applicable, provides copies of) any such
information to the Parent to the extent not previously provided to Parent, or
(B) engage or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding such an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal, if and
only to the extent that, (i) prior to taking any action described in clauses
(A) or (B) of this _Section 7.3(a)(ii)_ , the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that based on the information then available (x) such Acquisition
Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (y) a failure to take such
action, in light of the Acquisition Proposal and the terms of this
Agreement, would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  



  

(b)  _No Change of Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_.

  



  

(i) Except as permitted by _Section 7.3(b)(ii) _ and _Section 7.3(c)_ , the

resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to
Parent in any material respect, the Company Board Recommendation with respect
to the Merger, (2) fail to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation or fail
to publicly state that the Merger is in the best interests of the Company
Shareholders, within ten business days after Parent requests in writing that
such action be taken, (or if the Company Shareholders Meeting is scheduled to

requests), (3) fail to publicly announce, within ten business days after a
tender offer or exchange relating to the securities of the Company shall have
been commenced, an unqualified statement disclosing that the Company Board
recommends rejection of such tender offer or exchange offer, or (4) approve,

any Acquisition Proposal ( _it being understood_ that, if the Company Board
takes no position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal initiated through a
tender or exchange offer pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act until
the earlier of the close of business as of the day prior to the Company
Shareholders Meeting and the tenth business day after the commencement of
such Acquisition Proposal such failure to take a position shall not in and of
itself be considered adverse to Parent for purposes of this _Section
7.3(b)(i)(A)_ ) (any of the actions described above, a "Change
of Recommendation"); or

  



    

-40- 
--- 

 


---

9.3(a)_ , cause or permit the Company to enter into any acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or other similar definitive acquisition agreement (other
than a confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section 7.3(a)_ entered into
in compliance therewith) relating to any Acquisition Proposal (an
"Alternative Acquisition Agreement").

  



  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
prior to the time, but not after, the Company Shareholder Approval is
obtained, the Company Board may: (A) effect a Change of Recommendation if (1)
an unsolicited, _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal is received by
the Company and has not been withdrawn, (2) the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that based on the information then available (x) such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, and (y) a failure to effect a
Change of Recommendation in connection with such Acquisition Proposal would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, and (3) the Company Board intends to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_ in order to enter into
an Alternative Acquisition Agreement in relation to such Acquisition Proposal
(the actions described clause (A) of this _Section 7.3(b)(ii)_ , a "Qualifying
Change of Recommendation"); or (B) cause or permit the Company or any of the
Company's Subsidiaries to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (and the Company may enter into
or cause a Subsidiary thereof to enter into such an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement) or agree, authorize or commit to do so, but in each case only after
complying with (i) in the case of clause (A) above, any applicable
requirements in _Section 7.3(e)_ and (ii) in the case of clause (B) above, any
applicable requirements in _Section 9.3(a)_. Any material amendment to any
Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal

(c)  _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section 7.3_
shall be deemed to prohibit either the Company or Company Board from
complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state law with
regard to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such
disclosure has the effect of withdrawing or adversely modifying the
Company Board Recommendation, such disclosure shall be deemed to be a Change
of Recommendation.

  



  

(d)  _Existing Discussions and other Actions_. The Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and all of its and their respective Representatives
to, immediately (i) cease all solicitation, encouragement, discussions and
negotiations regarding any inquiry, proposal or offer pending on the date of
this Agreement that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to,
an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished to any Person in connection
with a possible Acquisition Proposal; and (iii) terminate access to any
physical or electronic data rooms relating to a possible Acquisition
Proposal.

  



  

(e)  _Notice; Matching Rights_. The Company agrees that it will promptly
(and, in any event, within 48 hours) notify Parent if any inquiries,
proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by it
or any of its Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the
name of such Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or
offers (including, if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals
or offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter shall keep
Parent informed, on a current basis, of the status and terms of any such
proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_ may be effected until the
provision thereof have been complied with by the Company, and no Qualifying
Change of Recommendation may be made until after the third business day
following receipt by Parent of written notice from the Company regarding the
Company Board's intention to make a Qualifying Change of Recommendation (a
"Notice of Change of Recommendation"), and specifying the reasons for the
Qualifying Change of Recommendation in reasonable detail and attaching to such
notice the most current version of such agreement shared between the proposed
parties thereto. At Parent's option, the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith during such three business day period to reach mutual agreement on
revisions to this Agreement so that the conditions set forth in _Section
7.3(b)(ii)(A)(2)_ would not be satisfied. In determining whether to make a
Change of Recommendation, or to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement, the Company Board shall take into account any revisions to the
terms of this Agreement and any other proposals or offers proposed in writing
by Parent during such three business day period following Parent's receipt of
a Notice of Change of Recommendation. For the avoidance of doubt, any material
amendment to a Superior Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition
Proposal for purposes of this _Section 7.3_ , including with respect to the
requirements in this _Section 7.3(e)_ and _Section 9.3(a)_.

  



  

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, any action taken by any Representative of the
Company that would, if taken directly by the Company, constitute a breach of
this _Section 7.3_ shall be deemed a breach of this _Section 7.3_ by the
Company.

the reasonable cooperation of the Company, and in the case of the Company,
the reasonable cooperation of Parent and Merger Sub, in each case in
accordance with this _Section 7.4(a)_ ) each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, submit (i)
the Continuing Membership Application of any Broker-Dealer Subsidiary and (ii)
the pre-merger notification with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement required under the HSR Act. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company shall use, and shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to use,

completion of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Party shall consult
with the other Parties in advance of any meeting or conference with any
Government Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and each Party shall, to the maximum extent possible, afford each
other Party and its Representatives the opportunity to participate in such
meetings and conferences.

7.4_ , each of the Parties shall promptly (i) furnish to the other such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other Party may request

any Person for or in connection with, and to reasonably assist Parent in
litigating or otherwise contesting any objections to or proceedings or other
actions challenging, the consummation of the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this _Section 7.4(c)_ shall obligate the Company to take any
action that is not (i) conditioned on the consummation of the Merger and (ii)
at the expense of Parent.

  



  

Section 7.5 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Change of
Recommendation made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Parent and
the Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other
the opportunity to review and comment in advance upon, any press release
or other public statements with respect to the Merger (including notices to
Clients), and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation, except as such party may reasonably
conclude may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or
national securities quotation system. Parent and the Company agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore
agreed to by the parties. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
except as permitted by a communications plan to be mutually agreed upon by the
Company and Parent promptly following the date of this Agreement, Parent
shall not make any written broad-based communication to the employees or
independent contractors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the
prior written consent of the Company.

  



  

Section 7.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Parent shall give prompt
notice to the Company and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent (in
such capacity, the "Notifying Party") of (i) any notice or other
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; or (ii) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event which
occurrence or failure to occur (x) would cause or be reasonably likely to
cause a Parent Material Adverse Effect or a Company Material Adverse Effect,
as applicable, or (y) which the Notifying Party believes would cause or would
be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of the
Notifying Party's representations, warranties or covenants contained herein
that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the
aggregate, to the failure of a condition set forth in, if Parent or Merger
Sub is the Notifying Party, Section 8.1 or Section 8.3, or if the Company is
the Notifying Party, Section 8.1 or Section 8.2; provided that any failure to
give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall
not be deemed to constitute a violation of this or the failure of any
condition set forth in Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 to be satisfied, or
otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give
such notice, in each case, unless the underlying breach would independently
result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 8.2 or Section 8.3
to be satisfied.

Section 7.7 _Access_. Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable notice, the
Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parent's officers
and other authorized Representatives of it and its Affiliates who are subject
to confidentiality obligations no less restrictive than the
confidentiality obligations set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement,
reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the period prior
to the Effective Time, to its and its Subsidiaries' employees, properties,
books, contracts and records and instruct the appropriate employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to cooperate reasonably with Parent and its
officers and other authorized Representatives in connection with the
foregoing (including for purposes of integration planning); and, during such
period, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish
promptly to Parent all information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as may reasonably be requested, provided that no investigation
pursuant to this Section 7.5 shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by the Company herein, and provided, further,
that the foregoing shall not require the Company (i) to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of
the Company would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third
parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if
the Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of
such third party to such inspection or disclosure or (ii) to disclose any
privileged information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall reasonably
cooperate and assist the Parent in its efforts to retain the Company's
Financial Advisors following the Closing, including to (a) coordinate in-
person meetings with key Financial Advisors (except as would
unreasonably interfere with the business of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) and (b) provide Parent with reasonably prompt notice
upon becoming aware that any Financial Advisor with 12 month trailing gross
dealer concessions equal to or greater than $300,000, or any member of senior
management of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, resigns from his or her
employment or terminates his or her relationship (or clearly indicates to a
member of management of the Company an intention to resign or terminate its
relationship), as the case may be, with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. All requests for information made pursuant to this Section
7.7 shall be directed to the executive officer or other Person designated by
the Company. All such information shall be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.8 _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and, upon Parent's request therefor, use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NYSE, including
filing post-effective amendments to deregister unsold Registered Debt
Securities, and Preferred Shares, from Securities Act registration statements,
to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the Registered Debt
Securities, Shares and Preferred Shares, from the NYSE and the
deregistration of the Registered Debt Securities, Shares, and Preferred
Shares, in each case, as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
and in any event no more than ten days after the Closing Date. The Surviving
Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Shares to no
longer be quoted on the NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act as soon
as practicable following the Effective Time.

Section 7.9 _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending one year after the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall
cause to be provided to each Continuing Employee for so long as such
Continuing Employee remains an employee of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation (or a Subsidiary thereof) during such period compensation (base
salary, base wage rate, commission schedule, target annual and long-term
incentive opportunities), severance benefits and retirement and employee
welfare benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Affiliates. Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing
Employee any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any affiliate of Parent.

  



  

(b) Parent shall (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and
eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of Parent or its
Affiliates to be waived with respect to the Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents, (ii) give each Continuing Employee credit for the plan
year in which the Effective Time occurs towards applicable deductibles and
annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses incurred prior to the
Effective Time for which payment has been made and (iii) give each
Continuing Employee service credit for such Continuing Employee's employment
with the Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of vesting, benefit
accrual and eligibility to participate under each applicable Parent benefit
plan, as if such service had been performed with Parent, except for purposes
of qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits or to the extent it
would result in a duplication of benefits.

  



  

(c) No later than immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all reasonable and necessary steps so as to terminate (with such
termination effective subject to and contingent upon the Effective Time) (i)
any Benefit Plan sponsored by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries which is
a defined contribution plan intended to be qualified under Code Section 401(a)
(the "Company 401(k) Plans") and (ii) those other Benefit Plans identified by
Parent or one of its Affiliates in writing no later than 20 business days
prior to the Effective Time, in each case, with such termination to be
implemented in accordance with the terms of each such Benefit Plan, and in
the case of the Company 401(k) Plans, with the Company taking all actions
reasonably necessary to cause each participant therein to become 100% vested
in his or her account balance, to the extent required by applicable Law.

  



  

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all actions necessary and appropriate so as to directly
transfer to a 401(k) plan maintained or established by Parent or one of its
Affiliates (the "Parent 401(k) Plan"), those assets and liabilities of each
Company 401(k) Plan, including all outstanding loans to participants
under such plans and employer contributions through the Effective Time. The
Parties shall take all reasonable and necessary steps so as to cooperate and
effectuate the provisions of this _Section 7.9(c)(i)_ , including to conform
such transfer with Section 414(l) of the Code, and, giving effect to the
service credit provisions of _Section 7.9(b)_ , to ensure that each
Continuing Employee is eligible to participate in the Parent 401(k) Plan as
soon as administratively practical after the Effective Time.

(ii) The actions required under this _Section 7.9(c)_ shall include, for the
avoidance of doubt, the termination of any and all sick, vacation, personal
days, floating days, voluntary paid time off and other paid time off policies,
programs and plans (collectively, the "PTO Plans"), as provided for in this
_Section 7.9(c)(ii)_. No later than immediately prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall take all reasonable and necessary actions so as to freeze
the accrual of any additional paid time off under the PTO Plans effective as
of December 31, 2019, and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, shall
pay out any accrued but unused benefits under such PTO Plans through such
date to participants of such plans no later than the normally scheduled
payroll immediately prior to the Effective Time. From January 1, 2020 through
the Effective Time (the "Transition Period"), Continuing Employees shall
continue to accrue (and use) any and all paid time off under the PTO Plans.
Following the Effective Time, Continuing Employees shall accrue paid time off
under the policies of the Parent and its Affiliates and Parent shall, or
shall cause its Affiliates to, provide Continuing Employees to be credited
with paid time off for the Transition Period under the corresponding policies
of Parent and its Affiliates.

  



  

(iii) The Company shall pay out all 2019 annual bonuses prior to the
Effective Time, consistent with past practice.

  



  

(iv) Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent and its Affiliates shall take
all actions necessary and appropriate so as to facilitate the coverage of any
participants and beneficiaries under any Benefit Plan that is a short term
disability plan, long term disability plan or providing COBRA continuation
coverage to Parent's corresponding plans so as to provide for uninterrupted
coverage to such individuals.

  



  

(d) Parent hereby acknowledges that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall constitute a "change in control," "change of control" or term
or concept of similar import of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the
terms of the Benefit Plans. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor all obligations and
rights under the Benefit Plans which are not terminated pursuant to _Section
7.9(c)_ in accordance with their terms,  _provided_ that, nothing in this
Agreement shall require Parent or any of its Affiliates to continue the
Benefit Plans indefinitely or for any period of time following the Effective
Time.

  



  

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement, including this _Section 7.9_ , is
intended to (i) be treated as an amendment of any Benefit Plan, (ii) prevent
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates from amending or
terminating any Benefit Plan or any of their benefit plans, (iii) prevent
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates, after
the Effective Time, from terminating the employment of any Continuing
Employee or independent contractor at any time, or (iv) create any third-
party beneficiary rights in any employee or independent contractor of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or
any collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect to the
compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be
provided to any Continuing Employee by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their Affiliates or under any benefit plan which Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates may maintain.

  



  

Section 7.10 _Treatment of Company Preferred Stock_. Following the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to comply with its
obligations under the Constituent Documents of the Surviving Corporation with
respect to the Preferred Shares.

Section 7.11 _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_.

  



  

(a) Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent agrees that all rights,
existing as of the date hereof, to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time in favor of the current or former directors, officers
or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in their
respective Constituent Documents or in any indemnification, employment or
other similar agreements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in
each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms. From and after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless
each individual who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior
to the Effective Time, a director, officer or employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who
thereafter commences prior to the Effective Time, serving at the request of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer or employee of
another Person (all of the foregoing, collectively, the "Company Indemnified
Parties"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses,
including attorneys' fees and disbursements ("Losses"), incurred or arising
in connection with any claim, action, investigation, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, regulatory, administrative or investigative
(including with respect to matters existing or occurring or alleged to have
existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including this
Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby)), arising
out of or pertaining to the fact that the Company Indemnified Party is or was
a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as
a director, officer or employee of another Person or any act or omission by
such Company Indemnified Party while serving in such capacity, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law. In the event of any such claim,
action, investigation, suit or proceeding (x) each Company Indemnified Party
will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any
such claim, action, investigation, suit or proceeding, from the Surviving
Corporation and Parent within ten business days of receipt by the Surviving
Corporation from the Company Indemnified Party of a request therefor;
_provided _ that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the FBCA, to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification and (y) the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall cooperate
in the defense of any such matter. Any Company Indemnified Party wishing to
claim indemnification under this _Section 7.11_ , upon learning of any
threatened or actual claim, Action, suit, demand, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify the Company and, if so learning after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation thereof in writing;  _provided_
that the failure promptly to so notify in writing shall not affect the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation except to the extent, if any, that
it is materially prejudiced by such failure or delay.

(b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (i) cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries or (ii)
provide substitute polices for the Company and its current and former
directors and officers (and any individual who becomes an officer or director
prior to the Effective Time) who are currently (or prior to the Effective
Time become) covered by the directors' and officers' and fiduciary liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company in either case, of not
less than the amount of existing coverage and have other terms and from
carriers not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors' and
officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts
or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, except that in no
event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to such
insurance policies in respect of any one policy year more than 300% of the
annual premium payable by the Company for such insurance for the year ended
December 31, 2018 (such 300% amount, the "Maximum Amount"), and if the
Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by this
_Section 7.11_ it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for
the years within such six-year period for an annual premium equal to the
Maximum Amount, in respect of each policy year within such period. In lieu of
such insurance, prior to the Closing Date, Parent may direct that the Company,
in which case the Company shall, purchase a "tail" directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy and fiduciary liability insurance policy for the
Company and its current and former directors and officers (and any individual
who becomes an officer or director prior to the Effective Time) who are
currently (or prior to the Effective Time become) covered by the directors'
and officers' and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained
by the Company. In the event the Company purchases such tail coverage, the
Surviving Corporation shall cease to have any obligations under the first
sentence of this _Section 7.11(b)_.

  



  

(c) The provisions of this _Section 7.11_ : (i) shall survive consummation of
the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Company
Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and (iii) are in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. In the event that Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (x)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or
Surviving Corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (y)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, the Surviving Corporation shall
cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.11_.

  



  

Section 7.12 _Section 16 Matters_. The Company and the Company Board (or duly
formed committees thereof consisting of non-employee directors (as such term
is defined for the purposes of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act)), shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all such actions as may be
necessary or advisable to cause the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company
(including derivative securities) in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by any individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

  



  

Section 7.13 _Approval of the Sole Shareholder of Merger Sub_. Immediately
following the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall execute and deliver,
in accordance with the FBCA and in its capacity as the sole shareholder of
Merger Sub, a written consent approving this Agreement and the Merger and
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall promptly provide
a true, correct and complete copy thereof to the Company.

Section 7.14 _Fund Client Consents_.

  



  

(a)  _Public Funds_. Subject in each case to the requirements of applicable
Law and the fiduciary duties of the Company Board, the board of directors (or
Persons performing similar functions) of any Subsidiary of the Company and
each Public Fund Board:

  



  

(i) with respect to each Public Fund and the Public Fund Board thereof, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts to: (A) request, as promptly
as practicable following the date of this Agreement, such Public Fund Board
to approve (and to recommend that the shareholders of such Public Fund
approve) a new Advisory Contract with the applicable Subsidiary of the
Company, to be effective as of the Effective Time, containing terms, taken as
a whole, that are substantially similar to the terms of the existing Advisory
Contract between such Public Fund and such Subsidiary of the Company; (B)
request, as promptly as practicable following receipt of the approval and
recommendation described in the foregoing clause (A), such Public Fund Board
to call a special meeting of the shareholders of such Public Fund to be held
as promptly as reasonably practicable for the purpose of voting upon a
proposal to approve (in the requisite manner) such new Advisory Contract; (C)
to prepare and to file (or to cause to be prepared and filed) with the SEC and
all other applicable Government Authorities, as promptly as practicable
following receipt of the approval and recommendation described in the
foregoing clause (A), all proxy solicitation materials required to be
distributed to the shareholders of such Public Fund with respect to the
actions recommended for shareholder approval by such Public Fund Board and to
mail (or to cause to be mailed) such proxy solicitation materials as promptly
as practical after clearance thereof by the SEC (if applicable); and (D) to
submit (or to request such Public Fund Board to submit), as promptly as
practical following the mailing of the proxy materials to the shareholders
of such Public Fund for a vote at a shareholders meeting the proposal
described in clause (B) above.

  



  

(ii) Parent and the Company agree that a Public Fund shall be deemed to have
consented for all purposes under this Agreement to the continued management
of such Public Fund by the applicable Subsidiary of the Company following the
Effective Time, if a new Advisory Contract has been approved by the Public
Fund Board and shareholders of such Public Fund in the manner contemplated by
clauses (A)-(D) of _Section 7.14(a)(i)_ , unless at any time prior to the
Closing the respective Public Fund Board notifies the applicable Subsidiary
of the Company, in writing, that such Public Fund has terminated its existing,
interim, or new Advisory Contract prior to or following the Effective Time.

(b)  _Private Funds and Other Non-Fund Clients_.

  



  

(i) If consent or other action is required by applicable Law or by the
Advisory Contract of any Client other than a Public Fund for the Advisory
Contract with such Client to continue after the Effective Time, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, and in any event
no less than 30 days before the Parties' anticipated Closing Date, the
Company shall, and shall cause the applicable Company Subsidiaries to, send a
notice ("Transaction Notice") complying with applicable Law and the terms of
such Client's Advisory Contract and requesting such Client's written
consent for the Advisory Contract with such Client to continue after the
Effective Time. Each Transaction Notice shall inform the applicable Client:
(1) of the intention to complete the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, which may result in a deemed assignment of such Client's Advisory
Contract; (2) of the applicable Company Subsidiary's intention to continue to
provide the advisory services pursuant to the existing Advisory Contract with
such Client after the Effective Time if such Client does not terminate such
agreement prior to the Effective Time; and (3) that the consent of such Client
will be deemed to have been granted if such Client continues to accept such
advisory services for a period of at least 30 days after the sending of the
Transaction Notice without termination.

  



  

(ii) Parent and the Company agree that any consent required for any Advisory
Contract with a Client (other than a Public Fund) to continue after the
Effective Time shall be deemed given for all purposes under this Agreement (A)
upon receipt of a written consent requested in the Transaction Notice prior
to the Effective Time or (B) if no such written consent is received, if 30
days shall have passed since the sending of the Transaction Notice to such
Client; _provided_ that no consent shall be deemed to have been given for any
purpose under this Agreement if at any time prior to the Effective Time such
Client notifies the Company in writing that such Client has not so consented
or has terminated its Advisory Contract.

  



  

(iii) The Company agrees that the information that is contained in any
Transaction Notice to be furnished to any Client other than a Public Fund
(and other than information that is or will be provided in writing by or on
behalf of Parent or its Affiliates specifically for inclusion in such
Transaction Notice) to the extent consent or other action is required under
applicable Law or the applicable Advisory Contract for the purpose of having
the Advisory Contract continue after the Effective Time will be true, correct
and complete in all material respects. Parent agrees that the information
provided by it or its Affiliates (or on their behalves) in writing for
inclusion in any Transaction Notice to be furnished to any Client other than a
Public Fund to the extent consent or other action is required under
applicable Law or the applicable Advisory Contract for the purpose of having
the Advisory Contract continue after the Effective Time will be true, correct
and complete in all material respects.

  



  

(c)  _Prospective Clients_. In addition to the foregoing, as promptly as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall cause
each of the Company Subsidiaries to use its reasonable best efforts, (i) to
supplement the offering documentation with respect to each Public Fund to
inform prospective investors therein of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and (ii) with respect to any new Clients following the date of
this Agreement, to include a Transaction Notice along with the
Advisory Contract and other materials provided to such new Clients.

Section 7.15 _Financing_.

  



  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its respective reasonable best
efforts (taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, obtain and consummate the
Financing on the terms and conditions not materially less favorable to Parent
and Merger Sub than the terms and conditions described in the Commitment
Letters (including, as necessary, the "market flex" provisions contained in
any related fee letter), including reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in
full force and effect the Commitment Letters, (ii) satisfy (or obtain a
waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent in obtaining
the Debt Financing (including by consummating the Equity Financing at or
prior to the Closing), (iii) enter into definitive agreements (which, with
respect to any bridge facility documentation, shall not be required until
reasonably necessary in connection with the funding of the Debt Financing)
with respect to the Debt Financing on terms and conditions not materially less
favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than the terms and conditions described in
or contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including any "market flex"
provisions in the Debt Commitment Letter), and (iv) upon satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in  _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature will not be satisfied until the
Closing), consummate the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing at or prior
to the Closing and enforce its rights under the Commitment Letters. Parent
and Merger Sub shall obtain the Equity Financing contemplated by the Equity
Letter at or prior to the Closing Date upon satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions to Closing in _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature will not be satisfied until the Closing).

  



  

(b) Without the prior written consent of the Company, Parent shall not agree
to: (A) any amendment, restatement, replacement, supplement, termination,
repudiation, rescission, cancellation, expiration or other modification or
waiver of, any condition, remedy or other provision under any Commitment
Letter if such amendment, restatement, replacement, supplement, termination,
repudiation, rescission, cancellation, expiration, modification or waiver
would reasonably be expected to (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the
Financing from that contemplated by the Commitment Letters delivered as of the
date hereof to fund the Required Amount (taking into account cash on hand and
other readily available sources of cash), (ii) impose new or additional
conditions or expand any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing or
otherwise make it less likely that the Financing would be funded at
Closing (including by making satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing
less likely to occur), (iii) prevent, impair, adversely affect or delay
(other than in an immaterial manner) the funding of the Financing at Closing
or (iv) adversely affect the ability of Parent or the Company, as applicable,
to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Commitment Letters
or (B) terminate, or permit the termination of, any Commitment Letter unless
such Commitment Letter is, prior to or substantially concurrently with such
termination, replaced with a new commitment that, were it structured as an
amendment to such existing Commitment Letter, would satisfy the requirements
of the foregoing clause (A). For the avoidance of doubt, Parent may
customarily modify, amend or supplement the Debt Commitment Letter to add (or
assign or reassign commitments and roles to) lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents, documentation agents or entities
in similar roles. Upon any amendment, modification or supplement of, or
waiver of, any Commitment Letter in accordance with this _Section 7.15(b)_ ,
Parent shall promptly deliver a copy thereof to the Company and references
herein to "Commitment Letter", "Equity Letter" or "Debt Commitment Letter",
as applicable, shall include and mean such documents as amended, modified,
supplemented or waived in compliance with this _Section 7.15(b)_ , and
references to "Financing", "Equity Financing" or "Debt Financing", as
applicable, shall include and mean the financing contemplated by such
Commitment Letter as amended, modified, supplemented or waived in compliance
with this _Section 7.15(b)_ , as applicable.

(c) In the event all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable
or Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware of any event or circumstance that would
reasonably be expected to make any portion of the Debt Financing unavailable,
on the terms and conditions (including any "market flex" provisions
applicable thereto) described in or contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters for any reason, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best
efforts to arrange for and obtain alternative financing from alternative
sources (the "Alternative Financing") (it being understood and agreed that no
provision hereof shall require the Parent to draw upon Parent's existing
revolving credit facility under any circumstances) in an amount sufficient to
fund the Required Amount (taking into account the Equity Financing, any
available portion of the Debt Financing, cash on hand and other readily
available sources of cash) which would not involve any conditions precedent
that are materially less favorable to Parent than those contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter and would not reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Debt Financing
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The obligations under
this _Section 7.15_ shall apply equally to any such Alternative Financing
(including any new financing commitment).

  



  

(d) Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonable basis and in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing upon
the Company's written request (including providing the Company with copies of
all material definitive agreements related to the Financing). Parent shall
give the Company prompt written notice (i) of any actual breach or default by
any party to the Commitment Letters (or commitments for any Alternative
Financing obtained in accordance with this _Section 7.15_ ) or definitive
documents relating to the Financing of which Parent becomes aware that would
reasonably be expected to delay (other than in an immaterial manner) or
impair the Closing or make funding less likely to occur at the Effective Time
or any termination of the Commitment Letters (or commitments for any
Alternative Financing obtained in accordance with this _Section 7.15_ ), (ii)
the receipt by any of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates
or Representatives of any written notice or other written communication from
any Debt Financing Source, any lender or any other Person with respect to
any (A) actual breach, default or termination by any party to any Commitment
Letter or (B) dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any
Commitment Letter, solely to the extent such dispute or disagreement relates
to the obligation of the parties thereto to fund their commitments thereunder
or the availability of the Financing or (iii) any other circumstance that
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the ability of Parent to
obtain, prior to Closing, all or any portion of the Financing on the terms
and conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letters or the definitive
documents related to the Financing.

  



  

(e) Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledges and agrees that
obtaining the Financing is not a condition to the Closing.

any information the disclosure of which is prohibited or restricted under any
Laws. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries'

(b) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor its and their respective
officers, directors, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel,

suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and the performance of
their respective obligations in respect of the Debt Financing, and any
information utilized in connection therewith, except to the extent such
liabilities or losses arise solely from misstatements contained
in information in respect of the Company and its Subsidiaries supplied by the
Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives or to the extent
any liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties are caused by the gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives and other than with respect to the preparation of
audited and other historical financial statements and
customary representation and authorization letters (including with respect to
the presence or absence of material non-public information and the accuracy

(i) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ or _Section

reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented attorneys' fees) in connection with such
Action; (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, in the event that the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Expense
Reimbursement becomes payable by, and is paid or caused to be paid by, the
Company, such fee shall be Parent's sole and exclusive remedy for
monetary damages pursuant to this Agreement with respect to termination of
this Agreement under the provisions of this Agreement giving rise to the

Reimbursement pursuant to _Section 9.5(c)(iii)_ , it shall retain all rights
to further payment under _Section 9.5(c)(i)_ (subject to clause (iv) below);
_provided_ , _further_ , that any such payment shall not relieve the Company
of any liability or damages incurred or suffered by Parent or Merger Sub to
the extent such liability or damages were the result of or arise out of any
fraud or Willful Breach of any provision of this Agreement (including with
respect to breaches of this Agreement pursuant to which the Company
Termination Fee shall have become or becomes payable pursuant to this
_Article IX_ ), in which case Parent and/or Merger Sub shall be entitled to
all rights and remedies available in equity or at law, in contract, in tort

Termination Fee required by _Section 9.5_ ; and (v) notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company shall have the right
to recover damages (which shall be determined by reference to the total amount

Willful Breach of any provision of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub,
which right is hereby acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub.

  



  

(f) The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall Parent be

then, in such instances, the Company's right to receive the Reverse

losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Company or any of its Affiliates

Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

agents in connection with or arising out of the Debt Financing, this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder, whether in law or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise; and

  



  

(ii) the Company shall not be entitled to specific performance under this
Agreement if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.2(a)
following the occurrence of a Financing Failure and either (i) the Reverse

Reverse Termination Fee is not required to be paid due to the occurrence of a
Company Causation Exception pursuant to Section 9.5(d).

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH,

(b) Each of the Parties irrevocably (i) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the Federal or State courts of the State of New York for the purpose of
any action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Confidentiality
Agreement, and each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that all claims in

claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise) against any of the Debt Financing Sources or any of their
respective representatives, Affiliates or any of their respective managers,
directors, officers, employees, partners, members, equityholders, attorneys,
advisors, representatives or agents in any way relating to the Debt Financing
or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, shall

(c) Each of the Parties irrevocably consents to the service of any summons

the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective
addresses set forth in _Section 10.2_ shall be effective service of process
for any suit or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each Party hereby irrevocably waives, and
agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or
otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, any
claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named
courts for any reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance
with this _Section 10.8_ , that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise), and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, that the
suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, that the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper, or that
this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof or thereof, may not be enforced
in or by such courts and further irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, the benefit of any defense that would hinder,
fetter or delay the levy, execution or collection of any amount to which the
Party is entitled pursuant to the final judgment of any court having
jurisdiction. Each Party expressly acknowledges that the foregoing waiver is
intended to be irrevocable under the Laws of the State of New York and of the
United States of America; _provided _ that each such party's consent to
jurisdiction and service contained in this _Section 10.8_ is solely for the
purpose referred to in this _Section 10.8_ and shall not be deemed to be a
general submission to said courts or in the State of New York other than for
such purpose.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 10.8_ to the contrary, each of
the Parties agrees that (i) it will not bring or support (and it will not
support any of its Affiliates to bring or support) any suit (whether at law,
in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against or involving any Debt
Financing Source, any of their respective representatives and Affiliates
or any of the respective managers, officers, directors, employees, partners,
members, equityholders, attorneys, advisors, agents and representatives of
the foregoing, and their respective successors and permitted assigns in any
way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including any related Financing), including any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt
Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other than any New York
State court or federal court sitting in the County of New York and the Borough
of Manhattan (and appellate courts thereof).

COMPANY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND

hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such
invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement
and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall
not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such

amended if, and only if, such amendment is in writing and signed by and on
behalf of each Party. Any provision of this Agreement may be waived if such

such waiver is to be enforced; _provided_ that _Section 9.5(f)_ ,
_Section 10.4_ , _Section 10.7_ , _Section 10.8_ , _Section 10.9_ and this
proviso (and the defined terms used therein to the extent applicable thereto)
