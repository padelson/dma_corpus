  Exhibit B: Form of Voting Agreement 
 



iii  THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of April 28, 2011 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is among Valley National Bancorp, a New Jersey corporation and
registered bank holding company (" _Valley_ ") and State Bancorp, Inc., a New
York corporation and registered bank holding company (" _State Bancorp_ ").

RECITALS

 

Valley desires to acquire State Bancorp, and State Bancorps Board of
Directors has determined, based upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set
forth, that the acquisition is in the best interests of State Bancorp and its
shareholders. The acquisition will be accomplished by merging State Bancorp
into Valley with Valley as the surviving corporation and, at the same
time, merging State Bank of Long Island, a New York state-chartered
commercial bank (" _SBLI_ ") and wholly-owned subsidiary of State Bancorp into
Valley National Bank, a national banking association (" _VNB_ ") and wholly-
owned subsidiary of Valley, with VNB as the surviving bank, and State Bancorp
shareholders receiving the consideration hereinafter set forth.

NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

 

1.1. The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time (as hereafter defined), State Bancorp shall be merged with and
into Valley (the " _Merger_ ") in accordance with the New Jersey Business
Corporation Act (the " _NJBCA_ ") and the New York Business Corporation Law
(the " _NYBCL_ ") and Valley shall be the surviving corporation (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ "). Immediately following the Effective Time, SBLI
shall be merged with and into VNB as provided in Section 1.7 hereof.

1.2. Effect of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects as set forth in
the NJBCA and the NYBCL. 

1.3. Certificate of Incorporation. The certificate of incorporation of Valley
as it exists immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not be amended by
the Merger, but shall continue as the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until otherwise amended as provided by law.

 

1.4. Bylaws. The bylaws of Valley as they exist immediately prior to the
Effective Date shall continue as the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until otherwise amended as provided by law.

1.5. Directors and Officers. The directors and officers of Valley as of the
Effective Time shall continue as the directors and officers of the Surviving
Corporation, subject to the provisions of Section 5.15(g). 1.6. Closing Date, Closing and Effective Time. Unless a different date, time
and/or place are agreed to by the parties hereto, the closing of the Merger
(the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m., at the offices of Valley,
1455 Valley Road, Wayne, New Jersey 07470, on a date (the " _Closing Date_ ")
which is five (5) business days following the last to occur of the receipt of
all necessary regulatory and governmental approvals and consents and the
expiration of all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof and
the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to the consummation of
the Merger specified in Article VI hereof (other than the delivery of
certificates, opinions and other instruments and documents to be delivered at
the Closing), with the exact date determined by the mutual agreement of
Valley and State Bancorp. Simultaneous with the Closing, Valley and State
Bancorp shall cause to be filed a certificate of merger, in form and substance
satisfactory to Valley and State Bancorp, with the Department of Treasury of
the State of New Jersey and the New York Secretary of State (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ "). The Certificate of Merger shall specify as the "
_Effective Time_ " of the Merger a date and time following the Closing agreed
to by Valley and State Bancorp (which date and time the parties currently
anticipate will be the close of business on the Closing Date).

1.7. The Bank Merger. Immediately following the Effective Time, SBLI shall be
merged with and into VNB (the " _Bank Merger_ ") in accordance with the
provisions of the National Bank Act and, to the extent applicable, New York
Banking Law (the " _Banking Law_ ") and the regulations of the New York State
Banking Department (the " _Department_ "), and VNB shall be the surviving
bank (the " _Surviving Bank_ "). The Bank Merger shall have the effects as
set forth in the National Bank Act and the New York Banking Law. State Bancorp
and Valley shall cause the Boards of Directors of SBLI and VNB, respectively
to approve a separate merger agreement (the " _Bank Merger Agreement_ ") in
substantially the form of Exhibit A, annexed hereto, and cause the Bank Merger
Agreement to be executed and delivered as soon as practicable following
the date of execution of this Agreement.

ARTICLE II

 

CONVERSION OF STATE BANCORP COMMON STOCK, OPTIONS AND WARRANTS

 

2.1. Conversion of State Bancorp Common Stock; Exchange Ratio; Cash in Lieu of
Fractional Shares. (a) At the Effective Time, subject to the other provisions
of this Section 2.1 and Section 2.2, each share of common stock, $0.01 par
value per share, of State Bancorp (" _State Bancorp Common Stock_ ") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded
Shares (as such term is hereinafter defined)), shall by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of State Bancorp, Valley or the holder
thereof, cease to be outstanding and shall be converted into and become the
right to receive 1.00 share (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") after giving effect to
the five (5) percent stock dividend declared by Valley on April 13, 2011 (the
" _Valley Stock Dividend_ ") of no par value common stock of Valley ("
_Valley Common Stock_ "). No fractional shares of Valley Common Stock will be
issued, and in lieu thereof, each holder of State Bancorp Common Stock who
would otherwise be entitled to a fractional interest will receive an amount
in cash determined by multiplying such fractional interest by the Average
Closing Price as defined below. For purposes of this Section 2.1, the
following terms shall have the following meanings:

 



2 (i) " _Closing Price_ " shall mean the closing sale price of Valley Common
Stock on a Trading Day as supplied by the New York Stock Exchange (as reported
in _The Wall Street Journal_ or, if not reported thereby, another mutually
agreed to authoritative source).

 

(ii) " _Trading Day_ " shall mean a day for which a Closing Price is so
supplied.

 

(iii) " _Average Closing Price_ " shall mean the average of the Closing Prices
on the ten (10) Trading Days immediately preceding the date which is five (5)
Trading Days prior to the Closing Date.

(b) At the Effective Time, all shares of State Bancorp Common Stock and all
shares of Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, stated
liquidation amount $1,000 per share, of State Bancorp (the " _State Bancorp
Series A Preferred Stock_") held by State Bancorp in its treasury or owned
by Valley or by any of Valleys Subsidiaries (other than shares held as
trustee or in a fiduciary capacity and shares held as collateral on or in lieu
of a debt previously contracted) (" _Excluded Shares_ ") shall be canceled
and shall cease to exist and no shares of Valley Common Stock shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(c) On and after the Effective Time, holders of certificates which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of State Bancorp
Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") shall cease to have any rights as
shareholders of State Bancorp, except the right to receive the consideration
set forth in this Section 2.1 for each such share held by them. The Valley
Common Stock which any one State Bancorp shareholder may receive pursuant to
this Section 2.1 is referred to herein as the " _Merger Consideration_ " and
total number of Valley Common Stock plus any cash in lieu of fractional
shares which all of State Bancorp shareholders are entitled to receive
pursuant to this Section 2.1 is referred to herein as the " _Aggregate Merger
Consideration_ ".

 

(d) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if, during the
period from the date hereof to the Effective Time, the shares of Valley
Common Stock shall be changed into a different number or class of shares by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares or readjustment, or a stock dividend thereon shall be
declared with a record date within said period (other than the Valley Stock
Dividend), appropriate adjustments shall be made to the Exchange Ratio, if
necessary, to provide the State Bancorp shareholders with the equivalent value
of the Merger Consideration set forth in Section 2.1.

2.2. Treatment of State Bancorp Preferred Stock and Conversion of State
Bancorp Warrant. 

(a) As soon as possible following (i) the receipt of State Bancorp Shareholder
Approval and the relevant approval of such transaction by Governmental
Entities under applicable laws, and (ii) the agreement by State Bancorp that
all conditions to the Closing have been satisfied or waived (other than the
delivery of opinions, certificates and other documents on the Closing Date as
provided for herein), and in any event not later than five (5)

 



3  business days prior to the Closing Date, Valley will fund the purchase by
either Valley or State Bancorp from the United States Department of the
Treasury (" _Treasury_ ") of each share of the State Bancorp Series A
Preferred Stock issued and outstanding on such date (such purchase, the "
_TARP Purchase_ "). Valley may, but shall not be required to, fund the
purchase by Valley or State Bancorp of the warrant issued on December 5, 2008
to Treasury in connection with the issuance of the State Bancorp Series A
Preferred Stock (the " _State Bancorp Warrant_ "). The method of funding the
TARP Purchase shall be mutually agreed to by Valley and State Bancorp subject
to any formal or informal Treasury requirements.

(b) If Valley does not purchase the State Bancorp Warrant prior to the
Effective Time, then the State Bancorp Warrant shall, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent a
warrant to purchase State Bancorp Common Stock and will be converted
automatically into a warrant to purchase Valley Common Stock (the " _Valley
Warrant_ "), with such adjustments to the number of Valley shares into which
the warrant is convertible and the exercise price in accordance with the
terms of the State Bancorp Warrant, and Valley will assume such warrant
subject to its terms.

2.3. Exchange of Shares. (a) State Bancorp and Valley hereby appoint American
Stock Transfer and Trust Company as the exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_
") for purposes of effecting the conversion of State Bancorp Common Stock.
Not later than five (5) business days after the Effective Time, Valley shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record as of the Effective
Time (a " _Record Holder_ ") a Certificate or Certificates, a letter
of transmittal in form mutually agreed upon by Valley and State Bancorp
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent), and instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for the Valley Common Stock (and cash in lieu
of fractional shares) as provided in Section 2.1 hereof.

 

(b) Upon surrender of Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
executed, the Record Holder shall be entitled to promptly receive in exchange
for such Certificates (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) a check in the
amount equal to the cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, which such
Record Holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof.
Certificates so surrendered shall be canceled. As soon as practicable, but no
later than ten (10) business days following receipt of the properly completed
letter of transmittal and any necessary accompanying documentation, Valley
shall cause the Exchange Agent to distribute the Merger Consideration and cash
as provided herein. The Exchange Agent shall not be obligated to deliver or
cause to be delivered to any Record Holder the consideration to which such
Record Holder would otherwise be entitled until such Record Holder surrenders
the Certificates for exchange or, in default thereof, an appropriate Affidavit
of Loss and Indemnity Agreement and/or bond as may be reasonably required in
each case by Valley. Notwithstanding the time of surrender of the
Certificates, Record Holders shall be deemed shareholders of Valley for all
purposes from the Effective Time, except that Valley shall withhold the
payment of dividends from any Record Holder until such Record Holder effects
the exchange of Certificates for Valley Common Stock. Such Record Holder shall
receive such withheld dividends, without interest, upon effecting the share
exchange. 

 



4 (c) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of State Bancorp of the shares of State Bancorp Common Stock
which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and, if any
Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer, they shall
be canceled and exchanged for the consideration as provided in Section 2.1
hereof.

(d) If payment of the consideration pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof is to be
made in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such payment that
the Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by
an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for
transfer, and that the person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason of
the payment to a person other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish
to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is
not payable.

 

(e) Valley and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon State
Bancorps stock transfer books to establish the identity of those persons
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, which books shall be conclusive
with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of
stock represented by any Certificate, Valley and the Exchange Agent shall
be entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration or dividends or distributions
thereon represented thereby in escrow with an independent third party and
thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto.

 

2.4. Treatment of State Bancorp Stock Options. (a) All options which may be
exercised for issuance of State Bancorp Common Stock (each, a " _State
Bancorp Stock Option_ " and collectively the " _State Bancorp Stock Options_
") are described in the _State Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ and are issued and
outstanding pursuant to the State Bancorp stock option plans described in the
_State Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ (collectively, the " _State Bancorp Stock
Option Plans_ ") and the forms of agreements pursuant to which such State
Bancorp Stock Options were granted (each, an " _Option Grant Agreement_ ").
True and complete copies of all outstanding grant agreements for State Bancorp
Stock Options issued under State Bancorps Stock Option Plans will be
delivered to Valley promptly after execution of this Agreement.

(b) At the Effective Time, Valley shall assume and adopt each of the State
Bancorp Stock Option Plans and all of the rights, powers, discretions,
obligations and duties of State Bancorp thereunder, and each outstanding State
Bancorp Stock Option granted to an eligible individual (an " _Optionee_ ")
under any State Bancorp Stock Option Plan shall be converted into an option to
purchase Valley Common Stock (a " _Valley Stock Option_ "), wherein (x) the
number of shares of Valley Common Stock subject to the Valley Stock Option
shall be equal to the number of shares of State Bancorp Common Stock subject
to the State Bancorp Stock Option multiplied by the Exchange Ratio and (y) the
option exercise price per share of Valley Common Stock subject to the Valley
Stock Option shall be equal to the option exercise price per share of State
Bancorp Common Stock subject to the State Bancorp Stock Option that is being
converted divided by the Exchange Ratio and (z) in all other respects the
option shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable State
Bancorp Stock Option Plan and any stock option agreement or other grant
instrument evidencing such State Bancorp Stock Option as 

 



5  in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and for any options which
are "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), the adjustments shall be
and are intended to be effected in a manner which is consistent with Section
424(a) of the Code. Shares of Valley Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
Stock Options shall be covered by an effective registration statement on Form
S-8 (or, or the extent that Form S-8 is not available for such purpose, an
effective registration statement Form S-3 on another available form), and
Valley shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or other available
form) covering such shares as soon as practicable, and in any event within
five (5) business days, after the Effective Time. Concurrently with, or as
soon as practicable following, the execution of this Agreement, Valley shall
reserve, from its authorized but unissued or treasury shares, a sufficient
number of shares of Valley Common Stock to provide for the shares issuable
upon exercise of the Valley Stock Options.

 

2.5. Valley Shares. The shares of Valley Common Stock outstanding at the
Effective Time shall not be affected by the Merger, but along with the
additional shares of Valley Common Stock to be issued as provided in Section
2.1 hereof, shall become the outstanding common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

2.6. Tax Consequences. It is intended that the Merger shall constitute
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that this
Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Section
368 of the Code.

2.7. No Dissenters Rights. Consistent with the provisions of the NYBCL, no
shareholder of State Bancorp shall have appraisal rights with respect to the
Merger.

of the disclosure schedules required by Article III and Article V hereof,

3.1. Corporate Organization. (a) State Bancorp is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of New York. State Bancorp has the corporate power and authority to own or
lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do business and
in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so licensed or qualified or in good standing would
not have, or would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect (as hereinafter defined) on State
Bancorp. State Bancorp is registered as a bank holding company under The Bank
Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the " _BHCA_ ").

(b) All of the Subsidiaries of State Bancorp are listed in the _State Bancorp
Disclosure Schedule_ with a designation of which Subsidiaries are Significant
Subsidiaries. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Subsidiary_ " shall mean
any corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or
other entity of which at least a majority of the capital stock or other
ownership interest having ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the
board of directors or other persons performing similar functions are at the
time directly or indirectly owned by such person. As used in this Agreement,
the term " _Significant Subsidiary_ " shall mean each Subsidiary which is a
"significant subsidiary" as defined in Regulation S-X, promulgated by the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "), as in effect
as of the date hereof. Each Significant Subsidiary of State Bancorp is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
state of incorporation or organization. SBLI is a commercial bank chartered
under the laws of the State of New York whose deposits are insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ") to the fullest extent
permitted by law. Each Significant Subsidiary of State Bancorp has the power
and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted and is duly licensed or qualified
to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned or 

 



7  leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where
the failure of each of the foregoing would not have a Material Adverse Effect
on State Bancorp. The _State Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth true and
complete copies of the certificate of incorporation, articles of association,
bylaws or other comparable formation and governing documents (together the "
_Charter Documents_ ") of State Bancorp and of each State Bancorp Significant
Subsidiary as in effect on the date hereof. Except as set forth in the _State
Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ , State Bancorp does not own or control, directly
or indirectly, any equity interest in any corporation, company, association,
partnership, joint venture or other entity and owns no real estate, except (i)
residential real estate acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of
foreclosure in each individual instance with a fair market value less than
$500,000 and (ii) real estate used for its banking premises.

3.2. Capitalization. (a) The authorized capital stock of State Bancorp
consists of 50,000,000 shares of State Bancorp Common Stock and 250,000 shares
of preferred stock, $0.01 par value (the " _State Bancorp Preferred Stock_ ").
As of the date hereof, there were 16,966,603 shares of State Bancorp Common
Stock issued and outstanding, and 712,592 shares of State Bancorp Common Stock
issued and held in the treasury and 36,842 shares of State Bancorp Preferred
Stock issued and outstanding and no shares of State Bancorp Preferred Stock
issued and held in treasury. As of the date hereof, except for 191,425 shares
of State Bancorp Common Stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock
options granted pursuant to the State Bancorp Stock Option Plans and 465,569
shares of State Bancorp Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the State
Bancorp Warrant, there were no shares of State Bancorp Common Stock issuable
upon the exercise of outstanding stock options or otherwise. All issued and
outstanding shares of State Bancorp Common Stock and State Bancorp Preferred
Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid, and
nonassessable. The authorized capital stock of SBLI consists of 750,000 shares
of common stock, $5.00 par value per share. As of the date hereof, there were
629,974 shares of SBLI common stock outstanding. Except as set forth in the
_State Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ , neither State Bancorp nor any State
Bancorp Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling for the
transfer, purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock of State Bancorp
or any State Bancorp Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to
purchase or otherwise receive any shares of such capital stock or any
securities convertible into or representing the right to purchase or subscribe
for any such shares, and there are no agreements or understandings with
respect to voting of any such shares.

(b) The _State Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ contains a list setting forth as
of the date of this Agreement (i) all outstanding State Bancorp Stock Options,
the names of the option holders, the date each such option was granted, the
number of shares subject to each such option, the expiration date of each
such option, any vesting schedule with respect to an option which is not yet
fully vested, and the price at which each such option may be exercised and
(ii) comparable information for any other outstanding awards under the State
Bancorp Stock Option Plans. Each State Bancorp Stock Option intended to
qualify as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code so
qualifies. The exercise price of each State Bancorp Stock Option is no less
than the fair market value of a share of State Bancorp Common Stock as
determined on the date of grant of such State Bancorp Stock Option and within
the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and associated guidance set forth by
Treasury. State Bancorp has 

 



8  made available to Valley true and complete copies of all State Bancorp Stock
Option Plans and the forms of all award agreements evidencing outstanding
State Bancorp Stock Options.

stock and record and beneficial owners of such capital stock for each
Subsidiary of State Bancorp. Except as set forth in the _State Bancorp
Disclosure Schedule_ , State Bancorp owns, directly or indirectly, all of the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of or all other equity
interests in each of State Bancorps Subsidiaries, free and clear of any lien,
claim, charge, mortgage, pledge, security interest, restriction, encumbrance
or security interest (" _Liens_ "), and all of such shares are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights.

faith, neither State Bancorp nor any of its Subsidiaries beneficially owns or
controls, directly or indirectly, any shares of stock or other equity interest
in any corporation, firm, partnership, joint venture or other entity.

debentures, trust-preferred securities or other similar indebtedness of State
Bancorp (parent company only) are issued or outstanding.

Bancorp or SBLI are necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
State Bancorp, and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of State
Bancorp, enforceable against State Bancorp in accordance with its terms,

 



9  subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting
creditors rights and remedies generally and subject, as to enforceability, to
general principles of equity, whether applied in a court of law or a court of
equity.

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by State Bancorp
or the execution and delivery of the Bank Merger Agreement by SBLI, nor the
consummation by State Bancorp of the transactions contemplated hereby in
accordance with the terms hereof or the consummation by SBLI of the
transactions contemplated thereby in accordance with the terms thereof, or

assuming that the consents and approvals set forth below are duly obtained,
violate any statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ,

or any other plan or arrangement identified in the _State Bancorp Disclosure
Schedule_ other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course of business.

contingent liability arising wholly or partially out of events occurring prior
to or at the Effective Time.

by State Bancorp and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice). Each contract, arrangement, commitment or

knowledge of State Bancorp, any other party thereto, under any such State
Bancorp Contract, except, in each case, where such invalidity, failure to be

present value of the monetary amounts payable as of the date specified in
such schedule, whether individually or in the aggregate (including good faith
estimates of all amounts not subject to precise quantification as of the date

similar contract or plan with or which covers any present or former employee,
director or consultant of State Bancorp or any of its Subsidiaries
and identifying the types and estimated amounts of the in-kind benefits due
under any State Bancorp Pension Plans, State Bancorp Welfare Plans or State
Bancorp Contract (other than a tax-qualified plan) for each such person,
specifying the assumptions in such schedule. The failure of State Bancorp to
include immaterial amounts (both individually or in the aggregate) under this
Section 3.13(c) shall not constitute a breach thereof.

(a) To State Bancorps knowledge, and except as set forth in the _State
Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ , State Bancorp and its Subsidiaries have good,

for abatement alleging that State Bancorp or such State Bancorp Subsidiary
(either directly or as a trustee or fiduciary, or as a successor-in-interest
in connection with the enforcement of remedies to realize the value of
properties serving as collateral for outstanding loans) is responsible for the
correction or cleanup of any condition resulting from the violation of any
law, ordinance or other governmental regulation regarding environmental
matters, which correction or cleanup would have a Material Adverse Effect on

3.20. [Reserved]

3.21. SEC Documents; Other Reports; Internal and Disclosure Controls.

(a) State Bancorp has filed all reports, schedules, registration statements
and other documents, together with amendments thereto, required to be filed
with the SEC since December 31, 2008 (the " _State Bancorp SEC Reports_ "). As
of their respective dates of filing with the SEC (or, if amended or superseded
by a subsequent filing prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such
subsequent filing), the State Bancorp SEC Reports complied, and each such
State Bancorp SEC Report filed subsequent to the date hereof will comply, in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act
of 1933 (the " _Securities Act_ "), the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and did not or
will not, as the case may be, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. There are no outstanding comments from, or
unresolved issues raised by, the SEC with respect to any of the State Bancorp
SEC Reports. None of State Bancorps Significant Subsidiaries is required to
file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act. No executive officer of State Bancorp has failed in any respect
to make the certifications required of him or her under Sections 302 or 906 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and to the knowledge of State Bancorp no enforcement
action has been initiated against State Bancorp by the SEC relating to
disclosures contained in any State Bancorp SEC Report.

(b) State Bancorp and each of its Significant Subsidiaries have filed all
material reports, registrations and statements, together with any amendments
required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required to file
since December 31, 2008 with any Governmental Entity (other than the SEC) and
have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith.
Except for normal examinations conducted by a Governmental Entity in the
regular course of the business of State Bancorp and its Significant
Subsidiaries or as set forth in the _State Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ , no
Governmental Entity has initiated any proceeding or, to the knowledge of State
Bancorp, threatened an investigation into the business or operations of State
Bancorp or any of its Significant Subsidiaries since December 31, 2008.

(c) Except as set forth in the _State Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ , the
records, systems, controls, data and information of State Bancorp and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of State Bancorp or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means
of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and
non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a materially
adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls described in the
following sentence. State Bancorp and its Subsidiaries have devised and
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP. State Bancorp (A) has designed

 



21  disclosure controls and procedures (within the meaning of Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
relating to State Bancorp and its Subsidiaries is made known to the
management of State Bancorp by others within those entities as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required by the Exchange Act with respect to the State Bancorp
SEC Reports, and (B) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior
to the date hereof, to State Bancorps auditors and the audit committee of
State Bancorps Board (1) any significant deficiencies in the design
or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect in any
material respect State Bancorps ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data and have identified for State Bancorps auditors any
material weaknesses in internal controls and (2) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in State Bancorps internal controls. Companys management has completed
an assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial
reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2010, and such assessment concluded
that such controls were effective.

(d) Except as set forth in the _State Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ , since
January 1, 2008, neither State Bancorp nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to
the knowledge of State Bancorp, any member of State Bancorps Board of
Directors or executive officer of State Bancorp or any of its Subsidiaries,
has received any material written complaint, allegation, assertion or claim,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods of State Bancorp or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
internal accounting controls.

material respects in accordance with the relevant loan documents, State
Bancorps underwriting standards (and, in the case of State Bancorp Loans held
for resale to investors, the underwriting standards, if any, of the applicable
investors) and with all applicable requirements of federal, state and local
laws, regulations and rules, except for such exceptions as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on State Bancorp.

 

(b) Except as set forth in the _State Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ or as would
not have a Material Adverse Effect on State Bancorp, each State Bancorp Loan

been secured by valid Liens which have been perfected and (iii) to State
Bancorps knowledge, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor
named therein, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and other laws of
general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to
general equity principles. Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect
on State Bancorp, the loan documents with respect to each State Bancorp Loan
were in 

 



22  compliance with applicable laws and regulations at the time of origination
or purchase by State Bancorp or its Subsidiaries and are complete and correct
in all material respects.

 

(c) State Bancorp has previously delivered to Valley a schedule setting forth
a list of all Loans as of March 31, 2011 by State Bancorp and its
Subsidiaries to any directors, executive officers and principal shareholders

agreement or on which the borrower is paying a rate which was below market at
the time the loan was made; and (ii) all such loans are and were made in
compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, except for such

the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on State Bancorp. The schedule
referred to in item (i) of this subsection (c) is accurate and complete in all
material respects.

 

(d) State Bancorp has previously delivered to Valley a schedule setting forth

OREO and the book value thereof as of such date. Such schedule is accurate and
complete in all material respects.

(e) Except as set forth in the _State Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ , none of
the agreements pursuant to which State Bancorp or any of its Subsidiaries has
sold loans or pools of loans or participations in loans or pools of loans
contains any obligation to repurchase such loans or interests therein solely
on account of a payment default by the obligor on any such loan.

(f) Except as set forth in the _State Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ , neither
State Bancorp nor any of its Subsidiaries has originated, serviced, and does
not currently hold, directly or indirectly, any loans which would be commonly
referred to as "subprime", "Alt-A" or "negative amortization" loans, or
home equity loans or lines of credit with a loan to value ratio at
origination of over ninety percent (90%) (collectively, _"High Risk Loans"_ ).

(g) Except as set forth in the _State Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ , neither
State Bancorp nor its Subsidiaries owns any investment securities that are
secured by High Risk Loans.

 

3.23. Intellectual Property.

knowledge of State Bancorp, valid and enforceable and (ii) no State Bancorp
Registered IP is involved in any interference, reissue, reexamination,
opposition, cancellation or similar proceeding and, to the knowledge of State
Bancorp, no such action is or has been threatened with respect to any of
State Bancorp Registered IP.

Adverse Effect, State Bancorp or its Subsidiaries own exclusively (such
exclusive right excluding any licenses granted by State Bancorp or its
Subsidiaries), free and clear of any and all Liens, all State Bancorp
Registered IP and all other Intellectual Property that is material to the
businesses of State Bancorp or any of its Subsidiaries other than intellectual
property owned by a third party that is licensed to State Bancorp or a
Subsidiary thereof pursuant to an existing license agreement and used by
State Bancorp or such Subsidiary within the scope of such license.

(c) Each of State Bancorp and its Subsidiaries has taken all reasonable steps
to protect and maintain its rights in its intellectual property and maintain

others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions

Exchange Act with respect to the Valley SEC Reports, and (B) has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Valleys
auditors and the audit committee of Valleys Board (1) any significant
deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which could

summarize and report financial data and have identified for Valleys auditors
any material weaknesses in internal controls and (2) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Valleys internal controls. Companys management has completed an

Proposal; provided that in the event, prior to the time the approval of State
Bancorps shareholders (" _State Bancorp Shareholder Approval_ ") is obtained
but not after, (1) State Bancorp receives, after the execution of this
Agreement, an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal from a person other
than Valley, and (2) the State Bancorp Board of Directors concludes in
good faith (A) that, after consulting with its financial advisor, such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be
likely to result in a Superior Proposal and (B) that, after considering the
advice of outside counsel, failure to take such actions would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to State Bancorps
shareholders under applicable law, State Bancorp may, and may permit its
Subsidiaries and its Subsidiaries representatives to, furnish or cause to be
furnished nonpublic information or data and participate in negotiations or
discussions with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; provided, that prior to
providing any nonpublic information 

 



39  permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, it shall have
entered into an agreement with such third party on terms substantially similar
to and no more favorable to such third party than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement between Valley and State Bancorp dated March 23,
2011 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and any non-public information
provided to any person given access to nonpublic information shall have
previously been provided to Valley or shall be provided to Valley prior to or
concurrently with the time it is provided to such person. State Bancorp will
(A) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions
or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any persons
other than Valley with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (B) not terminate,
waive, amend, release or modify any provision of any confidentiality or

reasonable efforts to enforce any confidentiality or similar
agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Neither the State Bancorp Board of Directors nor any committee thereof
shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Valley)
or refuse to make the State Bancorp Recommendation or (B) adopt, approve,
recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable the adoption of
any Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) cause or permit State Bancorp or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement
constituting or related to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to
lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement
permitted by the terms of Section 5.3(a)). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to the date of the Shareholders Meeting, the State Bancorp Board of
Directors may take any of the actions specified in items (i) and (ii) of the
preceding sentence (a " _State Bancorp Subsequent Determination_ ") after the
fourth (4th) business day following Valleys receipt of a written notice (the
" _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") from State Bancorp (A) advising that the
State Bancorp Board of Directors has decided that a bona fide unsolicited
written Acquisition Proposal that it received (that did not result from a
breach of this Section 5.3) constitutes a Superior Proposal (it being
understood that State Bancorp shall be required to deliver a new Notice of
Superior Proposal in respect of any revised Superior Proposal from such third
party or its affiliates that State Bancorp proposes to accept), (B) specifying
the material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the party making,
such Superior Proposal, and (C) containing an unredacted copy of the relevant
transaction agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal, if, but
only if, the State Bancorp Board of Directors has reasonably determined in
good faith, after consultation with and having considered the advice of
outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that the failure to take such
actions would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to State Bancorps shareholders under applicable law and that such
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal and such Superior Proposal has
been made and has not been withdrawn and continues to be a Superior Proposal
after taking into account all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that
are committed to in writing by Valley pursuant to this Section 5.3(b).

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the changing, qualifying or modifying of the
State Bancorp Recommendation or the making of a State Bancorp Subsequent
Determination by the State Bancorp Board of Directors shall not change the
approval of the State Bancorp Board of Directors for purposes of causing any
takeover laws to be inapplicable to this 

 



40  Agreement and the Voting Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, including the Merger.

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent State Bancorp or the
State Bancorp Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2
under the Exchange Act, or other disclosure requirements under applicable law
or the NYSE or the NASDAQ rules, with respect to an Acquisition Proposal;
provided that such rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that
any action pursuant to such rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

(d) In addition to the obligations of State Bancorp set forth in Sections
5.3(a) and (b), in the event State Bancorp or any of its Subsidiaries or
representatives receives (i) any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any request for
non-public information or to engage in negotiations that the State Bancorp
directors reasonably believe is reasonably likely to lead to or that
contemplates an Acquisition Proposal, State Bancorp promptly (and in any event
within two (2) business days of receipt) shall advise Valley in writing of the
existence of items (i) or (ii), together with the material terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or request and the identity of the
person making any such Acquisition Proposal or request. State Bancorp shall
keep Valley reasonably well informed in all material respects of the
status (including after the occurrence of any material amendment or
modification) of any such Acquisition Proposal or request. Without limiting
any of the foregoing, State Bancorp shall promptly (and in any event within
two (2) business days) notify Valley in writing if it determines to begin
providing non-public information or to engage in negotiations concerning an
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Sections 5.3(a) or (b) and shall in no event
begin providing such information or engaging in such discussions or
negotiations prior to providing such notice.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

by this Agreement, a tender or exchange offer to acquire 25% or more of the
voting power in State Bancorp or any of its Subsidiaries, a proposal for a
merger, consolidation, or other business combination involving State Bancorp
or any of its Subsidiaries or any other proposal or offer to acquire in any
manner 25% or more of the voting power in, or 25% or more of the business,
assets or deposits of, State Bancorp or any of its Subsidiaries.

(ii) _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal (with the percentages set forth in the definition of such term
changed from 25% to 50%) that the State Bancorp Board of Directors concludes
in good faith to be more favorable from a financial point of view to its
stockholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
(including taking into account any adjustment to the terms and conditions
proposed by Valley in response to such proposal pursuant to Section 5.3(b) or
otherwise), (1) after receiving the advice of its financial advisor (which
shall be a nationally recognized investment banking firm), (2) after taking
into account the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the terms
set forth therein (as compared to, and with due regard for, the terms herein),
and (3) after taking into account all legal (with the advice of outside
counsel), financial (including the financing terms of any such proposal),
regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and any other relevant factors
permitted under applicable law.

opportunity to discuss, the relevant documentation for any such loan,
extension of credit, lease, or renewal upon request. Notwithstanding any other
provision contained in this Agreement, neither Valley nor any Valley

sentence apply. State Bancorp acknowledges that Valley may be involved in

party), issue such press release or public statements as may be required by
applicable law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange.

5.10. Failure to Fulfill Conditions. In the event that Valley or State
Bancorp determines that a material condition to its obligation to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby cannot be fulfilled on or prior to
January 31, 2012 (the " _Cutoff Date_ ") and that it will not waive that
condition, it will promptly notify the other party. State Bancorp and Valley
will promptly inform the other of any facts applicable to State Bancorp or
Valley, respectively, or their respective directors or officers, that would
be likely to prevent or materially delay approval of the Merger by any
governmental authority or which would otherwise prevent or materially delay
completion of the Merger.

 



45 5.11. Dividends. Beginning in the third quarter of 2011, State Bancorp
shall take all necessary action to ensure that the record and payment dates
of its regular quarterly dividends on its common stock shall be the same dates
as the record and payment dates for Valleys regular quarterly dividends on
its common stock. 

5.12. [Reserved]

5.13. [Reserved]

5.14. Indemnification.

 

(a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, Valley shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of State Bancorp or
its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _State Bancorp Indemnitees_ ") against
any and all claims, damages, liabilities, losses, costs, charges, expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable costs of investigation, and the
reasonable fees and disbursements of legal counsel and other advisers and
experts as incurred), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in
settlement, asserted against, incurred by or imposed upon any State Bancorp
Indemnitee (" _Costs_ ") by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a
director or officer of State Bancorp or its Subsidiaries, acted as a director
or officer of a third party at the request of State Bancorp or its
Subsidiaries or acted as a benefits plan fiduciary, in connection with,
arising out of or relating to any threatened, pending or completed claim,
action, suit or proceeding (whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative) (each a " _Claim_ " and collectively, " _Claims_ "), including
without limitation any Claim which is based upon, arises out of or in any way
relates to the Merger, this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the State Bancorp Indemnitees service as a member of the
Board of Directors of State Bancorp or any of its Subsidiaries or any
committee thereof, the events leading up to the execution of this Agreement,
any statement, announcement, recommendation or solicitation made in connection
therewith or related thereto and any breach of any duty in connection with
any of the foregoing, in each case to the fullest extent which State Bancorp
or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, would have been permitted under any
applicable law and its Charter Documents had the Merger not occurred (and
Valley shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent so
permitted); _provided, however_ , that all rights to indemnification in
respect of any Claim asserted or made within such six year period shall
continue until the final disposition of such Claim.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Valley shall assume and honor any
obligation of State Bancorp immediately prior to the Effective Time with
respect to the indemnification of the State Bancorp Indemnitees arising out of
the Charter Documents of State Bancorp or arising out of any written
indemnification agreements between State Bancorp and such persons disclosed
in the _State Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ , as if such obligations were
pursuant to a contract or arrangement between Valley and such State Bancorp
Indemnitees.

 

(c) In the event Valley or any of its successors or assigns (i) reorganizes or
consolidates with or merges into or enters into another business combination
transaction with any other person or entity and is not the resulting,
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation, merger or
transaction, or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or 

 



46  transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person or entity, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Valley assume the obligations set forth
in this Section 5.14.

(d) Valley shall cause the officers and directors of State Bancorp and its
Subsidiaries to be covered, for a period of six years after the Effective Time
under an extension of State Bancorps existing officers and directors
liability insurance policy (the " _Director and Officer Insurance_ ").

(e) Any State Bancorp Indemnitee wishing to claim indemnification under this
Section 5.14 shall promptly notify Valley upon learning of any Claim, but the
failure to so notify shall not relieve Valley of any liability it may have to
such State Bancorp Indemnitee if such failure does not materially prejudice
Valley.

 

5.15. Employment and Director Matters; Other Post-Closing Items.

 

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in the _State Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ ,
Valley and VNB hereby expressly assume and agree to honor, effective from and
after the Effective Time, each of the Employment Agreements and Change in
Control Agreements identified on the _State Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_ , in
accordance with their respective terms.

 

(b) Before or following consummation of the Merger, Valley will decide whether
to continue each of the State Bancorp Pension Plans and/or the State Bancorp
Welfare Plans for the benefit of employees of SBLI and State Bancorp, or to
have such employees become covered under a Valley pension and/or welfare plan
in accordance with the terms of the Valley pension and/or welfare plans.
Subject to the foregoing, following consummation of the Merger, Valley shall
make available to all employees and officers of State Bancorp who become
employed by VNB coverage under the benefit plans generally available to VNBs
employees and officers (including pension and health and hospitalization) on
the terms and conditions available to VNBs employees and officers in Valley
or VNB medical and dental plans for State Bancorp employees and their
dependents. No prior existing condition limitation not currently imposed by
State Bancorp or SBLI medical or dental plans shall be imposed with respect to
Valleys or VNBs medical and dental plans on State Bancorp or SBLI employees.
State Bancorp and SBLI employees shall receive credit for any deductibles
paid under State Bancorp and SBLI existing medical and dental plans. State
Bancorp employees will be given credit for eligibility and vesting purposes
(but not for benefit accrual purposes) under Valleys or VNBs medical, life,
vacation, sick leave, disability and other welfare plans for prior service
with State Bancorp, and State Bancorps employees will be granted credit for
such prior service with State Bancorp, solely for purposes of eligibility and
vesting under Valleys or VNBs 401(k) plan. No State Bancorp employee will be
given credit for prior service under Valleys or VNBs Pension Plan for any
purpose.

 

(c) Valley will use reasonable efforts to retain State Bancorp and SBLI
employees following the Effective Time of the Merger. Valley intends to give
priority consideration to State Bancorp and SBLI employees for open positions
at Valley and its Subsidiaries to the extent their jobs are eliminated in
connection with the Merger.

 



47 (d) Except for State Bancorp and SBLI employees who have individual severance
or similar contractual agreement, following the consummation of the Merger
and for one year thereafter, VNB shall, pay severance to State Bancorp and
SBLI employees who are involuntarily terminated by Valley or VNB for reasons
other than cause in the amount of two (2) weeks per year of service subject
to (i) a minimum of four (4) weeks for non-officer employees and twelve (12)
weeks for officers, and (ii) a maximum for all terminated employees of 52
weeks severance. Terminated employees described in the preceding sentence
will be reimbursed for payments made pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act, as amended, during the applicable severance period.

 

(e) Each non-management State Bancorp director shall be offered the
opportunity to participate in the Valley New York regional advisory board.

(f) Upon or as soon as practicable following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, Valley and VNB will enter into Retention Incentive Agreements
substantially in the form included in the _State Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_
with the individuals identified in the _State Bancorp Disclosure Schedule_.
Prior to the Effective Time, Valley, VNB, State Bancorp and SBLI shall
cooperate to develop, implement and communicate to other key employees of
State Bancorp and SBLI identified as such by the Chief Executive Officer of
State Bancorp a retention program designed to retain the services of such key
employees through the Effective Time and thereafter until one hundred and
eighty (180) days following the Closing Date or such earlier time as Valley
and VNB may determine consistent with their respective business needs.

 

(g) Valley will increase the size of the Valley Board of Directors and will
fill the vacancy created by such increase by appointing an individual, at the
Effective Time, to the Valley Board of Directors from the current Board of
Directors of State Bancorp. Such director shall be chosen by Valleys Board of
Directors (upon recommendation of Valleys Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee) from a pool of three (3) State Bancorp directors
selected by State Bancorps Board of Directors and who meet the director
qualifications set forth in Valleys director qualification standards
and corporate governance guidelines.

(h) Valley and VNB may, in their discretion within thirty (30) days prior to
the Effective Time, direct State Bancorp and SBLI to terminate any or all
nonqualified deferred compensation plans, programs and arrangements sponsored
by them in a manner that does not materially adversely affect the rights of
participants to benefits earned through the termination date. Upon receipt of
such a direction State Bancorp and SBLI shall take all requisite action to
implement it.

5.16. Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment.

(a) The parties intend that the Merger qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that this Agreement constitute a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the
income tax regulations promulgated under the Code. From and after the date of
this Agreement and until the Effective Time, each of State Bancorp and Valley
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to qualify
as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and

 



48  will not knowingly take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to
take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken which action or
failure to act could prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Following the Effective
Time, neither Valley nor any affiliate knowingly shall take any action, cause
any action to be taken, fail to take any action, or cause any action to fail
to be taken, which action or failure to act could prevent the Merger from
qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

(b) As of the date hereof, State Bancorp does not know of any reason why it
would not be able to deliver to counsel to both Valley and State Bancorp
certificates substantially in compliance with IRS published advance ruling
guidelines, with reasonable or customary exceptions and modifications thereto
(the " _IRS Guidelines_ "), to enable counsel to both Valley and State Bancorp
to deliver the legal opinions contemplated by Section 6.1(d), and State
Bancorp hereby agrees to deliver such certificates effective as of the date of
such opinions to counsel to both Valley and State Bancorp.

(c) As of the date hereof, Valley does not know of any reason why it would not
be able to deliver to counsel to both Valley and State Bancorp certificates
substantially in compliance with the IRS Guidelines, with reasonable or
customary exceptions and modifications thereto, to enable counsel to both
Valley and State Bancorp to deliver the legal opinions contemplated by Section
6.1(d), and Valley hereby agrees to deliver such certificates effective as of
the date of such opinions to counsel to both Valley and State Bancorp.

5.17. [Reserved] 

5.18. Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the parties will each
take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to cause any
disposition of shares of State Bancorp Common Stock or conversion of any
derivative securities in respect of shares of State Bancorp Common Stock in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

5.19. Dividend Reinvestment Plan. State Bancorp shall not permit participants
in such its dividend reinvestment plan to purchase State Bancorp Common Stock
at a discount from its current market price.

 

5.20. State Bancorp Preferred Stock. Each of Valley and State Bancorp shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause or facilitate the TARP Purchase in
accordance with Section 2.2 hereof. In furtherance of the foregoing, State
Bancorp shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
representatives to provide, all reasonable cooperation and take all
reasonable actions as may be requested by Valley in connection with such
repurchase, including by (i) furnishing all information concerning State
Bancorp and its Subsidiaries that Valley or any applicable Governmental Entity
may request in connection with such repurchase or with respect to the effects
of such purchase on Valley or its pro forma capitalization, (ii) assisting
with the preparation of any analyses or presentations Valley deems necessary
or advisable in its reasonable judgment in connection with such repurchase or
the effects thereof and (iii) entering into any agreement with such holder
(including any letter agreement among

 



49  State Bancorp, Valley and such holder) to effect the repurchase of such
shares as Valley may reasonably request.

then, if within 12 months after such termination, State Bancorp or any of its

hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto.
Upon such determination, the parties hereto will negotiate in good faith in an
effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect
the original intent of the parties hereto.

and each of the parties hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such courts
(and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action

any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of
any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,
