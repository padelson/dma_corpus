corporation  and is in good  standing  under  the  laws of each  state  or other

used by it, or the  nature of the  activities  conducted  by it,  requires  such
qualification.

     (b)  Seller  has  delivered  or  made  available  to  Buyer  copies  of the
Organizational   Documents  of  the  Company,   as  currently  in  effect.   The
Organizational  Documents  of the  Company  are in full force and effect and the

valid and binding obligations of the parties thereto and:

          (i) the Company is not in material breach or default (and no situation

     the  Company  Basic  Documents  have been and are  being  made  timely  and
     properly,  and before the same became  delinquent,  by the Company  and, to
     Seller's  Knowledge,  where the non-payment of same by another party to any
     of the Company Basic Documents could adversely  affect any of the Interests

     in force have been duly performed; and

          (iv) except as set forth in Schedule 3.9(c) or Schedule 3.9(d)(iv), no
     non-consent operations exist with respect to any of the Interests that have
     resulted or will result in a temporary or permanent increase or decrease in
     either the  Company's  Net  Revenue  Interest  or Working  Interest in such
     Interest.

     (e) The Company is not  obligated to incur any  expenses,  and has not made
commitments to make  expenditures  (capital or otherwise),  or to apply revenues
from a Well's  production  or a Lease in connection  with any Interests  (and no
other similar obligations or liabilities have been incurred) with respect to the
ownership or operation of Interests  attributable to the time period on or after
the Effective  Date,  other than Ordinary and Capital  Expenses.  Subject to the
comments set forth in Schedule  3.9(e)(i),  all expenses payable under the terms
of the Company  Basic  Documents  have been  properly and timely paid except for
such expenses as are being  currently paid or will be paid prior to delinquency.
Except for budgeted capital expenditures as set forth in Schedule 3.9(e)(ii), no
proposals calling for expenditures in excess of $250,000 for any one project are
currently  outstanding  (whether made by the Company,  or by any other party) to
drill additional wells, or to deepen, plug back,  sidetrack,  abandon, or rework
existing  Wells,  or to conduct other  operations  for which consent is required
under the applicable  operating  agreement,  or to conduct any other operations,
other than normal operation of the Interests.

     (f)  No  agreements  or  arrangements   exist  for  the  sale,   gathering,
transportation,  compression,  refining, treating, processing or other marketing
of  production  from the  Interests  (including  calls  on,  or other  rights to
purchase,  production,  whether or not the same are currently  being  exercised)
other than (i) agreements set forth in Schedule  3.9(d),  and (ii) agreements or
arrangements  that are  cancelable on 30 days notice or less without  penalty or
detriment to the Company.

     (g) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.9(g)(i), the Company has not received
prepayments   (including  payments  for  oil  and  gas  not  taken  pursuant  to
"take-or-pay"  arrangements) for any oil or gas produced from the Interests as a
result of which the  obligation  does (or may) exist (i) to  deliver  oil or gas
produced  from the  Interests  from or after the  Effective  Date  without  then
receiving  payment  therefor,  or (ii) to make  repayments  in  cash.  For  each
Interest listed in Schedule 3.9(g)(i),  such Schedule also sets forth as to each
such Interest (i) the total amount of prepayment received prior to the Effective
Date,  and (ii)  whether  or not a cash  payment  can be  required  in the event
recoupment  out of production  proves to be  inadequate.  Except as set forth in
Schedule 3.9(g)(ii),  there is no Interest with respect to which the Company has
taken more (referred to herein as  "Over-produced")  or less (referred to herein
as  "Under-produced")  production  from such  Interest (or on the Units in which
such Interest  participates),  or any product thereof, than the ownership of the
Company and such  predecessors in such Interest would entitle the Company or any
such predecessors (absent any balancing agreement or arrangement) to receive, to

                                       21
<PAGE>

the extent such Over-produced or Under-produced  position has not, as of the day
immediately  preceding  the  Effective  Date  been  fully  made up or  otherwise
extinguished.  For each Interest  listed in Schedule  3.9(g)(ii),  such Schedule

applicable balancing  agreement,  (i) whether the Company is in an Over-produced
or  Under-produced   position,  (ii)  the  amount  of  such  Over-production  or
Under-production,  (iii) a description  of the written  balancing  agreement (if
any) pertaining to such Interest (or a statement that no such agreement  exists)
and (iv) a statement  as to whether  royalties,  overriding  royalties  or other
burdens  against the  Company's Net Revenue  Interest in the affected  Interests
were, during the period the subject imbalance accrued,  paid based upon receipts
or  entitlements.  Except  as set forth in  Schedule  3.9(g)(iii),  no  pipeline
imbalances have arisen and remain  outstanding due to the failure of nominations
made by the Company to match actual  deliveries  of  production  from any one or
more  Interests.  Except  as set  forth  in  Schedule  3.9(g)(iv),  none  of the
purchasers  under any production  sales contracts has (i) exercised any economic
out  provision;  (ii)  curtailed  its takes of natural gas in  violation of such
contracts;  or (iii) given notice that it desires to amend the production  sales
contracts  with  respect to price or quantity of  deliveries  under  take-or-pay

Interests;  provided that the foregoing is qualified by Seller's  Knowledge with
respect to Interests not operated by the Company or its Affiliates.

     (i) Except with respect to Retained Assets, as set forth in Schedule 3.9(i)
or, as may be provided for by a Company  Basic  Document  identified on Schedule
3.9(d) or any other part of Schedule  3.9,  neither the Company nor any Interest
is subject to (i) any area of mutual interest  agreements,  (ii) any farm-out or
farm-in  agreement  under  which  any  party  thereto  is  entitled  to  receive
assignments of any Interest or any interest  therein not yet made, or could earn
additional  assignments  of any Interest or any interest  therein after the date
hereof,  (iii) any tax  partnership,  (iv) any Contract  relating to the pending
disposition  or  acquisition  of the  assets of, or any  interest  in, any other
entity,  (v)  any  Contract  relating  to the  purchase  or sale  of  assets  or
properties pursuant to which the Company paid or received total consideration in
excess of $250,000,  that was or will be consummated  after July 10, 2001, or to
Seller's  Knowledge  that was  consummated  on or  before  July 10,  2001;  (vi)
options, swaps, futures, caps, hedges or other derivative contracts that will be
binding  on any of the  Company's  properties  or assets  after  Closing;  (vii)
sale-leaseback and similar  Contracts;  (viii) Contracts that constitute a lease
(other than an oil and gas or similar lease) which lease involves an annual base
rental of more than $250,000;  (ix) Contracts  containing covenants limiting the
freedom of the  Company to engage in any line of  business  or compete  with any
person or entity or  operate  at any  location;  (x)  participation  agreements,
development  agreements,  plant  agreements,   production  handling  agreements,
injection  agreements,  repressuring and recycling  agreements and gas balancing
and deferred production agreements;  (xi) Contracts,  the default or termination
of which could have a Material  Adverse  Effect on the Company or the  Company's
ownership or operation of the Interests, (xii) Contracts between the Company and
Seller or any  Affiliate  of Seller that will survive the  Closing;  or,  (xiii)
other  Contracts  that  could be  reasonably  expected  to result  in  aggregate
payments by Buyer or the Company of more than $250,000 during the current or any

                                       22

subsequent  year. True and complete  copies of all Contracts  listed in Schedule
3.9(i) have been provided to Buyer and there are no amendments to such Contracts
except as set forth on such schedule.

     (j) All severance,  production, ad valorem and other similar taxes based on

commercial  rates being  received by other parties in  comparable,  arm's length
transactions.

     (n) Except as disclosed in Schedule  3.9(n),  there are no Wells located on

plug and abandon and with respect to which the plugging and abandonment  must be

and  which of those  Tax  Returns  are  currently  the  subject  of  audit.  All
deficiencies  proposed  as a result of such  audits,  if any,  have  been  paid,
reserved against,  settled,  or, as indicated by Seller,  are being contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings.  Except as described in Schedule 3.11(c),
neither  Seller nor the Company has given or been  requested  to give waivers or

respect to the due date for the  filing of any Tax Return of or with  respect to
the  Company  or any  waiver  or  agreement  for any  extension  of time for the

been made since July 10,  2001,  or to Seller's  Knowledge on or before July 10,
2001,  by an  authority  in a  jurisdiction  where the Company does not file Tax
Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. Seller is
not a "foreign  person" for  purposes of Section 1445 of the IRC. All Taxes that
the Company is or was required by Legal Requirements to withhold or collect have
been duly withheld or collected and, to the extent  required,  have been paid to
the proper Governmental Body or other Person.

     (e) The Company has no liability for the Taxes of any Person other than the

9.1      TERMINATION EVENTS

     This  Agreement  may,  by  notice  given  at or prior  to the  Closing,  be
terminated:

     (a) by either Buyer or Seller if a material Breach of any provision of this

other Party and such Breach has not been waived;

     (b) (i) by Buyer if any of the  conditions  set forth in Article 7 have not
been satisfied as of the Proposed Closing Date or any  subsequently  agreed upon

(other than  through the failure of Buyer to comply with its  obligations  under
this  Agreement)  and Buyer has not waived any such  condition  on or before the
Proposed Closing Date or any  subsequently  agreed upon Closing Date; or (ii) by
Seller,  if any of the conditions set forth in Article 8 have not been satisfied
as of the Proposed Closing Date or any subsequently  agreed upon Closing Date or
if  satisfaction  of any such  conditions is or becomes  impossible  (other than
through  the  failure  of Seller  to  comply  with its  obligations  under  this
Agreement)  and  Seller  has not  waived  any such  condition  on or before  the
Proposed Closing Date or any subsequently agreed upon Closing Date;

     (c) by mutual consent of Buyer and Seller; or

     (d) by either Buyer or Seller if the Closing has not  occurred  (other than
through the failure of any Party seeking to terminate  this  Agreement to comply
fully with its  obligations  under this Agreement) by 30 days after the Proposed
Closing Date.

9.2      EFFECT OF TERMINATION

     Each Party's right of  termination  under Section 9.1 is in addition to any
other rights it may have under this Agreement or otherwise,  and the exercise of
a right of termination will not be an election of remedies. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, all further obligations of the Parties under
this Agreement  will  terminate,  except that the  obligations in Sections 12.1,
12.2 and 12.3 will survive; provided, however, that nothing herein shall relieve
Seller or Buyer from liability for any Breach of this Agreement.

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

10.1     TAX MATTERS

     (a) Seller shall and shall cause the Company to  terminate  any tax sharing
agreement  between or among  Seller and the Company or any other  Affiliates  of
Seller as of the  Closing  Date and any such  agreement  shall  have no  further
effect for any taxable year  (whether the current year, a future year, or a past
year).

                                       44
<PAGE>

     (b) Seller  shall  timely file the U.S.  federal  income Tax Returns of the
Affiliated  Group and any  Combined  Returns  (taking  into  account  extensions
thereto) for all periods  (including any Pre-Closing  Period or Straddle Period)
and will timely pay any Taxes with respect  thereto.  Seller  shall  include the
income of the Company  (including  any deferred  items  triggered into income by
Treas. Reg. ss.1.1502-13, any excess loss account taken into income under Treas.
Reg.  ss.1.1502-19  and all items of income and gain  resulting from the Section
338(h)(10)  Elections) on Seller's  consolidated  federal income Tax Returns for
all periods through the end of the Closing Date and pay any federal income Taxes
attributable to such income. The Company shall furnish Tax information to Seller
for inclusion in Seller's federal  consolidated income Tax Return for the period
which includes the Closing Date in accordance with the Company's past custom and
practice.  For purposes of preparing these Tax Returns and Combined Returns, the
income and expenses of the Company shall be apportioned between the period up to
and  including the Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date by closing
the books of the Company as of the end of the Closing Date.  Seller shall timely
file such Tax Returns and duly and timely pay all Taxes on such Tax Returns.

     (c)  Seller  shall  prepare  or shall  cause to be  prepared  all other Tax
Returns of the Company for a Pre-Closing Period that are filed subsequent to the
Closing Date.  Seller shall timely file such Tax Returns and duly and timely pay
all Taxes due with respect to the periods  covered by such Tax  Returns.  To the
extent  in its or the  Company's  possession  Buyer  shall  provide  timely  and
accurate information to Seller for Seller's preparation of such Tax Returns

     (d) Buyer shall  prepare or shall  cause to be prepared  all Tax Returns of
the Company for a Straddle Period that are filed subsequent to the Closing Date.
All such Tax Returns  with  respect to a Straddle  Period shall be prepared on a
basis consistent with prior Tax Returns filed with respect to the Company.  With
respect to each such Tax Return,  Buyer shall determine the Tax  attributable to
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (the  "Pre-Closing
Tax") by an interim  closing of the books as of the Closing Date,  except for ad
valorem Taxes and franchise  Taxes.  At least twenty (20) days prior to the date
on which such Tax Return is due (including any extensions),  Buyer shall deliver
a copy of such Tax Return to Seller together with a statement of the Pre-Closing
Tax.  Seller shall be permitted to review and comment on each such Tax Return at
least ten days prior to such due date,  and Buyer  shall make such  changes  and
revisions to such Tax Return and the resulting Pre-Closing Tax as are reasonably
requested by Seller and which are consistent  with past practices of the Company
and shall notify  Seller  thereof at least five days prior to such due date that
such changes  have been made.  Not later than three days prior to such due date,
Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of Pre-Closing Tax (as so revised), reduced
by the amount of any prepaid tax payments  (including  tax  deposits)  made with
respect to such Pre-Closing Tax prior to the Closing.  If the amount of any such
prepaid tax  payments is in excess of the amount of the  Pre-Closing  Tax,  then
such excess shall be treated as a refund under Section 10.1(f) of this Agreement
and shall be refunded to Seller in accordance with the terms of Section 10.1(f).
Upon  receipt of such  payment,  Buyer  shall cause the Company to file such Tax
Return  and timely pay the Tax shown due on such Tax  Return  less  prepaid  tax
payments (including tax deposits).

                                       45

     Buyer shall be responsible  for preparing and filing the initial  franchise
tax return of the  Company  required  to be filed  after the  Closing  Date as a
result of the transfer of the Shares to the Buyer (the  "Initial  Franchise  Tax
Return") and shall be  responsible  for the payment of any  franchise  taxes due
with respect to the period covered by the Initial  Franchise Tax Return.  Seller
shall be  responsible  for preparing and filing any franchise tax returns of the
Company  required to be filed for any periods prior to the period covered by the
Initial  Franchise  Tax Return and shall be  responsible  for the payment of any
franchise  taxes due with respect to the periods  covered by such  franchise tax
returns. Any reduction in the amount of franchise taxes for any period for which
Seller is  responsible  hereunder  shall be  treated as a refund  under  Section
10.1(f) and shall be refunded to Seller in accordance  with the terms of Section
10.1(f)

     Buyer shall be responsible for paying the ad valorem taxes  attributable to
the Interests for the calendar  year 2004.  Buyer shall  calculate and determine
the amount of such ad valorem  taxes  attributable  to the periods  prior to the
Closing  Date by  prorating  such taxes on a daily  basis (the  "Pre-Closing  Ad
Valorem  Tax").  At least  twenty  (20) days  prior to the date that any such ad
valorem tax is due, Buyer shall deliver a copy of the 2004 tax statements  along
with Buyer's  calculation of the  Pre-Closing  Ad Valorem Tax to Seller.  Seller
shall be permitted to review such documentation until ten days prior to such due
date,  and Buyer shall make such changes and  revisions to such tax payments and
the resulting  Pre-Closing Ad Valorem Tax as are reasonably  requested by Seller
and which are  consistent  with past  practices  of the Company and shall notify
Seller at least  five days  prior to such due date that such  changes  have been
made.  Not later than three  days  prior to such due date,  Seller  shall pay to
Buyer the final  amount of  Pre-Closing  Ad Valorem  Tax.  Upon  receipt of such
payment,  Buyer shall cause the Company to timely pay the 2004 ad valorem  taxes
attributable to the Interests.

     (e) Seller shall join Buyer in making a timely,  irrevocable  and effective
election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and any similar election under any
applicable state or local income tax law (collectively,  the "Section 338(h)(10)
Elections") with respect to Buyer's  purchase of the Shares.  To facilitate such
election,  at the Closing Seller shall deliver to Buyer an IRS Form 8023 and any
similar forms under applicable state or local income tax law ("Forms 8023") with
respect to Buyer's purchase of the Shares,  on which Seller shall have completed
Sections  B and C  thereof  and  which  shall  have  been  duly  executed  by an
authorized  person for Seller.  Buyer shall complete Sections A, D and E thereof
and cause the Forms 8023 to be duly executed by an authorized  person for Buyer,
shall provide a copy of the completed Forms 8023 to Seller,  and shall cause the
Forms  8023 to be duly and  timely  filed  as  prescribed  by  Treas.  Reg.  ss.
1.338(h)(10)-1  or the  corresponding  provisions of  applicable  state or local
income Tax law.  Seller and Buyer shall  cooperate with each other in allocating
the aggregate  deemed sale price ("ADSP") as defined in Treas.  Reg. ss. 1.338-4
among the classes of assets of the Company pursuant to Treas.  Reg. ss. 1.338-6,
and shall make  available to each other such Tax data and other  information  as
may be  reasonably  requested  by the other  party.  Within  150 days  after the
Closing,  Seller and Buyer shall agree on the  allocation of such ADSP among the
classes of assets of the Company to be reported on the  respective IRS Form 8883
and any similar  forms under  applicable  state or local  income tax law ("Forms
8883") to be filed by Seller and  Buyer.  In the event that Buyer and Seller are

                                       46
<PAGE>

unable to agree on the  allocation  of ADSP to be  reported on Forms 8883 within
180 days of the Closing Date, the matter in dispute shall be resolved as soon as
practicable  (but in any  event  within  30  days  thereafter)  by a "Big  Four"
independent  accounting firm or, if the disagreement  involves  valuation,  by a
nationally  recognized  appraisal  firm,  mutually  satisfactory to the parties,
which  resolution  shall be binding and conclusive upon Seller and Buyer.  Buyer
and Seller  shall bear  equally the fees and  expenses  of such firm.  Buyer and
Seller shall file all Tax Returns in a manner  consistent with the allocation of
ADSP reported on Forms 8883.

     (f) Any Tax  refunds  that are  received  by Buyer or the  Company  and any
amounts  credited  against Taxes to which Buyer or the Company  become  entitled
that relate to Tax periods or portions  thereof  ending on or before the Closing
Date shall be for the account of Seller,  and Buyer shall pay over to Seller any
such refund or the amount of any such credit within 15 days after the receipt or
entitlement  thereto,  net of any  Taxes  imposed  upon  Buyer by  reason of the
receipt of such refund or credit.

     (g) Buyer  shall not file an amended Tax Return or any claim for refund for
any period ending on or prior to the Closing Date without the written consent of
Seller,  which consent will not be unreasonably  withheld.  However,  in no case
will Seller's failure to give consent be treated as unreasonably  withheld if it
is due to Seller's reasonable belief that filing a claim for refund would have a
detrimental impact (including an increased risk of a tax audit) on Seller or any
Seller's Affiliates (including Seller's Affiliated Group).

     (h) Seller shall be solely  responsible for the audit of, or any litigation
or other Proceeding with respect to, the consolidated  federal income Tax return
of the Affiliated  Group and any Combined Returns and Seller shall have the sole
discretion to settle or defend any such audit,  litigation  or other  Proceeding
with respect to a U.S.  federal income Tax Return of the  Affiliated  Group or a
Combined  Return.  Any such audit,  litigation or other Proceeding will not be a
Third Party Claim subject to the provisions of Section 11.7.

     (i) Buyer agrees to indemnify  Seller for any additional tax owed by Seller
(including  tax owed by Seller due to this  indemnification  payment)  resulting
from any  transaction  engaged in by the Company not in the  Ordinary  Course of
Business occurring on the Closing Date but after the Closing, other than any Tax
resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Elections.

     (j) Buyer and Seller agree to report all  transactions  not in the Ordinary
Course of Business  occurring  after the Closing on the Closing  Date on Buyer's
federal  income Tax  Return (or on the  Company's  separate  federal  income Tax
Return) to the extent permitted by Treas. Reg. ss.1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B),  other
than any transactions  resulting or deemed to result from the Section 338(h)(10)
Elections.

     (k)  Seller,  the  Company and Buyer  shall  preserve  all Tax  information
related to the  Company,  and records or other  documents  related to Taxes with
respect to the Company,  until the date that is six months after the  expiration
of the statute of  limitations  applicable to such Tax; and each Party agrees to
give to the other Party a reasonable  written notice prior to its  transferring,
destroying or discarding any such information,  records or documents and, to the
extent the other Party so requests,  the notifying  Party shall permit the other
Party to take possession of such information,  records and documents.  Buyer and

                                       47
<PAGE>

the Company,  on the one hand, and Seller,  on the other hand,  shall  cooperate
fully,  as and to the extent  reasonably  requested by the other,  in connection
with the filing of Tax  Returns  pursuant  to this  Section  10.1 and any audit,
litigation or other  Proceeding with respect to Taxes.  In that regard,  Seller,
Buyer,  and  the  Company  shall,  at  their  own  expense,  maintain  such  Tax
information or Tax records  relating to the Company as are regularly  maintained
by the Company or such Party or as may be required by law (including Tax law) to
be maintained.  Such Tax records or Tax information shall be made available upon
written  request by Seller or Buyer or the Company,  as the case may be,  within
five business days of such request.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  Seller and
Buyer  shall  only be  obligated  to  provide  that  portion  of  their  federal
consolidated Tax Returns or Combined Tax Returns and accompanying Tax records or
Tax  information  that  directly  relates  to the  Company.  In any  event,  the
provisions  of  access  to  such  Tax  records  or  Tax  information  shall  not
unreasonably interfere with the business operations of the non-requesting Party.

     (l) All transfer,  documentary,  sales, use, stamp,  registration and other
similar  Taxes and fees  (including  any  penalties  and  interest)  incurred in
connection  with  the  Contemplated  Transactions  shall  be paid  by the  Party
incurring same.

10.2     INSURANCE

     Buyer  acknowledges that on the Closing Date,  effective as of the Closing,
all insurance  coverage and bonds (other than bonds  included in Seller's  Bonds
and Liability  Agreement and bonds covered by the  provisions of Section  10.12)
provided by Seller,  or any of its  Affiliates  other than the Company,  for the
Company  ("Seller  Provided  Insurance  and  Bonds"),  and all  certificates  of
insurance evidencing that the Company maintains any required insurance by virtue
of Seller Provided Insurance and Bonds, other than the three bonds identified in
Schedule  10.8(a)  under which the Company is  indicated  as  "Principal,"  will
terminate  and  Seller  will have the  right to keep any  unearned  premiums  in
connection with Seller Provided Insurance and Bonds. After Closing,  Seller will
cooperate  with Buyer and the Company to obtain for the Company the  benefits of
Seller  Provided  Insurance  and Bonds with respect to matters  arising prior to
Closing that are covered thereby, including, if so covered, claims asserted by a
third party against the Company that would have been  Pre-Closing Date Claims if
asserted on or before the first anniversary of the Closing Date.

10.3     PRE-CLOSING DATE CLAIMS

     (a) For the purpose of this Agreement, the term "Pre-Closing Date Liability
Claim" means any claim  asserted by a third party against the Company for damage
to person or property to the extent it arises out of events  occurring  prior to
the Closing Date.  Pre-Closing  Date Liability  Claims do not include (i) claims
which arise out of events  occurring on or after the Closing Date,  even if such
events result from the Company continuing to conduct business in the same manner
as prior to the Closing Date, (ii) claims related to violations of Environmental
Laws or based on release or the  threat of release of any  Hazardous  Substance,
unless the  existence of such claim  results in a Breach of the  representations
and  warranties in Section 3.19, or (iii) claims which are asserted  against the
Company after the first anniversary of the Closing Date.

                                       48
<PAGE>

     (b)  For  the  purpose  of  this  Agreement,  the  term  "Pre-Closing  Date
Litigation  Claim" means any claim asserted by a third party against the Company
for damage to person or property, including those set forth on Schedule 3.15(a),
and the threatened  litigation  described on Schedule  3.15(a) (even though such
threatened  litigation  does not involve  damage to person or  property),  which
arises out of events  occurring  prior to the Closing Date and which is asserted
prior to the Closing Date in any litigation  commenced against the Company prior
to the Closing Date or, with respect to the threatened  litigation  described on
Schedule  3.15(a),  which is asserted in any  litigation  commenced  against the
Company at any time.

     (c)  Pre-Closing  Date Liability  Claims and  Pre-Closing  Date  Litigation
Claims are  collectively  referred  to as  "Pre-Closing  Date  Claims."  Damages
resulting  from  Pre-Closing  Date Claims are  included  in the  indemnification
obligations of Seller set forth in Section 11.2 of this  Agreement.  Pre-Closing
Date Claims will be Third Party Claims subject to the provisions of Section 11.7
of this Agreement,  provided,  however,  that  notwithstanding  any provision of
Section 11.7 to the contrary, Seller shall have the absolute right to direct the
legal defense of, and to compromise or settle,  any such claim seeking only cash
payments and for which Seller provides a full and  unconditional  release of the
Company, on such terms as Seller deems appropriate, using such counsel as Seller
may choose and no party shall have a right to refuse to execute any  document or
to refuse to take any other act  necessary  or required in  connection  with the
settlement of a Pre-Closing  Date Claim seeking only cash payments and for which
Seller  provides  a full and  unconditional  release  of the  Company,  provided
further that Seller shall be responsible for the reasonable expenses, if any, of
executing any document necessary or required in connection with such settlement.
Pre-Closing  Date Claims made seeking  damages  other than cash  payments or for
which Seller does not provide a full and  unconditional  release of the Company,
will be governed by the provisions of Section 11.7 hereof.

     (d) If, and to the extent that,  the Company has a claim  against any third
party which arises out of or which  directly  relates to events giving rise to a
Pre-Closing Date Claim (in all cases, a "Company Claim"),  Buyer shall cause the
Company both to transfer to Seller on a timely basis all rights  related to such
Company Claim, other than rights with respect to a Company Claim for amounts due
to the Company with respect to operations  during the  Adjustment  Period,  such
that to the  extent  possible  Seller  is able to make  demand  upon the  proper
parties based on such claim, and to cooperate with Seller in Seller's efforts to
make recovery on such claim;  provided  that any costs and  expenses,  including
attorneys  fees and  expenses,  incurred by the Company in  connection  herewith
shall be paid by Seller.  On request of Seller,  Buyer will,  and will cause the
Company  to,  instruct  and  direct  any  counsel  representing  the  Company in
connection with any Pre-Closing Date Claim that seeks only cash payments and for
which Seller provides a full and unconditional release of the Company or Company
Claim to comply  with  Seller's  directions  regarding  the  prosecution,  legal
defense,  compromise or settlement of any such Pre-Closing Date Claim or Company
Claim.  Other than rights with respect to a Company Claim for amounts due to the
Company with respect to operations  during the Adjustment  Period,  Seller shall
retain control of all Seller  Provided  Insurance and Bonds  providing  coverage
with respect to such  Pre-Closing  Date Claims and Company  Claims,  and will be
entitled  to receive and retain all amounts  paid  pursuant to said  policies or
bonds with respect to such  Pre-Closing  Date Claims or Company  Claims.  Seller
will be entitled to retain all damages  recovered  in  connection  with  Company
Claims,  other  than  rights  with  respect to a Company  Claim with  respect to
amounts due to the Company for operations during the Adjustment Period.

                                       49
<PAGE>

10.4     EMPLOYEES

     Seller  will have the right,  on or before the Closing  Date,  to cause the
Affiliate of Seller which  employs the  individuals  named on Schedule 3.20 (the
"Schedule  3.20  Employees")  to terminate the  employment of some or all of the
Schedule 3.20 Employees.  Such  termination  will not cause the Company to incur
any severance  obligations to the Schedule 3.20  Employees.  Buyer  acknowledges
that if not terminated prior to Closing,  all Schedule 3.20 Employees except for
the employees  designated "Retained Employees" on Schedule 3.20, if any, will be
terminated as of the Closing Date.  Notwithstanding Buyer's agreements set forth
in Section  12.3(g) below,  Buyer may solicit any of the Schedule 3.20 Employees
except for the Retained  Employees  for  employment  to commence  following  the
Closing.  Any  and all  obligations  or  liabilities  (including  any  severance
obligations)  arising in connection  with the  termination  of employment of any
Schedule  3.20  Employee  by Seller or any  Affiliate  of Seller  shall be borne
solely by Seller or an Affiliate of Seller.

10.5     COMPANY FILES

     In addition to the books and records covered by Section 3.5,  certain other
files  relating to the Interests or the operation of the Company are  maintained
by Seller at Seller's  place of  business.  All such files either will be in the
possession  of the  Company at the Closing or will be  delivered  to the Company
promptly after the Closing.

10.6     DISPUTE RESOLUTION

     (a) The  Parties  will  attempt  in  good  faith  to  resolve  promptly  by
negotiation  any and all  controversies  and disputes  arising under,  out of or
relating  to  this  Agreement  or  the  Contemplated  Transactions,  other  than
controversies or disputes arising out of a Party's  fraudulent acts or omissions
or willful  misconduct (a "Dispute").  If such negotiation has not resulted in a
resolution of such Dispute within 30 days of the receipt by a Party of a written
notification  by the other Party of a Dispute,  such  Dispute will be settled by
final and binding  arbitration in accordance  with the procedures and conditions
set forth herein,  which may be initiated by either Party  following such 30-day
period in accordance with Section 10.6(d).

     (b)  Except  as   modified   herein,   the  Federal   Arbitration   Act,  9
U.S.C.ss.ss.1, et seq., will apply to any arbitration hereunder.

     (c) Any  arbitration  proceedings  hereunder  will be  conducted in Dallas,
Texas.  The  arbitration  will  be  administered  by the  AAA,  pursuant  to the
then-prevailing  Commercial  Arbitration  Rules  (the  "Rules"),  subject to the
limitations and modifications set forth herein.

     (d) Notice of a demand for  arbitration (a "Notice to  Arbitrate")  must be
accompanied by a short and plain statement of the Party's claim(s),  the grounds
for same and the relief sought and,  unless the Parties have already agreed upon
a single  Arbitrator to conduct the  arbitration,  shall appoint one Arbitrator.

Within 30 days of receipt  of a Notice to  Arbitrate,  the other  Party must set
forth in writing and deliver to the Party who gave such Notice to  Arbitrate  an
answer  setting  forth its  response  to the claim  for  relief,  as well as any
affirmative  defenses  and  counterclaims  and,  unless the Parties have already
agreed upon a single  Arbitrator,  shall appoint one Arbitrator.  If the Parties
agree upon a single  Arbitrator,  then the date of the other Party's answer will
be the date of the appointment of the Tribunal.

     (e) The  arbitration  will be  before  a panel  (the  "Tribunal")  of three
neutral arbitrators (each, an "Arbitrator").  If the Parties agree upon a single
Arbitrator to conduct the  arbitration,  references  herein to the Tribunal mean
such single Arbitrator. If the Parties have not agreed upon a single Arbitrator,
each Party shall  appoint one  Arbitrator  as provided in Section  10.6(d).  The
third Arbitrator shall be appointed jointly by the first two Arbitrators. If the
Arbitrators appointed by the Parties cannot agree upon a third Arbitrator within
30 business days from their  appointment,  the third Arbitrator will be selected
by the AAA in accordance with the Rules.

     (f)  Neither  Party  will  have  the  right to ex  parte  contact  with the
Tribunal.  The Tribunal is only  authorized  to, and only has the consent of the
Parties to,  interpret and apply the terms and  conditions of this  Agreement in
accordance  with the governing  law. The Tribunal is not authorized to and shall
not add to, detract from or modify any term or condition of this  Agreement,  or
deprive either Party of any right or remedy expressly provided hereunder. In the
event that the Arbitrator  exceeds his or her authority under this Agreement and
violates  its  provisions,  either  Party  may  petition  a court  of  competent
jurisdiction to vacate the Arbitration  Award on the grounds that the Arbitrator
exceeded his or her authority.  The court shall make its determination  based on
the record  from the  arbitration,  affidavits  submitted  by the  Parties,  and
briefing submitted by the Parties. In any event, the Parties expressly waive any
right to a jury trial and stipulate that any  designated  issues will be decided
by the court without a jury.

     (g) It will be the  responsibility  of each Party to timely comply with the
AAA's  requests for payment of the  Tribunal's  fees. Any Tribunal fees that are
due prior to the  issuance  of an  Arbitration  Award  shall be  evenly  divided
between the Parties. Any Party who has not complied with any such request within
30 calendar  days  thereof will be deemed in default of this  Agreement  and the
Tribunal may enter a default judgment against such Party on the merits.

     (h) The  Parties  will have the right to conduct  and  enforce  pre-hearing
discovery in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure then in effect
for the Northern District of Texas, including any Local Rules (collectively, the
"Court Rules"), subject to the following:

          (i) The Parties will make the voluntary  disclosures  described in the
     Court Rules (except those  applicable to expert  witnesses)  within 30 days
     after the  appointment  of the  Tribunal.  The Tribunal  shall  establish a
     deadline for disclosure of the identity and report of each expert  witness,
     as well as all other disclosures described in the Court Rules.

          (ii) Each Party may serve a request for  production  of  tangible  and
     documentary evidence.  Responses to a request for production will be due 30
     days after receipt.

                                       51
<PAGE>

          (iii)  Each  Party may  serve no more than one set of  interrogatories
     limited  to no more  than 30  questions,  including  subparts.  Answers  to
     interrogatories will be due 30 days after receipt.

          (iv) Each Party may depose expert and fact witnesses.

          (v) The Tribunal  will have the right and  authority to decide any and
     all discovery  disputes.  The Tribunal will be empowered to issue subpoenas
     and any and all  process  and  orders  permitted  under the Rules to compel
     cooperation in the discovery and otherwise enforce the discovery rights and
     obligations of the Parties.

     (i) The Tribunal  will issue and deliver to each Party a written and signed
award (the  "Arbitration  Award") after the conclusion of the hearing before the
Tribunal  provided in this Section 10.6. The Arbitration  Award will contain the
factual and legal basis for such award. The Arbitration  Award will, in addition
to the relief granted therein, award attorneys' fees and costs to the prevailing
Party as the Arbitrator may determine in light of all of the circumstances.  The
term "costs"  includes  court costs,  the fees of the  Tribunal,  administrative
fees,  travel  expenses  and  out-of-pocket  expenses  such as copying  charges,
telephone  expenses  and witness  fees  (including  expert  witness  fees),  and
reasonable  internal  costs.  The  Arbitration  Award will be  binding  upon the
Parties in  accordance  with its terms  provided that the  Arbitration  Award is
rendered, and the Arbitration  proceedings are conducted, in accordance with the
terms and provisions of this Agreement.

     (j) The  Arbitration  Award  may be  enforced  by any  court  of  competent
jurisdiction.

10.7     SEISMIC DATA

     The Company does not own or license any seismic data.  Another Affiliate of
Seller owns  licenses for certain  seismic  data as set forth on Schedule  10.7,
which is the seismic data that is used by the Company.  Effective  upon Closing,
the Company will no longer have access to or the right to use such seismic data.
After Closing,  Buyer and the Company will be responsible to obtain such seismic
data or licenses as they may choose.

10.8     BUYER'S MMS AND STATE REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS

     (a) In addition to its representations and warranties set out in Article 4,

execute any and all guarantees and indemnity agreements, provide all evidence of
financial  responsibility  and  make  any and all  filings,  registrations,  and
recordings  with the MMS,  the  states  of Texas  and  Louisiana,  and all other
Governmental  Bodies necessary to permit the termination and cancellation of any
and all liability and  obligations  of Seller with respect to Seller's Bonds and
Liability Agreements (collectively,  "MMS Cancellation").  Buyer shall expressly
agree in all filings with MMS and all other  Governmental  Bodies, to the extent
such filings  permit such an  agreement,  to assume any and all  obligations  of
Seller relating to the Interests  (collectively,  "MMS Obligations"),  provided,
however, that Buyer's assumption of the MMS Obligations will not limit any right
Buyer  otherwise has to be  indemnified  by Seller for Claims arising out of the
MMS Obligations prior to the Closing Date or for a Breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant of Seller herein.

     (c) Buyer  will,  and will cause each of its Related  Parties to,  promptly
after the Closing, take all actions required by the MMS, the states of Louisiana
and  Texas,  and any  other  Governmental  Bodies  to  obtain  the MMS and State

10.9     CHANGE OF THE COMPANY'S NAME; USE OF SELLER'S NAME

     Upon Seller's  receipt of MMS' written  notice of MMS  Cancellation,  Buyer
shall  promptly  cause  the  Company's  name to be  changed  so that it does not
contain the word "Denbury" or words  deceptively  similar thereto or derivations
or abbreviations  thereof.  As soon as practicable after MMS Cancellation but in
any event no later  than  thirty  days  after the date of the MMS  Cancellation,
Buyer  will  notify  all third  parties  with whom the  Company  regularly  does
business or with whom the Company has written  agreements,  including parties to
the Company Basic  Documents  identified on Schedule 3.9(d) or any other part of
Schedule  3.9,  of the  change  in the  name  of the  Company.  Also  as soon as
practicable after MMS  Cancellation,  but in any event no later than ninety days
after the date of the MMS Cancellation, Buyer will remove or cause to be removed

audited and  accompanied  by the signed  audit  report of  Seller's  independent
public  accountants and shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP,  consistently
applied and in accordance  with the rules and  regulations of the SEC,  provided
that Buyer shall first request a waiver or similar exception from the SEC of the
financial  statement  requirements  of Section 3-05 of Regulation S-X that would
permit  Buyer to provide  in its  filings  with the SEC only an audited  balance
sheet of the Company and a statement of revenues and direct  operating  expenses
of the  Interests as of the same date and for the same  periods.  In  connection
therewith,  Seller shall use its commercially  reasonable  efforts to obtain and

customarily provided in connection with the audit of financial statements. Buyer

sureties,  or plugging bonds which have been tendered by Seller,  its Affiliates
or the Company to various third  parties to secure  performance  by Seller,  its
Affiliates  or the Company under  agreements  with those third  parties,  all as
listed on Schedule 10.12. Such substituted bonds and guarantees will be in forms
that are satisfactory to the third parties that are  beneficiaries of such bonds
and  guarantees,  and Buyer will use  commercially  reasonable  efforts to cause
Seller to be released within 90 days after the Closing, or as soon thereafter as
practicable,  from all such bonds and guarantees  listed on Schedule  10.12.  As
soon as such  release is  obtained,  Buyer will  provide  Seller with  evidence,

bonds and guarantees.

10.13    RETAINED CLAIMS

execute and deliver to Seller such documents as Seller may  reasonably  request,
and (ii) Seller will  execute and deliver to Buyer such  documents  as Buyer may
reasonable  request,  to evidence or effect Seller's  assumption of such claims,
provided  that no  warranty,  express or implied  shall be given with respect to

to enforce or collect  such  claims in the name of the Company and to retain all
proceeds of such enforcement or collection. Buyer will cooperate, and will cause
the Company to  cooperate,  with  Seller as  reasonably  requested  by Seller in

venture audit of Buyer's records  relating to revenue and expenses  attributable
to  operations  and  activities  conducted on High Island A-521 and West Cameron
427/426 (the "Audit  Properties").  Buyer previously has paid to Seller $500,000
as an  advance  payment  toward  any  final  audit  exceptions.  As  part of the
adjustment of the Purchase  Price through the  Settlement  Adjustment set out in
Section  2.5(b)(iii),  the Purchase Price will be reduced by $100,000 as part of
the settlement of the joint venture audit, and otherwise Seller shall retain the
balance of such advance payment as final and complete  satisfaction of any audit
exceptions which have or may be found with respect to the Audit Properties,  and
Seller hereby  releases Buyer and Buyer hereby  releases Seller from any further
liabilities with respect to any audit claims or exceptions they have or may have
against each other with respect to such Audit Properties.  Seller further hereby
agrees to  indemnify  Buyer and hold Buyer  harmless  from and against any joint
venture audit claims by third parties owning an interest in the Audit Properties

for under the provisions of Article 11) of any nature incurred due to any Breach
of, or otherwise in connection with, this Agreement,  whether in connection with
Damages for which a Party is indemnified  under the provisions of Article 11, or
otherwise.

Contract  that  has not  been  transferred  to  Buyer  in  accordance  with  the
provisions  set forth above.  Any such  transaction  shall be made in accordance

provide timely notice to Seller of any such transaction and Buyer shall have the
right to approve each such  transaction;  provided,  that Buyer shall reasonably
accommodate Seller and Seller's counterparties' timing and availability.  Seller

the tenth  business day following  the Closing Date,  Seller may cause the early
termination  in  the  open  market  of any  Swap  Contract  that  has  not  been
transferred  to Buyer or retired prior to such date.  Within three business days
after the early  termination of any Swap Contract by Seller or the settlement of
any Swap Contract  pursuant to their terms  following  Closing but before either

11.7     PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATION--THIRD PARTY CLAIMS

     (a) Promptly  after receipt by a Person  indemnified  under Section 11.2 or
11.3 (in either case, an "Indemnified  Party") of notice of the  commencement of
any  Proceeding  against  it by a third  party (a  "Third  Party  Claim"),  such
Indemnified  Party will,  if a claim is to be made against a Person  required to
provide  indemnification  under  Section  11.2  or  11.3  (in  either  case,  an
"Indemnifying Party"), give notice to the Indemnifying Party of the commencement
of such Third Party Claim, but the failure to notify the Indemnifying Party will
not  relieve the  Indemnifying  Party of any  liability  that it may have to any
Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates
that the  defense of such Third  Party Claim is  prejudiced  by the  Indemnified
Party's failure to give such notice.

     (b) If any Third Party Claim is brought against an Indemnified Party and it
gives notice to the  Indemnifying  Party of the commencement of such Third Party
Claim,  the  Indemnifying  Party will be entitled to  participate  in such Third
Party Claim and, to the extent that it wishes (unless (i) the Indemnifying Party
is also a party to such Third Party Claim and the Indemnified  Party  determines
in good faith that a  reasonable  likelihood  exists of a conflict  of  interest
between the Indemnifying  Party and the Indemnified  Party, (ii) the Third Party
Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified  Party, or
(iii) the  Indemnifying  Party  fails to  provide  reasonable  assurance  to the


                                       62
<PAGE>

Indemnified Party of its financial capacity to defend such Third Party Claim and
provide  indemnification  with respect to such Third Party Claim), to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim with counsel  satisfactory  to the Indemnified
Party and, after notice from the Indemnifying  Party to the Indemnified Party of
its election to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim,  the  Indemnifying
Party will not, as long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the
Indemnified  Party  under this  Article 11 for any fees of other  counsel or any
other  expenses  with respect to the defense of such Third Party Claim,  in each
case  subsequently  incurred by the  Indemnified  Party in  connection  with the
defense of such Third Party Claim, other than reasonable costs of investigation;
provided,  that the  Indemnifying  Party shall be  responsible  for the fees and
expenses of such separate co-counsel if the Indemnified Party shall determine in
good  faith  that  (i)  an  actual  or  potential  conflict  of  interest  makes
representation  by the same counsel or the counsel  selected by the Indemnifying
Party inappropriate, or (ii) there is one or more legal defenses available to it
that are different  from or additional  to those  available to the  Indemnifying
Party. If Seller is the Indemnifying Party and it assumes the defense of a Third
Party Claim,  Seller will have control of all decisions  and actions  related to
insurance  providing  coverage  with respect to such Third Party  Claim.  If the
Indemnifying  Party  assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim,  (i) it will be
conclusively  established for purposes of this Agreement that the claims made in
that Third Party  Claim are within the scope of and subject to  indemnification;
(ii)  no  compromise  or  settlement  of  such  claims  may be  effected  by the
Indemnifying  Party without the Indemnified  Party's consent unless (A) there is
no finding or admission of any violation of Legal  Requirements or any violation
of the rights of any Person and no effect on any other  claims  that may be made
against the  Indemnified  Party,  and (B) the sole  relief  provided is monetary
damages  that  are  paid  in full  by the  Indemnifying  Party;  and  (iii)  the
Indemnified  Party will have no  liability  with respect to such  compromise  or
settlement.  If notice is given to an Indemnifying  Party of the commencement of
any Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party does not, within ten days after
the Indemnified Party's notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Party of
its election to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim,  the  Indemnifying
Party will be bound by any  determination  made in such Third Party Claim or any
compromise or settlement effected by the Indemnified Party.

     (c)  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  if an Indemnified Party determines in
good faith that there is a reasonable  probability  that a Third Party Claim may
adversely affect it or its Affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages
for which it would be  entitled to  indemnification  under this  Agreement,  the
Indemnified Party may, by notice to the Indemnifying Party, assume the exclusive
right  to  defend,  compromise,  or  settle  such  Third  Party  Claim,  but the
Indemnifying Party will not be bound by any determination of a Third Party Claim
so defended,  or any  compromise  or  settlement  effected,  without its consent
(which may not be unreasonably withheld).

11.8     PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATION--OTHER CLAIMS

     A claim for  indemnification  for any matter not  involving  a Third  Party
Claim  may be  asserted  by notice to the  Party  from whom  indemnification  is
sought.

11.9     EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE

     THE  INDEMNITIES  SET FORTH IN THIS ARTICLE 11 SHALL APPLY  NOTWITHSTANDING
ANY STATE'S  "EXPRESS  NEGLIGENCE RULE" OR SIMILAR RULE THAT WOULD DENY COVERAGE
BASED  ON  AN  INDEMNIFIED  PERSON'S  SOLE  OR  CONCURRENT,  ACTIVE  OR  PASSIVE
NEGLIGENCE  OR GROSS  NEGLIGENCE.  IT IS THE INTENT OF THE PARTIES  THAT, TO THE
EXTENT PROVIDED ABOVE, THE INDEMNITIES SET FOR IN THIS ARTICLE 11 SHALL APPLY TO
AN  INDEMNIFIED  PERSON'S SOLE OR  CONCURRENT,  ACTIVE OR PASSIVE  NEGLIGENCE OR
GROSS NEGLIGENCE, OR STRICT LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS UNDER CERCLA. THE PARTIES AGREE
THAT THIS PROVISION IS "CONSPICUOUS" FOR PURPOSES OF ALL STATE LAWS.

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

12.1     EXPENSES

     Except as otherwise  expressly  provided in this  Agreement,  each Party to
this Agreement will bear its respective expenses incurred in connection with the
preparation,  execution,  and performance of this Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions,  including  all  fees and  expenses  of  agents,  representatives,
counsel,  and  accountants.  Seller  will cause the  Company  not to incur or be
liable  for any  out-of-pocket  expenses  in  connection  with  this  Agreement,
including  severance and other  employee  costs.  In the event of termination of
this  Agreement,  the  obligation  of each Party to pay its own expenses will be
subject to any rights of such Party  arising from a Breach of this  Agreement by
the other Party.

12.2     PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS

     Except as otherwise required by any applicable Legal Requirement, including
the rules of any  stock  exchange  on which  either  Buyer or Seller is  listed,
neither Buyer nor Seller nor any of their respective  Related Persons will issue
or cause the  publication  of any press  release  or other  public  announcement
about,  or otherwise  make any public  statement  concerning,  the  Contemplated
Transactions  without the consent of the other Party,  which  consent may not be
unreasonably  withheld.  Further,  prior to any  disclosure  as  required by any
applicable  Legal  Requirement,  including the rules of a stock  exchange,  such
required  Party will provide the other Party a reasonable  opportunity to review
and  comment  on the  form  of the  disclosure  and  such  required  Party  will
incorporate  any  reasonably  requested  changes  to  such  disclosure,  if  the
requested  changes  would  not (a) cause a  violation  of any  applicable  Legal
Requirement,  including the rules of a stock  exchange,  or (b) be  inconsistent
with that Party's prior practices on similar disclosures.

12.3     CONFIDENTIALITY, NO SOLICITATION, NO TRADE

     (a) Each Party agrees that all Confidential  Information (as defined below)
received  by  a  Party  (the  "Receiving  Party")  from  the  other  Party  (the
"Disclosing  Party",  and which term,  when Buyer is the Receiving  Party,  will
include  Seller,  the  Company  and  Seller's  other  Affiliates)  will  be kept
confidential  by the  Receiving  Party,  will not be disclosed by the  Receiving
Party in any manner  whatsoever,  and will not be used by the Receiving Party in
any way  whatsoever,  including  in any way that is  directly or  indirectly  in
competition  with or  detrimental  to the  Disclosing  Party  or for  any  other
purpose,  other than in connection  with the  evaluation or  negotiation  of the
Contemplated  Transactions,  except that (i) any of the Confidential Information
may be disclosed to the  Receiving  Party's  Representatives  for the purpose of
evaluating   the   Contemplated    Transactions   if   the   Receiving   Party's
Representatives  are informed by the Receiving Party of the confidential  nature
of the  information  and are required to treat the  information  confidentially,
(ii) any disclosure of  Confidential  Information  may be made if the Disclosing
Party consents to the disclosure in writing, (iii) Confidential  Information may
be  disclosed  by  the  Receiving   Party  or  any  of  the  Receiving   Party's
Representatives  to the extent that, in the opinion of counsel for the Receiving
Party or its  Representatives,  they are legally compelled to do so, if prior to
making  such  disclosure,  the party being  legally  compelled  to disclose  the
information  advises  and  consults  with the  Disclosing  Party  regarding  the
disclosure  and the party being  legally  compelled to disclose the  information
discloses  only that  portion  of the  Confidential  Information  as is  legally
required, and (iv) any Confidential Information may be disclosed to any banks or
other  financial  institutions or other  prospective  investors that may provide
financing to the Receiving Party if such banks or other  financial  institutions
or other  prospective  investors  agree to comply  with the  provisions  of this
Section 12.3.  Seller agrees that Buyer or the Company shall have the benefit of
and shall be entitled to enforce any confidentiality  agreements entered into by
the Seller with  respect to  information  about or related to the Company or the
Interests and Seller will take such action as  reasonably  requested by Buyer or
the  Company  to enforce  such  agreements,  at the  expense of the Buyer or the
Company.

     (b) When Buyer is the Receiving Party, the term "Confidential  Information"
means all  information  disclosed  to Buyer by Seller,  the  Company,  or any of
Seller's other Affiliates  (irrespective of the form of communication)  about or
related to Seller,  the  Interests  or the  Company,  or any of  Seller's  other
Affiliates, including all "Evaluation Material" disclosed to Buyer, as such term
is defined in the letter  agreement  entered into between Buyer and Seller dated
April 8, 2004 (the "Confidentiality  Letter Agreement"),  other than information
which (i) was or  becomes  generally  available  to the  public  other than as a
result of  disclosure by the  Receiving  Party or any of the  Receiving  Party's
Representatives,  (ii) was or  becomes  available  to the  Receiving  Party on a
nonconfidential  basis  prior  to  disclosure  to  the  Receiving  Party  or its
Representatives,  (iii) was or becomes  available to the Receiving  Party from a
source other than the Disclosing Party or its  Representatives  if the source is
not known by the Receiving Party to be prohibited from making such disclosure by
a confidentiality  agreement with the Disclosing Party, or (iv) was available to
the Receiving  Party under any joint  operating  agreement or other agreement to
which the Company and the Receiving  Party are both parties.  After the Closing,
when Buyer is the Receiving  Party,  the term  "Confidential  Information"  only
means  information  (irrespective of the form of communication) to the extent it
is about or  related  to Seller or any of  Seller's  Affiliates  other  than the
Company, and will no longer include information about or related to the Company.

                                       65
<PAGE>

     (c) When Seller is the Receiving Party, the term "Confidential Information"
means all information  disclosed to Seller by Buyer (irrespective of the form of
communication)  about or related to Buyer,  other than information which (i) was
or  becomes  generally  available  to the  public  other  than  as a  result  of
disclosure by the Receiving Party or any Receiving Party's Representative,  (ii)
was or becomes available to the Receiving Party on a nonconfidential basis prior
to  disclosure  to the  Receiving  Party or its  Representatives,  (iii)  was or
becomes available to the Receiving Party from a source other than the Disclosing
Party or its  Representatives;  provided  that  such  source is not known by the
Receiving Party to be bound by a  confidentiality  agreement with the Disclosing
Party,  or (iv) was available to the Receiving  Party under any joint  operating
agreement  or other  agreement to which Buyer and the  Receiving  Party are both
parties.  After the  Closing,  when  Seller  is the  Receiving  Party,  the term
"Confidential  Information"  also means all information to the extent that it is
about or relates to the Company or the  Interests and that is known to Seller on
the Closing Date,  other than  information  which Seller must use or disclose in
connection with a Tax Return,  in order to comply with a Legal  Requirement,  or
for other legitimate purposes.

     (d) If this  Agreement is terminated,  each  Receiving  Party will promptly
return, and will use their Best Efforts to cause all of their Representatives to
promptly return,  all  Confidential  Information to the Disclosing Party without
retaining any copies,  except that such portion of the Confidential  Information
as  consists  of  notes,  compilations,  analyses,  reports,  studies,  or other
documents   prepared  by  the   Receiving   Party  or  the   Receiving   Party's
Representatives will be destroyed.

     (e) Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies  available to a Party
under this  Agreement,  each Party  acknowledges  and agrees that money  damages
would not be an adequate remedy for any Breach of the provisions of this Section
12.3 and that the  nonbreaching  Party shall also be entitled to the remedies of
injunction,  specific  performance and other equitable relief for any threatened
or actual Breach of this Section 12.3.

     (f) Subject to the following  sentence,  this Section 12.3  supersedes  the
Confidentiality Letter Agreement. The Confidentiality Letter Agreement is hereby
terminated,  except  that any cause of action for breach of the  Confidentiality
Letter  Agreement will survive the  termination for the period of the applicable
statute of limitations for the cause of action.

     (g) Buyer agrees that,  except as  permitted by Section  10.4,  without the
prior  consent of Seller,  Buyer will not for a period of one year from the date
of this Agreement,  directly or indirectly  solicit for employment any person to
whom the Buyer was  introduced  or of whom the Buyer  became  aware  through the
negotiation of this Agreement or consummation of the  Contemplated  Transactions
and who is now  employed by Seller or any of its  Subsidiaries  or the  Company;
provided that soliciting  shall not include the  solicitation of any such person
by general advertising, such as in a newspaper,  periodical, trade journal or by
posting of a position on the internet.

                                       66
<PAGE>

     (h) Buyer agrees that if this  Agreement is terminated  then until one year
after Buyer  complies  with the  requirements  of Section 12.3 (d) above,  or if
Closing  occurs  then until one year after  Closing,  Buyer will not without the
prior  approval  of the Board of  Directors  of Seller  (i)  acquire or make any
proposal to acquire any securities or property of Seller,  (ii) propose to enter
into any merger or business combination  involving Seller or purchase a material
portion of the assets of Seller,  (iii) make or participate in any  solicitation
of proxies to vote,  or seek to advise or  influence  any person with respect to
the voting of any  securities of Seller,  (iv) form,  join or  participate  in a
"group"  (within  the  meaning of Section  13(d)(3)  of the  Exchange  Act) with
respect to any voting securities of Seller, (v) otherwise act or seek to control
or influence  the  management,  Board of  Directors or policies of Seller,  (vi)
disclose any intention,  plan or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing, or
(vii) take any action which might require  Seller to make a public  announcement
regarding  the  possibility  of a  business  combination  or  merger.  Except as
provided  above,  Buyer also agrees during such period not to request Seller (or
its directors,  officers,  employees,  affiliates or advisors) to amend or waive
any provision of this Section 12.3 (h).

12.4     NOTICES

     All  notices,  consents,  waivers,  and  other  communications  under  this
Agreement  must be in  writing  and will be deemed to have been duly  given when

12.5     JURISDICTION; SERVICE OF PROCESS

     Any action or  proceeding  seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on
any right  arising  out of,  this  Agreement  may be brought  against any of the
Parties in the courts of the State of Texas,  County of Collin, or, if it has or
can acquire  jurisdiction,  in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Texas.  Each of the Parties  consents  to the  jurisdiction  of such
courts  (and  of the  appropriate  appellate  courts)  in  any  such  action  or
proceeding  and waives any  objection  to venue  laid  therein,  and each of the
Parties  waives  the right to a jury  trial in any such  action  or  proceeding.
Process in any action or proceeding referred to in this section may be served on
any party anywhere in the world.

documents referred to in this Agreement.

12.7     WAIVER

     The rights and remedies of the Parties to this Agreement are cumulative and
not  alternative.  Neither the failure nor any delay by any Party in  exercising
any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement or the documents referred to
in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right,  power,  or privilege,
and no single or partial  exercise of any such right,  power,  or privilege will
preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power, or privilege or the
exercise  of any  other  right,  power,  or  privilege.  To the  maximum  extent

                                       68

permitted by applicable law, (a) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement
or the documents  referred to in this  Agreement can be discharged by one party,
in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in
writing  signed by the other  Party;  (b) no waiver that may be given by a Party
will be applicable  except in the specific  instance for which it is given;  and
(c) no notice  to or  demand  on one Party  will be deemed to be a waiver of any
obligation  of such  Party or of the right of the Party  giving  such  notice or
demand to take  further  action  without  notice or demand as  provided  in this
Agreement or the other  agreements and documents to be entered into or delivered
in connection with this Agreement.

12.8     ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND MODIFICATION

     This Agreement and the Confidentiality  Letter Agreement (to the extent not
terminated)  supersede all prior agreements  between the Parties with respect to
their subject  matter and  constitute  (along with the documents  referred to in
this Agreement) a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement
between the Parties with respect to their subject matter. This Agreement may not
be amended except by a written agreement executed by the Parties.

12.9     ASSIGNMENTS, SUCCESSORS, AND NO THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS

     Neither Party may assign any of its rights under this Agreement without the
prior  consent of the other Party except that Buyer may assign any of its rights
under  this  Agreement  to any  Affiliate  of  Buyer  so long as  Buyer  remains
obligated on this Agreement.  Subject to the preceding sentence,  this Agreement
will apply to, be binding in all respects  upon, and inure to the benefit of the
successors and permitted  assigns of the Parties.  Nothing expressed or referred
to in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than the Parties
to this Agreement any legal or equitable right,  remedy,  or claim under or with
respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement. This Agreement and
all of its provisions  and conditions are for the sole and exclusive  benefit of
the Parties to this Agreement and their successors and assigns.

12.10    SEVERABILITY

     If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or  unenforceable by any
court of competent  jurisdiction,  the other  provisions of this  Agreement will
remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this Agreement held invalid or
unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in full force and effect to the
extent not held invalid or unenforceable.
