                  divest (or not to acquire) assets with a value in excess of
                  (pound)20 million or, in the case of behavioural commitments,
                  would amount to a more than immaterial change in the terms
                  upon which either the Purchaser's Group or the Group Companies
                  do business.

                  the Base Working Capital Amount, and the consideration payable
                  for the Shares shall be decreased by the amount by which the
                  Closing Working Capital Amount is less than the Base Working
                  Capital Amount. Accordingly, within five Business Days after
                  the Working Capital Statement becomes binding pursuant to
                  paragraph 2 of Part 1 of Schedule 4:

                  (i)      if the Final Working Capital Adjustment Amount is
                           greater than the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment
                           Amount, then the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller by
                           wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
                           Seller's Nominated Account an amount equal to the
                           difference between the Estimated Working Capital
                           Adjustment Amount and the Final Working Capital
                           Adjustment Amount, together with an amount thereon
                           calculated by reference to the PPA Interest Rate from
                           and including the Closing Date to but not including
                           the date of such payment; and

                  (ii)     if the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount is
                           greater than the Closing Working Capital Amount, then
                           the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser by wire
                           transfer of immediately available funds to the
                           Purchaser's Nominated Account an amount equal to the
                           difference between the Estimated Working Capital
                           Adjustment Amount and the Final Working Capital
                           Adjustment Amount, together with an amount thereon
                           calculated by reference to the PPA Interest Rate from
                           and including the Closing Date to but not including
                           the date of such payment.

         7.3.2    The consideration paid pursuant to Clause 6.4 shall be
                  increased by the amount by which the Final Closing Cash Amount
                  exceeds the Estimated Closing Cash Amount, and the
                  consideration paid pursuant to Clause 6.4 shall be decreased
                  by the amount by which the Final Closing Cash Amount is less
                  than the Estimated Closing Cash Amount. Accordingly, within
                  five Business Days after the Cash Amount Statement becomes
                  binding pursuant to paragraph 2 of Part 1 of Schedule 4:

                  (i)      if the Final Closing Cash Amount is greater than the
                           Estimated Closing Cash Amount, then the Purchaser
                           shall pay to the Seller by wire transfer of
                           immediately available funds to the Seller's Nominated
                           Account an amount equal to the Final Closing Cash
                           Adjustment Amount, together with an amount thereon
                           calculated by reference to the PPA Interest Rate from
                           and including the Closing Date to but not including
                           the date of such payment; and

                           Estimated Closing Cash Amount, then the Seller shall
                           pay to the Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately
                           available funds to the Purchaser's Nominated Account
                           an amount, equal to the Final Closing Cash Adjustment
                           Amount, together with an amount thereon calculated by
                           reference to the PPA Interest Rate from and including
                           the Closing Date to but not including the date of
                           such payment

         7.3.3    The consideration paid pursuant to Clause 6.4 shall be
                  increased by the amount by which the Estimated Cash Deferred
                  Income Amount exceeds the Final Cash Deferred Income Amount,
                  and the consideration paid pursuant to Clause 6.4 shall be
                  decreased by the amount by which the Estimated Cash Deferred
                  Income Amount is less than the Final Cash Deferred Income
                  Amount. Accordingly, within five Business Days after the Cash
                  Deferred Income Amount Statement becomes binding pursuant to
                  paragraph 2 of Part 1 of Schedule 4:

                  (i)      if the Estimated Cash Deferred Income Amount is
                           greater than the Final Cash Deferred Income Amount,
                           then the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller by wire
                           transfer of immediately available funds to the
                           Seller's Nominated Account an amount equal to the
                           Final Cash Deferred Income Adjustment Amount,
                           together with an amount thereon calculated by
                           reference to the PPA Interest Rate from and including
                           the Closing Date to but not including the date of
                           such payment; and

                  (ii)     if the Final Cash Deferred Income Amount is greater
                           than the Estimated Cash Deferred Income Amount, then
                           the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser by wire
                           transfer of immediately available funds to the
                           Purchaser's Nominated Account an amount equal to the
                           Final Cash Deferred Income Adjustment Amount,
                           together with an amount thereon calculated by
                           reference to the PPA Interest Rate from and including
                           the Closing Date to but not including the date of
                           such payment.

         7.3.4    If the Final Cash Deferred Income Amount is less than either
                  (i)(pound)27,900,000 (twenty seven million, nine hundred
                  thousand pounds Sterling) (if Closing occurs on or prior to 31
                  August 2004, representing the forecast Cash Deferred Income at
                  such date); or (ii)(pound)23,900,000 (twenty three million,
                  nine hundred thousand pounds Sterling) (if Closing occurs on
                  or prior to 30 September 2004 but after 31 August 2004,
                  representing the forecast Cash Deferred Income at such date)
                  then the Final Working Capital Adjustment Amount shall be
                  increased by the difference between the Final Cash Deferred
                  Income Amount (at such date) and either (i)(pound)27,900,000
                  (twenty seven million, nine hundred thousand pounds Sterling)
                  (if Closing occurs on or prior to 31 August 2004); or
                  (ii)(pound)23,900,000 (twenty three million, nine hundred
                  thousand pounds Sterling) (if Closing occurs on or prior to 30
                  September 2004 but after 31 August 2004).

                  For the avoidance of doubt, if the Final Cash Deferred Income
                  Amount is either greater than (i) (pound)27,900,000 (twenty
                  seven million, nine hundred thousand pounds Sterling) (if
                  Closing occurs on or prior to 31 August 2004); or (ii)
                  (pound)23,900,000 (twenty three million, nine hundred thousand
                  pounds Sterling) (if Closing occurs on

                  or prior to 30 September 2004 but after 31 August 2004) then
                  there shall be no corresponding adjustment to the Final
                  Working Capital Adjustment Amount.

         7.3.5    The Purchaser agrees that following the Closing and until the
                  Completion Statements become binding pursuant to paragraph 2
                  of Part 1 of Schedule 4, it shall not take any actions with
                  respect to the Books and Records with the result that the
                  Completion Statements cannot be calculated consistent with the
                  Accounting Policies.

         7.3.6    The parties may agree to net the amounts payable pursuant to
                  the foregoing provisions of this Clause 7.3 against each
                  other, such that settlement of the adjustment amounts
                  described herein may be effected by one wire transfer in
                  respect of all such amounts.

7.5      No Double Counting

         For the avoidance of doubt, no item included in the determination of
         the Completion Statements, shall be taken into account for the purposes

         either the Working Capital Statement, the Cash Deferred Income Amount
         Statement or the Cash Amount Statement.

7.6      Fixed Assets Re-allocation

         For the avoidance of doubt and solely for the purposes of this Clause
         7, (i) accounts included in fixed assets in the March Balance Sheet
         shall not be reallocated to balances included within the Closing
         Working Capital Assets; and (ii) accounts included in Current Assets in
         the March Balance Sheet shall not be reallocated to asset balances not
         included within Closing Working Capital Assets.

7.7      Creditors Re-allocation

         For the avoidance of doubt and solely for the purposes of this Clause
         7, (i) any accounts due to creditors classified within the Base Working
         Capital Liabilities in the March Balance Sheet shall not be
         reclassified as creditors falling due after more than 12 months in the
         Closing Date Balance Sheet; and (ii) accounts due to creditors falling
         due after more than 12 months shall not be reclassified within Closing
         Working Capital Liabilities.

         interests of the Purchaser and the Group Companies but if any such
         restriction shall be held to be void but would be valid if deleted in
         part or reduced in application, such restriction shall apply with such
         deletion or modification as may be necessary to make it valid and
         enforceable.

                  representation, warranty or undertaking made or given in
                  connection with this Agreement shall be for breach of the
                  terms of this Agreement to the exclusion of all other rights
                  and remedies (including those in tort or arising under
                  statute).

         reasonable.

13.9     Assignment

         13.9.1   Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
                  neither the Seller, the Purchaser nor the Guarantor may
                  without the prior written consent of the others, assign, grant
                  any security interest over, hold on trust or otherwise
                  transfer the benefit of the whole or any part of this
                  Agreement.

         13.9.2   Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the
                  Seller or the Purchaser may, without the consent of the other,
                  assign to a connected company the benefit of the whole or any
                  part of this Agreement provided that:

                  (i)      such assignment shall not be absolute but shall be
                           expressed to have effect only for so long as the
                           assignee remains a connected company of the party
                           concerned, with an obligation to re-assign to a
                           connected company of the assignor should any assignee
                           cease to be so; and

                  (ii)     the assignee shall not be entitled to receive under
                           this Agreement any greater amount than that to which
                           the assignor would have been entitled.

                  For the purposes of this Clause, a "connected company" is a
                  company which is a subsidiary of the party concerned or which
                  is a holding company of such party or a subsidiary of such
                  holding company.

         Account, as applicable, by wire transfer of immediately available
         funds, on or before the due date for payment. Payment of such sum in

         registration and transfer taxes and duties or their equivalents in all
         jurisdictions where such fees, Taxes and duties are payable as a result
         of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Purchaser shall

         question in connection with the payment of such Taxes and duties. The

         Seller's Group against

         increased to include interest on such sum from the date when such
         payment is due until the date of actual payment (after as well as
         before judgment) at a rate per annum of 4 per cent. above the rate of
         interest from time to time announced publicly by Barclays Bank plc as
         its base rate. Such interest shall accrue from day to day and shall be
         compounded monthly.

13.17    Grossing-up of Indemnity Payments, VAT

         13.17.1  Any payment made under this Agreement pursuant to an
                  indemnity, compensation or reimbursement provision (including,
                  for the avoidance of doubt, any payments in respect of a
                  breach of any Warranty and any payment under Clause 14 (Tax
                  Indemnity)) shall be paid free and clear of all deductions
                  withholdings, set-offs or counterclaims whatsoever save only
                  as may be required by law. If any deductions or withholdings
                  are required by law the party making the payment shall be
                  obliged to pay to the other party such sum as will, after such
                  deduction or withholding has been made, leave the other party
                  with the same amount as it would have been entitled to receive
                  in the absence of any such requirement to make a deduction or
                  withholding.

         13.17.2  If the recipient of a payment made under this Agreement
                  pursuant to an indemnity, compensation or reimbursement
                  provision (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any payments
                  in respect of a breach of any Warranty and any payment under
                  Clause 14 (Tax Indemnity)) receives a credit for or refund of
                  any Taxation payable by it or similar benefit by reason of any
                  deduction or withholding for or on account of Taxation then it
                  shall reimburse to the other party such part of such
                  additional amounts paid to it pursuant to Clause 13.17.1 as
                  will leave it (after such reimbursement) in no better and no
                  worse position than it would have been if the other party had
                  not been required to make such deduction or withholding.

         13.17.3  Where any payment is made under this Agreement to the
                  Purchaser pursuant to an indemnity, compensation or
                  reimbursement provision (including, for the avoidance of
                  doubt, any payments in respect of a breach of any Warranty and
                  any payment under Clause 14 (Tax Indemnity)) and that sum is
                  subject to a charge to Taxation in the hands of the recipient
                  (other than Taxation attributable to a payment being properly
                  treated as an adjustment to the consideration paid by the
                  Purchaser for the Group) the sum payable shall be increased to
                  such sum as will ensure that after payment of such Taxation
                  (and after giving credit for any Taxation Relief available to
                  the recipient in respect of the matter giving rise to the
                  payment) the recipient shall be left with a sum equal to the
                  sum that it would have received in the absence of such a
                  charge to Taxation.

         13.17.4  Where any payment is made under this Agreement pursuant to an
                  indemnity, compensation or reimbursement provision (including,
                  for the avoidance of doubt, any payments in respect of a
                  breach of any Warranty and any payment under Clause 14 (Tax
                  Indemnity)) and the matter giving rise to the payment results
                  in a Taxation Relief being available to any member of the
                  Purchaser's Group the


                                       40

<PAGE>

                  amount of that payment shall be reduced to take into account
                  the value of that Taxation Relief.

         13.17.5  Where any sum constituting an indemnity, compensation or
                  reimbursement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
                  payments in respect of a breach of any Warranty and any
                  payment under Clause 14 (Tax Indemnity)) to any party to this
                  Agreement is paid to a person other than such party but is
                  treated as taxable in the hands of such party, the payer shall
                  promptly pay to such party such sum as shall reimburse such
                  party for all Taxation suffered by it in respect of the
                  payment (after giving credit for any Taxation Relief available
                  to such party in respect of the matter giving rise to the
                  payment).

         13.17.6  Where under the terms of this Agreement one party is liable to
                  indemnify or reimburse another party in respect of any costs,
                  charges or expenses, the payment shall include an amount equal
                  to any VAT thereon not otherwise recoverable by the other
                  party, subject to that other party using all reasonable
                  endeavours to recover such amount of VAT as may be
                  practicable.

         13.17.7  If any payment under this Agreement constitutes the
                  consideration for a taxable supply for VAT purposes, then in
                  addition to that payment, and against delivery of a valid VAT
                  invoice, the payer shall pay any VAT due.

         13.19.1  If any provision in this Agreement shall be held to be
                  illegal, invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, the

                  enforceable and gives effect to the commercial intention of
                  the parties.

         13.19.2  To the extent it is not possible to delete or modify the
                  provision, in whole or in part, under Clause 13.19.1, then

         of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
         The Seller, the Purchaser and the Guarantor may enter into this
         Agreement by executing any such counterpart.

13.21    Dispute Resolution

         13.21.1  Subject to Clause 7 (Post-Closing Adjustments), if any dispute
                  arises in connection with this Agreement, the Seller, the
                  Purchaser and the Guarantor will attempt to settle it by
                  mediation in accordance with the CEDR Model Mediation
                  Procedure. Unless otherwise agreed by the Seller, the
                  Purchaser and the Guarantor, the mediator will be nominated by
                  CEDR.

         13.21.2  To initiate the mediation, a party must give notice in writing
                  (an "ADR Notice") to the other parties requesting a mediation.
                  A copy of the request shall be sent to CEDR Solve. The
                  mediation will start not later than 20 days after the date of
                  the ADR Notice.

         13.21.3  No party may commence any arbitration in relation to any
                  dispute arising out of this Agreement until it has attempted
                  to settle the dispute by mediation and either the mediation
                  has terminated or the other parties have failed to participate
                  in the mediation, provided that the right to issue proceedings
                  is not prejudiced by a delay.

         13.21.4  If the dispute is not settled by mediation within ten days of
                  commencement of the mediation or within such further period as
                  the parties may agree in writing, the dispute shall be
                  referred to and finally resolved by arbitration as set out
                  below.

         13.21.5  Subject to Clause 7 (Post-Closing Adjustments), any dispute
                  arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including
                  any question regarding the validity, existence or termination
                  of this Agreement and/or this Clause 13.21, which has not been
                  settled by mediation in accordance with Clauses 13.21.1 to
                  13.21.4 above, shall be finally resolved by arbitration in
                  England, conducted in English, by three arbitrators pursuant
                  to the rules of the London Court of International Arbitration
                  (the "LCIA") (the "Rules") save that the Rules shall be
                  amended in relation to the appointment of arbitrators and the
                  disclosure of documents in any arbitration proceedings as set
                  out below.

         13.21.6  One arbitrator shall be nominated by the Seller and one
                  arbitrator shall be nominated jointly by the Purchaser and the
                  Guarantor. If the Purchaser and the Guarantor are unable to
                  agree on the nomination of an arbitrator within 15 days of
                  notification of the Seller's nominated arbitrator, the LCIA
                  shall appoint an arbitrator on behalf of the Purchaser and the
                  Guarantor. The third arbitrator shall be selected
                  by the two so chosen within 15 days of the appointment of the
                  second arbitrator, failing which the LCIA shall appoint the
                  third arbitrator, who shall be the chairman of the arbitral
                  tribunal.

         13.21.7  The parties agree that disclosure in any arbitration shall be
                  in accordance with the standard disclosure requirements of the
                  Civil Procedure Rules of the English court.

                  action or proceedings arising out of this Agreement, service
                  upon whom shall be deemed completed whether or not forwarded

         13.23.2  The Seller agrees to inform the Purchaser and the Guarantor in
                  writing of any change of address of such process agent within
                  28 days of such change.

         13.23.3  If such process agent ceases to be able to act as such or to
                  have an address in England, the Seller irrevocably agrees to
                  appoint a new process agent in England acceptable to the
                  Purchaser and the Guarantor and to deliver to the Purchaser
                  and the Guarantor within 14 days a copy of a written
                  acceptance of appointment by the process agent.

         13.23.4  Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right to serve
                  process in any other manner permitted by law or the right to
                  bring proceedings in any other jurisdiction for the purposes
                  of the enforcement or execution of any judgment or other
                  settlement in any other courts.

13.24    Consents and Waivers

         The Purchaser acknowledges that the consents and waivers with respect
         to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement set out in Section
         6.7 of the Disclosure Letter may be required from third parties. The
         Purchaser agrees that the Seller shall not have any Liability
         whatsoever to the Purchaser arising out of or relating to the failure
         to obtain any consents or waivers set out in Section 6.7 of the
         Disclosure Letter that may be required in connection with the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement or because of the
         termination of any contract, licence or permit as a result thereof. The
         Purchaser further agrees that no Seller Warranty or covenant contained
         herein shall be breached or deemed breached as a result of (i) the
         failure to obtain any such consent or waiver, (ii) any such termination
         or (iii) any action, claim or proceeding commenced or threatened by or
         on behalf of any person arising out of or relating to the failure to
         obtain any such consent or waiver or as a result of any such
         termination. With respect to any such consent or waiver not obtained
         prior to Closing, the Seller shall continue at the Purchaser's request
         to use reasonable endeavours to cooperate with the Purchaser in
         attempting to obtain any such consent or waiver for 180 days after
         Closing. For the purposes of this Clause 13.24, "reasonable endeavours"
         shall not include any requirement of the Seller or any of its
         Affiliates to expend money (other than nominal amounts), commence or
         participate in any litigation or offer or grant any material
         accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party.

14       Tax Indemnity

14.1     The Seller covenants to pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to:

         14.1.1   all Liability for Taxes of the Group Companies which arises as
                  a consequence of an Event occurring or deemed (for Taxation
                  purposes) to have occurred, on or before the Closing Date, or
                  which arises by reference to profits earned, accrued or
                  received on or before the Closing Date;

         14.1.2   all Liability for Taxes of any Group Company that would not
                  have arisen but for any Group Company being controlled or
                  connected for Tax purposes on or before Closing by any person
                  or entity other than another Group Company;

         14.1.3   the amount of any additional Tax which is payable if any
                  Purchaser Relief is not available or is lost, reduced or
                  cancelled; and

         14.1.4   all reasonable legal and other professional fees and expenses
                  properly attributable to any of the items in Clauses 14.1.1,
                  14.1.2 and 14.1.3. For the purposes of this Clause 14, a
                  Liability for Taxes shall be deemed to arise not only when an
                  actual payment of Taxes or payment in respect of Taxes is due,
                  but where a payment of Taxes or payment in respect of Taxes
                  would be due but for the availability of any Relief (other
                  than Seller's Relief which is not taken into account pursuant
                  to Clause 14.11).

14.2     The covenant in Clause 14.1 shall not apply, and the Seller shall have
         no liability to make a payment under Clause 14.1 or for breach of the
         warranties in paragraph 12 of Schedule 5 (the "Tax Warranties") in
         respect of any Liability for Taxes of any person to the extent that:

         14.2.1   such Liability for Taxes is a liability to United Kingdom
                  corporation tax which arises as a result of an Event
                  (including the earning of income, profits or gains) occurring
                  since 31 December 2003 in the ordinary course of business of
                  any of the Group Companies (as carried on at Closing);

         14.2.2   provision or reserve for such a Liability for Taxes was made
                  or reflected in the Working Capital Statement or such
                  Liability for Taxes was otherwise taken into account as a
                  liability in the Working Capital Statement;

         14.2.3   such Liability for Taxes was discharged prior to Closing;

         14.2.4   such Liability for Taxes arises or is increased as a result of
                  a Change in Tax Law;

         14.2.5   such Liability for Taxes would not have arisen but for a
                  change after the Closing Date in accounting policies or
                  practices in effect on the Closing Date save for any change
                  which is necessary to cause such accounting policies or
                  practices to comply with UK GAAP as at the Closing Date;

         14.2.6   such Liability for Taxes would not have arisen but for any
                  voluntary act, omission or transaction by the Purchaser, any
                  Group Company or any of their respective directors, employees
                  or agents after the Closing Date, and the Purchaser or any
                  Group Company or any of their respective directors, employees
                  or agents knew that the voluntary act, omission or transaction
                  would have given rise to the Liability in question other than
                  any act, omission or transaction which was (A) required by Law
                  in effect on the date of this Agreement; (B) pursuant to a
                  legally binding commitment of the Group Company created on or
                  before the Closing Date; or (C)


                                       45

<PAGE>


                  in the ordinary course of business of the Group Company as
                  carried on immediately before the Closing Date;

         14.2.7   such Liability for Taxes arises as a result of a failure by
                  the Purchaser or any Group Company after the Closing Date to
                  (A) submit the Tax Returns required to be made by or on behalf
                  of that person; (B) submit such Tax Returns within the
                  appropriate time limits or otherwise than on a proper basis;
                  or (C) make any payments assumed to be made for purposes of
                  the provision in the Working Capital Statement, except in each
                  case where any such failure arises as a result of a breach by
                  Seller of its obligations under Clause 15;

         14.2.8   such Liability for Taxes arises as a result of the amendment,
                  disregard, withdrawal or disclaimer by the Purchaser or any
                  Group Company after the Closing Date of any claim, election,
                  surrender or disclaimer made on or before the Closing Date
                  except where the making of that amendment, disregard,
                  withdrawal or disclaimer is or has been, or the making of that
                  claim, election, surrender or disclaimer is not or has not
                  been, assumed in computing the provision for Taxes in the
                  Working Capital Statement;

         14.2.9   such Liability for Taxes would not have arisen but for the
                  failure or omission to make any claim, election, surrender or
                  disclaimer, or to give any notice or consent or to take any
                  other action that is or has been assumed in computing the
                  provision for Taxes in the Working Capital Statement and full
                  particulars of which have been given by the Seller to the
                  Purchaser in good time to allow the Purchaser to procure the
                  making of the claim, election, surrender or disclaimer, the
                  giving of any notice or consent or the taking of any other
                  such action;

         14.2.10  such Liability for Taxes is a Liability for interest or
                  penalties and would not have arisen but for the failure of any
                  Group Company to pay the relevant Tax Authority an amount of
                  Taxes equal to the payment made by the Seller to the Purchaser
                  hereunder in respect of such Taxes not later than the Business
                  Day following the date such payment is made hereunder;

         14.2.11  such Liability for Taxes is a Liability for interest or
                  penalties attributable to an underpayment of Taxes payable in
                  instalments under the Corporation Tax (Instalment Payments)
                  Regulations 1998 for the accounting period commencing prior to
                  the Closing Date to the extent that the underpayment would not
                  have been an underpayment but for an Event occurring after the
                  Closing Date;

         14.2.12  the Purchaser or that person has received from any other
                  person other than a Group Company a payment in respect of such
                  Liability for Taxes;

         14.2.13  such Liability for Taxes was satisfied by the Seller and the
                  Liability of the Group Company was correspondingly
                  extinguished or reduced under any statutory provision imposing
                  Liability on the Seller or any member of the Purchaser's Group
                  (other than a Group Company) for Taxes primarily chargeable
                  against any Group Company;

         14.2.14  such Liability for Taxes arises as a result of an Event
                  occurring after 31 December 2003 and as a result of that
                  Event, there is an increase in the assets of that person in
                  excess of their value as reflected in the Working Capital
                  Statement, but only to the extent such Liability for Taxes
                  does not exceed such increase in assets; or

         14.2.15  such Liability for Taxes would not have arisen but for the
                  failure of the Purchaser to


                                       46

<PAGE>

                  comply with its obligations under Clauses 14.5, 14.7, 14.15 or
                  15.1.


14.3     The Purchaser covenants to pay to the Seller an amount equal to (i) any
         Taxes for which the Seller or other person (other than a Group Company)
         by virtue of that person being controlled by the Seller becomes liable
         as a result of any Group Company failing to discharge any Liability for
         Taxes when payable, (ii) any Liability for Taxes arising to the Seller,
         or a person controlled by the Seller (other than a Group Company)
         pursuant to: (A) Section 132 of the Finance Act 1988 if a Group Company
         ceases to be resident in the United Kingdom after the Closing Date; (B)
         Section 190 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 if the unpaid
         tax referred to in Section 190(1) is first assessed against any Group
         Company; (C) paragraph 68 Schedule 29 Finance Act 2002 where the unpaid
         tax referred to in paragraph 68(1) is first assessed on any Group
         Company; (D) paragraph 75A Schedule 18 of the Finance Act 1998 where
         the claimant company is a Group Company; or (E) Section 767A of the
         Taxes Act or Schedule 28 of the Finance Act 2000 where the taxpayer
         company is a Group Company or Section 767AA of the Taxes Act where the
         transferred company is a Group Company, (iii) all reasonable legal fees
         and expenses attributable to any item in Clause (i) or (ii); provided
         that the Purchaser shall not be liable to make a payment to the Seller
         under this Clause 14.3 in respect of any Taxes:

         14.3.1   which are subject to a valid claim under Clause 14.1 by the
                  Purchaser which has not been satisfied or could be the subject
                  of any such valid claim, assuming that a claim was made in
                  respect of such Taxation (ignoring for these purposes Clause 9
                  of the Agreement);

         14.3.2   which have been recovered under any relevant statutory
                  provision (and the Seller shall procure that no such recovery
                  is sought to the extent that payment is made under this Clause
                  14.3);

         14.3.3   with respect to which the Purchaser would have a claim against
                  the Seller under Clause 14.1; or

         14.3.4   for breach of the Tax Warranties and such claim has not been
                  satisfied by the Seller. The provisions of Clause 14.9 and
                  14.10 below shall apply to this Clause 14.3 with the necessary
                  changes.

14.4     Any payment to be made pursuant to Clause 14.1, 14.3, 14.16 or 14.17
         shall be paid within ten Business Days after the person to whom the
         payment is due to be made (the "Indemnified Party") makes written
         demand upon the other party (the "Indemnifying Party"), but in no case
         (except in the case of a payment under Clause 14.16 or 14.17) earlier
         than five Business Days prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes
         (including any estimated Tax payments) are required to be paid to the
         relevant Tax Authority (or would be required to be paid but for the
         availability of any Relief (other than a Seller's Relief which is not
         taken into account pursuant to Clause 14.11)).

14.5     Reasonably promptly after a party becomes aware of the existence of a
         Tax issue that may give rise to a claim under Clause 14.1, 14.3, 14.16
         or 14.17 or for breach of the Tax Warranties (a "Tax Controversy") by
         it against the other party, the Indemnified Party shall notify the
         Indemnifying Party of the Tax issue and thereafter shall promptly
         forward to the Indemnifying Party copies of notices and communications
         with a Tax Authority relating to such Tax Controversy. Except as
         provided in this Clause 14.5 and provided that the



                                       47

<PAGE>


         Indemnifying Party agrees to indemnify the Indemnified Party against
         any Liability which may be suffered by it (or where the Indemnified
         Party is the Purchaser, a Group Company) in connection therewith, the
         Indemnifying Party may, subject to Clauses 14.6 and 14.7 below, request
         that the Indemnified Party takes such action as it may reasonably
         request to deal with, settle or contest any audit inquiry, information
         request, audit proceeding, suit, contest or any other action with
         respect to a Tax Controversy for which it would be required to make a
         payment under Clause 14.1, 14.16 or 14.17 for breach of the Tax
         Warranties or (as the case may be) Clause 14.3. The Indemnified Party
         shall not be required to take any action which is likely to increase
         its liability to Taxation for accounting periods ending after Closing
         (other than as a result of the reduction or utilisation of any Seller's
         Relief). Any out of pocket expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party
         in handling, settling or contesting a Tax Controversy at the request of
         the Indemnifying Party under this Clause 14.5 shall be borne by the
         Indemnifying Party.

14.6     The Indemnified Party (or where the Indemnified Party is the Purchaser,
         the Group Company) shall be at liberty without reference to the
         Indemnifying Party to deal with any matter which could give rise to a
         Liability under this Clause 14 if the Indemnifying Party delays
         unreasonably in giving any such request as is mentioned in Clause 14.5
         above provided that Indemnified Party concerned has notified the
         Indemnifying Party of its intention to so deal with the matter and has
         afforded the Indemnifying Party a period of 15 Business Days to
         respond.

14.7     Subject to Clause 14.6 and provided that the Indemnifying Party agrees
         to indemnify the Indemnified Party against any Liability which may be
         suffered by it (or where the Indemnified Party is the Purchaser, a
         Group Company) in connection therewith and, provided that the
         Indemnified Party shall not be required to take any action which is
         likely to increase its liability to Taxation for accounting periods
         ending after Closing (other than as a result of the reduction or
         utilisation of any Seller's Relief), the Seller and the Purchaser shall
         each have the right to participate in all activities and strategic
         decisions relating to any litigation of the Tax Controversy in front of
         any court or any other Tax proceedings for which each party would be
         required to make a payment under Clause 14.1, 14.3, 14.16 or 14.17 or
         for breach of the Tax Warranties with respect to one or more Tax
         issues.

14.8     The Purchaser shall, to the extent possible, apply any Relief (other
         than any Purchaser Relief or a Post-Closing Relief) to mitigate any
         Liability for Taxes which is the subject of a claim under Clause 14.1
         or for breach of the Tax Warranties, including apportioning or
         reapportioning any amount pursuant to any Group Payment Arrangements to
         which any Group Company is a party or making such claims or elections
         in relation to such Seller Relief as the Seller reasonably requests.

14.9     If the Seller pays any amount to the Purchaser under Clause 14.1, 14.16
         or 14.17 or for breach of the Tax Warranties in respect of any
         Liability for Taxes (a "Relevant Payment") and the Purchaser or a Group
         Company (the "Relevant Recipient") receives a rebate, refund, credit,
         set off, other tax benefit or payment from any other person other than
         a Group Company in respect of such Liability (the "Relevant Receipt"),
         the Purchaser shall repay or cause to be repaid to the Seller an amount
         equal to the lesser of (i) the amount of the Relevant Receipt less any
         Liability for Taxes of the Relevant Recipient in respect of the
         Relevant Receipt and reasonable costs incurred by the Purchaser or the
         Relevant Recipient in obtaining it (to the extent that such costs have
         not been reimbursed pursuant


                                       48

<PAGE>


         to Clause 14.10) and (ii) the amount of the Relevant Payment less any
         Liability for Taxes on the receipt thereof. If the Relevant Recipient
         receives a rebate, refund, credit, set off or other tax benefit in
         respect of which it is required by this Clause 14.9 to make a payment,
         the Relevant Recipient shall not be obliged to make that payment until
         such date upon which the Relevant Recipient's liability to make an
         actual payment of Tax is reduced by reason of the rebate, refund,
         credit, set off or other tax benefit.

14.10    The Purchaser shall notify the Seller of (i) any actual entitlement of
         the Purchaser or any Group Company to any Relevant Receipt or, (ii) any
         prospective entitlement to any Relevant Receipt which may become an
         actual entitlement, as soon as is reasonably practicable after the
         Purchaser becomes aware of such actual or prospective entitlement. The
         Purchaser shall, if the Seller so requests and at the Seller's expense,
         take or cause to be taken such action reasonably required to secure the
         Relevant Receipt.

14.11    If the auditors for the time being of any Group Company certify in
         writing (at the request and reasonable expense of the Seller) to the
         Seller and the Purchaser that (i) the Working Capital Statement
         includes an over provision for Taxes of any Group Company or (ii) if
         the Liability for Taxes of any Group Company (other than a Liability
         for Taxes in respect of which the Seller would have a claim under
         Clause 14.1 or the Tax Warranties) is reduced as a result of the
         utilisation of any Seller Relief after the Closing Date, an amount
         equal to the over provision or reduction in Liability, as the case may
         be, shall be set off against any payment then due from the Seller to
         the Purchaser under this Agreement. To the extent that the
         overprovision or reduction in Liability exceeds the amount of any
         payment then due from the Seller, the balance shall be carried forward
         and set off against any payment which becomes due from the Seller in
         the future. For purposes of this Clause 14.11, none of the following
         matters shall be considered to give rise to an over provision or
         reduction in Liability: (i) the utilisation of any Purchaser Relief or
         Post-Closing Relief and (ii) a Change in Tax Law.

14.12    If the Seller is required to make a payment to the Purchaser under
         Clause 14.1 or for breach of the Tax Warranties in respect of a
         Liability for Taxes (the "Initial Payment") and, had such Liability
         been taken into account in the preparation of the Working Capital
         Statement, another adjustment would have been required to be made (a
         "Secondary Adjustment") that would have reduced the Liability for Taxes
         or increased the Relief of any Group Company then, to the extent that
         the Secondary Adjustment does not result in an over-provision being
         taken into account within Clause 14.11, the liability of the Seller to
         the Purchaser for such Liability shall be reduced by the amount of the
         reduction in Liability or increase in Relief, as the case may be. If
         the Secondary Adjustment results in the increase of a Relief, including
         through an increase of a deferred tax asset or a reduction in deferred
         tax Liability, then the liability of the Seller to the Purchaser shall
         not be reduced in accordance with this Clause 14.12 but when such
         reduction in deferred tax Liability or increase in deferred tax asset
         reduces the liability of the Purchaser, any member of the Purchaser's
         Group or any Group Company to make an actual payment of Tax by reason
         of such increase in Relief the Purchaser shall (if such reduction
         occurs within seven years of the date hereof) make a payment of an

                  to:

                  (i)      any liability of any member of the Purchaser's Group
                           to pay secondary National Insurance contributions and
                           any liability to account for primary National
                           Insurance contributions and income tax due under PAYE
                           arising in respect of any share incentive, share
                           option or other incentive granted before Closing to
                           any Relevant Employee or any former employee of any
                           Group Company; and

                  (ii)     any penalties or interest arising for any member of
                           the Purchaser's Group in connection with a failure of
                           the Seller to pay amounts due under Clause 14.13.1.

         14.13.2  The due date for payment in relation to Clause 14.13.1:

                  (i)      shall be ten Business Days before the latest date on
                           which the National Insurance contributions and PAYE
                           may be paid to the Inland Revenue without a liability
                           to interest and penalties arising; or

                  (ii)     if payment has already been made or Clause 14.13.1
                           applies, five Business Days after service by a member
                           of the Purchaser's Group of a notice containing a
                           written demand.

         14.13.3  The members of the Purchaser's Group appoint the Seller as
                  their agent to collect an amount equal to any employees'
                  National Insurance contribution and income tax liability under
                  PAYE arising in respect of any share incentive, share option
                  or other incentive granted before Closing to any Relevant
                  Employee or any former employee of any Group Company.

         14.13.4  The Seller will provide the Purchaser with all information
                  reasonably required by the Purchaser relating to the
                  calculation of amounts payable under this Clause 14.13 within
                  ten Business Days of the liability arising or, if sooner, ten
                  Business Days before the date the liability is payable by the
                  Purchaser.

         14.13.5  If the Purchaser becomes aware after Closing of any matter
                  which could give rise to a liability under this Clause 14.13
                  it shall give notice of that matter to the Seller within ten
                  Business Days of becoming so aware.

         14.13.6  The Purchaser will after Closing provide such information
                  and/or assistance as the Seller may reasonably request in
                  writing for the purpose of making or calculating any
                  deduction, withholding or payment in respect of Tax or
                  National Insurance which the Seller is required to make, or
                  the making or giving of any return or notice to any Taxation
                  Authority, in connection with any share incentive, share
                  option or other incentive granted before Closing to any
                  Relevant Employee or any former employee of any Group Company
                  within ten Business Days of receiving such a request.

         14.13.7  The Seller's liability to make a payment to the Purchaser
                  under Clause 14.13.1 above shall be reduced by an amount equal
                  to 30% of any Share Option Relief available to the Purchaser,
                  or the relevant Group Company in respect of the share
                  incentive, share option or other incentive in question.

         14.13.8  For the purposes of Clause 14.13.7 above it shall be assumed
                  that the Purchaser, or the relevant Group Company, has
                  obtained a Share Option Relief in relation to each share
                  incentive, share option or other incentive giving rise to an
                  obligation to

                  make a payment pursuant to Clause 14.13.1 and such assumption
                  shall be rebutted only in the circumstances set out in Clause
                  14.13.9.

         14.13.9  The assumption in Clause 14.13.8 shall be rebutted to the
                  extent that:

                  (i)      the Purchaser demonstrates that the Share Option
                           Relief is not available as a consequence of an act or
                           omission by the Seller or any Group Company prior to
                           Closing, including the obtaining of a Relief in
                           relation to such share incentive, share option or
                           incentive prior to Closing; or

                  (ii)     the Purchaser demonstrates that the Share Option
                           Relief is not available as a consequence of the
                           failure of any of the conditions set out in paragraph
                           4(3) of Schedule 23 Finance Act 2003.

14.14    If paragraph 12.6 of Schedule 5 is untrue with respect to any document
         or transaction the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser by way of
         liquidated damages an amount equal to any stamp duty or SDLT paid by a
         Group Company under the Clawback Provision or Secondary Recovery
         Provision (both as defined in paragraph 12.1 of Schedule 5) and any
         interest or penalties payable in respect thereof (except to the extent
         that any interest or penalties are due to the unreasonable delay or
         default of the Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser's Group),
         provided that the Seller shall not be liable under paragraph 12.6 of
         Schedule 5 above to the extent that such stamp duty or SDLT is payable
         as a result of a voluntary transaction effected after Closing otherwise
         than pursuant to a legally binding obligation, whether or not
         conditional, entered into on or before Closing.

14.15    The Purchaser:

         14.15.1  shall (to the extent permitted by Law) procure that each Group
                  Company shall make such claims and elections in respect of
                  Capital Allowances and Group Relief as shall ensure that the
                  Actual Tax Written Down Value is neither more nor less than
                  the Estimated Tax Written Down Value. For the avoidance of
                  doubt, this Clause 14.15 shall not require the Purchaser or
                  any member of the Purchaser's Group (other than any Group
                  Company) to surrender Group Relief to or accept the surrender
                  of Group Relief from any Group Company;

         14.15.2  shall not (except to the extent required by Law) and shall
                  procure that no Group Company shall (except to the extent
                  required by Law) alter or amend any claims and elections
                  either made pursuant to Clause 14.15.1 or (in respect of
                  Capital Allowances) made before Closing to ensure that the
                  Actual Tax Written Down Value is neither more nor less than
                  the Estimated Tax Written Down Value;

         14.15.3  shall not (except to the extent required by Law or pursuant to
                  Clause 14.15.1) and shall procure that no Group Company shall
                  (except to the extent required by law or pursuant to Clause
                  14.15.1) alter or amend any claims or elections relating to
                  Capital Allowances the making of which was assumed in the
                  audited annual consolidated accounts of the Company or the
                  audited annual accounts of Crown Castle UK, in each case for
                  the financial year ended 31 December 2003; and

         14.15.4  hereby agrees that if the Seller is or would otherwise be
                  liable to make a payment under Clause 14.1.1 hereof in respect
                  of a Liability for Taxes arising as a consequence of an Event
                  occurring (including the earning of income, profit or gains)
                  on or prior to 31 December 2003 the Purchaser shall use
                  reasonable endeavours to procure that such claims and
                  elections are made in respect of


                                       51

<PAGE>



                  Capital Allowances for the purpose of reducing or eliminating
                  that Liability for Taxes and the Purchaser shall instead make
                  a claim under Clause 14.16 in respect of the reduction of the
                  Actual Tax Written Down Value below the Estimated Tax Written
                  Down Value which results from the use of the Capital
                  Allowances to reduce or eliminate that Liability for Taxes.

14.16    Subject to Clause 14.19, the Seller covenants that if the Actual Tax
         Written Down Value is less than the Estimated Tax Written Down Value
         (including by virtue of the setting off of any Capital Allowances
         against any income, profit or gains accrued, earned or received on or
         before 31 December 2003), then the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser an
         amount equal to 23.1% of the amount by which the Actual Tax Written
         Down Value is less than the Estimated Tax Written Down Value; provided
         always that the amount payable by the Seller shall be reduced by an
         amount equal to 10% of any corresponding increase in the Long Life
         Asset Pool (for example, any increase which results from an asset which
         was not treated as a Long Life Asset for the purposes of the
         calculation referred to in paragraph 12.5 of Schedule 5 being or
         subsequently being treated as a Long Life Asset).

14.17    The Seller covenants to pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to 30% of
         the amount by which the profits of the Group Companies which would be
         chargeable to United Kingdom corporation tax (on the assumption that
         the Group Companies were not to claim any Capital Allowances)
         (including any trading losses resulting from claims and elections made
         to reduce the Actual Tax Written Down Value to the Estimated Tax
         Written Down Value) or any Group Relief from any company which is not a
         Group Company and were not entitled to any Purchaser Relief) in respect
         of the accounting period which would end on Closing if an accounting
         period of each Group Company were to end on Closing exceeds (a)
         (pound)64,014,773 (sixty four million, fourteen thousand, and seven
         hundred and seventy three pounds Sterling), if Closing occurs on or
         prior to 31 August 2004; or (b) (pound)72,016,620 (seventy two million,
         sixteen thousand and six hundred and twenty pounds Sterling), if
         Closing occurs on or prior to 30 September 2004 (but after 31 August
         2004). Notwithstanding Clause 14.4, the Seller shall not be obliged to
         make a payment under this Clause 14.17 earlier than 30 June 2005. The
         amount payable under this Clause 14.17 shall be reduced by an amount
         equal to any corporation tax included in the Base Working Capital
         Liabilities.

14.18    The Purchaser shall not make any claim under any provision of this
         Agreement other than under Clause 14.16 or 14.17 (and the Seller shall
         not be liable to make a payment under any provision of this Agreement
         other than under Clause 14.16 or 14.17) in respect of any matter or
         matters which comprise or involve paragraph 12.3 of Schedule 5 (or, if
         Closing shall occur on 30 September 2004, paragraph 12.4 of Schedule 5)
         being untrue or ceasing to be true.

14.19    The covenant in Clause 14.16 shall not apply, and the Seller shall have
         no liability to make a payment under Clause 14.16 to the extent that
         the Actual Tax Written Down Value is less than the Estimated Tax
         Written Down Value as a result of :

         14.19.1  the making of any claim or election which results in any Group
                  Company having a correspondingly increased amount of trading
                  losses available to carry forward from the accounting period
                  which ends on 31 December 2003;

         14.19.2  any voluntary act, omission or transaction by the Purchaser,
                  any Group Company or any of their respective directors,
                  employees or agents after the Closing Date


                                       52

<PAGE>

                  (including any change in accounting policies or practices in
                  effect on the Closing Date save for any change which is
                  necessary to cause such accounting policies or practices to
                  comply with UK GAAP as at the Closing Date) and the Purchaser
                  or any Group Company or any of their respective directors,
                  employees or agents knew that the voluntary act, omission or
                  transaction would result in the Actual Tax Written Down Value
                  being less than the Estimated Tax Written Down Value, other
                  than any act, omission or transaction which was (a) required
                  by Law in effect at the date of this Agreement; (b) is
                  pursuant to a legal binding commitment of the Group Company
                  created on or before the Closing Date; or (c) carried out in
                  compliance with the Purchaser's obligations under Clause 14.15
                  or 15.5; or

         14.19.3  the failure by the Purchaser to comply with its obligations
                  under Clauses 14.5, 14.7, 14.15 or 15.1.

14.20    If (i) the Seller has made or is liable to make a payment pursuant to
         Clause 14.16; and (ii) the liability to make that payment would not
         have arisen but for either (a) the disallowance, postponement or
         restriction of any deduction in computing the profits of any Group
         Company (for the purposes of corporation tax) of a Pre-Closing Tax
         Period; or (b) any expenditure incurred by any Group Company on or
         before 31 December 2003 not qualifying for Capital Allowances; and
         (iii) the auditors for the time being of any Group Company certify in
         writing (at the request and reasonable expense of the Seller) to the
         Seller and the Purchaser that the liability of any Group Company or any
         member of the Purchaser's Group to make an actual payment of Taxes or
         payment in respect of Taxes is lower than it would have been as a
         result of the matters referred to in (ii) above (for example, as a
         result of a deduction being available in a later accounting period
         rather than an earlier accounting period) (the "Saving"); then the
         amount of the Saving shall be set off against any payment due from the
         Seller under this Clause 14 or (to the extent that it is not so set
         off) shall be carried forward and set off against any future payments
         which become due from the Seller under this Clause 14.

15       Tax Returns etc.

15.1     The Seller shall at its cost timely prepare, file, or cause to be
         prepared and filed, consistent with past practice and (subject to
         Clauses 14.5 to 14.7) have conduct of all Tax Returns and all matters
         relating to the Tax Returns of the Group Companies for any Pre-Closing
         Tax Period including all claims, elections, surrenders, disclaimers,
         notices and consents and shall present Tax Returns and any
         communication with any Tax Authority in draft to the Purchaser for
         review in the case of corporation tax Tax Returns at least 30 days
         before the date on which the such Tax Returns are required to be filed
         and in the case of all other Tax Returns within a reasonable period
         before the expiration of any applicable statutory time limit for the
         filing of such Tax Returns are required to be filed or, in the case of
         any communications, before the intended date of submission. With
         respect to Tax Returns for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, the Purchaser
         shall procure that the relevant Group Company (i) notifies the Seller
         of any intended written communication with the relevant Tax Authority,
         (ii) signs and submits any properly and accurately prepared Tax Return,
         (iii) makes any proper and accurate claims, disclaimers, notices or
         elections; and (iv) gives any proper and accurate consents, in each
         case as may be reasonably required by the Seller. The Purchaser shall
         timely prepare, file or procure to be prepared and filed, on a basis
         which is (to the extent permitted by Law) consistent with the past
         practice and, subject to Clauses 14.5 to 14.7, shall have conduct of
         all Tax Returns and all matters relating to the Tax


                                       53

<PAGE>


         Returns of the Group Companies for the Straddle Period and shall
         present such Tax Returns and any communication with any Tax Authority
         in draft to the Seller for review, in the case of corporation tax, Tax
         Returns, at least 30 Business Days before the date on which such Tax
         Returns are required to be filed and, in the case of all other Tax
         Returns, within a reasonable period before the expiration of any
         applicable statutory time limit by the end of which such Tax Returns
         are required to be filed or, in the case of any communications, before
         the intended date of submission and shall take into account such
         reasonable comments in relation thereto as the Seller makes. The Seller
         shall co operate with the Purchaser in providing such information and
         assistance as the Purchaser may reasonably request in relation to the
         Tax Return for the Straddle Period and all Tax Returns with respect to
         any Group Companies for any Post-Closing Tax Period.

15.2     The amount or economic benefit of (i) any Seller Relief with respect to
         Taxes of the Group Companies, or of any affiliated, consolidated,
         combined or unitary group of which any Group Company is or has been a
         member for any Pre-Closing Tax Period in any audit, examination, suit,
         contest or other Tax proceeding of the Seller or any member of the
         Seller's Group in a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of
         the Seller; or (ii) any Relief realised by the Purchaser or any member
         of the Purchaser's Group in a Post-Closing Tax Period as a result in
         any corresponding offsetting adjustment in any audit, examination,
         suit, contest or other Tax proceeding of the Seller or any member of
         the Seller's Group in a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account
         of the Seller provided that this shall not apply to any Purchaser
         Relief. Except as described in the preceding sentence, the amount or
         economic benefit of any Relief with respect to Taxes of any Group
         Company for any Post-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of the
         Purchaser. Each party shall forward, and shall cause the members of its
         group to forward, to the party entitled pursuant to this Clause 15.2 to
         receive the amount or economic benefit of a Relief, the amount or
         economic benefit of the Relief within 10 days after the Relief is
         received or applied against another Liability for Taxes, as the case
         may be.

15.3     The Purchaser shall not make any election under Section 338 of the
         United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended) with respect
         to any UK Group Company without the Seller's prior written consent,
         which consent may be provided or withheld in the sole discretion of the
         Seller.

15.4     The Purchaser and the Seller agree that they shall each take such
         action within their control to ensure that they shall not alter or
         amend, and that no Group Company shall alter or amend, any Group Relief
         claims or any other arrangements for the allocation of Relief (or the
         terms thereof) made by the Seller or any Group Company relating to any

                                    and the Purchaser has taken all such steps
                                    as may be reasonable and practicable in the
                                    circumstances to agree the contents of such
                                    disclosure with the Seller before making
                                    such disclosure (the Seller not to
                                    unreasonably withhold or delay any such

                  subsequently recovered by or paid to the Purchaser from or by
                  any third party in respect of any matter or Liability in
                  respect of which the Seller has paid any sum to the Purchaser

16.4     Conduct of Claims

         16.4.1   Without prejudice to Clause 16.5, if any claim is received by
                  or any matter or circumstance comes to the attention of the
                  Purchaser which could reasonably be anticipated to give rise
                  to a Liability for which the Seller may be liable under Clause
                  16.1 or 16.2:

                  (i)      the Purchaser shall give Notice to the Seller as soon
                           as reasonably practicable and in any event within 20
                           Business Days of becoming aware of it;

                  (ii)     the Purchaser shall give to the Seller reasonable
                           access to all information relevant to any claim
                           pursuant to Clause 16.1 and/or Clause 16.2 to enable
                           the Seller to investigate thoroughly such claim and
                           its potential Liability in respect of such claim or
                           matter other than such access as would compromise any
                           legal privilege or evidence of the Purchaser;

                  (iii)    as regards any such claim the Purchaser shall take
                           such action as the Seller may reasonably request in
                           writing to appeal, avoid, compromise, defend, dispute
                           or resist the claim and any adjudication in respect
                           thereof; and

                  (iv)     the Purchaser shall not admit, discharge, pay or
                           settle any such claim without the prior written
                           consent of the Seller (such consent not to be
                           unreasonably withheld or delayed).

         16.4.2   The action which the Seller may reasonably request under
                  Clause 16.4.1(iii) shall include (without limitation) allowing
                  the Seller in the name of the Purchaser to take complete
                  control of the conduct, handling and settlement of any such
                  claim, including the cost of litigation and of any appeal or
                  any negotiations and the appointment of and the giving of
                  instructions to legal representatives for that purpose,
                  provided that the Seller shall:

                  (i)      keep the Purchaser informed of all material steps
                           proposed by it;

                  (ii)     consult as fully as is reasonably practicable with
                           the Purchaser and take account of the Purchaser's
                           reasonable representations;

                  (iii)    not take any action in the name of the Purchaser as
                           may adversely affect the goodwill or good name of the
                           Purchaser or the value of the Purchaser's business;
                           and

                  (iv)     not admit, discharge, pay or settle any such claim
                           without the prior written consent of the Purchaser
                           (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
                           delayed).

         16.4.3   The provisions of this Clause 16.4 shall not apply to any
                  claim insofar as it relates to the carrying out of any
                  Remedial Action. The procedure for dealing with any such claim
                  is set out in Clause 16.5.

16.5     Remedial Action by Purchaser after Closing

         16.5.1   Within six months of Closing the Purchaser shall identify any
                  Remedial Action it considers necessary:

                  (a)      to procure the compliance of the Group Companies with
                           Environmental Law and Industry Guidelines in respect
                           of Radiation emitted from any Relevant Equipment;
                           and/or

                  (b)      to procure the compliance of the Group Companies with
                           the Asbestos Regulations in respect of any Property.

         16.5.2   The Purchaser shall notify the Seller within six months of
                  Closing of any Remedial Action identified under Clause 16.5.1
                  and shall provide the Seller with reasonable details of the
                  identified Remedial Action and any correspondence received
                  from a Governmental Entity that relates thereto; provided (a)
                  that the provision of such notification shall not prevent the
                  Purchaser from pursuing further Remedial Action as a result of
                  any claim for Losses made within four years following Closing
                  under Clauses 16.1 and 16.2 in addition to that set out in the
                  notification; and (b) that the parties agree that the
                  procedure set out in this Clause 16.5 to agree the cost nature
                  and extent of Remedial Action shall apply to such further
                  Remedial Action.

         16.5.3   The Seller shall notify the Purchaser within 20 Business Days
                  of receipt of the Purchaser's notice under Clause 16.5.2
                  whether it agrees with the cost, nature and extent of the
                  Remedial Action identified by the Purchaser.

         16.5.4   If the Seller notifies the Purchaser that it agrees with the
                  Remedial Action identified by the Purchaser then the Purchaser
                  shall, at the cost of the Seller, (subject always to Clause
                  9.4.1(ii)) carry out the Remedial Action identified by it and
                  agreed by the Seller and the provisions of Clause 16.5.5 shall
                  apply; save that if the Seller notifies the Purchaser that it
                  does not agree with the cost, nature or extent of the Remedial
                  Action proposed by the Purchaser, then the provisions of
                  Clause 16.7 shall apply, provided that if the Seller does not
                  respond to the Purchaser's notice under Clause 16.5.2 the
                  Seller shall be deemed to have agreed to the terms of the
                  notice.

         16.5.5   The Purchaser shall carry out any Remedial Action identified
                  by it under Clause 16.5.2 to procure compliance with
                  Environmental Law and Industry Guidelines and the Asbestos
                  Regulations as soon as reasonably practicable, having regard
                  to the nature and extent of the works following the earlier
                  of:

                  (i)      the date the Seller notifies the Purchaser or is
                           deemed to have notified the Purchaser that it agrees
                           with the Remedial Action identified by the Purchaser;
                           or

                  (ii)     the date the Expert's decision is notified to the
                           parties (if any dispute is referred to an Expert
                           under Clause 16.7).

         16.5.6   Any Remedial Action in respect of which this Clause 16 is to
                  apply shall be performed in a commercially reasonable,
                  cost-effective manner using the most sound materials available
                  for the purpose.

         16.5.7   The Purchaser shall afford to the Seller and its
                  Representatives all such reasonable access to Relevant
                  Equipment or the Properties as is required to

                  enable the Seller to confirm to its reasonable satisfaction
                  that any Remedial Action is or has been undertaken in
                  compliance with Clauses 16.5.5 and 16.5.6 above.

16.6     Seller's Right to carry out Remedial Action prior to Closing

         16.6.1   Without prejudice to Clause 5.1, the Seller and the Purchaser
                  agree that between the date of this Agreement and Closing the
                  Seller shall have the right to carry out or procure that Crown
                  Castle UK shall carry out any Remedial Action it considers
                  reasonably necessary to reduce or mitigate its liability under
                  Clauses 16.1 and 16.2, provided always that:

                  (i)      the Seller shall provide the Purchaser promptly with
                           details of all such works and full access to and
                           information regarding the said works; and

                  (ii)     the Seller shall consult during the course of such
                           works as fully as is reasonably practicable with the
                           Purchaser in relation to such works and take account
                           of the Purchaser's reasonable representations.

         16.6.2   Following completion of any such works carried out under this
                  Clause the Purchaser shall have full right of reasonable
                  access and inspection and shall either confirm in writing that
                  the works have been carried out to its reasonable satisfaction
                  or in the alternative require the Seller to carry out such
                  further works as it considers reasonably necessary to secure
                  compliance with Environmental Law, Industry Guidelines and the
                  Asbestos Regulations and any dispute in connection thereto
                  shall be referred to an Expert under Clause 16.7.

16.7     Disputes

         16.7.1   The Seller and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith
                  with a view to resolving any dispute between them as to the
                  cost, extent or nature of any Remedial Action to be carried
                  out. If they are unable to resolve any such dispute within 20
                  Business Days after the date of notification of any objection
                  pursuant to Clause 16.5.4 above, the matter in dispute shall
                  be referred for decision by the Seller or the Purchaser to an
                  appropriate independent expert (the "Expert") for resolution.
                  The Expert shall be appointed in default of agreement between
                  the Seller and the Purchaser within the five ensuing Business
                  Days by the Chairman for the time being of the Institute of
                  Environmental Management and Assessment.

         16.7.2   Where any dispute is referred for decision by an Expert:


                  (i)      the Seller and the Purchaser shall promptly provide
                           the Expert with such information as he may reasonably
                           require to enable him to reach his decision;

                  (ii)     the Expert shall act as an expert and not as an
                           arbitrator;

                  (iii)    the Expert's decision (which shall be given by him in
                           writing stating his reasons for it) shall be final
                           and binding on the Seller and the Purchaser (save in
                           case of manifest error); and

                  (iv)     the Expert's costs and expenses shall be borne by the
                           Seller and the Purchaser in such proportions as the
                           Expert may decide to be fair and reasonable in the
                           circumstances or, if no such decision is made by the
                           Expert, by the Purchaser and the Seller in equal
                           proportions.

17       Repayment of Intra-Group balances

17.1     On the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall procure that the relevant
         Group Company shall pay the Settlement Amount by wire transfer of
         immediately available funds to the Seller's Nominated Account.

17.2     The Seller and the Purchaser agree that the Settlement Amount is
         obtained by netting (a) an amount paid by the Seller (as agent of the
         relevant members of the Seller's Group) to the Purchaser (as agent of
         the relevant Group Companies) sufficient to ensure that the Intra-Group
         Receivables are fully discharged; and (b) an amount paid by the
         Purchaser (as agent of the relevant Group Company) to the Seller (as
         agent of the relevant members of the Seller's Group), sufficient to
         ensure that the Intra-Group Payables are fully discharged.

18       Guarantee by the Guarantor

18.1     In consideration of the Seller entering into this Agreement, the
         Guarantor unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Seller
         (which takes the benefit of this guarantee for itself and as trustee
         for each Group Company) the due and punctual performance of all the
         obligations and Liabilities of the Purchaser under or otherwise arising
         out of or in connection with this Agreement (as any of such obligations
         and Liabilities may from time to time be varied, extended, increased or
         replaced) but subject to the same limit on the Liability as applies to
         the Purchaser under this Agreement.

18.2     If any obligation or Liability of the Purchaser expressed to be the
         subject of the guarantee contained in this Clause 18 (the "NGT
         Guarantee") is not or ceases to be valid or enforceable against the
         Purchaser (in whole or in part) on any ground whatsoever (including,
         but not limited to, any defect in or want of powers of the Purchaser or
         irregular exercise of such powers, or any lack of authority on the part
         of any person purporting to act on behalf of the Purchaser, or any
         legal or other limitation, disability or incapacity, or any change in
         the constitution of, or any amalgamation or reconstruction of, or the
         liquidation, administration or insolvency of the Purchaser), the
         Guarantor shall nevertheless be liable to the Seller in respect of that
         purported obligation or liability as if the same were fully valid and
         enforceable and the Guarantor were the principal debtor in respect
         thereof.

18.3     The liability of the Purchaser under the NGT Guarantee shall not be
         discharged or affected in any way by:

         18.3.1   any variation, extension, increase, renewal, determination,
                  release or replacement of this Agreement;

         18.3.2   the Seller granting any time, indulgence, concession, relief,
                  discharge or release to the Purchaser or any other person or
                  realising, giving up, agreeing to any variation, renewal or
                  replacement of, releasing, abstaining from or delaying in
                  taking advantage of or otherwise dealing with any securities
                  from or other rights or remedies which it may have against the
                  Purchaser or any other person; or


                                       60

<PAGE>


         18.3.3   any other matter or thing which, but for this provision, might
                  exonerate or affect the liability of the Guarantor (including,
                  without limitation, the termination, supervening illegality or
                  invalidity of this Agreement).

18.4     The NGT Guarantee is in addition to any other security or right now or
         hereafter available to the Purchaser and is a continuing security
         notwithstanding any liquidation, administration, insolvency or other
         incapacity of the Purchaser or the Guarantor.

18.5     Until the full and final discharge of all obligations and Liabilities
         which are the subject of the NGT Guarantee, the Guarantor:

         18.5.1   waives all of its rights of subrogation, reimbursement and
                  indemnity against the Purchaser and agrees not to demand or
                  accept any security from the Purchaser in respect of any such
                  rights and not to prove in competition with the Seller in the
                  liquidation or insolvency of the Purchaser; and

         18.5.2   agrees that it will not claim or enforce payment (whether
                  directly or by set-off, counterclaim or otherwise) of any
                  amount which may be or has become due to the Guarantor by the
                  Purchaser or any other person liable to the Seller in respect
                  of the obligations hereby guaranteed if and so long as the
                  Purchaser is in default under this Agreement.

                  been taken so as to obtain a sufficient number of additional
                  licences so as to ensure that the Group's use of that software
                  after Closing does not infringe any third party Intellectual
                  Property rights in any material respect.

                 Determination of Closing Date Balance Sheet and
                              Completion Statements
                                   (Clause 7)
                                     Part 1


1        Accounting Policies and Bases

1.1      The Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Completion Statements shall be
         prepared in accordance with:

         1.1.1    the policies or bases as set out in Part 6 of Schedule 4;

         1.1.2    (subject to the requirements of Paragraph 1.1.1 which shall
                  prevail over the provisions of this Paragraph 1.1.2) in
                  accordance with the historical cost convention and the same
                  accounting policies, measurement bases and estimation
                  techniques as used in preparing the audited annual
                  consolidated accounts of the Group for the financial year
                  ended on 31 December 2003; and to the extent that the
                  accounting policies, measurement bases and estimation
                  techniques adopted in such accounts are different to those
                  applied in the preparation of the March Accounts arising
                  solely from the differences arising from the preparation of
                  the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2003 due to it
                  being a fiscal year end, the accounting policies, measurement
                  bases and estimation techniques used for the March Accounts
                  shall instead be adopted and consistently applied; and

         1.1.3    (subject to the requirements of Paragraph 1.1.1 and 1.1.2
                  which shall prevail over the provisions of this Paragraph
                  1.1.3), UK GAAP.

2        Completion Statements

2.1      Pursuant to Clause 7.2, during the 30 Business Days following the
         Seller's receipt of the Completion Statements, the Seller and its
         independent auditors shall be permitted to review the non-proprietary
         working papers relating to such Completion Statements. The Completion
         Statements shall become binding upon the parties and deemed finally
         determined on the 30th Business Day following delivery thereof unless
         the Seller gives notice of its disagreement with the Completion
         Statements (a "Notice of Disagreement") to the Purchaser prior to such
         date. For the avoidance of doubt, the 30 Business Day period referenced
         in this paragraph 2.1 shall not commence until (i) each Completion
         Statement shall have been delivered to the Seller and (ii) the
         non-proprietary working papers relating to each such Completion
         Statement shall have been delivered or made available to the Seller.

2.2      Any Notice of Disagreement shall be in writing and specify with
         reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement and amount disputed so
         asserted, and shall include only disagreements based on (i)
         mathematical errors, (ii) the Closing Working Capital Amount, the Final
         Closing Cash Amount and/or the Final Cash Deferred Income Amount set
         out in the Completion Statements not being calculated in the manner
         provided in the definition(s) thereof or (iii) the amounts recorded in
         the line items reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet not being
         obtained from and in accordance with the Books and Records or in
         accordance with the Accounting Policies.

2.3      During the 20 Business Day period following the delivery of a Notice of
         Disagreement, the Seller and the Purchaser shall seek in good faith to
         resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to
         the matters specified in such Notice of Disagreement and to agree on
         final Completion Statements. During such period the Purchaser and its
         independent auditors shall have access to the non-proprietary working
         papers prepared in connection with such Notice of Disagreement. For the
         avoidance of doubt, the 20 Business Day period referenced in this
         paragraph 2.3 shall not commence until the non-proprietary working
         papers prepared in connection with such Notice of Disagreement shall
         have been delivered or made available to the Purchaser.

2.4      At the end of such 20 Business Day period, if the Seller and the
         Purchaser have not otherwise agreed, the Seller and the Purchaser shall
         submit to a nationally recognised independent public accounting firm in
         the United Kingdom as shall be reasonably agreed upon by the parties
         hereto in writing or in default of agreement, nominated by the
         President for the time being of the Institute of Chartered Accountants
         in England and Wales (the "Accounting Firm") for expert determination
         any and all matters that remain in dispute and were properly included
         in such Notice of Disagreement, in each case in the form of a written
         brief, copied to all parties. The Seller or the Purchaser, as
         applicable, shall have the right to respond in writing to the written
         brief, by submitting such response to the other party and the
         Accounting Firm. The Seller and the Purchaser shall jointly request
         that each expert determination be conducted in an expedited manner, and
         the Seller and the Purchaser shall, using reasonable endeavours, cause
         the Accounting Firm to render a determination resolving the matters
         submitted thereto within 30 Business Days after submission. The
         Accounting Firm may only resolve those disagreements permitted to be
         asserted in a Notice of Disagreement pursuant to paragraph 2.2 of this
         Schedule 4, and may not make any other determination. The Accounting
         Firm shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator. The determination
         of the Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the parties, and
         judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Accounting Firm
         in any court having jurisdiction over the party against which such
         determination is to be enforced.

2.5      The Seller and the Purchaser shall instruct the Accounting Firm to
         allocate the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm incurred in
         connection with this paragraph 2 such that each party shall bear the
         portion of such fees and expenses incurred by the Accounting Firm in
         connection with matters in respect of which such party has not
         prevailed, and such fees and expenses shall be allocated between the
         Seller and the Purchaser as the Accounting Firm shall so determine.

7.5      Pensions

         7.5.1    The Seller's Pension Scheme and the GPP are the only
                  arrangements (funded or unfunded) under which a Group Company
                  has or could have any Liability for the purpose of providing
                  benefits on retirement or death and no Group Company otherwise
                  has any obligation (whether written or established by custom
                  or established pursuant to an oral promise) to provide any
                  such benefit or to make any payment for the purpose of
                  providing any such benefit.

         7.5.3    The Seller's Pension Scheme is approved as an exempt approved
                  scheme (within the meaning of Chapter I of Part XIV of the
                  Taxes Act), and, to the Seller's knowledge, there is no reason
                  why this approval could be withdrawn.

         7.5.4    There is in force in respect of each employment with each
                  Group Company to which the Seller's Pension Scheme relates an
                  appropriate contracting-out certificate. To the Seller's
                  knowledge, there is no reason why any contracting-out
                  certificate could be cancelled, surrendered or varied.

         7.5.5    Each Group Company and the Seller's Pension Scheme comply and
                  have, to the Seller's knowledge, at all times complied in all
                  material respects with all Laws applicable to the Seller's

                  applied retrospectively.

                  complied in all material respects with its duty to facilitate
                  access to a stakeholder pension scheme (under section 3 of the
                  Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999).

         7.5.7    No claim, dispute, complaint or investigation has arisen which
                  relates to the Seller's Pension Scheme or to the provision of
                  retirement or death benefits in respect of the current and
                  former employees of each Group Company, and, to the Seller's
                  knowledge, there is no reason why any material claim, dispute,
                  complaint or investigation could arise.

         7.5.8    All amounts under the Schedule of Contributions in respect of
                  the Seller's Pension Scheme and under the relevant scheme
                  member's contract of employment and under the schedule of
                  payments in respect of the GPP which are required to be paid
                  prior to Closing have been paid.

         7.5.9    The assets of the Seller's Pension Scheme are not subject to
                  any Lien or charge, and do not include any securities issued
                  by, properties leased to or occupied by, or loans made to the
                  Seller or Crown Castle UK or any connected person (for the
                  purposes of Section 40 of the Pensions Act 1995).

         7.5.10   Prior to Closing, no action has been taken by the Seller or
                  the Seller's Pension Scheme which has resulted in or could
                  result in the Seller's Pension Scheme being amended, closed,
                  terminated or wound up in whole or in part.

         7.5.11   All lump sum death in service benefits (with the exception of
                  a refund of contributions) in respect of Relevant Employees
                  are fully insured.

         7.5.12   No payment or repayment of any of the assets of any
                  occupational pension scheme or cancellation of any outstanding
                  payment to an occupational pension scheme has been made to or
                  for the benefit of a Group Company.

         7.5.13   An announcement substantially in the form of the draft
                  announcement disclosed to the Purchaser, pursuant to Section
                  4.10.26(ix) of the Disclosure Letter, has been sent to all
                  members of the Seller's Pension Scheme who were affected by
                  the amendments set out therein.

         7.5.14   The early retirement provisions of the Seller's Pension
                  Scheme, including actuarial reduction factors, were, as at the
                  date on which former members of the BBC Pension Scheme joined
                  the Seller's Pension Scheme, identical to the early retirement
                  provisions which were applicable to such members under the BBC
                  Pension Scheme immediately prior to their ceasing membership
                  of that scheme.

         Company.

         liability the consideration for which was or will be otherwise than on
         an arm's-length basis, nor has it agreed to do so, where the relevant

         person being or having been a member of the same group of companies.
