Current Reports on Form 8-K, forms, schedules, statements and other documents
required to be filed or furnished by Buyer with or to the SEC, as applicable,
pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act (the "Buyer SEC
Documents"), have been timely filed or furnished in accordance with the rules
and regulations of the SEC. All such Buyer SEC Documents (i) complied as to
form in all material respects in accordance with the requirements of the
Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations thereunder and (ii) as of its filing date in the case of any
Exchange Act report and as of its effective date in the case of any Securities
Act filing, did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which

internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)
as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Buyer's disclosure controls
and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by Buyer in the reports that it files under the
Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such

of operations, cash flows and changes in partners' equity of the entities to
which such Buyer Financial Statements relate, on the basis set forth therein

accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of
unaudited financial statements, as permitted by Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X)
and subject, in the case of interim financial statements, to normal year-end
adjustments.

Section 7.17. MLP Status. Buyer is properly treated as a partnership for
United States federal income tax purposes and more than 90% of Buyer's current
gross income is qualifying income under Section 7704(d) of the Code. Buyer is
not, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a partnership that would be treated

compensation paid or potentially payable to any Arrow ND Employee; or (vi)
hire any new Arrow ND Employee unless necessary to replace any Arrow ND
Employee whose employment has been terminated as permitted herein; provided,
however, that in such instance the base pay and other compensation paid and
payable to such new Arrow ND Employee shall be no greater than the base pay
and other compensation paid to the Arrow ND Employee that he or she replaced.

Section 9.6. Confidentiality.

(a) The Confidentiality Agreement will remain in full force and effect, except
to the extent any provision thereof would prohibit actions contemplated by the
terms of this Agreement (including disclosures to any potential Financing
Sources, it being acknowledged and agreed that all potential Financing Sources
shall be treated as "Additional Financing Sources" for all purposes under the
Confidentiality Agreement); provided, however, that, subject to the provisions
of Section 9.10, upon Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate,
and the Member Representative shall, and shall cause the Members and their
Affiliates to, not use or make disclosure to third parties of any confidential
or proprietary information relating to a Target Company or the Properties,
except (i) with the prior consent of Buyer, (ii) as required by Applicable
Law, or (iii) to the employees, directors, officers, representatives and
advisors of each Member and each of their Affiliates; provided, further, that
nothing shall prohibit the Members or their respective Affiliates from using
their general knowledge of the industry or geographic area in the conduct of
their respective businesses following Closing.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use Reasonable Efforts to cause
each of the counterparties to the Contracts set forth on Section 1.1(e) of the
Disclosure Schedule (the "Bidder Confidentiality Agreements") to return or
destroy all confidential or proprietary information relating to a Target
Company or the Properties that is subject to such Bidder Confidentiality
Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof. From and after the Closing,
the Members shall (and shall cause any designee to which any such Bidder
Confidentiality Agreement is conveyed in accordance with Section 9.3 to) (i)
use Reasonable Efforts to cause any such information that was not returned or
destroyed prior to the Closing to be returned or destroyed, (ii) not waive the
terms of or release any Person from liability under any of the Bidder
Confidentiality Agreements with respect to any such information, and (iii) at
the request of Buyer (and at Buyer's costs and expense), take all other
actions to enforce in full the terms of each of the Bidder Confidentiality
Agreements with respect to such information.

Section 9.7. Indemnification of Managers and Officers. Buyer agrees that all
rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, existing as of the Execution
Date in favor of the Seller Indemnified Parties as provided in the Target
Companies' respective certificates of formation, operating agreements or other
organizational documents or in any agreement shall survive the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect for
a period of not less than six years following the Effective Time. For a period
of six years from the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the Company to
maintain in effect any and all exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses provisions of the Company's and any of the Company Subsidiaries'
certificates of formation, operating agreements or similar organizational
documents in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or in any
indemnification agreements of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries with any
of the Seller Indemnified Parties in effect immediately prior to the Execution
Date (to the extent that same has been fully disclosed to Buyer and full and
complete copies thereof have been delivered to Buyer prior to the Execution
Date), and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions or
the exculpation, indemnification or advancement of expenses provisions of the
Surviving Company's Governing Documents in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any individual who immediately before the
Effective Time was an Arrow Release Party; provided, however, that all rights
to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses in respect of any
Proceeding pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall
continue until the disposition of such Proceeding or resolution of such claim.

Section 9.8. Employee Matters.

(e) For a period of one year following the termination of the Transition
Services Agreement ("TSA Termination Date"), Buyer shall or shall cause the
Surviving Company to maintain for Arrow ND Employees who continue in the
employ of Buyer or any of the Target Companies following the TSA Termination
Date ("Continuing Employees"), (i) a base salary or wages that are no less
favorable than, (ii) variable/incentive/bonus pay programs that are
substantially similar in value (excluding any value attributable to equity and
equity-based compensation) to, and in any event no less favorable than, and
(iii) other benefit plans and arrangements that are substantially comparable
in the aggregate to, in each of clauses (i) and (ii), those provided to the
Continuing Employees by the Company immediately prior to the Closing and, in
the case of clause (iii), those provided to similarly situated employees of
Buyer and its Affiliates. This Section 9.8 shall not limit the obligation of
Buyer to maintain any compensation arrangement or benefit plan that, pursuant
to an existing contract, must be maintained for a period longer than one year.
No provision of this Agreement shall be construed as a guarantee of continued
employment of any Continuing Employee and this Agreement shall not be
construed so as to prohibit the Buyer or any of the Target Companies from
having the right to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee,
provided that any such termination is effected in accordance with Applicable
Law.

(f) From and after the TSA Termination Date, Buyer shall give each Continuing
Employee full credit for all purposes (including for purposes of eligibility
to participate, level of benefits, early retirement eligibility and early
retirement subsidies, vesting and benefit accrual) under any employee benefit
plans, arrangements, collective agreements and employment-related entitlements
(including under any applicable 401(k), savings, medical, dental, life
insurance, vacation, long-service leave or other leave entitlements, post-
retirement health and life insurance, termination indemnity, severance or
separation pay plans) provided, sponsored, maintained or contributed to by
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries for such Continuing Employee's service with
the Target Companies, and with any predecessor employer, to the same extent
recognized by the Target Companies, except to the extent such credit would
result in the duplication of benefits for the same period of service.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted under Applicable Law,
Buyer shall not be required to provide credit for such service for benefit
accrual purposes under any employee benefit plan of Buyer other than vacation
or severance plans.

(g) Buyer shall (i) waive for each Continuing Employee and his or her
dependents, any waiting period provision, payment requirement to avoid a
waiting period, pre-existing condition limitation, and any other restriction
that would prevent immediate or full participation under the welfare plans of
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries applicable to such Continuing Employee (other
than actively-at work requirements with respect to disability and life
insurance plans) to the extent such waiting period, pre-existing condition
limitation, actively-at-work requirement or other restriction would not have
been applicable to such Continuing Employee under the terms of the welfare
plans of the Target Companies, and (ii) give full credit under the welfare
plans of Buyer and its Subsidiaries applicable to each Continuing Employee and
his or her dependents for all co-payments and deductibles satisfied prior to
the Closing in the same plan year as the Closing (but not any lifetime
maximums), as if there had been a single continuous employer.

(h) Nothing in this Agreement shall (i) amend, or be deemed to amend, any
Employee Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit or compensation plan,
program, policy, practice or arrangement or restrict any authority to amend or
terminate any of the foregoing or (ii) provide any Person not a party to this
Agreement with any right, benefit or remedy with regard to any Employee
Benefit Plan or other employee benefit or compensation plan, program, policy,
practice, or otherwise.

Section 9.9. Taxes.

(f) Tax Treatment. Buyer and the Members each hereby acknowledge and agree
that for federal income tax purposes the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are intended to be treated as an "assets-over" partnership merger
transaction under Treasury Regulations Sections 1.708-1(c)(1) and
1.708-1(c)(3)(i), wherein the Company shall merge with and into Merger Sub,
resulting in the termination of the Company and the continued existence of
Buyer as the resulting partnership. Under the "assets-over" form, the
transactions contemplated pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for U.S.
federal, and applicable state and local, income Tax purposes as an exchange
described in Section 721(a) of the Code to the extent the Cash Merger
Consideration does not exceed the amount of the Company's capital expenditures
described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-4(d). If the Cash Merger
Consideration exceeds the amount of the Company's capital expenditures
described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-4(d), then the contribution of
the Properties in exchange for the consideration delivered pursuant to Article
III will be treated in part as an exchange described in Section 721(a) of the
Code and in part as a disguised sale transaction described in Section
707(a)(2)(B) of the Code (a "Disguised Sale"). Each of Buyer, the Member
Representative and the Members agree to prepare and file all U.S. federal
income Tax Returns in accordance with the foregoing and shall not take any
position inconsistent therewith on any such Tax Return, or in the course of
any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to U.S. federal income
Taxes, except as otherwise required by Applicable Laws following a final
determination by a court of competent jurisdiction or other final
administrative decision by an applicable Governmental Entity.

(g) Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes.

(i) With respect to each Tax Return of a Target Company covering only a Pre-
Closing Date Tax Period that is required to be filed after the Closing Date
(each, a "Pre-Closing Tax Return"), the Member Representative shall (i) cause
such Pre-Closing Tax Return to be prepared and (ii) deliver a copy of such
Pre-Closing Tax Return, together with copies of pertinent supporting
documentation and workpapers, to Buyer for Buyer's review and reasonable
comment at least 30 days prior to the due date for filing any such Pre-Closing
Tax Return. Should Buyer have any comments, they must be provided to the
Member Representative no later than 20 days prior to the due date for filing
any such Pre-Closing Tax Return. The Member Representative or the Target
Companies and Buyer, as applicable, shall cause such Pre-Closing Tax Return
(as revised to incorporate Buyer's reasonable comments) to be filed timely
with the appropriate Governmental Entity and shall provide a copy to each
other party. At the election of the Member Representative, (x) the Buyer and
the Member Representative shall promptly (but in any event not later than five
days prior to the due date for payment of Taxes with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Return) issue joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Account a number of
Common Units equal to the quotient of Member Taxes owed with respect to such
Pre-Closing Tax Return (up to a maximum amount equal to the Escrow Amount)
divided by the Closing Date Common Unit Value to Buyer within three days of
receipt of such joint written instructions and Buyer shall pay such Tax, or
(y) the Members shall promptly (but in any event not later than five days
prior to the due date for payment of Taxes with respect to any such Pre-
Closing Tax Return) pay an amount equal to the amount of Member Taxes owed
with respect to such Pre-Closing Tax Return to Buyer.

(ii) With respect to each Tax Return of a Target Company covering a Straddle
Period that is required to be filed after the Closing Date (each, a "Straddle
Period Tax Return"), Buyer and such Target Company shall (i) cause such
Straddle Period Tax Return to be prepared and (ii) deliver a copy of such
Straddle Period Tax Return to the Member Representative for the Member
Representative's review and reasonable comment at least 30 days prior to the
due date for filing any such Straddle Period Tax Return. Should Member
Representative have any comments, they must be provided to the Buyer no later
than 20 days prior to the due date for filing any such Straddle Period Tax
Return. Buyer and such Target Company shall cause such Straddle Period Tax
Return (as revised to incorporate the Member Representative's reasonable
comments) to be filed timely with the appropriate Governmental Entity and
shall provide a copy to the Member Representative. At the election of the
Member Representative, (x) the Buyer and the Member Representative shall
promptly (but in any event not later than five days prior to the due date for
payment of Taxes with respect to any Straddle Period Tax Return) issue joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
release from the Escrow Account a number of Common Units equal to the quotient
of Member Taxes owed with respect to such Straddle Period Tax Return (up to a
maximum amount equal to the Escrow Amount), divided by the Closing Date Common
Unit Value, to Buyer within three days of receipt of such joint written
instructions and Buyer shall pay such Tax, or (y) the Members shall promptly
(but in any event not later than five days prior to the due date for payment
of Taxes with respect to any such Straddle Period Tax Return) pay an amount
equal to the amount of Member Taxes owed with respect to such Straddle Period
Tax Return to Buyer. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall pay all other
Taxes shown on such Straddle Period Tax Return that are not Member Taxes.

(iii) In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to any Straddle
Period of the Company, for purposes of allocating such Taxes between that
portion of the Straddle Period ending on or before the Closing Date (the "Pre-
Closing Date Straddle Period") and that portion of the Straddle Period
beginning after the Closing Date (the "Post-Closing Date Straddle Period"),
the portion of such Taxes related to the Pre-Closing Date Straddle Period will
be deemed to be:

(A) in the case of income Taxes, franchise and margin Taxes, Taxes measured in
whole or in part by reference to gross revenues or receipts, excise,
employment, gross receipts and other similar Taxes, sales and use Taxes and
Taxes imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of
property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), equal to the amount that
would be payable if the taxable year of the Company terminated based on an
interim closing of the books as of the Closing Date, and based on accounting
methods, elections and conventions that do not have the effect of distorting
income and expenses; provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions that
are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization
deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on and including the
Closing Date and the period beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to
the number of days in each period; and

(B) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to
the assets or capital of the Target Companies, equal to the amount of such
Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined
on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding
period), multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Date Straddle
Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle
Period.

All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations will
be made in a manner consistent with the past practice of the Target Companies
with respect to such items, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law.

(h) Tax Refunds. The amount of any refunds of Taxes of the Target Companies
for any Pre-Closing Date Tax Period (other than any refund resulting from the
carryback of a net operating loss or other Tax attribute from a period
beginning after the Closing Date to a period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date, which refund shall be for the account of Buyer) shall be for the account
of the Members. The amount of any refunds of Taxes of the Target Companies for
any period beginning after the Closing Date shall be for the account of Buyer.
The amount of any refund of Taxes of the Target Companies for any Straddle
Period shall be equitably apportioned between the Buyer and the Members in
accordance with the principles set forth in Section 9.9(b)(iii). Each party
shall forward, and shall cause its Affiliates to forward, to the party
entitled to receive a refund of Tax pursuant to this Section 9.9(c) the amount
of such refund within 30 days after such refund is received, net any costs or
expenses incurred by such party or its Affiliates in procuring such refund.

(i) Allocation of Consideration.

(i) The Parties agree that the Base Merger Consideration (plus the liabilities
of each Target Company to the extent properly taken into account under Section
1060 of the Code) will be allocated among the Properties in conformity with
Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Within ten
(10) Business Days following the Execution Date, the Member Representative
shall deliver to Buyer the Members' preliminary allocation of the Base Merger
Consideration (plus the liabilities of each Target Company to the extent
properly taken into account under Section 1060 of the Code) among the
Properties in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code (as adjusted from time
to time pursuant to this Section 9.9(d), the "Allocation Schedule"). Not later
than 30 days after the Closing, the Member Representative shall deliver to
Buyer any proposed changes to the Allocation Schedule (the "Allocation
Statement"). If, within 20 days after the delivery of the Member
Representative's proposed changes, Buyer notifies the Member Representative in
writing that Buyer objects, Buyer and the Member Representative shall use
Reasonable Efforts to resolve such dispute within 20 days. In the event that
Buyer and the Member Representative are unable to resolve such dispute within
20 days, Buyer and the Member Representative shall jointly retain a mutually
agreeable, nationally recognized accounting firm (that does not have a
material relationship with either Buyer or the Member Representative, or any
of their respective Affiliates) (the "Tax Allocation Referee") to resolve the
disputed items. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Buyer and the
Member Representative (and the Tax Allocation Referee, if applicable) shall
resolve all disputed items within thirty days of retaining the Tax Allocation
Referee. The fees and expenses payable to the Tax Allocation Referee shall be
split equally between Buyer and the Member Representative. Upon resolution of
the disputed items, the allocation reflected on the Allocation Statement shall
be adjusted to reflect such resolution. Buyer and the Member Representative
agree to (i) be bound by the Allocation Statement and (ii) act in accordance
with the Allocation Statement in the preparation, filing and audit of any Tax
Return except as otherwise required by applicable Law. If any Taxing authority
disputes the allocations set forth in the Allocation Statement, the Party
receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the other parties hereto
of such dispute and the parties hereto shall cooperate in good faith in
responding to such dispute in order to preserve the effectiveness of the
allocations set forth in the Allocation Schedule. Buyer and the Member
Representative shall revise the Allocation Schedule in a manner consistent
with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder upon the
occurrence of any adjustment to the Base Merger Consideration pursuant to this
Agreement.

(ii) For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer and the Members agree that the
Allocation Statement shall be used for purposes of allocating (A) the
consideration that is properly considered to have been received by the Company
in a Disguised Sale among the portion of Properties that are treated as sold
in such Disguised Sale and (B) the fair market value of the Properties that
are treated as contributed to Buyer under Section 721(a) of the Code,
including for purposes of applying Section 704(c) of the Code to such
Properties. The variation between the fair market value of such contributed
Properties and the adjusted tax basis of such Properties will be taken into
account under the "remedial method" as described in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-3(d).

(j) Cooperation. The Member Representative, the Members and Buyer agree to
furnish to each other, at the requesting Party's expense, any and all
information and documents reasonably required to comply with Tax and financial
reporting requirements and audits.

(k) Survival. The covenants contained in this Section 9.9 shall survive the
Closing for a period of sixty (60) days following the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations.

(l) Indemnification Claims. Any claim for indemnification pursuant to this
Section 9.9 shall be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 13.4.

Section 9.10. Press Releases. Unless consultation is prohibited by Applicable
Law, and except in connection with the Buyer Financing pursuant to Section
9.14, Buyer and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any
press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation
(but no approval thereof shall be required). Unless required by Applicable
Law, for the avoidance of doubt, any press release or other public disclosure
authorized or permitted pursuant to this Section 9.10 shall only refer to the
Company and not any Member or their Affiliates.

Section 9.11. Books and Records. At or promptly after Closing, (i) the Company
shall deliver to Buyer all records relating to the Business and the Properties
that are in the Company's or its Affiliate's control, including original
minute books and other corporate books and records and accounts and (ii) the
Company will deliver to Buyer all of the rights-of-way easements, rights-of-
way option agreements, files, assignments, operating records and agreements,
engineering records, financial and accounting records, and other similar files
and records of the Target Companies which directly relate to the Properties.

Section 9.12. Reasonable Efforts; Further Assurances.

(f) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party hereto
will use its Reasonable Efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or desirable to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(g) After Closing, Buyer and the Member Representative agree to take such
further actions and to execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further
documents as are reasonably requested by the other Party for carrying out the
purposes of this Agreement or of any document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement, including each Party's obligation to deliver certain documents or
instructions that are contemplated by the Escrow Agreement and all other
agreements to be executed by the Parties in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 9.13. Title Policies. The Company shall cooperate with Buyer in
obtaining an owner's title insurance policy or leasehold title insurance
policy issued by a title company acceptable to Buyer, with respect to the Real
Property so that such title insurance policies can be issued to Buyer as
promptly as practicable following Closing. The cost of such title insurance
policies will be for the account of Buyer. In this connection therewith, the
Target Companies shall enter into any customary and reasonable affidavits
(including a non-imputation endorsement) and indemnities as may be reasonably
required by the title company to issue such title insurance policies.

Section 9.14. Assistance with Buyer Financing and Securities Filings. From and
after the Execution Date and at any applicable time until the nine-month
anniversary of the Closing Date:

(a) The Member Representative and the Company shall use Reasonable Efforts and
shall cause the Target Companies and their respective employees, agents and
representatives to use Reasonable Efforts to provide to Buyer all cooperation
reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with the arrangement of any bridge
or other debt or equity financing entered into by Buyer in connection with the
Closing and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Buyer
Financing"), including using Reasonable Efforts to cause such Persons to, upon
the reasonable request of Buyer and at Buyer's expense, to (i) furnish to
Buyer and its Financing Sources, as promptly as practicable, all financial,
business and other pertinent information related to the Target Companies
reasonably required by Buyer for Buyer to consummate the Buyer Financing,
including all required audited and unaudited financial statements and other
data and information, including a description of the business, of the type and
in the form required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities
Act and of type and in the form customarily included in an offering memorandum
or offering circular under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, (ii) furnish
consents (including any representation letters), comfort letters and legal
opinions as reasonably requested by Buyer, (iii) reasonably cooperate with the
marketing efforts of Buyer and the Financing Sources for any portion of the
Buyer Financing and participate in due diligence sessions with Financing
Sources, (iv) take corporate actions by the Target Companies reasonably
necessary to permit the completion of the Buyer Financing, and (v) facilitate
the execution and delivery (at the Closing) of definitive documents related to
the Buyer Financing as may reasonably be requested by Buyer. Buyer
acknowledges that obtaining the Buyer Financing in connection with the Closing
is not a condition to Buyer complying with its obligations under this
Agreement, including closing the transactions contemplated herein following
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions in Section 10.1.

(b) The Members and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, furnish all information about the Members, the Target Companies
and the Business, and all necessary financial information to Buyer as Buyer
may reasonably request in connection with the preparation and filing of any
filings that Buyer may be required to make with the SEC under Applicable Law
that includes information regarding the Members, the Target Companies or the
Business (the "Required Buyer Filings") or in any offering documents used in
connection with the Buyer Financing.

(c) On Buyer's request and at Buyer's expense, the Member Representative and
the Company shall use Reasonable Efforts to obtain the consents of Grant
Thornton LLP, the Company's independent public accountants, to include the
reports of Grant Thornton LLP with respect to any financial statements in the
Required Buyer Filings or in any offering documents used in connection with
any Buyer Financing, each dated as of the filing date of the applicable
Required Buyer Filing or offering document or such other date as reasonably
requested by Buyer. In addition, neither the Members nor the Company will
object to the use of any such financial statements in connection therewith.

(d) On Buyer's request, the Member Representative and the Company shall use
Reasonable Efforts to cause to be delivered to Buyer, at Buyer's expense,
"comfort" letters of Grant Thornton LLP, each dated as of the filing date of
the applicable Required Buyer Filing or in any offering documents used in
connection with any Buyer Financing or such other date as reasonably requested
by Buyer, and addressed to Buyer or its specified Affiliates with regard to
the financial statements and financial information of the Target Companies
included in, or incorporated by reference in, such Required Buyer Filing or in
any offering documents used in connection with any Buyer Financing, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and customary in scope and
substance for "comfort" letters delivered by independent public accountants in
connection with underwritten public debt or equity offerings.

Section 9.15. Replacement of Sureties, Bonds and Letters of Credit. Buyer and
the Persons listed on Section 9.15(a) of the Disclosure Schedule (the
"Sponsors") will cooperate and use Reasonable Efforts prior to the Closing to
have the letters of credit described in Section 9.15(b) of the Disclosure
Schedule (the "Sponsor Letters of Credit") released at or contemporaneously
with the Closing. Buyer will, to the extent acceptable to and required by the
beneficiary of the Sponsor Letters of Credit, replace the Sponsor Letters of
Credit with one or more comparable letters of credit issued by JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Citibank, N.A., or a
comparable U.S. bank ("Acceptable Issuing Bank") or otherwise provide
substitute credit support in a form acceptable to the beneficiary at or
contemporaneously with the Closing. If the beneficiary does not release the
Sponsor Letters of Credit at or contemporaneously with the Closing, then Buyer
will (i) provide to the Sponsors comparable credit support in a form
acceptable to the Sponsors (which may include one or more letters of credit
issued by Acceptable Issuing Banks) at or contemporaneously with the Closing
for purposes of backstopping the payment or reimbursement obligations of the
Sponsors under the Sponsor Letters of Credit following the Closing, and (ii)
use Reasonable Efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, a release of the
Sponsor Letters of Credit following the Closing. Buyer agrees that the
Sponsors will have no obligation to extend the expiration date of the Sponsor
Letters of Credit.

Section 9.16. Litigation and Regulatory Cooperation. For a period of eighteen
(18) months following the Closing Date, at the Surviving Company's sole cost
and expense:

(d) The Members shall cooperate with the Surviving Company in the
investigation, defense or prosecution of any Proceedings or matters now in
existence or which may arise in the future against or on behalf of the Target
Companies which relate to events or occurrences that transpired or commenced
prior to Closing. The Members' cooperation in connection with such Proceedings
shall include, but not be limited to, being available at mutually convenient
times and with reasonable advance notice to meet with counsel to prepare for
discovery or trial and to act as a witness on behalf of the applicable Target
Company.

(e) The Members shall cooperate with the Surviving Company in any
investigation, defense, prosecution or remedial action respecting compliance
by the Target Companies or the Business with regulatory requirements
promulgated by applicable Governmental Entities to the extent such
investigation, defense, prosecution or remedial action relates to events or
circumstances that transpired or commenced prior to Closing.

(f) The Members shall to the extent reasonably necessary for the Surviving
Company to conduct its Business or for Buyer to address any claims relating to
the Business, provide access to the Surviving Company, Buyer and their
respective representatives to all of the records relating to the Business or
the Properties which were retained as Excluded Properties.

Section 9.17. Updated Disclosure Schedules; Notification.



(a)The Parties agree that, with respect to the representations, warranties and
covenants of such Party contained in this Agreement, such Party shall have the
continuing right and obligation until the Closing to supplement or amend the
Disclosure Schedules with respect to any matter hereafter arising or
discovered which, if existing or known at the date of this Agreement, would
have been required to be set forth or described on such Disclosure Schedule.
For all purposes of this Agreement, including without limitation for purposes
of determining whether the conditions set forth in Article X have been
fulfilled, the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to include only that
information contained therein on the Execution Date and shall be deemed to
exclude all information contained in any supplement or amendment thereto.

(b)Each Party shall give to the others prompt notice of (i) any representation
or warranty made by it or contained in this Agreement that, to such Party's
Knowledge, has become untrue or inaccurate, (ii) the failure by it to comply
with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement and (iii) any notice or other
communication from any third party alleging that the consent of such third
party is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

Section 9.18. Custodial Account. At or prior to Closing, the Members shall
enter into a custody agreement (the "Custody Agreement") with respect to the
Common Units to be delivered in accordance with Section 3.2(b)(i). The Custody
Agreement shall provide that the Member Representative, or any Person
designated as the custodian under the Custody Agreement, shall hold the
applicable Common Units in a brokerage account at a nationally recognized
financial institution on behalf of the Members or their designees for a period
of 180 days after Closing. The Members agree that for a period of 180 days
after Closing they shall not (i) offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell
any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell,
grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, lend, or otherwise transfer or
dispose of, directly or indirectly, the Common Units held under the Custody
Agreement or (ii) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to
another Person, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of
ownership of the Common Units held under the Custody Agreement, whether any
such transaction described in clause (i) or (ii) is to be settled by delivery
of such Common Units or such other securities, in cash or otherwise.

Closing Date as if made on and as of such date except (i) as affected by

basis restrains, enjoins or invalidates the transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) All Liens securing the Credit Facility and the Equipment Finance Lease and
any Debt shall have been released and/or terminated;

transactions contemplated hereby abandoned at any time prior to the Closing in
the following manner:

(g) by mutual written consent of the Member Representative and Buyer; or

(h) by the Member Representative if the Closing has not occurred on or before
December 31, 2013, upon written notice delivered to Buyer; provided, however,
that the Member Representative shall not be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.1(b) in the event that the Company's
actions have been the cause of the Closing failing to occur by such date; or

(i) by Buyer if the Closing has not occurred on or before December 31, 2013,
upon written notice delivered to the Member Representative; provided, however,
that Buyer shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 11.1(c) in the event that the Buyer's actions have been the cause of
the Closing failing to occur by such date; or

(j) by the Member Representative, in the event that any of Buyer or Merger Sub
has breached or otherwise violated any of its covenants under this Agreement
or any of the representations and warranties of Buyer or Merger Sub set forth
in this Agreement have become inaccurate, which, in either case, (i) would
result in a failure of the condition set forth in Sections 10.2(a) or 10.2(b)
and (ii) are incapable of being cured or have not been cured within thirty
(30) days after Buyer or Merger Sub receives written notice of such breach or
violation from the Company; provided, however, that the Company is not in
material breach of its representations, warranties or covenants under this
Agreement; or

(k) by Buyer, in the event that the Company has breached or otherwise violated
any covenants under this Agreement or any of the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement have become inaccurate,
which, in either case, (i) would result in a failure of the condition set
forth in Sections 10.1(a) or 10.1(b) and (ii) are incapable of being cured or
have not been cured within thirty (30) days after the Company receives written
notice of such breach or violation from Buyer; provided, however, that none of
Buyer or Merger Sub is then in material breach of its representations,
warranties or covenants under this Agreement; or

(l) by Buyer or the Member Representative if any Governmental Entity shall
have (i) enacted, issued or promulgated any Applicable Law that is in effect
and has the effect of making the transactions contemplated hereby illegal or
which has the effect of prohibiting or otherwise preventing the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) issued or granted any
injunction or other order that is final and non-appealable prohibiting or
otherwise preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 11.2. Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1 by the Company, on the one hand, or Buyer,
on the other, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other
Party specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is
made, and this Agreement shall become void and have no effect, except that the
agreements contained in this Article XI, Section 9.2 (Exculpation and
Indemnification), Section 9.6(a) (Confidentiality), Section 15.1 (Parties Bear
Own Expenses/No Special Damages), Section 15.4 (Choice of Law, Jurisdiction,

(Severability), Section 15.11 (Waiver), Section 15.12 (No Third Party

Party from liability for damages actually incurred as a result of any breach
of this Agreement prior to December 31, 2013. The actual or alleged
unavailability of funding from any source shall not excuse Buyer's failure to
perform its obligations under this Agreement.

Article XII. 

Merger Consideration Adjustments

Section 12.1. Initial Adjustment at Closing. At least five (5) days before the
Closing Date, the Company shall provide to Buyer (i) the Company's good faith
estimated balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date (the "Estimated
Closing Date Balance Sheet"); (ii) the Company's good faith estimate of the
Net Working Capital of the Company as of the Closing Date (the "Estimated Net
Working Capital"), (iii) the Company's good faith estimate of the Target
Companies' Capital Expenditures as of the Closing Date (the "Estimated
Reimbursable Capital Expenditures") and (iv) the Company's good faith estimate
of the Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount (the "Estimated Merger
Consideration Adjustment Amount"). The Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet,
the Estimated Net Working Capital, the Estimated Reimbursable Capital
Expenditures and the Estimated Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount
(collectively, the "Estimated Closing Items") shall be prepared on a basis
consistent with the definitions of Current Assets and Current Liabilities and
the methodology set forth on or used in the preparation of the Net Working
Capital illustration attached as Exhibit 1.1(a). The Company shall furnish to
Buyer, together with such computations, copies of back-up and other supporting
information that reasonably supports such computations. If Buyer, in good
faith, objects to any portion of the Estimated Closing Items, it will notify
the Company in writing (setting forth, in reasonable detail, the reasons for
such objections and, to the extent reasonably determinable by Buyer, Buyer's
computation of the adjustments to the Estimated Merger Consideration
Adjustment Amount) within three (3) days of receipt of the Estimated Closing
Items and the Company and Buyer will endeavor in good faith to resolve any
disputed matters prior to the Closing Date. If the Company and Buyer resolve
all disputed matters prior to the Closing Date, the Estimated Merger
Consideration Adjustment Amount used for purposes of calculating the Closing
Payment will be that mutually agreed upon amount. If the Company and Buyer are
unable to so resolve all disputed matters prior to Closing, the Estimated
Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount used for purposes of calculating the
Closing Payment will be based on the Estimated Closing Items originally
delivered by the Company as modified by any changes proposed by Buyer and
agreed upon by the Company and any further adjustments and the resolution of
such disputed amounts will be made only in accordance with Section 12.2. If
the Estimated Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount is a positive number, the
Cash Merger Consideration shall be increased by an amount equal to the
Estimated Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount. If the Estimated Merger
Consideration Adjustment Amount is a negative number, the Equity Merger
Consideration shall be decreased by an amount equal to the quotient of such
shortfall divided by the Closing Date Common Unit Value. The Cash Merger
Consideration plus the Estimated Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount, if
positive, shall constitute the Cash Dollar amount to be paid by Buyer at the
Closing (the "Closing Payment").

Section 12.2. Adjustment Post Closing.

(r) On or before sixty (60) days after Closing, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to the Member Representative (i) a balance sheet of the Company as of
the Closing Date (the "Final Closing Date Balance Sheet"); (ii) Buyer's
calculation of the Net Working Capital of the Company as of the Closing Date
(the "Final Net Working Capital"); (iii) Buyer's calculation of the Target
Companies' Capital Expenditures as of the Closing Date (the "Final
Reimbursable Capital Expenditures"); (iv) Buyer's calculation of the Merger
Consideration Adjustment Amount (the "Final Merger Consideration Adjustment
Amount"); and (v) in each case, together with a worksheet showing the
difference, if any, between any Estimated Closing Item and the corresponding
Final Closing Item (as defined below). The Final Closing Date Balance Sheet,
the Final Net Working Capital, the Final Reimbursable Capital Expenditures and
the Final Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount (collectively, the "Final
Closing Items") shall be prepared in accordance with the methodology used in
the preparation of the Estimated Closing Items.

(s) The Member Representative will assist Buyer in the preparation of the
Final Closing Items by providing Buyer with any data or information within the
Member Representative's control that is reasonably requested by Buyer. The
Final Closing Items shall become final and binding upon the Parties on the
thirtieth (30th) day following receipt thereof by the Member Representative,
unless the Member Representative gives written notice of its disagreement to
Buyer prior to such date. In order to be valid, any such notice shall specify
in reasonable detail the dollar amount, nature and basis of any disagreement
so asserted. If the Final Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 12.2 exceeds the Estimated Merger
Consideration Adjustment Amount, Buyer shall promptly deliver to the Member
Representative, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account(s) designated by the Member Representative, and the Member
Representative shall distribute to the Members their pro rata amounts equal to
such excess within five (5) Business Days after the Final Closing Date Balance
Sheet becomes final. If the Estimated Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount
exceeds the Final Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount as finally determined
pursuant to this Section 12.2, the Member Representative and Buyer shall,
within five (5) Business Days after the Final Closing Items become final,
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent directing it to release
to Buyer out of the Escrow Account a number of Common Units equal to such
excess amount (the "Excess Payment"). The number of Common Units to be
distributed shall be equal to the quotient of the Excess Payment divided by
the Closing Date Common Unit Value. If the Final Merger Consideration
Adjustment Amount as finally determined pursuant to this Section 12.2 is equal
to the Estimated Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount, neither the Member
Representative nor Buyer shall have any further obligation under this Section
12.2.

(t) If Buyer and the Member Representative cannot agree upon the Final Closing
Items, the Dispute shall be submitted to an independent public accounting firm
mutually agreed upon by Buyer and the Member Representative (in either case,
the "Independent Expert"), which firm shall make a final and binding
determination as to all matters in dispute relating to the calculations set
forth in the Final Closing Items as promptly as practicable after its
appointment. Within three (3) Business Days of referring the Dispute to the
Independent Expert for resolution, the Parties shall submit one copy to the
accounting firm of (i) this Agreement, with specific reference to this Section
12.2, (ii) the Final Closing Items, together with the supporting documents
that were provided to the Member Representative, (iii) a written copy of the
Dispute, (iv) the Member Representative's response to the Final Closing Items,
together with the supporting documents that were provided to Buyer and (v) the
Buyer's response to the Final Closing Items, together with the supporting
documents that were provided to the Member Representative. The Independent
Expert shall resolve such Dispute based only on the foregoing submissions.
Buyer and the Member Representative shall not have the right to (i) submit
additional documentation to the Independent Expert or (ii) demand discovery on
the other Party. The Independent Expert shall send its written determination
(such written determination, the "Final Settlement Statement") of the
adjustments provided for in this Section 12.2 to Buyer and the Member
Representative, together with a calculation of the Final Merger Consideration
Adjustment Amount that results from such determination, and such determination
of the Independent Expert, and the resulting calculations of the adjustments
provided for in this Section 12.2 shall be binding on the Parties, absent
fraud or manifest error; provided, however, that in no event shall the
Independent Expert assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value
for such items claimed by either Party or less than the smallest value for
such items claimed by either Party. The fees and expenses of the Independent
Expert shall be borne equally by Buyer and the Member Representative.

Article XIII. 

Indemnification

Section 13.1. Indemnification by Buyer.

(u) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold each
Member and each of the current officers, directors and managers of the Target
Companies (and their Affiliates, their respective successors and permitted
assigns and their respective directors, officers and managers) (collectively,
the "Seller Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against any and all
Damages (individually, a "Member Indemnified Claim" and, collectively,
"Members' Indemnified Claims") to the extent arising out of or related to (i)
any misrepresentation or breach of any warranty of Buyer or Merger Sub
contained in this Agreement that survives Closing or (ii) any breach of any
covenant or agreement of Buyer or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement that
survives the Closing.

(v) THE FOREGOING ASSUMPTIONS AND INDEMNIFICATIONS BY BUYER SHALL APPLY
WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DUTIES, OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILITIES, OR SUCH CLAIMS,
ACTIONS, CAUSES OF ACTION, LIABILITIES, DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS OR EXPENSES
ARISE OUT OF (i) NEGLIGENCE (INCLUDING SOLE NEGLIGENCE, SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE,
CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE, BUT EXPRESSLY NOT
INCLUDING GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT) OF ANY INDEMNITEE, (ii)
STRICT LIABILITY, OR (iii) ANY VIOLATION OF ANY LAW, RULE, REGULATION OR ORDER
RELATED TO THE OWNERSHIP OR OPERATION OF THE PROPERTIES, INCLUDING APPLICABLE
ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS.

Section 13.2. Indemnification by the Members.

(m) From and after Closing, the Members shall, jointly and severally, defend,
indemnify and hold Buyer (and its Affiliates, their respective successors and
permitted assigns and their respective directors, officers and managers)
(collectively, "Buyer Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against any and
all Damages (along with any claim by Buyer under Section 13.2(b) individually
a "Buyer's Indemnified Claim" and collectively "Buyer's Indemnified Claims")
to the extent arising out of or related to (%4) any misrepresentation or
breach of any warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement that
survives the Closing, (%4) any breach of any covenant or agreement of a Target
Company contained in this Agreement that survives the Closing, (%4) the
Retained Liabilities, (%4) any and all Member Taxes, (%3) Pre-Closing Casualty
Losses or (%3) Environmental Defects.

(n) From and after Closing, each Member shall severally defend, indemnify and
hold Buyer and Indemnified Parties harmless from and against any and all
Damages to the extent arising out of or related to (%4) any misrepresentation
or breach of any warranty of such Member contained in this Agreement and (%4)
any breach of any covenant or agreement of such Member contained in this
Agreement that survives the Closing.

(o) THE FOREGOING INDEMNIFICATIONS BY THE MEMBERS SHALL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT
SUCH DUTIES, OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILITIES, OR SUCH CLAIMS, ACTIONS, CAUSES OF
ACTION, LIABILITIES, DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS OR EXPENSES ARISE OUT OF (%4)
NEGLIGENCE (INCLUDING SOLE NEGLIGENCE, SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE, CONCURRENT
NEGLIGENCE, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE, BUT EXPRESSLY NOT INCLUDING GROSS
NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT) OF ANY INDEMNITEE, (%4) STRICT LIABILITY, OR
(%4) ANY VIOLATION OF ANY LAW, RULE, REGULATION OR ORDER RELATED TO THE
OWNERSHIP OR OPERATION OF THE PROPERTIES, INCLUDING APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL
LAWS.

(p) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, it is expressly understood that
the Members shall not have any obligation to defend, indemnify and hold
harmless each Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to any Buyer's Indemnified
Claims made under Section 13.2(a)(i) unless (%4) an individual Buyer
Indemnified Claim exceeds $100,000 in Damages (the "De Minimis Threshold") and
(%4) the aggregate of such Buyer's Indemnified Claims exceeds 1% of the Base
Merger Consideration (the "Deductible"), and in the event such Buyer's
Indemnified Claims exceed the Deductible, only the value of Damages in excess
of the Deductible shall be considered in applying Section 13.2(a)(i);
provided, however, that Member Taxes and the Fundamental Representations and
Warranties shall not be subject to the De Minimis Threshold or the Deductible.
In no event (subject to Section 13.2(g)) shall the Members have liability
pursuant to or in connection with any claim under Section 13.2(a)(i) of this
Agreement for Damages in excess of 10% of the Base Merger Consideration (the
"Cap"). The Buyer Indemnified Claims arising under Sections 13.2(a)(ii),
13.2(a)(iii) or 13.2(a)(iv) and 13.2(b) shall not be subject to the De Minimis
Threshold, Deductible or Cap. The Buyer Indemnified Claims arising under
Sections 13.2(a)(v) or 13.2(a)(vi) shall not be subject to the De Minimis
Threshold or the Deductible but shall be subject to the Cap. To the extent a
Buyer Indemnified Party asserts a Buyer Indemnified Claim, such Buyer
Indemnified Party shall initially seek recourse against the Escrow Amount
until the Escrow Amount is depleted.

(q) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Buyer
Indemnified Party shall be deemed to have suffered any Damages under this
Section 13.2 arising from claims based on assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses which have actually been included and taken into consideration in the
calculation of the Final Merger Consideration Adjustment Amount or in the
preparation of the Final Settlement Statement.

(r) For purposes of this Section 13.2, in determining whether the Company has
breached any of its representations or warranties contained in this Agreement
and for the determination of the existence of a breach, liability and Damages
under this Article XIII, all qualifications of such representations and
warranties by materiality (whether by reference to the terms "material",
"Material Adverse Effect" or otherwise) shall be disregarded.

(s) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed or interpreted as limiting a
Party's right to seek and receive recovery for fraud committed by the other
Party.

Section 13.3. Survival of Provisions.

(e) The representations and warranties shall not survive the Closing, except
as follows:

(i) Except as set forth in clause (ii) of this Section 13.3(a), all
representations of the Company contained in Article IV, all representations of
the Members contained in Article VI and all representations of Buyer contained
in Article VII shall survive until December 31, 2014 (such period, the
"General Survival Period"); and

(ii) the representations contained in Section 4.1 (Organization and Standing),
Section 4.3 (Capital Structure), Section 4.4 (Power and Authority), Section
4.5 (Valid and Binding Agreement), Section 4.20 (Financial Advisor), and the
representations of Buyer contained in Section 7.1 (Organization and Standing),
Section 7.2 (Power and Authority), Section 7.3 (Valid and Binding Agreement)
and Section 7.9 (Financial Advisor) (the "Fundamental Representations and
Warranties") shall survive the Closing for a period of six years and the
representations and warranties contained in Section 4.11 (Taxes) shall survive
the Closing for a period of sixty (60) days following the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations.

(f) All covenants of the Company, the Members or Buyer contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing through December 31, 2014 except (i) for
any covenant that by its terms continues for a longer period, which shall
continue for such specified longer period and (ii) except for the covenants
contained in Sections 9.6 and 9.11 and Articles XII, XIII and XV, which shall
survive the Closing for a period of sixty (60) days following the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations period. The indemnification
obligations set forth in Section 13.2(a)(v) shall survive for a period of
thirty (30) days after Closing and the indemnification obligations set forth
in Section 13.2(a)(vi) shall survive for a period of sixty (60) days after
Closing. Written notice of any claim by Buyer for indemnification from the
Member Representative under Section 13.2 arising during the Survival Period
must be given by Buyer to the Member Representative as a condition precedent
to the right to enforce such claim for indemnification but in any event no
later than the end of the Survival Period. Unless the applicable Survival
Period otherwise requires, Buyer agrees to bring an indemnification claim
within ninety (90) days after such claim becomes known to Buyer, provided any
failure to do so shall not adversely impact the claim except to the extent of
any actual prejudice to the Members. In the event a Buyer's Indemnified Claim
is timely and properly asserted, the covenants set forth in Section 13.2 shall
survive until such Buyer's Indemnified Claim is satisfied, but only with
respect to such timely and properly asserted Buyer's Indemnified Claim.

(g) The applicable survival period for representations and warranties as
reflected in Section 13.3(a), for covenants reflected in Section 13.3(b) and
the indemnification obligations under Sections 13.2(a)(v) and 13.2(a)(vi) as
reflected in Section 13.3(b) shall be referred to as the "Survival Period."

Section 13.4. Notice of Claim. If indemnification pursuant to Sections 13.1 or
13.2 is sought, the Party seeking indemnification (the "Indemnitee") shall
give written notice to the indemnifying party of an event giving rise to the
obligation to indemnify, describing in reasonable detail the factual basis for
such claim, and shall allow the indemnifying party to assume and conduct the
defense of the claim or action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnitee, and may cooperate with the indemnifying party in the defense
thereof; provided, however, that the omission to give such notice to the
indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability
that it may have to the Indemnitee, except to the extent that the indemnifying
party is prejudiced by the failure of the Indemnitee to give such notice and
as otherwise provided in Section 13.3. The Indemnitee shall have the right to
employ up to one separate counsel to represent the Indemnitee if the
Indemnitee is advised by counsel that an actual conflict of interest makes it
advisable for the Indemnitee to be represented by separate counsel and the
reasonable expenses and fees of such separate counsel shall be paid by the
indemnifying party.

Section 13.5. Net Amounts. Any amounts recoverable by any party pursuant to
this Article XIII with respect to any Buyer's Indemnified Claims or Members'
Indemnified Claims, as the case may be, shall be decreased by any insurance
proceeds (net of collection costs) relating to such Buyer's Indemnified Claims
or Member Indemnified Claims, as the case may be, which are actually paid to
such Indemnitee by any Person (other than any Affiliate of such Indemnitee)
not a party to this Agreement.

Section 13.6. Post-Closing Escrow.

(a) At Closing, Buyer shall deposit the Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

(b) The Escrow Amount will be utilized solely to satisfy any indemnification
obligations of the Members to Buyer under Section 13.2 and to cover other
amounts that can expressly be paid out of the Escrow Amount in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement. The Escrow Agreement shall, subject to paragraph
(c) of this Section 13.6, terminate upon the expiration of the General
Survival Period, subject to continuation for disputed claims (the "Escrow
Term"). The Escrow Agreement shall provide that the Escrow Amount may be drawn
upon by Buyer, its successors or assigns solely for the purpose of satisfying
any indemnification obligations of the Members under Section 13.2 and to cover
other amounts that can expressly be paid from the Escrow Amount in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

(c) If Buyer asserts a claim against the Escrow Amount under this Article XIII
and the Member Representative does not dispute such claim, Buyer shall be
entitled to indemnification by the Members in accordance with this Article
XIII, including the right to receive from the Escrow Amount a number of Common
Units being held in the Escrow Account equal to the quotient of Damages for
which Buyer is entitled for such claim under this Article XIII divided by the
Closing Date Common Unit Value. If, however, the Member Representative
disputes such claim, Buyer shall receive the undisputed portion thereof, if
any, in accordance with the formula set forth in the previous sentence but
shall not be entitled to receive any such disputed portion thereof from the
Escrow Amount with respect to such claim prior to resolution of such Dispute
and, if such Dispute extends beyond the expiration of the Escrow Term, the
term of the Escrow Term will be automatically extended as provided in
paragraph (d) of this Section 13.6.

(d) Provided the indemnification obligations of the Members for claims of
indemnification under this Article XIII of which the Member Representative has
been notified prior to the expiration of the Escrow Term have been satisfied
and no Dispute then exists as to any claim for indemnification by Buyer for
such claims, the balance of the Escrow Amount will be released to the Member
Representative for distribution to the Members on the first Business Day
immediately following the expiration of the Escrow Term. To the extent there
does exist a claim for indemnification by Buyer of which the Member
Representative has been notified, which claim has not been satisfied in full
in accordance herewith prior to the expiration of the Escrow Term, an amount
equal to the reasonable estimate of the amount of such claim hereunder by
Buyer will be withheld from the balance of the Escrow Amount and will continue
to be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement
until such claim has been fully resolved and the Escrow Term shall be deemed
to be extended accordingly and the balance of the Escrow Amount will be
released to the Member Representative for distribution to the Members.
Distributions declared and paid on the escrowed Common Units shall be
delivered to the Escrow Agent and the Escrow Agent shall, promptly upon
receipt of such distributions, release such distributions to the Member
Representative.

(e) The Parties shall execute and deliver such instruction notices and letters
in writing to the Escrow Agent, and take such other actions, as may be
reasonably requested, to implement the terms hereof and to disburse the Escrow
Amount as contemplated herein.

(f) The Parties acknowledge that the Escrow Amount has been established to
provide assets that will be available as a source of recovery by Buyer but
that the Escrow Amount is not intended to establish any cap or limit on the
Members' obligations resulting from a Buyer Indemnified Claim, other than with
respect to Buyer Indemnified Claims arising under Section 13.2(a)(i) that do
not relate to Fundamental Representations and Warranties or fraud.

(g) The fees and expenses payable to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement shall be split equally between Buyer and the Member Representative.

Section 13.7. Adjustment to Purchase Price. For all Tax purposes, the Parties
agree to treat (and will cause each of their respective Affiliates to treat)
any indemnification payment made under this Article XIII as an adjustment to
the Base Merger Consideration.

Article XIV. 

Notices

Section 14.1. Notices. All notices and other communications required under
this Agreement shall (unless otherwise specifically provided herein) be in
writing and be delivered personally, by recognized commercial courier or
delivery service which provides a receipt, by telecopier (with receipt
acknowledged), by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid), or by
electronic transmission to the Parties at the addresses set forth on Section
14.1 of the Disclosure Schedule or such other place within the continental
limits of the United States of America as a Party may designate for itself by
giving notice to the other Party, in the manner provided in this Section, at
least ten (10) days prior to the effective date of such change of address. All
notices given by personal delivery or mail shall be effective on the date of
actual receipt at the appropriate address. Notices given by telecopier shall
be effective upon actual receipt if received during recipient's normal
business hours or at the beginning of the next Business Day after receipt if
received after recipient's normal business hours. All notices by telecopier
shall be confirmed in writing on the day of transmission by either registered
or certified mail (postage prepaid), or by personal delivery.

Article XV. 

Miscellaneous Matters

Section 15.1. Parties Bear Own Expenses/No Special Damages. Each Party shall
bear and pay all expenses (including, without limitation, legal fees) incurred
by it in connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, NONE OF THE PARTIES SHALL
HAVE ANY OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR OTHERWISE IN
CONNECTION HEREWITH, FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR
PUNITIVE DAMAGES. For purposes of the foregoing, actual damages may, however,
include indirect, special, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages to the
extent (i) the injuries or losses resulting in or giving rise to such damages
are incurred or suffered by a Person that is not an Indemnitee pursuant to
this Agreement or an Affiliate of such Indemnitee and (ii) such damages are
recovered against an Indemnitee by a Person that is not an Indemnitee or an
Affiliate of such Indemnitee. This Section 15.1 shall operate only to limit a
Party's liability and shall not operate to increase or expand any contractual
obligation of a Party hereunder or cause any contractual obligation of a Party
hereunder to survive longer than provided in Section 13.3.

Section 15.2. Transfer Taxes. The Parties do not anticipate that any Transfer
Taxes will arise as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this
transaction is deemed to be subject to Transfer Tax for any reason, Buyer
agrees to be responsible for one-half of such Transfer Taxes and the Members
agree to be jointly and severally responsible for one-half of such Transfer
Taxes. If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are exempt from any
such Transfer Taxes upon the filing of an appropriate certificate or other
evidence of exemption, Buyer will timely furnish to the Member Representative
such certificate or evidence. The Parties agree to cooperate fully with each
other to minimize any liability for Transfer Taxes to the extent legally
permissible, and the Parties shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and
filing of all Tax Returns regarding any Transfer Taxes that become payable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 15.3. Entire Agreement. This Agreement including the Exhibits and
Schedules attached hereto contains the entire understanding of the Parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior
agreements, understandings, negotiations, and discussions among the Parties
with respect to such subject matter.

Section 15.4. Choice of Law, Jurisdiction, etc.

(h) Without regard to principles of conflicts of law, this Agreement, and all
claims of causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based
upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution
or performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based
upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or
in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement) shall be construed and enforced in accordance with and governed by
the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts made and to be
performed entirely within such state and the laws of the United States of
America, except that, to the extent that the law of a state in which a portion
of the Properties is located (or which is otherwise applicable to a portion of
the Properties) necessarily governs, the law of such state shall apply as to
that portion of the property located in (or otherwise subject to the laws of)
such state.

(i) The Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Federal courts of the United States of America located in New York and
appropriate appellate courts therefrom, and each Party hereby irrevocably
agrees that all claims in respect of such Dispute may be heard and determined
in such courts. The Parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Laws, any objection which they may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any such Dispute brought in any such court or
any defense of inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such Dispute. Each
Party agrees that a judgment in any such Dispute may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
Applicable Law.

(j) EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT
OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.

(k) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the Parties
hereto agrees (i) that it will not, and it will not permit any of its
Affiliates to, bring or support anyone else in bringing any Proceeding of any
kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby in any forum other
than any New York State court or federal court sitting in the City of New York
in the Borough of Manhattan (and any appellate courts thereof) and (ii) to
waive and hereby waive any right to trial by jury in respect of any Proceeding
against any Financing Sources.

Section 15.5. Time of Essence. Time is of the essence in this Agreement.

Section 15.6. Assignment, Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement shall be
binding on and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, provided that neither Party shall have the right to
assign this Agreement, including any indemnification rights, or any
obligations or benefits hereunder, without the prior written consent of the
other Party first having been obtained; provided, further, that Buyer may
assign its benefits hereunder to any Person who acquires substantially all of
the Properties; provided further, that this proviso, Section 15.4(d) and
Section 15.12, Section 15.14, and the third sentence of this Section 15.6
shall inure to the benefit of the Financing Sources. Any transfer in absence
of such consent shall be null and void. This Agreement may not be amended or
modified except by the written agreement of all the Parties hereto. In
addition, the second proviso of the first sentence of this Section 15.6,
Section 15.4(d), Section 15.12 and Section 15.14 may not be amended or
modified except by the written agreement of the Financing Sources. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, the failure by any Person to comply with
any obligation, covenant or condition under this Agreement may be waived by
the Person entitled to the benefit thereof only by a written instrument signed
by the Person granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon
strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition will
not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent other
failure. The failure of any Person to enforce at any time any of the
provisions of this Agreement will in no way be construed to be a waiver of any
such provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any
part hereof or the right of any Person thereafter to enforce each and every
such provision. No waiver of any breach of such provisions will be held to be
a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.

Section 15.7. Counterpart Execution. For execution, this Agreement may be
executed in counterparts, all of which constitute one and the same instrument.
It shall not be necessary for Buyer and the Company to sign the same
counterpart. This instrument may be validly executed and delivered by
facsimile or other electronic transmission.

Section 15.8. Remedies; Exclusive Remedy; Release.

(e) The Parties agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages
(even if available) would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that the Parties do not perform any provision of this Agreement in accordance
with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that, to prevent breaches or threatened breaches
by the Parties of any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth
in this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, the Parties shall be entitled to request or seek an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled in law or in equity.
Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
any other Parties has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity.
Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement hereby waives any requirement to provide any bond or other security
in connection with such order or injunction. The foregoing is in addition to
any other remedy to which any Party is entitled at law, in equity or
otherwise.

(f) THE PARTIES HERETO HAVE VOLUNTARILY AGREED TO DEFINE THEIR RIGHTS,
LIABILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS RESPECTING THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT
EXCLUSIVELY IN CONTRACT PURSUANT TO THE EXPRESS TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE EXHIBITS AND SCHEDULES HERETO; AND, WITHOUT LIMITING THE
RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO RELY ON THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE TO SUCH
PARTY IN ARTICLE IV, ARTICLE VI AND ARTICLE VII HEREIN, THE PARTIES HERETO
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM THAT THEY ARE OWED ANY DUTIES OR ARE ENTITLED TO ANY
REMEDIES NOT EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT. FURTHERMORE, THE PARTIES

EXPECTATION OF SOPHISTICATED PARTIES KNOWLEDGEABLE IN BUSINESS AND DERIVED
FROM VOLUNTARY, ARM'S LENGTH NEGOTIATIONS; ALL PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NO PARTY HAS ANY SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH
ANOTHER PARTY THAT WOULD JUSTIFY ANY EXPECTATION BEYOND THAT OF AN ORDINARY
BUYER AND AN ORDINARY SELLER IN AN ARM'S LENGTH TRANSACTION; THAT IS, NO
FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIP OR DUTY EXISTS. THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY
BREACH OF THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SET FORTH HEREIN) SHALL BE THOSE REMEDIES
AVAILABLE AT LAW, OR IN EQUITY FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT ONLY (AS SUCH
CONTRACTUAL REMEDIES MAY BE FURTHER LIMITED OR EXCLUDED PURSUANT TO THE
EXPRESS TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT); AND, WITHOUT LIMITING THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY
TO RELY ON THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE TO SUCH PARTY IN ARTICLE
IV, ARTICLE VI AND ARTICLE VII HEREIN, THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIM RELIANCE ON THE OTHER PARTY. EXCEPT FOR THE INDEMNIFICATION RIGHTS
AND REMEDIES CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 15.8 AND ARTICLE XIII, FROM AND AFTER
THE CLOSING, THE MEMBERS, ON ONE HAND, AND THE COMPANY AND BUYER, ON THE
OTHER, EACH RELEASE, REMISE AND FOREVER DISCHARGE THE OTHER AND ITS AFFILIATES
AND ALL SUCH PARTIES' AND ITS AFFILIATES' OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND MANAGERS,
INCLUDING THE ARROW RELEASE PARTIES, FROM ANY AND ALL SUITS, LEGAL OR
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS, DEMANDS, DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS,
LIABILITIES, INTEREST, OR CAUSES OF ACTION WHATSOEVER, IN LAW OR IN EQUITY,
KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, WHICH SUCH PARTIES MIGHT NOW OR SUBSEQUENTLY MAY HAVE, BASED
ON, RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTION
CONTEMPLATED HEREIN, INCLUDING RIGHTS TO CONTRIBUTION UNDER ANY APPLICABLE
ENVIRONMENTAL LAW, BREACHES OF STATUTORY OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, NUISANCE OR
OTHER TORT ACTIONS AND RIGHTS TO PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND COMMON LAW RIGHTS OF
CONTRIBUTION, EVEN IF CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER
SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF ANY
RELEASED PERSON. WITHOUT LIMITATION OF THE FOREGOING, THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE
REMEDY OF A PARTY FOR ANY AND ALL (A) CLAIMS RELATING TO ANY REPRESENTATIONS,
WARRANTIES, COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT AND (B) OTHER
CLAIMS PURSUANT TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE ANY RIGHT TO
INDEMNIFICATION FROM SUCH CLAIMS THAT IS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT,
AND IF NO SUCH RIGHT OF INDEMNIFICATION IS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED, THEN SUCH
CLAIMS ARE HEREBY WAIVED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. EACH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS THIS AGREEMENT AND ITS CONTENTS, AND SIGNS THIS AGREEMENT AS ITS
OWN FREE ACT. EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY WARRANTS THAT IT HAS BEEN REPRESENTED BY
LEGAL COUNSEL IN THIS MATTER, AND LEGAL COUNSEL HAS READ AND EXPLAINED TO EACH
PARTY THE ENTIRE CONTENTS OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND ITS WAIVERS AND RELEASES IN
FULL. EACH PARTY COVENANTS NOT TO SUE ON CLAIMS RELEASED OR WAIVED BY THIS
AGREEMENT, AND AGREES THAT ANY SUCH SUIT SHALL BE A BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT
FOR WHICH THE NONBREACHING PARTY MAY SEEK ACTUAL DAMAGES, WHICH SHALL INCLUDE
ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING OR ANY OTHER PROVISION
IN THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, THIS DISCLAIMER SHALL NOT RESTRICT AND
LIMIT ANY CLAIM BY A PARTY BASED ON FRAUD BY THE OTHER PARTY.

(g) UPON CLOSING, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 13.2, EACH OF THE PARTIES
HERETO SHALL WITH RESPECT TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT
ALSO BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT TO CONTRIBUTION AGAINST EACH OTHER PARTY (INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY CONTRIBUTION CLAIM ARISING UNDER ANY APPLICABLE
ENVIRONMENTAL LAW) AND ANY AND ALL OTHER RIGHTS, CLAIMS AND CAUSES OF ACTION
IT MAY HAVE AGAINST SUCH PARTY ARISING UNDER OR BASED ON ANY FEDERAL, STATE OR
LOCAL STATUTE, LAW, ORDINANCE, RULE OR REGULATION OR COMMON LAW OR OTHERWISE.

other subdivisions refer to corresponding articles, sections, subsections and

affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof.

Section 15.11. Waiver.

(a) It is acknowledged by each of the Parties that the Company has retained
Latham and Watkins, LLP and White, Coffey and Fite, PC (collectively, "Company
Counsel") to act as its counsel in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and that Company Counsel has not acted as counsel for any
other Party in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby for
conflict of interest or any other purposes. Buyer and the Company agree that
any attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence
attaching as a result of Company Counsel's representation of the Company in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including all
communications among Company Counsel and the Company and/or their respective
Affiliates whether or not in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, shall survive the Closing and shall remain in effect.
Furthermore, effective as of the Closing, (i) all communications (and
materials relating thereto) between any Target Company and Company Counsel
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are hereby
assigned and transferred to the Members, (ii) the Target Companies hereby
release all of their rights and interests to and in such communications and
related materials and (iii) each Target Company hereby releases any right to
assert or waive any privilege related to the communications referenced in this
Section 15.11 and acknowledges and agrees that all such rights shall reside
with the Members.

(b) Buyer and the Company agree that, notwithstanding any current or prior
representation of the Company by Company Counsel, Company Counsel shall be
allowed to represent either Member or any of their respective Affiliates in
any matters and disputes adverse to Buyer or the Company that either is
existing on the Execution Date or arises in the future and relates to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; and Buyer and the Company
hereby waive any conflicts or claim of privilege that may arise in connection
with such representation.

(c) Buyer acknowledges that any advice given to or communication with either
Member or any of their respective Affiliates (other than a Target Company)
shall not be subject to any joint privilege and shall be owned solely by such
Member and its Affiliates. Buyer and the Company each hereby acknowledge that
each of them have had the opportunity to discuss and obtain adequate
information concerning the significance and material risks of, and reasonable
available alternatives to, the waivers, permissions and other provisions of
this Agreement, including the opportunity to consult with counsel other than
Company Counsel.

This Section 15.11 is for the benefit of the Members and their respective
Affiliates and such Persons are intended third-party beneficiaries of this
Section 15.11. This Section 15.11 shall be irrevocable, and no term of this
Section 15.11 may be amended, waived or modified, without the prior written
consent of the Members.

Section 15.12. No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement shall
entitle any Person other than the Buyer and the Member Representative to any
claims, cause of action, remedy or right of any kind, except the rights
expressly provided in Sections 3.2(a), 3.4(a), 9.7, 15.8 and 15.11 and Article
XIII; provided that, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, the Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that the
Financing Sources are express third party beneficiaries of, and may enforce as
such the provisions of Section 15.4(d), the second proviso in the first
sentence of Section 15.6, the third sentence of Section 15.6, and this Section
15.12, and Section 15.14.

Section 15.13. Member Representative. As of the Execution Date each Member
has, pursuant to the terms of that certain Delegation Agreement, dated as of
the Execution Date, appointed the OZ Member (the "Member Representative") as
its agent and attorney in fact to act on such Member's behalf in effecting the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and any other document,
instrument or agreement executed and delivered in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, with full power and
authority to bind such Member as though such Member was present and acting on
its own behalf. Each Member has instructed Buyer to discuss all matters
relating to this Agreement and any other matters associated with the
transactions contemplated hereby with the Member Representative acting on
behalf of each Member. All actions to be taken or notices to be provided by
the Members under this Agreement shall be taken or provided on behalf of the
Members by the Member Representative. All decisions and actions by the Member
Representative including any agreement between the Member Representative and
Buyer relating to the defense or settlement of any claims for which the
Members may be required to indemnify Buyer, shall be binding upon each Member
and no Member shall have the right to object, protest or otherwise contest the
same.

Section 15.14. No Recourse Against Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything
that may be expressed or implied in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto
agrees and acknowledges that the Members, the Member Representative and (prior
to the Closing) the Company, shall not have any recourse (directly or
indirectly), rights or claims in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Buyer Financing) or any
documents or instruments delivered in connection herewith or therewith against
any Financing Source in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or
equitable proceeding, by virtue of any applicable requirements of law or
otherwise.
