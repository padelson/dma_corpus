  Company Disclosure Schedule 
  Parent Disclosure Schedule THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), made and entered
into September 18, 2007 by and among EVOTEC AG, an Aktiengesellschaft
organized and existing under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany ("
_Parent_ "), and RENOVIS, INC., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_
"). Parent and the Company are sometimes referred to herein each individually
as a " _Party_ " and, collectively, as the " _Parties_." Certain capitalized
terms used herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in
Section 8.13.

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the Supervisory Board and Management Board of Parent and the Board of
Directors of the Company have each declared it to be advisable and in the best
interests of their respective entities and their respective equity holders
that Parent acquire the Company in order to advance each of their long-term
business interests; and

WHEREAS, the Supervisory Board and Management Board of Parent and the Board
of Directors of the Company have each approved this Agreement and the merger
of the Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), in accordance
with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ")
and the terms and conditions set forth herein; and

WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended that
(a) the exchange of Company Common Stock for Parent ADSs pursuant to the
Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, (b)
the exchange of Company Common Stock for Parent ADSs shall result in no gain
recognition to the Companys stockholders by reason of Section 367(a) of the
Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, (c) this Agreement
constitutes a plan of reorganization, and (d) Parent and the Company will each
be a party to such reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the
Code; and

WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of, and an inducement to, Parent to
enter into this Agreement, contemporaneously with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement certain holders of shares of the Companys common stock are
entering into voting agreements in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_
(the " _Voting Agreements_ ").

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
is hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows.

1\. THE MERGER

1.1 _Formation of Merger Sub_. As promptly as practicable following the date
hereof, Parent shall cause to be incorporated pursuant to the DGCL
a corporation which shall be a constituent company in the Merger (" _Merger
Sub_ "). Parent shall own 100 percent of the outstanding capital stock of
Merger Sub.

1.2 _Appointment of Trust Company_. As promptly as practicable following the
date hereof, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company or
other independent financial institution which shall be reasonably acceptable
to the Company (the " _Trust Company_ ") to act as (i) contribution agent in
connection with the formation of Merger Sub and the Share Exchange (in
such function, the " _Contribution Agent_ "), pursuant to a contribution
agreement between Parent and the Contribution Agent which shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Contribution Agreement_ "), (ii) depositary
under the Deposit Agreement in connection with the issuance of Parent ADSs
evidenced by Parent ADRs (in such function, the " _Depositary_ "), and (iii)
exchange agent in connection with the Share Exchange (in such function, the "
_Exchange Agent_ "). Parent shall enter into an exchange agent agreement with
the Exchange Agent in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Company, which agreement shall set forth the duties, responsibilities and
obligations of the Exchange Agent consistent with the terms of this Agreement.
Parent may appoint one or more substitute persons reasonably acceptable to the
Company to perform any of the functions of the Trust Company
described herein. Solely to    accommodate the transactions described in this Section 1 and subject to the
terms and conditions of the Contribution Agreement, one day prior to
the Effective Time Parent shall cause the Contribution Agent to be
registered, as Parents fiduciary (for the period prior to the Effective Time
only), as the record holder of all of the issued and outstanding shares of
common stock, $0.01 par value share, of Merger Sub (the " _Sub Common Stock_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that it is understood and agreed that the
Contribution Agent shall act as a fiduciary of the former holders of Company
Common Stock after the Effective Time. In the Contribution Agreement ( _inter
alia_ ) the Contribution Agent shall take on the obligation towards the
holders of Company Common Stock to execute a subscription certificate (
_Zeichnungsschein_ ) following the Effective Time pursuant to Section
1.14(a).

1.3 _The Merger_. In accordance with the DGCL and the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. From
and after the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease and the Company, as the surviving entity in the Merger, shall
continue its existence under the Laws of the State of Delaware. The Company
as the surviving corporation after the Merger is hereinafter sometimes
referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_."

1.4 _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to
the provisions of Section 7, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver, as the
case may be, of the conditions set forth in Section 6, the closing of the
Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at a time and on a date to be
mutually agreed upon by the Parties (the " _Closing Date_ "), which date shall
be no later than the third Business Day after all the conditions set forth in
Section 6 (excluding conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied
until the Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the Closing
shall remain subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) shall
have been satisfied or waived, unless another time and/or date is agreed to in
writing by Parent and the Company. The Closing shall take place at the offices
of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C., One Financial Center,
Boston, MA 02111, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the Parties.
For purposes of this Agreement, " _Business Day_ " shall mean any day other
than Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday on which banks are permitted or
required to be closed in New York, New York.

1.5 _Filing of Certificate of Merger_. Subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, at the Closing, the Parties shall cause the Merger to become
effective by causing the Surviving Corporation to execute and file in
accordance with the DGCL a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). The Merger shall
become effective upon such filing, or at such later date and time as is agreed
to by Parent and the Company and set forth in the Certificate of Merger (the "
_Effective Time_ ").

1.6 _Effect of the Merger_. Upon the Closing, the Merger shall have the
effects set forth in this Agreement and in Section 259 of the DGCL.

1.7 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_. At
the Effective Time, (a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Closing shall become the Certificate of Incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation, and, until amended as provided therein and under
the DGCL, it shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, and (b) the Bylaws of the Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Closing shall become the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended as
provided therein and under the DGCL and the Certificate of Incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation.

1.8 _Directors and Officers_. (a) Subject to the requirements of Law,
the persons listed on Schedule 1.8(a) shall be the initial directors and
officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with
the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation,
in each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the Surviving Corporations Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws.

(b) Subject to the requirements of Law, in particular within the limits of
German law, the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
those persons set forth in Schedule 1.8(b) attached hereto to be appointed and
elected to the Supervisory Board of Parent as soon as practicable after the
Effective Time. Such persons shall be entitled to compensation from
Parent for their service on the Supervisory Board of  



 

2  Parent in such amounts and at such times as are consistent with Parents
compensation policy generally applicable to other non-employee members of
the Supervisory Board of Parent, the terms of which have been provided to the
Company.

1.9 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Parties or the holders of the
following securities:

(a) Each share of the Companys common stock, par value $0.001 per share ("
_Company Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, excluding Excluded Shares, but including the shares held in
the Company Trust pursuant to Section 1.11 hereof, shall be converted into the
right to receive 0.5271 of an American Depositary Share of Parent (" _Parent
ADS_ ") (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), with each Parent ADS representing two (2)
ordinary no-par value bearer shares of Parent (" _Parent Ordinary Share_ "),
pursuant to the terms of the deposit agreement between Parent and the
Depositary (the " _Deposit Agreement_ "). The Parent ADSs issued hereunder,
together with any cash to be paid in lieu of fractional Parent ADSs pursuant
to Section 1.13, shall be referred to herein as the " _Merger Consideration_."

(b) At the Effective Time, all outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
a certificate which previously represented any such share of Company Common
Stock or each holder of shares of Company Common Stock in uncertificated form
(each, a " _Company Certificate_ " and, collectively, the " _Company
Certificates_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other
than the right to receive Merger Consideration.

(c) At the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding share of Sub Common
Stock shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the
Surviving Corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation Common Stock_ ").

1.10 _Cancellation of Shares_. At the Effective Time, each share of Company
Common Stock owned by the Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time (collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ "), shall be canceled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof or payment therefor. 

1.11 _Company Equity Awards_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall establish a trust (which
shall not be affiliated with either Parent or the Company), the purpose of
which shall be to hold shares of Company Common Stock (prior to the Merger
and Parent ADS thereafter) issuable to holders of Company Equity Awards which
are not Out-of-the-Money Options outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and if reasonably requested by Parent, holders of warrants
to purchase shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the " _Company Trust_ "). Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall issue and deliver to the Company Trust such number of shares
of Company Common Stock as shall be necessary to satisfy the obligations
under all unexercised or unvested Company Equity Awards which are not Out-of-
the-Money Options as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and if
reasonably requested by Parent, all warrants to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) At the Effective Time, each Company Equity Award which is not an Out-of-
the-Money Option shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company
Common Stock and shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into an award to
acquire from the Company Trust, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under the Company Equity Award (but taking into account any changes
thereto, by reason of this Agreement or the Transactions as may be provided
for in the Company Equity Plans, in any award or other agreement or in such
award), that number of Parent ADSs determined by multiplying the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Equity Award by the
Exchange Ratio, with the result rounded down to the nearest whole Parent ADS,
and, with respect to options, at a price per share equal to the per share
exercise price specified in such Company Equity Award or Company Equity Plan,
as applicable, divided by the Exchange Ratio, with the result rounded up to
the nearest whole cent; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of any
Company Equity Award which is not an Out-of-the-Money Option and to  



 

3  which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under
Section 422 of the Code, the option price, the number of shares subject to
such Company Equity Award and the terms and conditions related to the exercise
of such Company Equity Award shall be determined in a manner consistent with
the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that in the case of any Company Equity Award to which Section 421 of the Code
applies by reason of its qualification under Section 423 of the Code, the
option price, the number of shares subject to such Company Equity Award and
the terms and conditions related to the exercise of such Company Equity Award
shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section
424(a) of the Code and the adjustment to the exercise price shall only apply
to the determination of the exercise price of the Company Equity Award at the
beginning of such options offering period.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) cause the plan
administrator of each of the Company Equity Plans to determine that the
adjustments pursuant to this Section 1.11 are sufficient to not cause any
accelerated vesting in connection with the Merger solely as a result of such
adjustments, and (ii) deliver to the holders of Company Equity Awards which
are not Out-of-the-Money Options appropriate notices setting forth such
holders rights (including that the Company Trust shall satisfy the
obligations under such Company Equity Awards) and the agreements evidencing
the grants of such Company Equity Awards shall continue in effect on the same
terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section
1.11).

(d) No later than 2 business days following the Effective Time, Parent shall
file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other
appropriate forms), with respect to the Parent ADSs subject to the Company
Equity Awards which are not Out-of-the-Money Options and shall use reasonable
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements for so long as such Company Equity Awards remain
outstanding.

(e) Options to purchase Company Common Stock that are outstanding under the
Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Company ESPP_ ") shall not be
assumed by Parent. In accordance with Section 19(c) of the Company ESPP, any
offering period that would otherwise be in progress as of the Effective Time
shall end on such date preceding the Effective Time as determined by the
Company and the options then outstanding under the Company ESPP shall be
exercised pursuant to the terms of the Company ESPP; _provided_ , that if the
Effective Time occurs after December 1, 2007, the options then outstanding
under the Company ESPP shall not be exercised, but, instead, the offering
period shall terminate and the Company shall refund any payroll deferrals
without interest and without the purchase of any Company Common Stock, in each
case, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or such earlier
time as determined by the Company. The Company shall terminate the Company
ESPP, effective as of the Effective Time.

(f) At the Effective Time, all outstanding Out-of-the-Money Options under the
Company Equity Plans (the " _Cancelled Equity Awards_ ") will be terminated or
cancelled, as the case may be, in accordance with the terms of such plan and
the agreements entered into thereunder. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall give any notice required by the Company Equity Plans, which
notice shall have been provided to Parent for its review prior to delivery, to
holders of Cancelled Equity Awards thereunder of (i) the acceleration in full
of the vesting and exercisability of such Cancelled Equity Awards, effective
as of a date determined by the Company on or prior to the date of the
Effective Time and (ii) the termination or cancellation, as the case may be,
upon the Closing of any unexercised Cancelled Equity Awards.

(g) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Out-of-the-Money Option_ " means any
option to purchase Company Common Stock that has an exercise price that
exceeds $9.00 per share.

1.12 _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. If, during the Interim Period,
all the outstanding Parent Ordinary Shares or, if permitted by the terms of
Section 4.1(f), Company Common Stock, shall have been changed, or offered the
opportunity to change, into a different number of shares or a different
class, by reason of the occurrence of any reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination or exchange of shares, the Exchange Ratio shall be
appropriately adjusted, to the extent necessary to reflect
such reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of
shares.



 

4 1.13 _No Fractional Shares_. No Parent ADRs representing fractional Parent
ADSs shall be issued upon the surrender of Company Certificates for exchange,
and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote
or to any other rights of a holder of Parent ADSs. In lieu of any such
fractional Parent ADSs, each holder of Company Common Stock who would
otherwise be entitled to such fractional Parent ADSs shall be entitled to an
amount in cash, without interest, rounded to the nearest cent, equal to the
amount determined by multiplying (A) such fraction of a Parent ADS by (B) the
Exchange Ratio by (C) the closing price of one share of Company Common Stock
on the trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time.

1.14 _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging Company
Certificates representing outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for the
Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger are set forth below. 

(a) _Share Capital Increase and Share Exchange_. As soon as possible following
the Effective Time and in accordance with Sections 202 _et seq._ (including
Sections 185 and 187 _et seq._ ) of the German Stock Corporation Law (
_Aktiengesetz_ , the " _GSCL_ ") and any additional requirements pursuant to
Section 5.14, Parent shall: (i) effect the increase of its stated share
capital by (A) passing a resolution of the Parents Management Board with the
approval of the Parents Supervisory Board, both in accordance with section 5
of Parents Articles of Association and conditional only upon the Merger
becoming effective, to use the authorized share capital ( _genehmigtes
Kapital_ ) of Parent (the " _Authorized Capital_ ") under exclusion of any
preemptive rights ( _Bezugsrechte_ ) in the meaning of Sec. 186 par. 3 and 4,
Sec. 203 par. 2 GSCL to issue new Parent Ordinary Shares underlying the Merger
Consideration to the Contribution Agent for the benefit of the former holders
of shares of the Company Common Stock against the prior contribution by the
Contribution Agent to Parent of all of the issued and outstanding shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock by contribution-in-kind, (B) having a
German accounting firm, appointed by the commercial register of Parent (the "
_Commercial Register_ "), determine the adequacy of the contribution-in-kind
as consideration for the new Parent Ordinary Shares, (C) allowing the
Contribution Agent to execute a subscription certificate ( _Zeichnungsschein_
) with the contents and in the form stipulated by the GSCL and the
Contribution Agreement, (D) seeing to the effectuation of the contribution-in-
kind through a transfer of all of the issued and outstanding shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock to Parent by the Contribution Agent, (E)
registering the implementation of such increase of Parents stated capital
with the Commercial Register (such registration, the " _Share
Capital Increase_ "), and (F) issuing the new Parent Ordinary Shares to the
Contribution Agent for the benefit of the former holders of shares of the
Company Common Stock (the " _Share Issuance_ ") (whereby it is understood
that steps (A) to (F) are to be effected at the respective times set forth in
the following sentence); (ii) file with and have authorized by the German
securities regulator ( _Bundesanstalt fuer Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht_ ,
the " _BaFin_ ") a listing prospectus according to German Law, if required
thereunder, and effect the registration and listing of the new Parent Ordinary
Shares at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange; and (iii) cause (A) the
Contribution Agent to deposit with the Depositary, for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, the Parent Ordinary Shares
underlying the Merger Consideration, (B) the Depositary to issue to the
Exchange Agent the Parent ADSs comprising the Merger Consideration and (C)
the Exchange Agent to deliver in accordance with this Section 1 the Parent
ADSs reflecting the Merger Consideration and evidenced by Parent ADRs to the
former holders of shares of Company Common Stock (such Parent ADSs, together
with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being referred to as
the " _Exchange Fund_ ") and any cash in lieu of Parent ADRs representing
fractional Parent ADSs (the actions described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)
above, collectively, the " _Share Exchange_ "). Subject to both the Management
Boards and Supervisory Boards fiduciary duties, Parent shall approve the
resolutions described in clause (i)(A) above prior to Closing; the
appointment of the German accounting firm by the Commercial Register (clause
(i)(B) above) shall be requested by Parent as soon as practicable after the
execution of this Agreement, and a draft of the determination of the adequacy
of the contribution-in-kind shall be delivered by the accounting firm to the
Parties at Closing; the subscription certificate (clause (i)(C) above) shall
be executed by the Contribution Agent on the Business Day following the day of
the Effective Time; the transfer of all issued and outstanding Surviving
Corporation Common Stock by the Contribution Agent to Parent (clause (i)(D)
above) shall be effected on the Business Day  



 

5  following the day of the Effective Time; and the Share Capital Increase and
the Share Issuance shall be effected as soon as reasonably
practicable thereafter. The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the Parent ADSs evidenced by American Depositary
Receipts issued by the Depository on behalf of Parent (" _Parent ADRs_ ")
contemplated to be issued pursuant to this Section 1 out of the Exchange Fund
in accordance with Section 1.14(b). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for
any other purpose. At the Effective Time, Parents obligation to effect the
Share Exchange shall become unconditional, subject only to the completion of
the contribution-in-kind by the Contribution Agent described in this Section
1.14(a).

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. In furtherance of the Share Exchange, as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Company Certificate, a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Company Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Company Certificates to the Exchange Agent in customary form)
and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Company Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Company Certificate shall
be entitled to receive promptly in exchange therefor (A) a Parent ADR
representing that number of whole Parent ADSs that such holder has the right
to receive as part of the Merger Consideration and (B) a check for the cash
that such holder is entitled to receive in lieu of fractional Parent ADSs,
and the Company Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until
such time as a Parent ADR representing Parent ADSs is issued to or at the
direction of the holder of a surrendered Company Certificate, such Parent
ADSs, and the Parent Ordinary Shares underlying such Parent ADSs, shall be
deemed not outstanding and shall not be entitled to vote on any matter. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, a Parent ADR representing
the appropriate number of shares of Parent ADSs may be issued to a person
other than the person in whose name the Company Certificate so surrendered is
registered, if such Company Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of Parent ADSs to a person other than the registered holder of such
Company Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax
has been paid or is not applicable. Until so surrendered, each outstanding
Company Certificate shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for
all corporate purposes, to evidence the right to receive upon such surrender
the Merger Consideration.

(c) _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the Closing with respect to Parent ADSs,
or the Parent Ordinary Shares underlying such Parent ADSs, with a record date
after the Closing will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered shares of
Company Common Stock with respect to the Parent ADSs issuable upon surrender
thereof, and no cash in lieu of fractional Parent ADSs shall be paid to any
such holder, until the holder of record of the Company Certificate
representing such Company Common Stock shall surrender such Company
Certificate or deliver an affidavit pursuant to Section 1.15. Subject to Law,
following surrender of any such Company Certificate or delivery of
an affidavit, there shall be paid to the holder of Parent ADRs representing
whole Parent ADSs issued in exchange therefor, any cash in lieu of fractional
Parent ADSs and any dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Closing theretofore paid with respect to such whole number of Parent
ADSs.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for one year
after the Effective Time shall be delivered, subject to applicable Law, to
Parent (or, at the election of Parent, the Exchange Agent or the
Company Trust), upon demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has
not theretofore complied with this Section 1 shall thereafter look only to
Parent (or the Exchange Agent or the Company Trust, as applicable) for payment
of its claim for Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with
respect to Parent ADSs as contemplated by this Section 1\.



 

6 (e) _Withholding of Tax_. Parent, Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code or any provision of federal, state, local or
foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent,
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts (i) shall
be remitted by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be, to the applicable Governmental Authority and (ii) shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding were made by Parent.

1.15  _Lost Certificates_. If any Company Certificate is lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and an
indemnification against loss in customary form, the Exchange Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate the
Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.

1.16 _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of the
Exchange Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation shall
be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any Parent ADSs
or any amount of cash from the Exchange Fund properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law
or retained by Parent. 

1.17 _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Trust, on a daily basis, in obligations of the
United States of America. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be the property of and shall be paid to Parent.

1.18 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time and from
time to time after the Closing, any further action is necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest in the Surviving
Corporation full right, title, interest and possession of all properties,
assets, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger
Sub, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be and are
fully authorized, in the name of and on behalf of any of the Company, Merger
Sub or the Surviving Corporation, to take, or cause to be taken, all such
lawful and necessary action as is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

Parent on the date hereof, or in a reference to a Company SEC Report filed and
publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement referred to in such
disclosure schedule, provided by the Company to Parent on the date hereof
(the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), the Company represents and warrants
to Parent that the statements contained in this Section 2 are true and
correct. The Company Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in paragraphs
corresponding to the numbered and lettered paragraphs contained in this
Section 2, and the disclosure in any paragraph shall qualify (A) the
corresponding paragraph of this Section 2, and (B) the other paragraphs of
this Section 2 to the extent that it is readily apparent from a reading of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, without reference to anything other than the
Company Disclosure Schedule, that it also qualifies or applies to such other
paragraphs. As used in this Agreement, a " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ "
means any change, event or effect that is materially adverse to the business,
assets (including intangible assets), financial condition, or results of
operations of the Company, taken as a whole, or to the Companys ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, provided that none
of the following shall constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect:

nation or region in which the Company has a substantial presence or
operations, provided that such conditions do not disproportionately affect the
Company relative to other industry participants;

provided that such conditions do not disproportionately affect the Company

incorporated, validly existing and in corporate good standing under the Laws
of the State of Delaware. The Company is duly qualified or licensed as a
foreign corporation to conduct business, and is in corporate good standing,
under the Laws of each jurisdiction where the character of the properties
owned, leased or operated by it, or the nature of its activities, makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified, licensed or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate,
would not be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Complete and correct copies of the Companys Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws, each as in effect on the date of this Agreement, are on file as
exhibits to the Company SEC Reports and, as so filed, are in full force and
effect. The Company is not in violation of any provisions of its Certificate

Common Stock were duly reserved for future grants or awards made after the

on the last Business Day prior to the date hereof, there were no shares of
voting or non-voting capital stock, equity interests or other securities of
the Company authorized, issued, reserved for issuance or otherwise
outstanding.

(c) All outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are, and all shares which
may be issued pursuant to the Company Equity Plans and the Company Equity

No outstanding shares of Company Common Stock were issued in violation of any
preemptive, subscription or any kind of similar rights.

options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments, agreements, arrangements or
undertakings of any kind (contingent or otherwise) to which the Company is a
party or bound obligating the Company to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to
be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock or other
voting securities of the Company or obligating the Company to issue, grant,
extend or enter into any agreement to issue, deliver or sell any such capital
stock or securities. The Company is not subject to any obligation or

Equity Awards were made and with applicable Laws. All Company Equity Awards
have been reported in the Companys financial statements in material
compliance with GAAP and applicable Tax requirements and the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and there is no reasonable
basis for any claim that the grant date of any Company Equity Award is
inaccurate or the exercise price of any option to purchase Company Common
Stock granted under a Company Equity Plan is less than the fair market value
of Company Common Stock on the date of grant. All of the issued and
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock were issued in compliance in
all material respects with all applicable U.S. federal and state securities
Laws.

(g) There are no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock (or
options to acquire any such shares) or other security or equity interests of
the Company, other than rights of forfeiture of Company Common Stock pursuant
to Company Equity Awards made pursuant to the Company Equity Plans. Except for
Company Equity Awards and except as described in Section 2.3(g) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, there are no stock-appreciation rights, security-
based performance units, phantom stock or other security rights pursuant to
which any Person is or may be entitled to receive any payment or other value
based on the stock price performance of the Company or to cause the Company to
file a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the " _Securities Act_ "), or which otherwise relate to the registration of
any securities of the Company.

the Company is a party or by which any of them is bound with respect to
the issuance, holding, acquisition, voting or disposition of any shares of
capital stock or other security or equity interest of the Company.

(i) Other than the Company Rights Plan, there is no other stockholder rights
plan (or similar plan commonly referred to as a "poison pill") or agreement
under which the Company is or may become obligated to sell or otherwise issue
any shares of its capital stock or any other securities.

2.4 _Authority; No Conflict; Required Filings_. 

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and, subject to the adoption of this Agreement by the

hereby will not, conflict with or result in any violation of, or default (with
or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right
of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to a loss
of a material benefit, or result in the creation of any liens, claims,
security interests, pledges and similar encumbrances (collectively, " _Liens_
") in or upon any of the properties or other assets of the Company under any
provision of: (i) the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company;

is bound, other than in the case of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and

likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

declaration or filing with, any government, governmental,
statutory, regulatory or administrative authority, agency, body or commission
or any court, tribunal or judicial body, whether federal, state, local or

Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended (the " _FDA Act_ "); and (iv) such
other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations

(c) The Company Requisite Stockholder Approval is the only vote of the holders
of any class or series of capital stock of the Company necessary to adopt

its sole discretion.

2.6 _SEC Filings; Sarbanes-Oxley Act_. 

(a) Since January 1, 2005, the Company has filed all forms, reports and
documents required to be filed by the Company with the SEC, including all
exhibits required to be filed therewith (the " _Company SEC Reports_ "). The
Company SEC Reports: (i) at the time filed complied (or, if later filed,
amended or superseded, then on the date of such later filing) as to form in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act
and/or the Exchange Act, as the case may be and (ii) did not at the time they
were filed (or, if later filed, amended or superseded, then on the date of
such later filing) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements contained therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

(b) Each of the financial statements (including, in each case, any related
notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Reports (collectively, the "
_Company Financial Statements_ "), at the time filed (or, if later filed,
amended or superseded, then on the date of such later filing), (i) complied as

regulations of the SEC with respect thereto; (ii) was prepared in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a

presented in all material respects the financial position of the Company as
of the dates indicated and the results of operations and cash flows for the
periods therein indicated, except, in the case of the unaudited interim
financial statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q promulgated by the SEC.



 

11 (c) The Company has established and maintains "disclosure controls
and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange
Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information (both
financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the
principal executive officer and principal financial officer of Company
required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. As of December
31, 2006, there were no "material weaknesses" in Companys internal controls
as contemplated under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (" _SOX_
"). The Company has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of its
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) by its principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Company
Board, (a) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of its
internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and has identified for the Companys auditors
and audit committee of the Company Board any material weaknesses in its
internal control over financial reporting and (b) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Since the
date of Companys most recent evaluation of internal control over financial
reporting, the Company has not received any notification of any facts or
circumstances that have arisen or occurred that would be required to be
disclosed to Companys auditors or Companys audit committee regarding (x) a
significant deficiency in the design or operation of its internal control
over financial reporting, (y) a material weakness in its internal control over
financial reporting or (z) fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Companys
internal control over financial reporting. For purposes of this Agreement,
"principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the
meanings given to such terms in SOX.

(d) The Company does not have any outstanding, nor has it arranged any
outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers within
the meaning of Section 402 of SOX. To the Companys knowledge, there are no
other violations of the Companys code of conduct, adopted pursuant to NASDAQ
Rule 4350(n), except for any such violations that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has delivered to Parent complete and correct copies of any
written complaints, reports or allegations, and a reasonably detailed summary
of any verbal complaints, reports or allegations, that have been submitted or
made by any party to the Audit Committee of the Company Board since January 1,
2005 pursuant to the procedures established in accordance with Section
10A(m)(4) of the Exchange Act. The Company is not a party to, nor does it have
any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar arrangement, including without limitation
any "off-balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation
S-K promulgated by the SEC), where the result, purpose or intended effect of
such contract or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company in any Company
Financial Statement or Company SEC Report.

2.7 _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. The Company does not have any
material liabilities or obligations, whether fixed, contingent, accrued or
otherwise, liquidated or unliquidated and whether due or to become due, in
each case of a nature required by GAAP to be reflected on a balance sheet of
the Company, other than: (i) liabilities reflected or reserved against on the
balance sheet contained in the Companys Form 10-Q (the " _Most Recent Balance
Sheet_ ") filed with the SEC on August 8, 2007; and (ii) liabilities or
obligations incurred since June 30, 2007 (the " _Most Recent Balance Sheet
Date_ ") in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice,
none of which has had or would be reasonably likely to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.



 

12 2.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since the Most Recent Balance
Sheet Date, the Company has conducted its business only in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, and there has not been any
action, event or occurrence which would be reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

2.9 _Agreements, Contracts and Commitments_.

(a) The Company has made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of
the following contracts and agreements to which the Company is a party as of
the date of this Agreement: (i) any agreement, contract or commitment in
connection with which or pursuant to which the Company will spend or receive
(or is reasonably expected to spend or receive), in the aggregate, more than
$200,000 during the current fiscal year or during the next fiscal year; (ii)
any non-competition or other agreement that prohibits or otherwise restricts

arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and lettered paragraphs

Agreement, provided that none of the following shall constitute a Parent
Material Adverse Effect:

(a) general economic conditions worldwide, in the United States, or in

no material claims pending as of the date of this Agreement as to which
coverage has been denied by Parents respective insurer. Since January 1,
2005, all claims thereunder have been filed in a due and timely fashion,

likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. 

3.19 _Taxes_.

(a) Each of Parent and its material Subsidiaries has timely filed all material
federal, state, local and foreign Returns relating to any and all Taxes
concerning or attributable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or to their
operations, and all such Returns are complete and correct in all material
respects.

(b) Each of Parent and its material Subsidiaries (i) has paid all Taxes it is
obligated to pay as reflected on the Returns or otherwise to the extent such
payment was legally due (except for Taxes which are being contested in good
faith and which have been provided for on the financial statements of Parent
or its material Subsidiaries in accordance with IFRS) and (ii) has withheld

against the Parent or any of its material Subsidiaries that is not accurately
reflected as a liability on the Most Recent Balance Sheet, nor has the Parent
or any of its material Subsidiaries executed any waiver of any statute of
limitations on or extending the period for the assessment or collection of any
material Tax which waiver or extension is currently in effect (except to the
extent that such extension is attributable solely to the Parent having
received a routine extension to file the Tax Return for the subject year).

(e) Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by
any material Tax allocation or sharing agreement (other than (i) customary
gross up provisions on credit agreements, derivatives, leases and similar
agreements entered into in the ordinary course, and (ii) the agreement in
place among the group filing a consolidated U.S. federal income Tax Return the
common parent of which is the Parent). Neither the Parent nor any of its

contract, or otherwise, except with respect to sales, use or similar tax
liabilities incurred in connection with leases, contracts and commercial
agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business and which would not
be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(f) Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action,
failed to take any action, or knows of any fact or circumstance that would
(i) prevent the qualification of the Merger as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or (ii) cause the stockholders of the
Company, other than any such stockholder that would be a "five-percent
transferee shareholder" of Parent (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii)) following the Merger and that does not enter
into a five-year gain recognition agreement in the form provided in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.367(a)-8(b), to recognize gain pursuant to Section 367(a)
of the Code.

compliance with, all Permits required under applicable Environmental Laws for

circumstances, conditions, activities or practices existing at the facilities
currently or formerly owned or operated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
including, without limitation, the release or threatened release of any
Materials of Environmental Concern, that could reasonably be expected to give
rise to any liability or result in a claim against Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries under any Environmental Law or that would interfere with or
prevent compliance with any Permits.

(d) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any federal,
state, local or private litigation, proceedings, administrative action, or,
to the knowledge of Parent, the subject of any investigation involving a
demand for damages or other potential liability under any Environmental Laws,

(including any registrations, continuations, continuations in part,
divisionals, renewals, reexaminations, reissues and applications therefor),

Agreement, (i) the registration or application  



 

30  number, the date filed and the title, if applicable, of the registration or
application and (ii) the names of the jurisdictions covered by the applicable

misappropriation or unlawful or unauthorized use of any Parent Third Party

discussions, negotiations or written communications (other than communications
solely directed at informing other parties of the restrictions contained in
this Section 4.3 and only in  



 

34  response to an inquiry from such other parties) with any party or parties
that commenced prior to the execution of this Agreement with respect to
any Competing Proposal. As used in this Agreement, a " _Competing Proposal_ "
means any proposal, offer or indication of interest (other than this Agreement
and the Merger), whether in writing or otherwise, from any Person or group
(as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) other than Parent,
Merger Sub or any affiliates thereof (a " _Third Party_ "), relating to (i)
any acquisition or purchase, directly or indirectly, of 20% or more of the
total assets of the Company or 20% or more of any class of equity or voting
securities of the Company; (ii) any tender offer (including a self-tender
offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Third Party
beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity or voting securities
of the Company; or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, sale of substantially all the assets, reorganization,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
involving the Company which would result in any Third Party beneficially
owning 20% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of the Company.

(b) During the Interim Period, the Company shall not, nor shall it authorize
or permit any Representative of the Company to, (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage, or otherwise knowingly facilitate, directly or
indirectly, any inquiries relating to, any Competing Proposal; (ii) directly
or indirectly initiate or participate in any discussions, negotiations or
communications (other than communications solely directed at informing other
parties of the restrictions contained in this Section 4.3 and only in response
to an inquiry from such other parties) regarding any Competing Proposal; or
(iii) furnish to any Third Party any nonpublic information or data for the
purpose of encouraging or facilitating, or provide access to the properties,
offices, books, records, officers, directors or employees of the Company for
the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, any Competing Proposal. The
Company will use reasonable best efforts (1) not to release any party from, or
waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which
it is a party relating to any Competing Proposal and (2) to enforce, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, each confidentiality agreement entered into
pursuant to this Section 4.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, if, prior to the closing of the
polls at the special meeting of the Companys stockholders in connection with
the Merger (the " _Company Special Meeting_ ") on the proposal to approve and
adopt this Agreement, the Company Board determines (after consultation with
outside counsel) that a Competing Proposal (other than one made following a
breach by the Company of this Section 4.3) constitutes or is reasonably likely
to lead to a Superior Competing Proposal, then the Company may, but only to
the extent that the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation
with the Companys outside counsel that failure to do so would be reasonably
likely to result in a breach of the Company Boards fiduciary obligations
under applicable Laws and subject to the Company providing prompt (but in any
event within 24 hours) written notice (which includes notice via electronic
mail) to Parent of its decision to take such action and compliance by the
Company with Section 4.3(d), (A) furnish information or data with respect to
the Company to such Third Party (and the Representatives of such Third Party);
(B) participate in discussions and negotiations directly or through its
Representatives with such Third Party, subject to, in the case of clause (A)
and, to the extent such discussions or negotiations include the disclosure by
the Company or any of its Representatives of any material
nonpublic information, clause (B), a confidentiality agreement not less
favorable overall to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement, provided,
that all such material nonpublic information not already provided or made
available to Parent is provided to Parent as soon as reasonably practicable
(but in any event within 24 hours) after it is provided to such Third Party
and (C) amend, or grant a waiver or release under, any standstill or similar
agreement with respect to any Company Common Stock, but only to the extent
necessary to permit the making and subsequent consummation of a Superior
Competing Proposal by a Third Party. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Superior Competing Proposal_ " shall mean a bona fide written proposal or
offer made by a Third Party to acquire, directly or indirectly, including
pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, sale of shares of stock, sale of
assets, merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction, 50% or more of the capital
stock of the Company then outstanding or 50% or more of the consolidated total
assets of the Company, (i) on terms the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consulting the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisor)
are more favorable  



 

35  to the holders of Company Common Stock than the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account relevant
legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects of the offer and the
Third Party making the offer and the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and (ii) which is reasonably capable of being consummated.

(c) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or
modify, or publicly propose or publicly resolve to withdraw or modify, in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Board Recommendation; (ii) approve
or recommend, or publicly propose or publicly resolve to approve or recommend,
any Competing Proposal; (iii) approve or recommend, or execute or enter into,
or publicly propose or publicly resolve to approve or recommend or execute or
enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
stock purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement, acquisition agreement,
option agreement or similar agreement relating to a Competing Proposal (other
than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 4.3(b) entered into in
the circumstances referred to in Section 4.3(b)) (an " _Acquisition
Agreement_ "); (iv) approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, or
publicly propose or publicly resolve to approve or recommend or execute or
enter into, any agreement requiring it to terminate this Agreement or abandon
or fail to consummate the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby; or
(v) take any action necessary to render the provisions of any "moratorium",
"control share", "fair price", "affiliate transaction", "business
combination", or other anti-takeover Laws and regulations of any state or
other jurisdiction, including the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL,
inapplicable to any Competing Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to obtaining the
Company Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may, in response to
a Superior Competing Proposal (other than one made following a breach by
the Company of this Section 4.3), (1) withdraw or modify the Board
Recommendation or (2) approve or recommend the Superior Competing Proposal,
but in the case of any action described in clause (1) or any recommendation
described in clause (2), only (x) if the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys outside counsel, that failure to
do so would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary
obligations under applicable Laws, and in each case, only (y) at a time that
is after 5 Business Days following written notice (which includes notice via
electronic mail) advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take such
action (during which period the Company shall make its chief executive
officer, principal financial officer and its counsel available to Parent to
meet on at least one occasion (provided that if such meeting is to be held in
person it shall be held in the United States), and shall consider in good
faith any amendment of the terms of the Merger proposed by Parent or any
proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement or the Merger),
specifying therein the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Competing Proposal and identifying the Person or group making such Superior
Competing Proposal, provided that such 5 Business Day period shall be extended
for an additional 5 Business Days following each material modification of such
Competing Proposal occurring after the receipt of Parents proposal, and (z)
if, after the end of such 5 Business Day period (plus each applicable
extension), the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with the Companys outside legal counsel and its financial advisor) that such
proposed transaction continues to be a Superior Competing Proposal, after
taking into account any bona fide proposal by Parent to amend the terms of
this Agreement and the Merger. The Company shall not during the term of this
Agreement release any Third Party from, or agree to amend or waive any

the standstill provision as provided above, and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to enforce, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
each confidentiality agreement entered into pursuant to this Section 4.3.
In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Stockholder
Approval, the Company Board may withdraw or modify the Board Recommendation if

fiduciary obligations under applicable Law, but only at a time that is after 5
Business Days following Parents receipt of written notice (which includes
notice via electronic mail) advising Parent that the Company Board is prepared
to take such action, specifying the reasons therefor.

conditions of a Competing Proposal or any other material development with
respect thereto.

shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and
disclosing to the Companys stockholders pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act a position with respect to a tender or
exchange offer by a Third Party or (ii) making any disclosure to the
Companys stockholders, if the Company Board determines, after consultation
with its outside counsel, that failure to so disclose would be reasonably
likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations under applicable
Law.

(f) Nothing in this Section 4.3 shall permit the Company to terminate this
Agreement (except as expressly provided in Section 7).

or indirectly, the right to control or direct Parents or its Subsidiaries
operations.

5\. ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

5.1 _Proxy Statement/Prospectus; Registration Statement_.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Parent
and the Company shall prepare and file the registration statement on Form F-4
(or such successor form as shall then be appropriate) to be filed with the SEC
by Parent in connection with the Share Issuance (including any amendments or
supplements thereto, the " _Form F-4_ ") and the proxy statement/prospectus
to be used in connection with the Company Special Meeting (the " _Proxy
Statement/Prospectus_ "), and Parent shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Depositary to prepare and file the
registration statement on Form F-6 (or such successor form as shall then be
appropriate) to be filed with the SEC by the Depositary in connection with the
Parent ADSs (the " _Form F-6_ "). Parent shall provide the Company and its
counsel with any comments it may receive from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Form F-4 and Form F-6 promptly after receipt of such comments,
and the parties shall reasonably cooperate to prepare appropriate responses to
the SEC to such comments and make such modifications to the Form F-4 and Form
F-6 as shall be reasonably appropriate. The Company shall provide the Parent
and its counsel with any comments it may receive from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus as promptly as practicable
after receipt of such comments, and the parties shall reasonably cooperate to
prepare appropriate responses to the SEC to such comments and make such
modifications to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus as shall be
reasonably appropriate. Parent shall use all commercially reasonable efforts
to have the Form F-4 and Form F-6 declared effective under the Securities Act
as promptly as practicable and to keep the Form F-4 and Form F-6 effective as
long as is necessary to consummate the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent
shall supply such information specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in (i) the Form F-4 and Form F-6 necessary so that, at the time the
Form F-4 and Form F-6 are filed with the SEC, at any time the Form F-4 and
Form F-6 are amended or supplemented or at the time(s) the Form F-4 and Form
F-6 become effective under the Securities Act, the Form F-4 and Form F-6 shall
not contain any untrue, incorrect or incomplete statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, and (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
and each amendment or supplement thereto, will not, when first mailed to the
Companys stockholders and at the time of the Company Special Meeting, contain
any untrue, incorrect or incomplete statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the  



 

37  circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. If required by
applicable Laws, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
mail the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to its stockholders as promptly as
practicable, and in any event within ten Business Days, after the Form F-4 and
Form F-6 are declared effective under the Securities Act and, if necessary,
after the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall have been so mailed, promptly
circulate amended, supplemental or supplemented proxy material, and, if
required in connection therewith, resolicit proxies. No amendment or
supplement to the Form F-4 or Form F-6 or Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be
made by Parent or the Company without the approval of the other party, which
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Each party will
advise the other party promptly, after it receives notice thereof, of the
time when the Form F-4 and Form F-6 are declared effective or any supplement
or amendment thereto has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order, of the
suspension or qualification of Parent ADSs issued in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of any request by the SEC
for amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. If, at
any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company or Parent discovers any
information relating to such party, or any of such partys affiliates,
officers or directors, that should be set forth in an amendment to either the
Form F-4, Form F-6 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that such document
would not contain any misstatement of material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party that discovers that information shall
promptly notify the other party and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by law or regulation, disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Parties
shall prepare and file any other filings required under the Exchange Act, the
Securities Act or any other federal or state securities Law or German Law
relating to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the German Prospectus (collectively, the "
_Other Filings_ ").

(c) The Parties shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Form F-4, Form F-6 and the Other Filings to comply in all material
respects with all requirements of Laws. Whenever any event or circumstance
occurs which is required under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other
Law to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Form F-4, Form F-6
or any Other Filing, each Party shall promptly upon becoming aware thereof
inform the other of such occurrence and the relevant Party shall promptly
prepare an amendment, supplement or filing, as appropriate, accurately
describing such event or circumstance and provide the other Party reasonable
opportunity under the circumstances to review and comment, and cooperate in
filing with the SEC, its staff or any other Governmental Authority, and/or
mailing to stockholders of the Company, such amendment or supplement.

(d) Subject to Section 4.3(c), the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include
the Board Recommendation.

5.2 _Stockholders Meeting_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
date of this Agreement and the effectiveness of the Form F-4 and Form F-6, the
Company, acting through the Company Board, shall (i) take all action necessary
to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Special
Meeting, (ii) subject to Section 4.3(c), include in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus the Board Recommendation and (iii) unless the Company
Board has withdrawn or modified the Board Recommendation in accordance with
Section 4.3(c), use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Company
Requisite Stockholder Approval. Once the Company Special Meeting has been
called and noticed, the Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company
Special Meeting (other than for the lack of a quorum) without the prior
written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Unless this Agreement has been earlier terminated in
accordance with Section 7.1, the Company Board shall submit this Agreement to
the stockholders of the Company, whether or not the Company Board at any time
changes, withdraws or modifies the Board Recommendation. The Company shall
solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of the adoption
of this Merger Agreement and shall take all other action reasonably necessary
or advisable to secure the Company Requisite Stockholder Approval to authorize
and approve the Merger. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i)
the Company agrees that its obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold the  



 

38  Company Special Meeting as required by this Section 5.2 shall not be
affected by the withdrawal, amendment or modification of the Board
Recommendation and (ii), the Company agrees that its obligations under this
Section 5.2 shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public
disclosure or communication to the Company of any Superior Competing Proposal.

5.3 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) Upon reasonable notice, during normal business hours and in a manner that
does not disrupt or interfere with business operations, Parent and the Company
shall (and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to) afford to
the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of the
other Party reasonable access, during the Interim Period, to all its
properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, provided that such
access shall not unreasonably interfere with its business or operations, and,
during such period, furnish promptly to the other Party such information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other Party may
reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section
5.3 shall require either Party to provide access, or disclose any information,
if permitting such access or disclosing such information would (i) violate
applicable Laws, (ii) violate any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality (provided that, upon the other partys request, the Company or
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of
any third party to such access or disclosure) or (iii) result in the loss of
attorney-client privilege.

(b) The Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Representatives and
affiliates to, keep all information obtained pursuant to Section 5.3(a)
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement dated October
24, 2006, as amended April 13, 2007 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
between Parent and the Company.

5.4 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Further Assurances_.

(a) Parent and the Company shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
satisfy or cause to be satisfied all of the conditions precedent that are set
forth in Section 6, as applicable to each of them. Each Party, at the
reasonable request of the other, shall execute and deliver such other
instruments and do and perform such other acts and things as may be
reasonably necessary and consistent with this Agreement to effect the
consummation of the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Company and Parent agree
to use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to promptly consummate and make effective the Merger and
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using their
respective commercially reasonable efforts: (i) to effect all
necessary registrations and filings required by any Governmental Authority
(in connection with which Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each
other in connection with the making of all such registrations and filings,
including providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing party and
its advisors prior to the time of such filing and, if requested, will consider
in good faith reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in
connection therewith) and (ii) to furnish to each other such information and
assistance as reasonably may be requested in connection with the foregoing.

(c) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly
obtain all consents, approvals, authorizations, and waivers of, and to give
all notices to, each third party that may be necessary for the performance of
its obligations under this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including obtaining all consents, approvals,
authorizations and waivers, and giving all notices listed in Section 2.4(c) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule; provided, however, that the Company shall
not amend or agree to amend, or waive any material right or material economic
benefit under, any Company Material Contract in connection with obtaining such
consents, approvals, authorizations and waivers without Parents prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed); and provided, further, that, in connection with obtaining such
consents, approvals, authorizations and waivers, or the giving of such
notices, the Company shall not incur any material out of pocket costs or any
other material obligation or liability without Parents prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).



 

39 (d) Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, in
connection with the efforts referenced in Section 5.4(b) to obtain all
requisite approvals and authorizations for the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement under the HSR Act, ECMR or any other applicable Antitrust Law,
use its reasonable best efforts to: (i) cooperate in all respects with each
other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party; (ii) keep the other Party reasonably informed of the status of
matters related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
furnishing the other with any written notices or other communications received
by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the Federal Trade Commission
(the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "
_DOJ_ "), the European Commission or any other Governmental Authority and of
any notices or other communications received or given in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby and (iii) permit the other Party to review any
communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any
meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental
Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any
other person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, DOJ or such other
applicable Governmental Authority or other person, give the other Party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences in
accordance with Antitrust Law. However, commercially sensitive information
shall not be disclosed between the Parties and appropriate measures shall be
taken to safeguard the confidentiality of such commercially sensitive
information. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Antitrust Law_ " means the
Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the
Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, the ECMR, and all other federal,
state and foreign, if any, statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative and judicial doctrines and other Laws that are designed
or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition
through merger or acquisition.

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in Sections 5.4(b) and (d), each Party hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
applicable Antitrust Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in connection with any filing or submission required or action to
be taken by either Parent or the Company to consummate the Merger, in no event
shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates be obligated to propose
or agree to accept any material undertaking or condition, to enter into any
consent decree, to make any material divestiture or to accept any material
operational restriction.

(f) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Authority or a
private party challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement,
each of the parties (i) shall cooperate with the others and use its respective
reasonable best efforts to defend, contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any order that
is in effect (until all appeals are exhausted, if necessary) that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) shall defend, at their costs and expense, any action or
actions, whether administrative or judicial, in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Section 5.4 shall limit a Partys right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1 so long as such Party has up to then
complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section
5.4.

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
the Company shall not take any action, agree to take any action or consent to
the taking of any action pursuant to this Section 5.4 (including with respect
to selling, holding separate or otherwise disposing of assets or
conducting its business in a specified manner) without the prior written
consent of Parent.



 

40 5.5 _IFRS Financials_. As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, the
Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent such financial information as may
be reasonably requested by Parents auditors if required for inclusion in the
German Prospectus, including financial information prepared in accordance with
IFRS.

5.6 _Employee Benefits_. Within a reasonable period of time prior to the
Effective Time, so as to facilitate a transfer of Company employees who
are employed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their respective
Subsidiaries upon and after the Effective Time (" _Continuing Employees_ ") to
the employee benefit plans maintained by Parent or Surviving Corporation or
their respective Subsidiaries (" _Parent Plans_ " or " _Parent_ _Policy_ "),
except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, the Company shall
terminate all Company Equity Plans as of the Effective Time. With respect to
any Company Employee Plans providing group medical, dental or vision benefits
and any Company Employee Plans covered by Section 125 of the Code (including
any attendant health or dependent care flexible spending account
arrangements), such plans shall continue to be maintained upon and after
Effective Time (" _Continuing Plans_ ") in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Continuing Plans until the end of the applicable
Continuing Plan year in which the Effective Time occurs at which time the
Surviving Corporation shall terminate such Continuing Plans and Parent shall
allow for the participation of former Continuing Plan participants and their
covered dependants in comparable Parent Plans under the terms and conditions
of such comparable Parent Plans to the extent such participants remain
employed by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries
and who are otherwise eligible for participation in such comparable Parent
Plans. For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide employee benefits, in the aggregate, to each Continuing Employee that
are no less favorable than the employee benefits provided, in the aggregate,
to such Continuing Employee by the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Following the Effective Time, Parent will give each Continuing Employee
full credit for prior service with the Company for purposes of (a)
eligibility, vesting and retirement status (but not benefit accruals, other
than vacation, sick time and the like) under any comparable Parent Plans and
(b) determination of benefit levels under any comparable Parent Plan or
Parent Policy relating to vacation or severance as if such service had been
completed with the Surviving Corporation. In addition, Parent shall waive, or
cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations to the same extent
such limitations are waived under any comparable Parent Plan except to the
extent a similar limitation or pre-existing condition limitation existed under
the comparable Company Employee Plan. Parent shall give Continuing Employees
credit towards any lifetime deductibles or limitations on out of pocket
expenses to the extent a Continuing Employee incurred the same with respect to
a Company Employee Plan and such deductibles or limitations are applicable
under the comparable Parent Plan. Parent shall take all reasonable actions to
effectuate the terms and conditions of this Section 5.6 including, without
limitation, amending or causing to be amended the comparable Parent Plans.

5.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, upon becoming
aware of (i) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which
occurrence or failure to occur would reasonably be expected to result in any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate such that the condition in Section 6.2(a) or 6.3(a) would not be
satisfied and (ii) any failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder such that the condition in Section 6.2(b)
or 6.3(b) would not be satisfied; provided, however, that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 5.7 shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the Party receiving such notice.

5.8 _Public Announcements_. Except as otherwise required by Law, the rules of
the NGM or the rules and regulations of the SEC or the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange, or as provided elsewhere herein, prior to the Closing or the earlier
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7, (a) the press release
announcing the execution of this Agreement shall be issued only in such form
as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company and Parent and (b) Parent and
the Company shall each use its reasonable efforts to consult with the other
before issuing any other press release or otherwise making any public
statement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement.



 

41 5.9 _Accountant s Letter_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause to be delivered to Parent a "comfort" letter of Ernst and Young dated
within two (2) Business Days before the date on which each of the Form F-4,
Form F-6 and German Prospectus shall become effective and addressed to Parent
and the Company, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

5.10 _Directors and Officers Insurance/Indemnification_. 

(a) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase a six
(6) year extended reporting period endorsement (" _reporting tail coverage_
") with respect to the Companys directors and officers liability insurance
currently in effect, on terms no less favorable than the terms of such
insurance currently in effect, and maintain such endorsement in full force
and effect for its full term, provided that Parent shall not be required to
pay more than 175% of the aggregate premium paid by the Company and its
Subsidiaries in the year ended December 31, 2006 for such reporting tail
coverage, provided, further, should the cost of reporting tail coverage exceed
such cap, Parent shall instead purchase the maximum reporting tail coverage
available for 175% of the aggregate premium paid by the Company and
its Subsidiaries in the year ended December 31, 2006.

(b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, until the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold
harmless, with respect to claims or events existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time, each person who is now, or has been at any time prior
to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "),
against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and fees,
costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
(including without limitation any claim, action, suit proceeding or
investigation related to the Merger, this Agreement and the other transactions
contemplated hereby), whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, arising out of or by reason of the fact that the
Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Company, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
to the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL for directors, officers,
employees and agents of Delaware corporations.

(c) The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain, and Parent shall cause the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to so contain, provisions no less
favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of present and former directors, officers, employees and agents of
the Company than are presently set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws of the Company, and such commitments will be included and
maintained in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.

(d) This Section 5.10 shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is
intended to benefit the Company, the Surviving Corporation and each Person who
on or prior to the Effective Time was a director, officer, employee or agent
of the Company, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation, and shall be enforceable by each Person who on
or prior to the Effective Time was a director, officer, employee or agent of
the Company. If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then and in each such case, the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.10 to the extent
permitted by applicable law. 

5.11 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company and Parent shall promptly notify
the other party of any stockholder litigation brought, or threatened in
writing, against the Company and/or the members of the Company Board or Parent
and/or the members of the Supervisory Board and Management Board of Parent,
respectively, relating to the Merger or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and shall provide the other party with updates and such
information as such party shall reasonably request with respect to the status
of the litigation and discussion between the parties thereto. The Company
shall give Parent the opportunity to  



 

42  participate in the defense of and settlement discussions with respect to
(but, in each case, not control) such litigation and the Company shall not
make any payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect
to any such litigation unless Parent shall have consented in writing to such
payment or settlement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. 

5.12 _Nasdaq Listing_. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Parent ADSs to be issued as the Merger Consideration to be approved for
listing on the NGM, on or prior to the Effective Time.

5.13 _Affiliates_. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain an executed affiliate agreement substantially in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit B_ , with such changes therein as are agreeable to Parent
(each, a " _Company Affiliate Agreement_ "), from each of the Persons
identified in Section 5.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule concurrently
with the execution of this Agreement and thereafter from any other Person who
is an officer or director of the Company or its Subsidiaries and who
the Company hereafter determines to be an Affiliate of the Company regarding
compliance with Rule 145 under the Securities Act.

5.14  _Section 16(b_). The Company and Parent shall take all steps
reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
derivative securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by each individual who is a director or executive officer of
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

5.15 _Certain Obligations of Parent_. Certain obligations of Parent set forth
in this Agreement, including those obligations designed to survive
the consummation of the Share Exchange, may require additional corporate
actions specified in the GSCL be taken by or with respect to Parent. As
required by Law, certain of such obligations of Parent shall be incorporated
in agreements in connection with the contribution-in-kind to Parent, which
agreements shall be entered into by Parent, the Company and the Contribution
Agent in the context of the Share Exchange pursuant to Section 202 _et seq_.
of the GSCL.

5.16 _Tax Matters_.

(a) Neither the Company nor the Parent shall take or fail to take any action
that would (i) cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, or (ii) prevent the Merger from
qualifying for nonrecognition with respect to the Company shareholders under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(1). The Parent and the Company shall
take any action that is required to cause the Merger to qualify (i) as
a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and (ii)
for nonrecognition with respect to the Company shareholders under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(1).

(b) Each of the Company and the Parent shall report the Merger as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code, unless

applicable reporting requirements set forth in the Treasury Regulations
under Section 367 of the Code, including Treasury Regulation Section
1.367(a)-3(c)(6).

5.17 _Parent Directors and Officers Insurance_. Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain a directors and officers liability insurance
policy covering the members of Parents Supervisory Board from a financially
sound and reputable insurer, in such amount and on such terms as is customary
in the industry for a company of similar size and value with securities listed
on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ Stock Market.

5.18 _Consulting Agreements_. Contingent upon the Closing, in the event the
resignations of two members of the Supervisory Board of Parent are not
effective as of the Effective Time such that those persons set forth in
Schedule 1.8(b) attached hereto have not been appointed and elected to the
Supervisory Board of Parent as of the  



 

43  Effective Time, Parent will enter into consulting services agreements with
such persons such that they will continue to provide services to Parent
following the Effective Time and through the earlier to occur of (i) their
appointment to the Supervisory Board of Parent, (ii) their election to the
Supervisory Board of Parent and (iii) June 30, 2008.

Company:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of the Parties;

(b) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before March 16, 2008; provided, however, that if (i) the
Effective Time has not occurred by such date by reason of nonsatisfaction of
(A) the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(a), (B) the conditions set forth

that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b) shall not
be available to a Party whose failure to fulfill any material obligation under
this Agreement has been the principal cause of, or resulted in, the failure
of the Merger to have been consummated on or before such date;

(c) by either Parent or the Company, if a Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued an order or taken any other action, in each
case, which has become final and non-appealable and which permanently
restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the Merger;

(d) by either Parent or the Company, if at the Company Special Meeting the
Company Requisite Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained;

Business Days after the commencement of such tender or exchange offer, the
Company Board fails to recommend against acceptance of such tender or exchange
offer;

(f) by Parent, if Parent is not in material breach of its obligations under
this Agreement, and if (i) there has been a breach of any of the
representations and warranties of the Company herein, which breach would cause
the condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) not to be satisfied, or (ii) there
has been a breach on the part of the Company of any of its covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach would cause the
condition in Section 6.2(b) not to be satisfied, and, in both case (i) and
case (ii), such breach (if curable)

period set forth in Section 7.1(b);

(g) by the Company, if it is not in material breach of its obligations under
this Agreement, and if (i) there has been a breach of any of the

condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) not to be satisfied, or (ii) there has
been a breach on the part of Parent of any of its covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement, which breach would cause the condition in Section
6.3(b) not to be satisfied, and, in both case (i) and case (ii), such breach
(if curable) has not been cured within thirty (30) days after notice thereof
to Parent from the Company, provided such cure period shall not extend beyond

of the payments required by Section 7.3 as a result of the operation of this
paragraph (h) have been made in full to Parent; or

Parent Ordinary Shares underlying the Merger Consideration, as described in
clause (i)(A) of Section 1.14(a).

event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, this
Agreement (other than this Section 7.2 and Sections 5.3(b), 5.8, 7.3 and 8,

VOTING AGREEMENT, dated as of September 18, 2007 (this " _Agreement_ "), by
and between EVOTEC AG an Aktiengesellschaft organized and existing under the
laws of the Federal Republic of Germany (" _Parent_ "), and  ("
_Stockholder_ "). Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined
shall have the meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement (as defined
below). 

WHEREAS, concurrently herewith, Parent and Renovis, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), are entering into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant to which (and subject to the
terms and conditions set forth therein) Merger Sub (as such term is defined in
the Merger Agreement), will merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_
"), and each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock will be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration;

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, Stockholder beneficially owns
shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Owned Shares_ " and, together with any
shares of Company Common Stock of which Stockholder acquires beneficial
ownership after the date hereof and prior to the termination hereof, whether
upon exercise of options, warrants, conversion of other convertible securities
or otherwise, collectively referred to herein as, the " _Covered Shares_ ");
and

WHEREAS, Stockholder acknowledges that Parent is relying on the
representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements of Stockholder set
forth in this Agreement in order to induce Parent to enter into the Merger
Agreement and proceed with the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent
and Stockholder hereby agree as follows:

1\. _Agreement to Vote._

(a) Prior to any termination of this Agreement, Stockholder hereby agrees that
it shall, and shall cause any other holder of record of any Covered Shares
to, at any meeting of the stockholders of the Company (whether annual or
special and whether or not an adjourned or postponed meeting), however called,
(i) when a meeting is held, appear at such meeting, submit a proxy to
vote the Covered Shares at such meeting or otherwise cause the Covered Shares
to be counted as present thereat for the purpose of establishing a quorum,
(ii) vote (or caused to be voted) in person or by proxy all Covered Shares in
favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and any other matters necessary
for consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as
the Merger Agreement may be modified or amended from time to time in a manner
not adverse to Stockholder, and (iii) vote (or cause to be voted) all Covered
Shares against any Competing Proposal.

(b) STOCKHOLDER HEREBY GRANTS TO, AND APPOINTS, PARENT, THE CHIEF FINANCIAL
OFFICER OF PARENT AND THE SECRETARY OF PARENT, IN THEIR RESPECTIVE CAPACITIES
AS OFFICERS OF PARENT, AND ANY OTHER DESIGNEE OF PARENT, EACH OF THEM
INDIVIDUALLY, THE STOCKHOLDERS IRREVOCABLE PROXY AND ATTORNEY-IN-FACT (WITH
FULL POWER OF SUBSTITUTION) TO VOTE THE COVERED SHARES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN CLAUSE (a) OF THIS _SECTION 1_ , _PROVIDED_
, _HOWEVER_ , THAT THE PROXY GRANTED PURSUANT TO THIS CLAUSE (b) SHALL
IMMEDIATELY TERMINATE AND HAVE NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT UPON THE TERMINATION
OF THIS AGREEMENT. STOCKHOLDER INTENDS THIS PROXY TO BE IRREVOCABLE DURING THE
TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT AND COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST. STOCKHOLDER WILL TAKE
SUCH FURTHER ACTION OR EXECUTE SUCH OTHER INSTRUMENTS AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO
EFFECTUATE THE INTENT OF THIS PROXY AND  



 

55  HEREBY REVOKES ANY PROXY PREVIOUSLY GRANTED BY STOCKHOLDER WITH RESPECT TO
THE COVERED SHARES TO THE EXTENT INCONSISTENT WITH THE TERMS OF THIS
AGREEMENT. 

(c) Except as set forth in clause (a) of this _Section 1_, Stockholder shall
not be restricted from voting in favor of, against or abstaining with respect
to any matter presented to the stockholders of the Company. In addition,
nothing in this Agreement shall give Parent or any of its officers or
designees the right to vote any Covered Shares in connection with the
election of directors.

2\. _No Inconsistent Agreements_. Stockholder hereby covenants and agrees
that, except as contemplated by this Agreement, it (a) has not entered into,
and shall not enter at any time while this Agreement remains in effect, any
voting agreement or voting trust with respect to the Covered Shares and (b)
has not granted, and shall not grant at any time while this Agreement remains
in effect, a proxy or power of attorney with respect to the Covered Shares, in
either case, which is inconsistent with its obligations pursuant to this
Agreement.

3\. _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earliest of (a) the
Effective Time, (b) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance
with its terms, and (c) written notice of termination of this Agreement by
Parent to Stockholder, such earliest date being referred to herein as the "
_Termination Date_ ".

4\. _Representations and Warranties_.

(a) Representations and Warranties of Parent. Parent hereby represents and
warrants to Stockholder as follows:

(i) _Valid Existence_. Parent is a corporation ( _Aktiengesellschaft_ ) duly
incorporated, validly existing and in corporate good standing (to the extent
such concepts are applicable) under the laws of the Federal Republic of
Germany and has the requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted.

(ii) _Authority Relative to This Agreement_. Parent has all necessary
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to
perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly
authorized, executed and delivered by Parent and, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Stockholder, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Parent, enforceable against Parent in accordance with its
terms.

(iii) _No Conflicts_. Except for the applicable requirements of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the " _Exchange Act_ "), no
filing with, and no permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any
Governmental Authority is necessary on the part of Parent for the execution
and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and the consummation by Parent of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b)  _Representations and Warranties of Stockholder_. Stockholder hereby
represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

(i)  _Ownership of Securities_. As of the date of this Agreement, (A)
Stockholder beneficially owns the Owned Shares, (B) Stockholder is the sole
record holder (or, in the case of shares held in street name, beneficial
owner) of  Shares of Company Common Stock (all of which shares
are included in the Owned Shares), free and clear of Liens (other than Liens
for Taxes not yet due or payable, Liens created by this Agreement or in
connection with the arrangements set forth on Schedule I attached to this
Agreement), (C) Stockholder has sole voting power and sole power of
disposition with respect to all Owned Shares, with no restrictions (other
than those created by this Agreement or in connection with the arrangements
set forth on Schedule I attached to this Agreement), subject to applicable
federal securities laws on their rights of disposition pertaining thereto, and
(D) Stockholder beneficially owns shares of Company Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise of currently exercisable stock options and other
equity awards (collectively, the " _Equity Awards_ "). Other than as created
by this Agreement, Stockholder has not appointed or granted any proxy which is
still in effect  



 

56  with respect to the Owned Shares. As used in this Agreement, the terms "
_beneficial owner_ ", " _beneficial ownership_ ", " _beneficially owns_ " or
" _owns beneficially_ ", with respect to any securities, refer to the
beneficial ownership of such securities as determined under Rule 13d-3(a) of
the Exchange Act.

(ii) _Existence, Power; Binding Agreement_. If Stockholder is an entity,
Stockholder is duly organized, formed or created, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all
requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to
perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, and all necessary corporate or other entity action on
behalf of Stockholder has been taken to authorize this Agreement to be entered
into on behalf of and to be performed by Stockholder. This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by Stockholder and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent, constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of Stockholder, enforceable against Stockholder in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equitable
Exceptions. If Stockholder is married, and any of the Covered Shares
constitute community property or otherwise need spousal or other approval for
this Agreement to be legal, valid and binding, this Agreement has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by, and constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of, Stockholders spouse, enforceable against such
Stockholders spouse in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy
and Equitable Exceptions. 

(iii) _No Conflicts_. Except for the applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act, (A) no filing with, and no permit, authorization, consent or approval
of, any state, federal or foreign governmental authority is necessary on the
part of Stockholder for the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Stockholder and the consummation by Stockholder of the transactions
contemplated hereby and (B) none of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Stockholder, the consummation by Stockholder of the transactions
contemplated hereby or compliance by Stockholder with any of the provisions
hereof will (1) result in any breach or violation of, or constitute a default
(or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a
default) under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment,
acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any
Covered Shares pursuant to, any contract to which Stockholder is a party or by
which Stockholder or any property or asset of Stockholder is bound or affected
or (2) violate any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or
regulation applicable to Stockholder or any of its properties or assets,
except in the case of (A) or (B) for any failure to make any filings or obtain
any permits, authorizations, consents or approvals, or violations, breaches
or defaults that would not in the aggregate materially impair the ability of
Stockholder to perform its obligations hereunder.

5\. _Certain Covenants_. Stockholder hereby covenants and agrees as follows:

(a) _No Solicitation_. Stockholder agrees that (i) he or it is a "
_Representative_ " of the Company for purposes of Section 4.3 of the Merger
Agreement, (ii) in such capacity, he or it is subject to the restrictions
of Section 4.3 of the Merger Agreement and (iii) that any breach by
Stockholder of the terms of Section 4.3 of the Merger Agreement shall be a
breach by Stockholder of this Agreement.

(b) _Restriction on Transfer, Proxies and Non-Interference_. Except in
connection with the arrangements set forth on Schedule I attached to this
Agreement, Stockholder hereby agrees, while this Agreement is in effect, and
except as contemplated hereby, not to (i) sell, transfer, pledge, encumber,
assign or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract, option or other
arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale, transfer, pledge,
encumbrance, assignment or other disposition of, (any of the foregoing, a "
_Transfer_ "), any of the Covered Shares or Equity Awards (other than
the exercise of Equity Awards), (ii) grant any proxies or powers of attorney,
deposit any Covered Shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting
agreement with respect to any Covered Shares or (iii) knowingly take any
action that would make any representation or warranty of Stockholder
contained herein untrue or incorrect in any material respect or have the
effect of preventing or disabling Stockholder from performing its obligations
under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the restrictions and prohibitions on
the trading of Covered Shares or Equity Awards set forth in this Section 5(b)
and elsewhere in this Agreement, Stockholder shall be permitted to (i) effect
transactions with  



 

57  respect to Covered Shares and Equity Awards pursuant to, and permitted
under, approved trading plans established under Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under
the Exchange Act (" _Trading Plans_ "), provided that such Trading Plans
shall be in place on or prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii) Transfer
Covered Shares to a family member or trust for estate planning purposes,
provided that, as a condition to any such Transfer to a family member or
trust, the transferee has agreed with Parent in writing to be bound by the
terms of this Agreement and to hold such Covered Shares subject to all the
terms and provisions of this Agreement, (iii) in connection with the exercise
of an Equity Award (cashless or otherwise), sell Covered Shares an amount that
is sufficient to satisfy the payment of any transaction costs and any tax
liability incurred by such Stockholder in connection with such exercise and
(iv) effect any Transfer of Covered Shares as may be specifically required by
court order or by operation of law.

upon the exercise of Equity Awards).

6\. _Further Assurances_. From time to time, at the other partys request
and without further consideration, each party hereto shall take such
reasonable further action as may reasonably be necessary or desirable to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

7\. _Fiduciary Duties_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary: (a) Stockholder makes no agreement or understanding herein in any
capacity other than in Stockholders capacity as a holder of Covered Shares
and is not making any agreement hereunder in Stockholders capacity as an
officer or director of the Company, (b) if Stockholder is a director
or officer of the Company, nothing herein shall be construed to limit or
affect any action or inaction by Stockholder acting in such persons capacity
as an officer or director of the Company (including the performance of
obligations required by the fiduciary duties of Stockholder acting in such
persons capacity as an officer or director) and in compliance with Section
[4.3] of the Merger Agreement, (c) Stockholder may provide information and
engage in discussions with a Third Party, as and to the extent such action is
in compliance with the provisions of Section [4.3] of the Merger Agreement,
and (d) Stockholder shall have no liability to Parent or any of its affiliates
under this Agreement or otherwise as a result of any action or inaction by
Stockholder in such persons capacity as an officer or director of the Company

8\. _No Control_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent the
right to control or direct the Company or the Companys operations. 

9\. _No Ownership Interest_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to vest in Parent any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of
ownership of or with respect to any Covered Shares. All rights, ownership and
economic benefits of and relating to the Covered Shares shall remain vested in
and belong to Stockholder, and Parent shall have no authority to exercise
any power or authority to direct Stockholder in the voting of any of the
Covered Shares, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, or in the
performance of Stockholders duties or responsibilities as a stockholder of
Parent.

10\. _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by each of the parties hereto.

[FORM OF AFFILIATE LETTER]

September 18, 2007

EVOTEC AG

Schnackenburgallee 114

22525 Hamburg, GERMANY

Ladies and Gentlemen:

The undersigned, a holder of shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share (" _Company Common Stock_ "), of Renovis, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the " _Company_ "), is entitled to receive, in connection with the merger
(the " _Merger_ ") of Renovis Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of
EVOTEC AG, an Aktiengesellschaft organized and existing under the laws of the
Federal Republic of Germany (" _Parent_ "), American Depository Shares of
Parent representing ordinary shares of Parent (" _Parent ADSs_ ", which
definition, for purposes hereof, shall also include any Parent ADSs or Parent
ordinary shares otherwise acquired or beneficially owned by the undersigned
prior to the Merger), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger by and
between Parent and the Company (the " _Merger Agreement_ "). Capitalized
terms used herein but not otherwise defined shall have the meanings set forth
in the Merger Agreement. The undersigned has been advised that, as of the date
hereof, he, she or it may be deemed an " _affiliate_ " of the Company within
the meaning of Rule 145 (" _Rule 145_ ") promulgated under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), by the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "), although nothing contained herein
should be construed as an admission of such fact, nor as a waiver of any right
the undersigned may have to object to any claim that the undersigned is such
an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.

If, in fact, the undersigned were such an affiliate under the Securities Act,
the undersigneds ability to sell, assign or transfer the Parent ADSs
received by the undersigned in the Merger may be restricted unless such
transaction is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such
registration is available. The undersigned understands that such exemptions
are limited and, to the extent the undersigned felt or feels necessary, the
undersigned has obtained or will obtain advice of counsel as to the nature and
conditions of such exemptions, including information with respect to the
applicability to the sale of such Parent ADS of Rules 144 and 145(d)
promulgated under the Securities Act. The undersigned understands that Parent
is under no obligation to register the Parent ADSs for sale, transfer or
other disposition by the undersigned or to take any action (other than as
provided in the penultimate paragraph of this letter) to make compliance with
an exemption from registration under the Securities Act or otherwise available
to the undersigned. 

The undersigned hereby represents to and covenants with Parent that the
undersigned will not sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of
the Parent ADSs received by the undersigned in the Merger except (i) pursuant
to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, (ii) in
conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule 145 or (iii) in a
transaction which, in the opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, or as described in a "no-action" or interpretive letter from the Staff
of the SEC specifically issued with respect to a transaction to be engaged in
by the undersigned, is not required to be registered under the Securities
Act.

In the event of a sale or other disposition by the undersigned of Parent ADSs
pursuant to Rule 145, the undersigned will supply Parent or Parents transfer
agent with evidence of compliance with such Rule, in the form of a customary
letter and, to the extent required by the preceding paragraph, the opinion
of counsel or no-action letter referred to in such paragraph. The undersigned
understands that Parent may instruct its transfer agent to withhold the
transfer of any Parent ADSs disposed of by the undersigned, but that (provided
such transfer is not prohibited by any other provision of this letter
agreement) upon receipt of such evidence of compliance, Parent shall cause the
transfer agent to effectuate, on a timely basis, the transfer of the Parent
ADSs sold as indicated in such letter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
shall revoke the stop transfer instructions with respect to any Parent ADSs
held by the undersigned or a transferee of the undersigned as to which the
legend referred to below has been removed in accordance with this letter
agreement. The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that there will be placed on the
certificates for Parent ADSs issued to the undersigned in connection with the
Merger, or, except as otherwise provided herein, any substitutions therefor, a
legend stating in substance:

"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION TO
WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "
_ACT_ "), APPLIES, AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD, EXCHANGED, PLEDGED,
TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
REQUIREMENTS OF THE ACT, AND OTHER CONDITIONS SPECIFIED IN THE COMPANY
AFFILIATE AGREEMENT BETWEEN EVOTEC AG AND THE HOLDER OF THIS CERTIFICATE,
A COPY OF WHICH MAY BE INSPECTED BY THE HOLDER OF THIS CERTIFICATE AT THE
OFFICES OF EVOTEC AG OR WHICH WILL BE FURNISHED BY EVOTEC AG WITHOUT CHARGE,
TO THE HOLDER OF THIS CERTIFICATE UPON WRITTEN REQUEST."

It is understood and agreed that certificates with the legend set forth in the
preceding paragraph will be replaced by delivery of certificates without such
legend, and Parent will cause its transfer agent to promptly issue such a
certificate without such legend, and the sale restrictions described in this
letter agreement will cease to apply, if:

(i) one year shall have elapsed from the date the undersigned acquired the
Parent ADS received in the Merger and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(2) are
then available to the undersigned;

(ii) two years shall have elapsed from the date the undersigned acquired the
Parent ADS received in the Merger and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) are
then applicable to the undersigned;

(iii) Parent has received either an opinion of counsel, which opinion and
counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or a "no action" letter
obtained by the undersigned from the staff of the SEC, to the effect that the
restrictions imposed by Rule 145 under the Securities Act no longer apply to
the undersigned; or

(iv) any registration statement registering the resale of Parent ADS issued
to the undersigned is declared effective by the SEC or automatically becomes
effective.

For so long as and to the extent necessary to permit the undersigned to sell
its shares of the Parent ADS pursuant to Rule 145 and, to the extent
applicable, Rule 144 under the Securities Act, Parent shall file, on a timely
basis, all reports and data required to be filed with the SEC by it pursuant
to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "
_Exchange Act_ "), referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 144 (or, if
applicable, Parent shall make publicly available the information regarding
itself referred to in paragraph (c)(2) of Rule 144), furnish to the
undersigned upon request a written statement as to whether Parent has complied
with such reporting requirements during the twelve months preceding any
proposed sale under Rule 144 and Rule 145 and otherwise take all such actions
as reasonably necessary to permit such sales pursuant to Rule 145 and Rule
