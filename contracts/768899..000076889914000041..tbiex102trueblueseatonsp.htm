For the   avoidance of doubt, any amounts released from the Holdback Account to the Award Participants   as contemplated in Section 9.9(g) shall have already been treated as compensation paid by the   Company (or the applicable Subsidiary), and shall not be subject to employment withholding   Taxes a second time.  From and after the Closing, the Purchaser, the Company and each Seller   hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Securityholder Representative shall be entitled to make   any and all determinations under the Incentive Bonus Plan as if the Securityholder   Representative was the Board (as defined in the Incentive Bonus Plan).

If the Indemnified Party within the   Dispute Period elects not to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any   Indemnification Claim, the Indemnifying Party may defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise   deal with such Indemnification Claim using counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably   satisfactory to the Indemnified Party.  If the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of any   Indemnification Claim, the Indemnifying Party may participate, at its own expense, in the   defense of such Indemnification Claim.  The Parties hereto agree to cooperate fully with each   other in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Indemnification   Claim.  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.5 to the contrary, neither the Indemnifying   Party nor the Indemnified Party shall, without the written consent of the other Party, not to be   unreasonably withheld, settle or compromise any Indemnification Claim or permit a default or   consent to entry of any judgment.  The Parties hereto agree that the Purchaser shall, reasonably   and in good faith, defend the Special Indemnity Matters upon, and subject to, the terms of this   Section 8.5 and that the Purchaser shall not settle any Special Indemnity Matter unless pursuant   to an Approved Settlement Agreement and that the Securityholder Representative shall have the   right to participate, at the Seller&#8217;s expense, in the defense of such Special Indemnity Matters.

(c) After any final and non-appealable decision, judgment or award shall have   been rendered by a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction, or a settlement or arbitration   shall have been consummated, or the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall have   arrived at a mutually binding agreement (any such event a &#8220;Final Determination&#8221;) with respect   to any Indemnification Claim hereunder, then the Indemnifying Party shall pay any amount so   determined to such Indemnified Party.   8.6 Calculation of Losses.   (a) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under   this ARTICLE VIII or Section 6.4 shall (i) be net of any amounts actually recovered or   recoverable by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies or otherwise with respect to such   Losses and each Indemnified Party will use commercially reasonable efforts to collect and/or   recover any such amounts, and (ii) be reduced by the product of (x) the portion of any such Loss   that constitutes a deductible payment for U.S. federal income Tax purposes and (y) an income tax   rate of thirty-five percent (35%).  Any reduction to an indemnity payment under this Section   8.6(a) shall not apply with respect to Special Losses (payments in respect of which shall be   subject to the Special Loss Tax Benefit).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, no   Party shall, in any event, be liable to any other Person for any Losses pursuant to this   ARTICLE VIII or Section 6.4 to the extent such Losses constitute, include or relate to any   consequential, incidental, indirect, special or punitive damages, including loss of future revenue,   income or profits, diminution of value or loss of business reputation or opportunity or a multiple   of revenue, income, profits or any other amount.   (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the   Purchaser Indemnified Parties are not entitled to indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII   or Section 6.4 to the extent that any matter, amount, item of other fact for which they are seeking   indemnification hereunder is an Excluded Item.    (e) For the purposes of determining the amount of Losses  for which   indemnification is provided under this ARTICLE VIII (and, for the avoidance of doubt, not for   determining whether a breach of any representation or warranty set forth in ARTICLE III or   ARTICLE IV has occurred), all qualifications and limitations as to materiality, Material Adverse   Effect and words of similar import in ARTICLE III and ARTICLE IV shall be disregarded,   except in each case (i) with respect to the representations and warranties in Section 3.4(b), the   lead in to Section 3.5 and Section 3.13(b), and (ii) to the extent &#8220;material&#8221; is used to qualify the   subject matter of a representation or warranty (e.g., &#8220;material&#8221; contract) rather than the nature of   an occurrence (e.g., &#8220;material&#8221; violation or &#8220;in all material respects&#8221;).   8.7 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments.  The Parties agree to treat any indemnity   payment made pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII or Section 6.4 as an adjustment to the purchase   price for federal, state, local and foreign income Tax purposes.   8.8 Exclusive Remedy; Release.  The Parties agree that after the Closing, the   exclusive remedies of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties and the Securityholder Indemnified   Parties for any Losses based upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of the matters set forth   in this Agreement and the Transaction Documents are the indemnification obligations of the   Parties set forth in this ARTICLE VIII or Section 6.4.  The Purchaser hereby acknowledges and   agrees that prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall have no right or remedy to take any action in   respect of, and the Company and the Sellers shall have no liability to the Purchaser in respect of,   any breach by the Company or the Sellers, as applicable, of any representations or warranties   contained herein or any failure to comply with any of the covenants, conditions or agreements   contained herein, except (i) to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof, in which   event, the Company and the Sellers shall thereupon only have liability with respect thereto as   provided for in Section 2.5 or (ii) to seek specific performance pursuant to Section 9.13 for   injunctive relief.
