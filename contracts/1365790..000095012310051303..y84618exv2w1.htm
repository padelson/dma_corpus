Certain terms used in this Agreement are used as defined in Section 8.12. 

  

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub have approved this Agreement, and the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") on the terms and subject to the conditions provided for in this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, Parent and certain stockholders of the Company (the " _Controlling Holders_ ") are entering into (a) a voting and support agreement (the " _Voting Agreement_ ") pursuant to which, among other things, such stockholders have agreed to vote to adopt this Agreement and to take certain other actions in furtherance of the Merger, in each case on the terms set forth therein and (b) a share exchange agreement (the " _Share Exchange Agreement_ ") pursuant to which, among other things, such stockholders have agreed to exchange their shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock (in each case, as defined below) for Parent Ordinary Shares (as defined below); 

  

 WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, Parent and certain Controlling Holders are entering into (a) a non-competition and non-solicitation agreement among Parent, the Company and Noam Gottesman, (b) a deed of vendor covenant among Parent, the Company and Pierre Lagrange and (c) a deed of vendor covenant among Parent, the Company and Emmanuel Roman, each dated the date hereof and effective on and from the Closing Date (as defined below);

 WHEREAS, the Special Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Special Committee_ ") has determined that the consideration to be paid for each share of Company Common Stock in the Merger is fair to the holders of such shares (other than the Controlling Holders) and has resolved to recommend that such stockholders adopt and approve this Agreement and the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and 

   ##### 

  

    

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Company and the Controlling Holders are executing and delivering a written waiver (a " _Shareholders Agreement Waiver_ ") which, upon its effectiveness, among other things, waives the transfer restrictions set forth in Article II of the Shareholders Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

 _THE MERGER_  

  

 SECTION 1.1 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date._ " 

  

 SECTION 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as promptly as practicable on the Closing Date the parties shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger, executed in accordance with, and in such form as complies with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger or at such later time as is agreed to by the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

 SECTION 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. From and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation_. The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended at and as of the Effective Time to be in the form of Exhibit A and Exhibit B, respectively, and as so amended shall be the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended (subject to Section 5.8) as provided therein or by Law. 

  

 SECTION 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. Each of the parties shall take all action necessary to cause the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time, to hold office until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or their earlier death or resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take all action necessary to cause the directors of the Company to resign as directors of the Company effective no later than the Effective Time.

ARTICLE II 

   

 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT 
 CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS_ 

  

 SECTION 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub: 

  

 (a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 

  

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock, Parent-Owned Stock and Preferred Stock_. Any shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock, any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any Subsidiary of the Company other than those Subsidiaries listed on Schedule 2.1(b), and any shares of Company Preferred Stock shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stoc_ k. Each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than (i) shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b), (ii) Dissenting Shares, (iii) the Company Restricted Shares and (iv) the Company Stock Rights) shall be converted into the right to receive $4.50 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ "), or un-certificated book-entry shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.2(b), without interest. 

  

 (d) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a stockholder that did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (each, a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ "), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead such holder shall be entitled to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL), unless such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each such share of Company Common Stock, in accordance with Section 2.1(c), without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such demand for payment, or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or timely take any other action to perfect appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Agent pursuant to Section 2.2 to pay for shares of Company Common Stock for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent upon demand. 

  

 SECTION 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Agent_. Upon the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with such bank or trust company as may be designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock converted at the 

   ##### 

  

 

Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.1(c), the aggregate Merger Consideration to which such holders
shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c). All cash so deposited with
the Agent shall, pending its disbursement to such holders, be invested by the
Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that any investment of
such cash shall in all events be limited to (i) direct short-term obligations
of the U.S. government, (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith
and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the
payment of principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated
A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Ratings Services, respectively, (iv) in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion, or (v) money market funds having a rating in
the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency
at the time of such investment; _provided_ , _further_ , that no such
investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article II. Any net profit
resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such amounts on deposit
with the Agent will be payable to Parent or as Parent otherwise directs. 

   

 (b) _Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c) into the right to receive the Merger Consideration a letter of transmittal and related instructions, which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or book-entry transfer of the Book-Entry Shares) to the Agent and which shall otherwise be in customary form and shall include customary provisions (including with respect to delivery of an "agents message" regarding the book-entry transfer of Book-Entry Shares) for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions (or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, receipt of an "agents message" by the Agent or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Agent may reasonably request), the holder of such Certificate (or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable) shall be entitled to receive promptly in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, without interest, for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate (or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable), and the Certificate (or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable) so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If any portion of such consideration is to be issued and paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares were registered, it shall be a condition to such issuance and payment that (1) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and (2) the Person requesting such issuance and payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the issuance and payment of such consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Agent and the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II, without interest. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate to the Agent to receive 

   ##### 

  

 

the consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article II

From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates that evidenced ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by Law. Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.2(e), if, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

 SECTION 2.3 _Company Equity Awards_. 

  

 (a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Share which is then outstanding shall be converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration, the receipt of which shall be subject to the same vesting conditions and other restrictions that were applicable to such Company Restricted Share at the time it was cancelled. For the avoidance of doubt, no interest shall accrue on any cash amount pending the satisfaction of any vesting or other restrictions. As of the Effective Time, all such Company Restricted Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such Company Restricted Share shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, subject to the applicable vesting conditions and other restrictions, to be paid in consideration therefor. 

  

 (b) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding award under the Company Stock Plans which represents a right to receive a share of Company Common Stock upon satisfaction of vesting conditions, which for the avoidance of doubt shall exclude the Company Restricted Shares (the " _Company Stock Rights_ "), shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation, subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions that were applicable to such Company Stock Rights prior to the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Company Stock Rights shall be settleable in Parent Ordinary Shares equal to the product (which shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share) of (i) the number of shares underlying such Company Stock Rights _multiplied by_ (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if and to the extent the representations and warranty contained in the last sentence of Section 3.2(c) is not true and complete as of the Effective Time, or the rollover contemplated in the first sentence of this Section 2.3(b) would be prohibited by applicable securities Laws, the affected Company Stock Rights shall be converted as of the Effective Time into a right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Company Stock Rights, the receipt of which shall be subject to the same vesting and other conditions that were applicable to such Company Stock Rights immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, or shall cause the appropriate administrative body to, take all actions and make such determinations with respect to the Company Restricted Shares and the Company Stock Rights, in each case, as necessary to implement the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.3 (including, any such actions as may be reasonably requested by Parent). Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the Company will not, at the Effective Time, be bound by any options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock rights, restricted stock units, phantom equity awards, warrants or other rights or agreements which would entitle any Person, other than Parent and its subsidiaries, to own any equity interest in the Surviving Corporation or to receive any payment in respect thereof (other than as provided in Section 2.3(a) or 2.3(b)). 

  

 SECTION 2.4 _Exchangeable Shares and Preferred Stock_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee of the Board of 

   #####

Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company. 

   

 SECTION 2.5 _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Article II such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law (including, as applicable, by acceleration to the Effective Time of the vesting of cash awards (under Section 2.3(b)) in an amount sufficient to pay the income tax and/or employee national insurance contributions liability that arises as a result of the transactions contemplated in Section 2.3(b) in respect of U.K. employees). To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. In addition, to the extent such amounts are insufficient to cover the income tax and/or employee national insurance contributions liability imposed on the service provider, vesting of the awards shall be accelerated in an amount sufficient to cover such income tax and/or employee national insurance contributions liability. 

  

 SECTION 2.6 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Article II to the contrary (but without in any way limiting the covenants in Section 5.5), if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or record date of any stock dividend, stock split, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, stock split, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction.

The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and will supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of the Companys Representatives (as defined in Section 5.3), on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Transactions (and, to the extent practicable, the Company and its counsel shall permit Parent and its counsel to participate in all communications with the SEC and its staff (including all meetings and telephone conferences) with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Transactions). If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting any event shall occur, or fact or information shall be discovered, that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC such amendment or supplement as promptly as practicable and, to the extent required by Law, cause such amendment or supplement to be disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. Parent shall cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto.

 (b) Provided that to do so is not inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of Parent to Parent under applicable Law (as reasonably determined by such 

   ##### 

  

 

Board of Directors in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel), Parent shall, through the Board of Directors of Parent, include a
recommendation in the Shareholder Circular that shareholders of Parent vote
so as to provide the Parent Shareholder Approval (the "
_Parent Recommendation_ "). Provided that to do so is not inconsistent with
the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of Parent to Parent under

faith after consultation with outside legal counsel), Parent shall
use reasonable best efforts to obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof and shall not adjourn or
postpone the Parent Shareholders Meeting in order to frustrate or delay
obtaining such Parent Shareholder Approval. Parent shall provide the

Shareholder Approval as the Company may reasonably request. 

   

 (c) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent shall (using its reasonable best efforts) prepare, and file with the UKLA, drafts of the Shareholder Circular and the Prospectus, which shall comply as to form in all material respects with applicable requirements of the Listing Rules and FSMA. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments of the UKLA or its staff on the Shareholder Circular and the Prospectus. Parent shall cause (a) the Shareholder Circular to be mailed to the shareholders of Parent; and (b) the Prospectus to be published, in each case as soon as practicable after the Shareholder Circular and the Prospectus have both been approved by the UKLA. Parent shall notify the Company promptly of the receipt of any comments from the UKLA or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Shareholder Circular and Prospectus and will supply the Company with copies of all correspondence between Parent or any of Parents Representatives, on the one hand, and the UKLA or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Shareholder Circular and the Prospectus (and, to the extent practicable, Parent and its counsel shall permit the Company and its counsel to participate in all communications with the UKLA and its staff (including all meetings and telephone conferences) with respect to the Shareholder Circular and the Prospectus). 

  

 (d) If at any time prior to the Parent Shareholders Meeting any event shall occur, or fact or information shall be discovered, that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Shareholder Circular, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and Parent shall prepare and file with the UKLA such amendment or supplement as promptly as practicable and, to the extent required by Law, cause such amendment or supplement to be disseminated to the shareholders of Parent. 

  

 (e) If at any time prior to the commencement of the trading of the Parent Ordinary Shares on the London Stock Exchange in connection with the Share Exchange Transactions, there arises or is noted a significant new factor, material mistake or inaccuracy relating to the information included in the Prospectus, that should be set forth in a supplement to the Prospectus, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and Parent shall prepare and file with the UKLA such supplement as promptly as practicable and shall cause such supplement to be published once it has been approved by the UKLA.

all information relating to it required by the Listing Rules and FSMA to be
set forth in the Shareholder Circular and the Prospectus and all other
information reasonably requested by the working capital financing sources.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to filing,
mailing or publishing the Shareholder Circular and the Prospectus (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the UKLA
or its staff with respect thereto, Parent shall provide the Company and its
counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document
or response and shall consider in good faith all comments reasonably proposed
by the Company and its counsel. 

   

 SECTION 5.3 _Takeover Proposals; Board Recommendation; Etc_. 

  

 (a) Except as otherwise permitted by this Section 5.3, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall not authorize or permit its and its Subsidiaries respective officers, directors, employees, financial advisors and investment bankers, agents and representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit (or facilitate or encourage, including by way of furnishing non-public information) the making of, or any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that is reasonably likely to lead to, a Takeover Proposal or (B) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any third party regarding a Takeover Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives receives following the date of this Agreement and prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, a written Takeover Proposal which was unsolicited and not involving a breach of this Agreement or any "standstill" agreement and that the Board of Directors of the Company (or any authorized committee thereof) reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and an outside financial advisor, constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and such Board reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company directors fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, then the Company and its Representatives may, prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval and after providing Parent prior written notice of its intention to take such action, and subject to compliance with the Companys obligations under this Section 5.3, (1) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (as defined below), any information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person (or group of Persons) making such Takeover Proposal ( _provided_ , that the Company shall concurrently provide to Parent all non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person given such access which was not previously provided to Parent or its Representatives) and (2) engage and participate in discussions and negotiations with such Person (or group of Persons) regarding such Takeover Proposal. Nothing contained in this Section 5.3 shall restrict the ability of the Company and its Representatives to request and obtain clarification of the terms of any Takeover Proposal. The Company shall provide Parent with a correct and complete copy of each confidentiality agreement entered into pursuant to this Section 5.3 within 48 hours of the execution thereof. The Company shall not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person which prohibits the Company from complying with its obligations to Parent under this Section 5.3. Without limiting any of the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of this Section 5.3 by the Companys 

   ##### 

  

 

Subsidiaries or Representatives under the Companys control shall be deemed to
be a breach of this Section 5.3 by the Company. 

   

 (b) Except as permitted by this Section 5.3(b), neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) withdraw, qualify or change, or publicly propose to withdraw, qualify or change, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation or (B) approve or recommend a Takeover Proposal or an indication of interest (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) authorize or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any merger, acquisition, share exchange or other agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with this Section 5.3) (each, a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ") or (iii)(A) authorize or take any action to make the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL (or any other "business combination _,_ " "control share acquisition," "fair price" or other similar anti-takeover Law), inapplicable to any transaction contemplated by a Takeover Proposal, or (B) release any Person from, or waive, terminate or fail to enforce, any "standstill" or similar obligation of any Person (other than Parent) with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if the Board of Directors of the Company or an authorized committee thereof receives a Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company or an authorized committee thereof reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and an outside financial advisor, constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal and/or the Company or its Subsidiaries may enter into one or more Company Acquisition Agreements with respect to such Superior Proposal if, in the case of a Company Acquisition Agreement, the Company shall have, concurrently with such entry into such Company Acquisition Agreement, terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) and paid to Parent the Company Termination Fee due under Section 7.3(b); _provided_ , _however_ , that no Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or entry into any Company Acquisition Agreement and termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii), shall be made until after the third (3rd) Business Day following Parents receipt of written notice (unless at the time such notice is otherwise required to be given there are less than three (3) Business Days until the Company Stockholders Meeting, in which case the Company shall provide as much notice as is reasonably practicable) from the Company (a " _5.3 Notice_ ") advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or enter into such Company Acquisition Agreement and terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) and specifying the terms and conditions of (and the identity of the Person or group of Persons making) the Superior Proposal and including copies of all materials described in Section 5.3 (d)(ii) (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms or conditions of such Superior Proposal shall require a new 5.3 Notice and a new three (3) Business Day period (unless at the time such notice is otherwise required to be given there are less than three (3) Business Days until the Company Stockholders Meeting, in which case the Company shall provide as much notice as is reasonably practicable)); and during such period, if requested by Parent, the Company shall engage in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in a manner such that the failure by the Board of Directors of the Company to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or to so terminate this Agreement (taking into account the share exchange agreement and any similar arrangements or agreements contemplated by the relevant Takeover Proposal) would not be 

   ##### 

  

 

inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and in
determining whether to make any such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
termination (and whether the relevant Takeover Proposal still constitutes a
Superior Proposal), the Board of Directors of the Company shall take into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement and the Share Exchange
Agreement proposed by Parent. Any Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall
be deemed not to change the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company
for the purposes of causing Section 203 of the DGCL or any other state
takeover statute or similar state Law to be inapplicable to the Transactions
and the Share Exchange Transactions. 

   

 (c) The Board of Directors of the Company may take and disclose to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act if such Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to so disclose such position would constitute a violation of applicable Law. 

  

 (d) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 5.3: 

   

 (i) within 24 hours of the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing discussion or negotiation of, or cooperation with, or assistance or participation in, or facilitation of, any such inquiries, proposal, discussions or negotiations with any third party or its representatives or financing sources conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal, and the Company shall promptly require that each Person (other than Parent) that has executed a confidentiality agreement within the twelve (12)-month period prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with consideration of any potential Takeover Proposal to return to the Company or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and all analyses and other materials prepared by or on behalf of such Person that contains, reflects or analyzes that information; and 

   

 (ii) the Company shall promptly advise Parent in writing, and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt, if any proposal, offer or inquiry is received by, any information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or its Subsidiaries or Representatives in respect of a Takeover Proposal, and shall, in such notice to Parent, indicate the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such proposal, offer, inquiry or request and the terms and conditions of such proposal or offer and the nature of such inquiry or request (and shall include with such notice copies of any draft agreements, financing commitment letters and other written materials and correspondence received from or on behalf of such Person or group of Persons relating to such proposal, offer, inquiry or request), and thereafter shall promptly keep Parent informed of all material developments affecting the status and terms and conditions of such proposal, offer, inquiry or request (and the Company shall provide Parent with copies of any additional drafts of agreements, financing commitment letters and other written materials and correspondence received that relate thereto) and the status of discussions or negotiations. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) As used in this Agreement: 

   

 (i) " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " shall mean any confidentiality agreement entered into after the date of this Agreement that contains provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company (and no less restrictive in any material respect with respect to the conduct of the Person to whom information is disclosed, including with respect to "standstill" provisions) than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement. 

   

 (ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any _bona fide_ written offer made by a third-party to the Company entered into after the date of this Agreement not involving a breach of this Agreement or any "standstill" agreement, to acquire, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the equity securities of the Company or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, which offer is on terms and conditions which the Board of Directors of the Company or any authorized committee thereof reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and an outside financial advisor, to be more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of Company Common Stock (in their capacity as such) than the Merger, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal (including the likelihood and timing of consummation thereof based upon, among other things, the availability of financing and the expectation of obtaining required approvals) and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement committed to by Parent to the Company in writing). 

   

 (iii) " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) or group of Persons relating to, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, any (A) acquisition of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including securities of Subsidiaries, but excluding sales of assets in the ordinary course of business) equal to 15% or more of the Companys consolidated assets or to which 15% or more of the Companys revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable, (B) acquisition of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Section 13 under the Exchange Act) of 15% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock or any other class of equity securities of the Company, (C) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person (or " _group,_ " as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act) beneficially owning 15% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock or (D) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company; in each case, other than the Transactions and the Share Exchange Transactions.

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including Section 5.3(b) and 5.4(d)), each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with the other parties hereto and use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things, necessary to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable and to 

   ##### 

  

 

consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Transactions, including preparing and filing promptly and fully all
documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions,

documents (including any required filings under applicable Antitrust Laws),
and (ii) obtain all approvals, consents, registrations, permits,
authorizations and other confirmations (A) required from third parties in
connection with the Transactions ( _provided_ , _however_ , that no
party hereto shall be obligated to pay any consideration (or grant any
financial accommodation) to any third party from whom any such approval,
consent or other confirmation is requested) and (B) from Governmental
Authorities necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions.
For purposes hereof, " _Antitrust Laws_ " means the Sherman Act, as amended,
the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, and the Federal Trade Commission

 (c) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, and (ii) keep the other parties informed in all material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, the European Commission or any other Governmental Authority and of any material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the Transactions. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, each of the parties hereto shall (1) have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each shall consult the other on, all the information relating to Transactions or the other parties that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions, and (2) to the extent allowed by the applicable Governmental

The parties hereto agree that each such Irish Fund shall be deemed to have consented for all purposes under this Agreement to the transactions contemplated hereby and the continued management of such Irish Fund by GLG Partners Asset Management Limited and discretionary investment management by GLG Partners LP following the Closing if such continued management following the Closing has been approved in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, unless at any time prior to the Closing such Irish Fund notifies the GLG Partners Asset Management Limited in writing that such Irish Fund has terminated its Advisory Agreement prior to or following the Closing (and such notice is not withdrawn). 

  

 (f) If consent is required or notice is required to be given (i) by applicable Law, (ii) by the Advisory Agreement of, or relating to, any Client (other than an Irish Fund) for the deemed assignment or continuation of the Advisory Agreement relating to such Client, or (iii) by the offering documents or constituent documents of any Fund, in each case as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, send a notice (" _Transaction Notice_ ") informing any relevant Client of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (if required) requesting the consent of such Client to the transactions or the deemed assignment or continuation of such Advisory Agreement. 

   #####

 SECTION 5.8 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

The Surviving Corporation shall advance all fees and expenses (including without limitation fees and expenses of legal counsel, experts, litigation consultants, and the cost of any appeal bonds) incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding within ten (10) Business Days after the receipt by 

   ##### 

  

 

the Surviving Corporation of a statement or statements requesting such
advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of
any Proceeding. The Indemnitee shall qualify for advances, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, solely upon the execution and delivery
to the Surviving Corporation of an undertaking providing that the Indemnitee
undertakes to repay the advance to the extent that it is ultimately
determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company
under the provisions of this Agreement, the Organizational Documents of the
Surviving Corporation, applicable Law or otherwise. Without limiting the
foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions
no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of
liabilities of directors and officers, indemnification and advancement of
expenses than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the
Organizational Documents of the Company, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees.

  

 (b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain and extend all directors and officers liability insurance policies (both primary and any and all excess policies) maintained by the Company on the date of this Agreement (collectively, the " _Current D andO Policies_") for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time with respect to claims arising in whole or in part from facts or events that actually or allegedly occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the Transactions or the Share Exchange Transactions;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may substitute therefor policies of substantially equivalent coverage and amounts containing terms no less favorable to the covered persons; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the Current DandO Policies expire or are terminated or cancelled during such period through no fault of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, then Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall obtain substantially similar DandO insurance; _provided further_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent be required to pay aggregate premiums for such similar insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual premiums paid in the aggregate by the Company for the Current DandO Policies, as set forth on Section 5.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Maximum Premium_ "). In lieu of the foregoing, the Company may obtain one or more prepaid and non-cancelable directors and officers insurance tail policies applicable for the period of six (6) years commencing at the Effective Time (including with respect to acts or omissions in connection with the Transactions or the Share Exchange Transactions) and ending on the six (6)-year anniversary of the Effective Time (the " _D andO Tail Period_"); such insurance policies shall provide at least the same coverage with respect to amounts, scope, terms and conditions as the Current DandO Policies; _provided_ , that the aggregate premium for such prepaid policies shall not exceed the Maximum Premium, and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if the Company is unable to obtain, prior to the Effective Time, insurance tail policies meeting the above requirements, the Company may instead obtain prior to the Effective Time as much comparable insurance for the DandO Tail Period as reasonably practicable for an aggregate policy premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium.

  

 (c) The provisions of this Section 5.8 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise.

 SECTION 5.9 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto shall cooperate to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) in the Transactions or the Share Exchange Transactions by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with the interpretative guidance set forth by the SEC with respect to such matters.

 (b) The Company shall deliver to Parent the information and reports listed on Exhibit 5.11(b). 

  

 SECTION 5.12 _Securityholder Litigation_. Company and the Parent shall reasonably cooperate in connection with the defense or settlement of any securityholder litigation

litigation without Parents prior consent. 

   

 SECTION 5.13 _Consolidation_.

 SECTION 5.14 _Warrant Tender Offers_.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the closing of the Warrant Offers shall be conditioned on the completion of the Merger and the Warrant Offers shall otherwise be consummated in compliance with applicable Laws and SEC rules and regulations.

Parent shall (i) upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out of pocket costs (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the actions of the Company and its Subsidiaries contemplated by this Section 5.14 and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries from and against any and all claims, losses and damages suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the Warrant Offers.
