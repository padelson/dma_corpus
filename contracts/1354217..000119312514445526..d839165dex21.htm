1 AGREEMENT

 

The Parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

 

SECTION 1\. THE OFFER

1.1 The Offer.

(a) Commencement of the Offer. Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with Section 8, as promptly as practicable
after the date of this Agreement but in no event later than December 30, 2014,
Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer.

(b) Terms and Conditions of the Offer. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, including the prior satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in Annex I (collectively, the " _Offer Conditions_ "), as soon as practicable
after the Expiration Date (but no later than 9:00 am Eastern Time, on the
first business day after the Expiration Date), Purchaser shall (and Parent
shall cause Purchaser to) accept for payment and promptly thereafter (but no
later than the first business day after the Expiration Date) pay for all
Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer. The
Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that contains terms not inconsistent with those set forth in this
Agreement. Purchaser expressly reserves the right to (i) increase the Offer
Price, (ii) waive any Offer Condition and (iii) make any other changes in the
terms and conditions of the Offer not inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise provided by this
Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Company, Purchaser shall
not (A) decrease the Offer Price, (B) change the form of consideration payable
in the Offer, (C) decrease the maximum number of Shares sought to be
purchased in the Offer, (D) impose conditions to the Offer in addition to the
Offer Conditions, (E) amend or modify any of the Offer Conditions in a manner
that adversely affects holders of Shares generally, (F) change the Minimum
Condition, (G) extend or otherwise change the Expiration Date in a manner
other than as required or permitted by this Agreement or (H) provide any
"subsequent offering period" within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated
under the Exchange Act. The Offer may not be terminated prior to the
Expiration Date (or any rescheduled Expiration Date) of the Offer without the
prior written consent of the Company, unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Section 8.

(c) Expiration and Extension of the Offer. Unless extended pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire twenty (20) business days (for this purpose determined as
set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following the Offer
Commencement Date at midnight Eastern Time (unless otherwise agreed to in
writing by Parent and the Company) (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ," such
date or such subsequent date to which the expiration of the Offer is extended
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ ").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but
subject to the Parties respective termination rights under Section 8: (i) if,
as of the scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and
has not been waived if permitted hereunder, Purchaser may, in its discretion
(and without the consent of the Company or any other Person), extend the Offer
on one or more occasions, for an additional period of up to ten (10) business
days per extension, to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied; (ii)
Purchaser shall extend the Offer from time to time for: (A) the minimum period
required by any Legal Requirement, interpretation or position of the SEC or
its staff or NASDAQ or its staff, in each case, applicable to the Offer; and
(B) periods of up to ten (10) business days per extension, until any waiting
period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the
Offer under the HSR Act and any foreign antitrust or competition-related Legal
Requirement shall have expired or been terminated; and (iii) if, as of the
scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not
been waived, at the request of the Company, Purchaser shall extend the Offer
on one or more occasions for an additional period of up to ten (10) business
days per extension, to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied;
_provided, however,_ that in no event shall Purchaser: (1) be required to
extend the Offer beyond the earliest to

 



2  occur of (the " _Extension Deadline_ ") (x) the valid termination of this
Agreement in compliance with Section 8 and (y) the End Date; or (2) be
permitted to extend the Offer beyond the Extension Deadline without the prior
written consent of the Company.

(d) Termination of Offer. In the event that this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to) promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours
of such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and
shall not acquire any Shares pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is terminated
or withdrawn by Purchaser, Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause
any depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, in accordance with
applicable Legal Requirements, all tendered Shares to the registered holders
thereof.

(e) Offer Documents. As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement
of the Offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent
and Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC a tender offer statement on Schedule
TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto and including exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") that will
contain or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase and form of the
related letter of transmittal and (ii) cause the Offer to Purchase and
related documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares. Parent and
Purchaser agree that they shall cause the Schedule TO and all exhibits,
amendments or supplements thereto (which together constitute the " _Offer
Documents_ ") filed by either Parent or Purchaser with the SEC to comply in
all material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder and other applicable Legal Requirements. Each of Parent, Purchaser
and the Company agrees to promptly correct any information provided by it for
use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent further
agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly cause the Offer
Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be promptly
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable Legal Requirements. The Company shall promptly furnish or
otherwise make available to Parent and Purchaser or Parents legal counsel all
information concerning the Company and the Companys stockholders that may
be required in connection with any action contemplated by this Section
1.1(e), including communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders
of the Shares. The Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC. Parent and Purchaser agree to provide the Company and
its counsel with any comments Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after
receipt of such comments. Each of Parent and Purchaser shall respond promptly
to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents or
the Offer.

 

(f) Funds. Without limiting the generality of Section 9.10, Parent shall cause
to be provided to Purchaser all of the funds necessary to purchase any Shares
that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer, and shall
cause Purchaser to perform, on a timely basis, all of Purchasers obligations
under this Agreement. Parent and Purchaser shall, and each of Parent and
Purchaser shall ensure that all of their respective Affiliates shall, tender
any Shares held by them into the Offer.

 

(g) Offer Price Adjustment. The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately
and proportionately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change
with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof
and at or prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, and such adjustment to the Offer
Price shall provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action; _provided_
that nothing in this Section 1.1(g) shall be construed to permit the Company
to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement.

 

1.2 Company Actions.

 

(a) Schedule 14D-9. As promptly as practicable on the day that the Offer is
commenced, following the filing of the Schedule TO, the Company shall file
with the SEC and disseminate to holders of Shares, in each

 



3  case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, a
Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together
with any exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_
") that, subject to Section 6.1(b), shall reflect the Company Board
Recommendation. The Company agrees that it will cause the Schedule 14D-9 to
comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable
Legal Requirements. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to
respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff and to promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and
to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect, and the Company further agrees to use all commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be
promptly filed with the SEC and to be promptly disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendment thereto prior
to the filing thereof with the SEC. The Company agrees to provide Parent and
its counsel with any comments the Company or its counsel may receive from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of
such comments. The Company shall respond promptly to any comments of the SEC
or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9.

 

(b) Stockholder Lists. The Company shall promptly furnish Parent with a list
of its stockholders, mailing labels and any available listing or computer
file containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and
lists of securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories, in each
case accurate and complete as of the most recent practicable date, and shall
provide to Parent such additional information (including updated lists of
stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such other
assistance as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the Offer.
Parent and Purchaser and their agents shall hold in confidence the
information contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such
information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this
Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request, deliver, and shall use
their reasonable efforts to cause their agents to deliver, to the Company (or
destroy) all copies and any extracts or summaries from such information then
in their possession or control.

 

SECTION 2\. MERGER TRANSACTION

conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the Section
251(h) of the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Purchaser shall be merged with and
into the Company and the separate existence of Purchaser shall cease. The
Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger, and the separate
corporate existence of the Company, with all its rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger,
except as set forth in this Section 2\.

 

2.2 Effect of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

2.3 Closing; Effective Time.

 

(a) Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to Section 8,
and unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the Company, Parent
and Purchaser, the consummation of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at the offices of Cooley LLP, 4401 Eastgate Mall, San Diego, CA 92121,
immediately following the Offer Acceptance Time, except that if any condition
set forth in Section 7 shall not be satisfied or waived by such date, in any
event no later than the first (1st) business day after the satisfaction
or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth
in Section 7\. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the "Closing Date."

 

(b) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, concurrently with or as soon
as practicable following the Closing, the Company and Purchaser shall file or
cause to be filed a certificate of merger with the Secretary

 



4  of State of the State of Delaware with respect to the Merger, in such form
as required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon the date and
time of the filing of such certificate of merger with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware or such later date and time as is agreed upon in
writing by the parties hereto and specified in the certificate of merger
(such date and time, the " _Effective Time_ ").

2.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. Unless
otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time:

(a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated as of the Effective Time to conform to the certificate of
incorporation of Purchaser as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time;

 

(b) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as
of the Effective Time to conform to the Bylaws of Purchaser as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

(c) the directors and officers of Purchaser immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of the Surviving
Corporation immediately following the Effective Time.

2.5 Conversion of Shares.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any stockholder of
the Company:

(i) any Shares then held by the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company (or held in the Companys treasury) shall be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor;

 

(ii) any Shares then held by Parent, Purchaser or any other wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

(iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" above and subject to
Section 2.5(b), each Share then outstanding (other than any Dissenting Shares,
as defined below) shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price
in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without interest, subject to any
withholding of Taxes required by applicable Legal Requirements in accordance
with Section 2.6(e); and

 

(iv) each share of the common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Purchaser
then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) Without duplication of any adjustment made pursuant to Section 1.1(g),
the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately and proportionately
to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company
Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company
Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and at or prior to the
Effective Time, and such adjustment to the Merger Consideration shall provide
to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action.

 

2.6 Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock to

 



5  receive the funds to which holders of such shares shall become entitled
pursuant to Section 2.5 (subject to Section 2.8(c)). Substantially concurrent
with the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to make payment of the cash
consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.5 (subject to Section 2.8(c)) (the
" _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by
the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than ten (10)
days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each
Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5 (other than those
entitled to be paid pursuant to Section 2.8(c)) a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing
such Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the
Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to such letter of transmittal.
Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates (or effective affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
Share formerly evidenced by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No interest shall
accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of
any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the benefit of the holder thereof.
If the payment of any Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates formerly evidencing
the Shares is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it
shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. Payment of the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only
be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

 

(c) At any time following the 180th day after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and
not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including, all
interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all
funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled
to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat
and other similar Legal Requirements) only as general creditors thereof with
respect to the Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by them. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger
Consideration delivered in respect of such share to a public official pursuant
to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar Legal Requirements. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Body
shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the
property of the Surviving Corporation or its designee, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company with respect to the Shares shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein or
by applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(e) Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Purchaser shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold (or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold)
from the Merger Consideration payable to any holder of Shares or any other
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it
is required by

 



6  any Legal Requirement to deduct and withhold with respect to Taxes. Each
such payor shall take all action as may be necessary to ensure that any such
amounts so withheld are timely and properly remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Body. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of Shares or other recipient of consideration hereunder in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an effective affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, which shall include an agreement
to indemnify and defend and hold harmless Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent from and against any and all costs, claims,
losses, judgments, damages, counsel fees, expenses and liabilities whatsoever
which each may suffer, sustain or incur in connection with the failure of any
statement, representation or warranty set forth in such affidavit, any
payment for or transfer, exchange or delivery of such Certificate and such
Persons inability to locate such Certificate, and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in customary and reasonable amount as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay (less any amounts entitled to be
deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 2.6(e)), in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be
paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by
such Certificate, as contemplated by this Section 2\.

 

2.7 Dissenters Rights.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
held by holders who are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL and have properly exercised and perfected their respective demands for
appraisal of such shares in the time and manner provided in Section 262 of
the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, have neither effectively withdrawn nor
lost their rights to such appraisal and payment under the DGCL (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive
Merger Consideration, but shall, by virtue of the Merger, be entitled to only
such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL;
_provided, that_ if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost such holders right to appraisal, such
holders Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration without any
interest thereon (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld
pursuant to Section 2.6(e)), and such shares shall not be deemed to be
Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands. Parent shall not, except with the prior written
consent of the Company, require the Company to make any payment with respect
to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands. 

(b) Within ten (10) days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall provide each of the holders of Company Common Stock with the notice
contemplated by Section 262 of the DGCL.

2.8 Treatment of Company Options and Company RSUs.

(a) Each Company Option that is then outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Offer Acceptance Time shall accelerate and become fully vested and
exercisable effective immediately prior to the Offer Acceptance Time. As of
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the holders thereof, each Company Option that is then outstanding and
unexercised shall be cancelled and be converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash, rounding such amount down to the nearest whole cent, equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (i) the total number of Shares subject to
such fully vested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise
price payable per Share under such Company Option, which amount shall be paid
in accordance

 



7  with Section 2.8(c). Each Company Option that has an exercise price per
Share that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be
cancelled at the Effective Time and shall cease to exist without entitling
the holder thereof to receive any payment under this Section 2.8(a) before or
after the Effective Time.

 

(b) Each restricted stock unit award granted under any of the Company Equity
Plans (the " _Company RSUs_ ") that is then outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Offer Acceptance Time shall become fully vested effective
immediately prior to the Offer Acceptance Time. In lieu of an issuance of
Shares in settlement of such vested Company RSUs, as of the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders
thereof, each Company RSU shall be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash, rounding such amount down to the nearest whole
cent, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the total number of
Shares otherwise issuable with regard to such fully vested Company RSUs
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Merger Consideration,
which amount shall be paid in accordance with Section 2.8(c).

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but no later
than the second payroll date after the Effective Time), the Surviving
Corporation shall pay the aggregate amount, net of any applicable withholding
Taxes deducted pursuant to Section 2.6(e), payable with respect to Company
Options and Company RSUs through, to the extent applicable, the Surviving
Corporations payroll to the holders of Company Options and Company RSUs;
_provided, however,_ that to the extent the holder of a Company Option or
Company RSU is not, and was not at any time during the vesting period of the
Company Option or Company RSU, a Company employee, the consideration payable
pursuant to Section 2.8(a) with respect to such Company Options or Section
2.8(b) with respect to such Company RSU shall be paid in the manner described
in Section 2.6.

(d) All amounts paid in respect of the Company Options and Company RSUs in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Options and
Company RSUs.

 

2.9 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of
Purchaser and the Company, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of
Purchaser, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

documents and any documents filed with or furnished to the SEC after the date
of this Agreement, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective
dates, the Company SEC Documents complied, or if filed or furnished subsequent
to the date of this Agreement, will comply, in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Documents and, except to the extent
that information contained in any Company SEC Document has been revised,
amended, modified or superseded (prior to the date of this Agreement) by a
later filed Company SEC Document, none of the Company SEC Documents when filed
or furnished contained, and any Company SEC Document filed with or furnished
to the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement will not contain, any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements

(c) The Company maintains, and at all times since January 1, 2013 has
maintained, a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as

accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in

controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013. To the knowledge
of the Company, except as set forth in the Company SEC Documents filed prior

the management or other employees of the Company; or (3) any claim or
allegation regarding any of the foregoing.

recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to enable each of the
principal executive officer of the Company and the principal financial
officer of the Company to make the certifications required under the Exchange
Act with respect to such reports. The Company is in compliance in all material
respects with all current listing and corporate governance requirements of

other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a)
of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)) where the result, purpose
or intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, any Acquired Corporation in
any Acquired Corporations published financial statements or other Company SEC
Documents.

3.8 Intellectual Property.

 

(a) Part 3.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies (i) the name (or
names for co-applicants/registrants/owners) of applicant/registrant and
current owner, (ii) the jurisdiction of application/registration and (iii) the
application or registration number for each item of Registered IP, owned by or
exclusively licensed to any Acquired Corporation. Each of the patents and
patent applications included in the Registered IP that are owned solely by any
Acquired Corporation (and, to the knowledge of the Company, each of the
Companys co-owned patents and patent applications) properly identifies
by name each and every inventor of the claims thereof as determined in
accordance with the Legal Requirements of the jurisdiction in which such
patent is issued or such patent application is pending. The Acquired
Corporations own and possess all right, title and interest in and to or have
the right to use, pursuant to a valid and enforceable agreement, all material
Company IP, free and clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted
Encumbrances. As of the date of this Agreement, no interference, opposition,
reissue, reexamination, cancellation or other proceeding of any nature (other
than initial examination proceedings) is pending or was pending during the
past three years or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, in which
the scope, validity, enforceability or ownership of any Registered IP listed
on Part 3.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule is being or has been
contested or challenged. All trademarks and designs included in Registered IP
have been in continuous use by an Acquired Corporation since they were first
used by an Acquired Corporation or are planned to be in use by an Acquired
Corporation. To the knowledge of Company, there has been no prior use of such
trademarks or designs by any Person which would confer upon such Person
superior rights in such trademarks or designs, respectively; and the
registered trademarks have been continuously used in the form appearing in,
and in connection with the goods and services listed in, their
respective registration certificates or identified in their respective
pending applications. Since January 1, 2013, no patent included in the
Registered IP, while under the control of the Company or to the Companys
knowledge, has been or is now involved in any infringement, interference,
reissue, re-examination, opposition, invalidity or nullity proceeding. No
copyright registration included in Registered IP has been or is now involved
in any litigation. To the knowledge of Company, there are no (i) trademarks
of any third party potentially conflicting with the trademarks included in the
Registered IP, (ii) designs of any third party potentially conflicting with
the designs included in Registered IP, or (iii) patents of any third parties
potentially interfering with the patents included in Registered IP. Part
3.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule describes each filing, payment, and
action that, as of the date of this Agreement, must be made or taken on
or before the date that is one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of
this Agreement with respect to such Registered IP and for which the Company is
responsible.

 

(b) No Company Associate owns or has any claim, right (whether or not
currently exercisable) or interest to or in any Company IP and each Company
Associate who is or was involved in the creation or development of any Company
IP has signed a valid, enforceable agreement containing an assignment of
Intellectual Property Rights to the Company and confidentiality
provisions protecting the Company IP. Such assignments of Intellectual
Property Rights to an Acquired Corporation by a Company Associate have
complied with the local Legal Requirements in which an Acquired Corporation
operates, including Legal Requirements regarding remuneration or
compensation, to effectuate a valid assignment.

(c) To the knowledge of the Company, no funding, facilities or personnel of
any Governmental Body or any university, college, research institute or other
educational institution is being used, directly or indirectly, to create, in
whole or in part, Intellectual Property Rights owned or purported to be owned
by the Acquired Corporations, except for any such funding or use of facilities
or personnel that does not result in such Governmental Body or institution
obtaining ownership rights to such Intellectual Property Rights.

 

(d) The Acquired Corporations have taken commercially reasonable steps to
maintain the confidentiality of and otherwise protect and enforce its rights
in all material proprietary information held by the

 



14  Acquired Corporations, or purported to be held by the Acquired Corporations,
as a material trade secret. To the knowledge of the Company, no current or
former employee, consultant, contractor, partner or investor of any Acquired
Corporation is in unauthorized possession of any of the trade secrets included
in Company IP.

(e) Part 3.8(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth each license
agreement pursuant to which an Acquired Corporation licenses in any material
Intellectual Property Right (each an " _In-bound License_ ") or licenses
out any material Intellectual Property Right owned by an Acquired Corporation
(each an " _Out-bound License_ ") ( _provided_ , that, In-bound Licenses shall
not include commercially available off-the-shelf software and non-exclusive
licenses entered into in the ordinary course of business, and, Out-bound
Licenses shall not include non-exclusive outbound licenses entered into in the
ordinary course of business; _provided further_ , that for the avoidance
of doubt, In-bound Licenses and Out-bound Licenses shall include patent or
technology licenses and licenses for which ongoing future royalty payments (in
excess of $50,000 annually) are due regardless of whether such licenses are
non-exclusive or exclusive and such licenses will not be considered "non-
exclusive licenses entered into in the ordinary course of business" within the
meaning of the preceding proviso).

 

(f) To the knowledge of the Company: (i) the operation of the business of the
Acquired Corporations as currently conducted does not infringe,
misappropriate, dilute or otherwise violate any Intellectual Property Rights
owned by any other Person; and (ii) no other Person is infringing,
misappropriating, diluting or otherwise violating any Company IP owned by the
Acquired Corporations. As of the date of this Agreement, no Legal Proceeding
is pending and served (or, to the knowledge of the Company, is being
threatened or is pending and has not been served) against an Acquired
Corporation or by an Acquired Corporation relating to any actual, alleged or
suspected infringement, misappropriation, dilution or other violation of any
Intellectual Property Rights of another Person or to the Companys Registered
IP or a the Companys Intellectual Property Rights. Since January 1, 2011
through the date hereof, no Acquired Corporation has received any written
notice or other written communication relating to any actual, foreseen,
alleged or suspected infringement, misappropriation, dilution or other
violation of any Intellectual Property Right of another Person by an Acquired
Corporation.

(g) None of the Acquired Corporations is now nor has ever been a member or
promoter of, or a contributor to, any industry standards body or any similar
organization that would reasonably be expected to require or obligate the
Acquired Corporation to grant or offer to any other Person any license or
right to any Company IP. To the knowledge of the Company, no Company Product
is distributed with any software that is licensed pursuant to an "open source"
or other third party license agreement that requires the disclosure or
licensing of any source code for any Company Product or requires any Company
Product to be made available at no charge or grant, or purport to grant, to
any third party, any rights or immunities under any Company IP (including,
but not limited to, using any open source materials that require, as a
condition of use, modification or distribution of the open source materials
that other software incorporated into, derived from or distributed with the
open source materials be (i) disclosed or distributed in source code form,
(ii) be licensed for the purpose of making derivative works or (iii) be
redistributable at no charge). The Acquired Corporations have not disclosed,
delivered, licensed or otherwise made available, and the Acquired
Corporations do not have a duty or obligation (whether present, contingent, or
otherwise) to disclose, deliver, license, or otherwise make available, any
source code for any Company Product to any third party who is not, as of the
date of this Agreement, an employee of the Acquired Corporations.

(h) To the knowledge of the Company, there are no defects in any of software
included in the Company Products that would prevent the same from performing
materially in accordance with its user specifications and there are no
viruses, worms, Trojan horses or similar disabling codes or programs in any
of software included in the Company Products.

(i) None of the Company IP owned or purported to be owned by the
Acquired Corporations is subject to any pending or outstanding injunction,
directive, order, judgment, or other disposition of dispute that adversely
restricts the use, transfer, registration or licensing of any such
Intellectual Property Rights by the Acquired

 



15  Corporations or otherwise adversely affects the validity, scope, use,
registrability, or enforceability of any Company IP owned or purported to be
owned by the Acquired Corporations.

Company Product sold or intended to be sold by the Acquired Corporations,
(ii) a change in the marketing classification or a material change in the
labeling of any such Company Products, (iii) a termination, enjoinment or
suspension of the manufacturing, marketing, or distribution of such Company

Product, that in each case, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
material impact on the business of the Acquired Corporations.

3.13 Certain Business Practices. Since January 1, 2009, (a) none of (i) the

any Acquired Corporation; (b) none of the Acquired Corporations have received
any written notice or communication, or to the knowledge of the Company, any

acting for or on behalf of an Acquired Corporation, may have violated any
Anti-Corruption Law applicable to any Acquired Corporation; (c) none of the

indirectly, of any monies or anything of value to any Person for the purpose
of influencing any act or decision of such Person to assist an Acquired
Corporation in obtaining or retaining business, or directing business to any
person or to secure any other illegal benefit or advantage. Since January 1,
2009 and to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements, the books
and records of the Acquired Corporations accurately and fairly reflect the

to maintain accountability for assets, (iii) access to assets is permitted
only in accordance with managements general or specific authorization, and
(iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the actual levels
at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences. The Acquired Corporations have instituted policies
and procedures in relation to business conduct and ethics reasonably designed
to prevent or detect any conduct of business of the Acquired Corporations
involving the actions described in the foregoing clauses (a) through (d) of
this Section 3.13 and, to the knowledge of the Company, there has not been
since January 1, 2009 any breach of such policies or procedures.

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Governmental
Authorizations held by the Acquired Corporations are, in all material
respects, valid and in full force and effect. The Acquired Corporations are in
compliance with the terms and requirements of such Governmental
Authorizations, except where failure to be in compliance, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2010, the Acquired Corporations

otherwise incurred any obligation or liability (including any

expected to affect materially and adversely the qualified status of any such
Employee Plan. Each of the Employee Plans is now and has been established,
operated and administered in compliance in all material respects with its

have engaged in a transaction in connection with which such
Acquired Corporation reasonably would be subject to either a material
liability pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a Tax imposed pursuant
to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code that is not curable without material cost
to the Acquired Corporations. For the last six (6) years, the Acquired
Corporations have performed in all material respects all obligations required

of an Acquired Corporation pursuant to any retiree medical, retiree
disability, retiree life insurance benefit plan or other retiree welfare plan.

 

(h) All Foreign Employee Plans comply in all material respects with applicable
local Legal Requirements, and all such plans that are intended to be funded
and/or book-reserved are funded and/or book-reserved, as appropriate, based on
reasonable actuarial assumptions, except where such failure to comply or
failure to be so funded and/or book-reserved has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result in a
material liability to the Acquired Corporations or otherwise interfere in any
material respect with the conduct of their respective businesses as now being
conducted.

 

(i) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Transactions (including in combination with other events or circumstances)

25  increase in severance pay, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting,
or increase the amount of, compensation or benefits due to any such employee,

the Acquired Corporations to transfer or set aside any material assets to fund
any benefits under any Employee Plan, (iv) otherwise give rise to any material
liability under any Employee Plan, (v) limit or restrict the right to merge,

the Code has been administered in compliance with its terms and the

not reasonably be expected to result in a material liability to the
Acquired Corporations. The Acquired Corporations do not have an obligation to

provider pursuant to Section 409A or 4999 of the Code.

to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, (b) to

in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
all such policies, programs and arrangements are in full force and effect, no
notice of cancellation or modification has been received, and there is no
existing default or event which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default, by any insured thereunder.

Agreement, the Company shall have complied with Section 8.1(f). For the
avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 6.1(b)(i) shall also apply
to any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal or any successive
Acquisition Proposals and require a new Determination Notice, except that, in
the case of material amendments to any Acquisition Proposal, the references to
three (3) business days shall be deemed to be two (2) business days; or

(ii) if the decision to make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation in not in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal, (A) a Change in Circumstance shall
have occurred, (B) the Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure
to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors of the Company to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal
Requirements; (C) the Company shall have given Parent a Determination Notice
at least three (3) business days prior to making any such Company Adverse
Change Recommendation; and (D) (1) the Company shall have specified in
reasonable detail the Change in Circumstance and the reasons for the Company
Adverse Change Recommendation, (2) the Company shall have given Parent the
three (3) business days after the Determination Notice to propose revisions to
the terms of this Agreement or make other proposals and shall have negotiated
in good faith with Parent (and caused its Representatives to negotiate with
Parent) with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposals, if any, so
that such Change in Circumstance would no longer necessitate a Company Adverse
Change Recommendation, and (3) after considering the results of
such negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by Parent, if any,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, the Companys Board of
Directors shall have determined, in good faith, that the failure to make the
Company Adverse Change Recommendation in response to such Change in
Circumstance would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors of the Company to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal
Requirements. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section
6.1(b)(ii) shall also apply to any material change to the facts and
circumstances relating to such Change in Circumstance and require a new
Determination Notice, except that the references to three (3) business days
shall be deemed to be two (2) business days.

6.2 Filings, Consents and Approvals.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, to file, or cause to be filed, all documents

Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Antitrust Laws to consummate and make effective the Transactions

necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, decisions,
declarations, approvals and, expirations or terminations of waiting periods

steps requested or required by any Governmental Body as a condition to
granting any consent, permit, authorization, waiver, clearance and approvals,

period and to resolve such objections, if any, as the FTC and the DOJ, or
other Governmental Bodies of any other jurisdiction for which consents,
permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals and expirations or
terminations of waiting periods are sought with respect to the Transactions,
so as to obtain termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act or other
Antitrust Laws, and to avoid the commencement of a lawsuit by the FTC, the
DOJ or other Governmental Bodies under Antitrust Laws, and to avoid the entry
of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining

 



37  order or other order in any suit or proceeding which would otherwise have
the effect of preventing the Closing or materially delaying the Offer
Acceptance Time or the Closing or delaying the Offer Acceptance Time beyond
the Expiration Date, _provided that_ the Company will only be required to take
or commit to take any such action, or agree to any such condition or
restriction, if such action, commitment, agreement, condition or restriction
is binding on the Company only in the event the Closing occurs.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Parties hereto shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates, if
applicable, to): (i) promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) business
days after the date hereof, make an appropriate filing of all Notification
and Report forms as required by the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions;
(ii) promptly make all other filings, notifications or other consents as may
be required to be made or obtained by such Party under foreign Antitrust Laws
in those jurisdictions identified in Schedule 6.2(c), which contains the list
of the only jurisdictions where clearance is a condition to Closing; and (iii)
cooperate with each other in determining whether, and promptly preparing
and making, any other filings, notifications or other consents are required
to be made with, or obtained from, any other Governmental Bodies in connection
with the Transactions.

best efforts to (i) give the other Parties prompt notice of the making or
commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding brought by a Governmental Body or brought by a third party
before any Governmental Body, in each case, with respect to the Transactions,
(ii) keep the other Parties reasonably informed as to the status of any such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, (iii) promptly
inform the other Parties of any communication to or from the FTC, DOJ or any
other Governmental Body in connection with any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, (iv) promptly furnish to the other
Party, subject to an appropriate confidentiality agreement to limit
disclosure to counsel and outside consultants, with copies of documents

request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding (other than "4(c)
documents" as that term is used in the rules and regulations under the HSR
Act), (v) subject to an appropriate confidentiality agreement to limit
disclosure to counsel and outside consultants, and to the extent reasonably
practicable, consult and cooperate with the other Parties and will consider in
good faith the views of the other Parties in connection with any analysis,
appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or
proposal made or submitted in connection with any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, and (vi) except as may be
prohibited by any Governmental Body or by any Legal Requirement, in connection
with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding in
respect of the Transactions, each Party hereto will permit authorized
Representatives of the other Party to be present at each meeting or conference
relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding
and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any argument,
opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Body in connection
with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding. Each
Party shall supply as promptly as practicable such information, documentation,
other material or testimony that may be requested by any Governmental Body,
including by complying at the earliest reasonably practicable date with any
request for additional information, documents or other materials received by
any Party or any of their respective Subsidiaries from any Governmental Body
in connection with such applications or filings or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and the Company shall have the right
to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the
other on, all the information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case
may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries that appear in any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any
Governmental Body in connection with the Offer and the Transactions (including
the Offer Documents) and shall incorporate all comments reasonably proposed
by Parent or the Company, as the case may be; provided, however, that with
respect to any documents or materials required to be filed under the HSR Act,
or other laws of any other applicable jurisdiction that contain information
that is confidential or proprietary to the providing party (including any so
called 4(c) or 4(d) documents), such information shall be provided solely to
those individuals acting as outside antitrust counsel for the other parties;
_provided_ that such counsel shall not disclose such information to such
other parties and shall enter into a joint defense agreement with the
providing party; _provided further_ that, the individuals acting as

 



38  outside antitrust counsel for Company may redact from such information any
information related to Companys transaction process, including third party
bidders, third party offers, financial advice and the value of the
Transaction.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement, including without limitation, any provision of
this Section 6.2, shall require, or be construed to require, Parent or any of
its Affiliates to proffer to, or agree (i) to, sell, divest, lease, license,
transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber, (ii) to hold separate and agree to
sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber
before or after the Offer Acceptance Time or the Effective Time, any assets,
licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates (or to consent to
any sale, divestiture, lease, license, transfer, disposition or other
encumbrance by the Company of any of its assets, licenses, operations, rights,
product lines, businesses or interest therein or to any agreement by the
Company to take any of the foregoing actions) or (iii) to agree to any
material changes (including, without limitation, through a licensing
arrangement) or restriction on, or other impairment of Parents ability to
own or operate, any such assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines,
businesses or interests therein or Parents ability to vote, transfer, receive
dividends or otherwise exercise full ownership rights with respect to the
capital stock of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, except for
proffers and agreements to amend or modify Contracts between the Company
and/or its Subsidiaries and third parties or sell, divest, lease, license,
transfer, dispose or otherwise encumber, or to agree to changes, restrictions

lines, businesses or interest therein, where such amended, sold, divested,
leased, licensed, transferred, disposed or encumbered Contracts, assets,
licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses and interests in the
aggregate shall not have accounted for more than $20 million of the parties
and their respective Affiliates gross revenues for the twelve (12) months
ending September 30, 2014; _provided_ , that Parent shall be entitled to
compel the Company or its Subsidiaries to take any of the actions referred to

the Effective Time.

6.3 Company Options; Company RSUs; ESPP.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement and
in any event prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all
actions (including obtaining any necessary determinations and/or resolutions
of the Board of Directors of the Company or a committee thereof) that may be
necessary (under the Company Equity Plans and award agreements pursuant to
which Company Options and Company RSUs are outstanding or otherwise) for (i)
the acceleration of vesting and exercisability (as applicable) of all
unexercised Company Options and all Company RSUs then outstanding, in each
case effective immediately prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, (ii) the
cancellation of the Company Options and Company RSUs as contemplated in

pursuant to Section 2.6(c) and (iii) the termination of each Company Equity
Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement and
in any event prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all
actions necessary or required under the ESPP and Legal Requirements (including
obtaining any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the Board of
Directors of the Company or a committee thereof and, if appropriate, amending
the terms of the ESPP) to provide that: (i) except for the six month offering
period under the ESPP that commenced on September 1, 2014 (the " _Final
Offering_ "), no offering period shall be authorized or commence on or after
the date of this Agreement, (ii) if the Offer Acceptance Time shall occur
prior to the scheduled end of the Final Offering, each individual
participating in the Final Offering pursuant to the terms of the ESPP shall
receive notice of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to
the Offer Acceptance Time and shall have an opportunity to withdraw from the
ESPP and terminate his or her outstanding purchase rights under the terms of
the ESPP prior to the end of the Final Offering, (iii) as required by the
terms of the ESPP, the Final Offering shall end within the ten (10) Business
Day period that immediately precedes the Offer Acceptance Time, (iv) with
respect to each ESPP participant who has not withdrawn from the ESPP prior to
the end of the Final Offering such participants accumulated contributions

 



39  under the ESPP shall be used to purchase Shares in accordance with the ESPP
as of the end of the Final Offering, (v) the applicable purchase price for
Shares purchased under the ESPP shall be determined in accordance with the
formula set forth in the ESPP as of the date of this Agreement and (vi) the
ESPP shall terminate in its entirety following the purchase of Shares as of
the end of the Final Offering and no further rights shall be granted or
exercised under the ESPP thereafter.

6.4 Employee Benefits.

 

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide, or cause to be provided, to those employees of the Acquired
Corporations who are employed by the Acquired Corporations as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time and who continue to be actively employed by the
Surviving Corporation (or any Affiliate thereof) during such one year
period (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") base salary and base wages, short-
term cash incentive compensation and commission opportunities and benefits
(including severance benefits, but excluding equity based compensation,
retention and performance bonus opportunities (including but not limited to
bonuses granted in connection with prior acquisitions by the Acquired
Corporations) and any long-term deferred cash award) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to such base salary and base wages, short-term
cash incentive compensation opportunities (including performance bonus awards
for 2014 performance under bonus plans that were adopted prior to the
execution of this Agreement) and benefits (including severance benefits under
the severance plans set forth on Part 6.4 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
but excluding equity based compensation, retention and performance bonus
opportunities (including but not limited to bonuses granted in connection
with prior acquisitions by the Acquired Corporations) and any long-term
deferred cash award) provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior
to the execution of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing:

 

(b) With respect to any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation time to
which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal, sick or
vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
and instruct its Affiliates to, as applicable (and without duplication
of benefits), assume the liability for such accrued personal, sick or
vacation time and allow such Continuing Employee to use such accrued personal,
sick or vacation time in accordance with the practice and policies of the
Acquired Corporations.

 

(c) Parent agrees that all Continuing Employees shall be eligible to continue
to participate in the Surviving Corporations health and welfare benefit
plans (to the same extent such Continuing Employees were eligible to
participate under the Companys health and welfare benefit plans immediately
prior to the Effective Time); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) nothing in
this Section 6.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the right of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any such health or
welfare benefit plan at any time and (ii) if Parent or the
Surviving Corporation terminates any such health or welfare benefit plan,
then (upon expiration of any appropriate transition period), the Continuing
Employees shall be eligible to participate in the Surviving Corporations
health and welfare benefit plans to the extent that it would not result in a
duplication of benefits and to the extent that coverage under such plans is
replacing comparable coverage under an Employee Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time. To the extent
that service is relevant for eligibility, vesting or allowances (including
paid time off) under any health or welfare benefit plan of Parent and/or the
Surviving Corporation, then Parent shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that such health or welfare benefit plan shall, for purposes
of eligibility, vesting and allowances (including paid time off) but not for
purposes of benefit accrual, credit Continuing Employees for service prior to
the Effective Time with the Company to the same extent it would not result in
a duplication of benefits and to the extent that such service was recognized
prior to the Effective Time under the corresponding health or welfare benefit
plan of the Company. Nothing in this Section 6.4 or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any employee to employment
with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Affiliate of the Surviving
Corporation and the employment of each Continuing Employee shall be "at will"
employment.

(d) Contingent upon, the Closing Date, the Company shall take all necessary
actions to terminate the Company 401(k) Plan, with such termination effective
as of the date immediately preceding the Closing Date.

 



40  The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of any resolutions or other
corporate action (the form and substance of which shall be subject to review
and approval by Parent, with such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) evidencing that the Company 401(k) Plan will be
terminated effective as of the date immediately preceding the Closing Date,
contingent upon the Closing Date, and will adopt any necessary amendments to
the Company 401(k) Plan to effect such termination. Prior to and conditioned
upon termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, the Company shall take any action
necessary to fully vest any and all unvested amounts of the accounts of
all participants in the Company 401(k) Plan that are impacted by such
termination. Parent shall allow the Continuing Employees to make eligible
rollover contributions to the Parent 401(k) Plan of their account balances (in
cash and in loan notes evidencing loans to such Continuing Employees as of
the date of distribution) from the Company 401(k) Plan as soon as practicable
following the Closing Date.

 

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.4 are solely for the benefit of the
Parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 6.4 is intended
to (i) constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any
Employee Plan or any other employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or
otherwise, (ii) prevent Parent and the Surviving Company from amending or
terminating any of its benefit plans, or after the Effective Time, any
Employee Plan in accordance with their terms and (iii) prevent Parent, after
the Effective Time, from terminating the employment of any Continuing
Employee. For the avoidance of doubt, no Continuing Employee, current or
former employee of any of the Acquired Corporations or of Parent or any other
individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third
party beneficiary of the Agreement or have the right to enforce the
provisions hereof.

6.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

 

(a) All rights to indemnification by the Company existing in favor of those
Persons who are directors and officers of the Company as of the date of this
Agreement (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") for their acts and omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time, as provided in the Certificate of
Incorporation and bylaws of the Company (as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement) and as provided in the indemnification agreements between the
Company and the Indemnified Persons set forth in Section 6.5(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) in the
forms made available by the Company to Parent or Parents Representatives,
shall survive the Merger for a period of six years from the Effective Time,
and any claim made requesting indemnification pursuant to such indemnification
rights within such six-year period shall continue to be subject to this
Section 6.5(a) and the indemnification rights provided under this Section
6.5(a) until disposition of such claim.

 

(b) From the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date
on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
(together with their successors and assigns, the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ")
shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Legal
Requirements, indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person in his or
her capacity as an officer or director of the Company against all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments or fines incurred by
such Indemnified Person as an officer or director of the Company in
connection with any pending or threatened Legal Proceeding based on or arising
out of, in whole or in part, the fact that such Indemnified Person is or was a
director or officer of the Company at or prior to the Effective Time and
pertaining to any and all matters pending, existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, including any such matter arising under any claim
with respect to the Transactions. Without limiting the foregoing, from the
Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective
Time occurs, the Indemnifying Parties shall also, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Legal Requirements, advance reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and
documented attorneys fees) incurred by the Indemnified Persons in connection
with matters for which such Indemnified Persons are eligible to be
indemnified pursuant to this Section 6.5(b) within a reasonable period after
receipt by Parent of a written request for such advance, subject to the
execution by such Indemnified Persons of appropriate undertakings in favor
of the Indemnifying Parties to repay such advanced costs and expenses if it
is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be
indemnified under this Section 6.5(b).

 



41 (c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company may (through a nationally
recognized insurance broker approved by Parent (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)), and if the Company does not,
the Surviving Corporation shall, purchase a six-year prepaid "tail" policy on
terms and conditions with respect to coverage, deductibles and amounts no
less favorable in the aggregate than the existing policy of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company with respect to acts and omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time as of the date of this Agreement (an accurate and complete copy
of which has been made available by the Company to Parent or Parents
Representatives prior to the date of this Agreement);  _provided_ , _however_
, that in no event shall the cost of such "tail" policy exceed an amount in
excess of 250% of the annual premium currently payable by the Company with
respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance, it being understood that if the cost of such "tail"
policy exceeds such amount, Parent shall be obligated to cause the Surviving
Corporation to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost equal to such amount.

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall ensure that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, or at Parents option, Parent, shall assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 6.5.

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.5 shall survive the acceptance of Shares
for payment pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger and are
(i) intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Persons and their successors, assigns and heirs and (ii) in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. Unless
required by applicable Legal Requirement, this Section 6.5 may not be amended,
altered or repealed after the Offer Acceptance Time in such a manner as to
adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Person or any of their
successors, assigns or heirs without the prior written consent of the affected
Indemnified Person.

 

6.6 Securityholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the right to
review and comment in advance on all material filings or responses to be made
by the Company in connection with any litigation against the Company and/or
its directors relating to the Transactions, and the right to consult on the
settlement with respect to such litigation, and the Company will in
good faith take such comments into account, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without Parents prior written consent. The Company shall promptly
notify Parent of any such securityholder litigation brought, or threatened,
against the Company and/or members of its Board of Directors.

6.7 Disclosure. The initial press release relating to this Agreement shall be
a joint press release issued by the Company and Parent and thereafter Parent
and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any further press
release(s) or otherwise making any public statement or making any announcement
to Company Associates (to the extent not previously issued or made in
accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Offer, the Merger, this
Agreement or any of the other Transactions and shall not issue any such press
release, public statement or announcement to Company Associates without the
other Partys written consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) each Party
may, without such consultation or consent, make any public statement in
response to questions from the press, analysts, investors or those attending
industry conferences, make internal announcements to employees and make
disclosures in Company SEC Documents, so long as such statements are
consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or
public statements made jointly by the parties (or individually, if approved
by the other Party), (b) a Party may, without the prior consent of the other
Party hereto but subject to giving advance notice to the other Party, issue
any such press release or make any such public announcement or statement as
may be required by Legal Requirement; and (c) no Party need consult with the
other Parties in connection with such portion of any press release, public
statement or filing to be issued or made pursuant to or in connection with
Section 5.3(d) or in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or Company
Adverse Change Recommendation.

 



42 6.8 Takeover Laws; Advice of Changes.

 

(a) If any Takeover Law may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the
Transactions, each of Parent and the Company and the members of their
respective Boards of Directors shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms and conditions contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to lawfully eliminate the effect of any Takeover Law on any of
the Transactions.

 

(b) The Company will give prompt notice to Parent (and will subsequently keep
the other informed on a current basis of any developments related to such

Material Adverse Effect or (ii) is reasonably likely to result in any of the
conditions set forth in Section 7 not being able to be satisfied prior to the
End Date.

(including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection with such
