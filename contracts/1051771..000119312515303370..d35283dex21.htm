ARTICLE III.

 

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

Section 3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the
holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

(a) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section
3.1(b)_ or _Section 3.1(d)_, each share of Class A common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the 

 



-11-  Effective Time (such shares, collectively, the " _Class A Common Stock_ ,"
and each, a " _Class A Share_ "), and each share of Class B common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (such shares, collectively, the " _Class B Common Stock_ " and,
together with the Class A Common Stock, the " _Common Stock_ "; and each, a "
_Class B Share_ "; and a Class A Share or a Class B Share referred to as a "
_Share_ "), shall be converted automatically into and shall thereafter
represent the right to receive $68.00 in cash without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). All Shares that have been converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this _Section 3.1_ shall
cease to exist, and the holders of certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented such Shares (" _Certificates_ ") shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such Shares other than the right to receive
the Merger Consideration (in each case, less any applicable
withholding Taxes).

(b) _Parent- and Merger Sub-Owned Shares_. Each Share that is owned directly
by the Company (or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company), Parent
or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any Shares
acquired by or contributed to Parent or any of Parents Affiliates immediately
prior to the Effective Time pursuant to agreements with holders of Shares
(the " _Rollover Agreements_ ")) (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange for such cancellation.

 

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares of common stock of Merger Sub so converted and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing
the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent
the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which
such shares of common stock of Merger Sub were converted in accordance with
the immediately preceding sentence.

 

(d) _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding this _Section 3.1_, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who
has demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with the DGCL shall not
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (unless and
until such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses
the right to appraisal with respect to such Shares), but instead shall be
converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be due such
holder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time,
such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses the
right to appraisal with respect to such Shares, such Shares shall be treated
as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon. The Company shall
give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal
of Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Parent or as required by applicable Law, the Company shall not make
any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that the
contribution of Shares to Parent or any of Parents Affiliates pursuant to
the Rollover Agreements shall be deemed to occur immediately prior to the
Effective Time and prior to any other above-described event described above in
this _Section 3.1_.

 

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall
be appointed by Parent (subject to the Companys reasonable prior written
approval) to act as a paying agent hereunder (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in
trust for the benefit of holders of the Shares, cash in U.S. dollars
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all of
the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the
Cancelled Shares and dissenting

 



-12-  shares), payable upon due surrender of the Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article III_ (such cash, the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the second (2nd) Business Day following the Closing
Date, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Shares whose
Shares were converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1_
(A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to
the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions
as Parent and the Company may mutually agree prior to the Closing), and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

 

(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may customarily be required by the Paying Agent,
the holder of such Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash
equal to the product of (A) the number of Shares represented by such holders
properly surrendered Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) and (B) the Merger Consideration (less any applicable
withholding Taxes). No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable
upon due surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof). In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be
paid upon due surrender of the Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if
the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been
paid or are not applicable.

 

(iii) The Paying Agent, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable,
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable under this
Agreement such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision
of state, local or foreign Law relating to Taxes with respect to the making
of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and
paid over to the applicable taxing authority, such deducted or withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was
made.

(c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other
reason, the holder of any such Certificates shall be given a copy of the
letter of transmittal referred to in  _Section 3.2(b)_ and instructed to
comply with the instructions in that letter of transmittal in order to receive
the cash to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this _Article III_.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that
remains undistributed to the former holders of Shares for one year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to the Surviving
Corporation upon demand, and any former holders of Shares who have not
surrendered their Shares in accordance with this _Section 3.2_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for payment of
their claim for the Merger Consideration upon due surrender of their Shares.
Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by stockholders of the
Company as of a date that is immediately prior to such time as such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity will,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent (or
at Parents election, the Surviving Corporation) free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



-13- (e) _No Liability_. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent
or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_
that (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger
Consideration payable hereunder, and, following any losses, Parent shall
promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the
stockholders of the Company in the amount of any such losses and (ii) such
investments shall only be in short-term obligations of, or short-term
obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S.
government. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be
payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs. Until the
termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to _Section 3.2(d)_, if for any
reason (including dissenting shares ceasing to be dissenting shares) the cash
in the Exchange Fund is insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment
obligations to be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent will
promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount equal to the
deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment
obligations.

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate
that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of
a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the amount
of the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration (less any applicable
withholding Taxes).

 

Section 3.3 _Treatment of Company Stock Based Awards_. The Company shall take
all actions necessary or appropriate to implement the following:

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then outstanding award
settled in shares of Class B Common Stock under the Company Long Term
Incentive Plan (the " _Company RSUs_ "), whether or not vested, and whether or
not any issuance or forfeiture conditions to which such Company RSUs are
subject have been achieved, shall, contingent upon consummation of the
Merger, become 100% vested under the Company Long Term Incentive Plan and all
outstanding issuance and forfeiture conditions shall be deemed 100% satisfied.
For purposes of this _Section 3.3(a)_, to the extent any issuance
or forfeiture condition applicable to any award of Company RSUs relates in
whole or in part to a performance goal for which the performance period
extends beyond the date hereof, such issuance or forfeiture condition shall be
deemed satisfied only to the extent of the target level for such performance
goal. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall issue to each
holder of an award of Company RSUs the number of shares of Class B Common
Stock underlying such award of Company RSUs (as determined above), which
shares of Class B Common Stock shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration (less any applicable withholding Taxes) pursuant to _Section
3.1(a)._

 

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award settled in shares of
Class B Common Stock under the Company Stretch Incentive Plan (each, a "
_Company Stretch Award_ ") that is either (i) outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time or (ii) if the Effective Time occurs following January 30,
2016, that was outstanding on January 30, 2016, whether or not vested, and
whether or not any such issuance or forfeiture conditions have been achieved,
shall, contingent upon consummation of the Merger, become 100% vested under
the Company Stretch Incentive Plan and all outstanding issuance
and forfeiture conditions shall be deemed 100% satisfied. For purposes of
this _Section 3.3(b)_, to the extent any issuance or forfeiture condition
applicable to a Company Stretch Award relates in whole or in part to a
performance goal for which the performance period extends beyond the date
hereof, such issuance or forfeiture condition shall be deemed satisfied only
to the extent of the target level for such performance goal. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Company and Parent agree that, for purposes of the Company
Stretch Incentive Plan, the fair market value of the Class B Common Stock

 



-14-  immediately prior to the Closing Date will be equal to the Merger
Consideration. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
issue to each holder of a Company Stretch Award the number of shares of Class
B Common Stock underlying such award (as determined above), which shares of
Class B Common Stock shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
(less any applicable withholding Taxes) pursuant to  _Section 3.1(a)_.

(c) The Company shall terminate the Company Stock Plan immediately as of the
Effective Time, and following the Effective Time, no participant in the
Company Stock Plan shall have any right under the Company Stock Plan other
than the right to receive the awards or payments in accordance with the terms
of this _Section 3.3_. All payments under this _Section 3.3_ shall be made
at or as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, pursuant to the
Companys ordinary payroll practices, and shall be subject to any applicable
withholding.

 

Section 3.4 _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Shares shall
occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split,
reverse stock split, or combination or exchange of shares, or any stock
dividend thereon with a record date during such period or any similar
event, then the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant
to this Agreement shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to
proportionally reflect such change.

applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and on such date, none of the Company SEC
Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were

Act. The Companys management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of the Companys internal controls over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as

effective and did not identify any (A) "significant deficiency" or "material
weakness" in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, of the
Exchange Act) or (B) fraud or allegation of fraud that involves management or
other employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal

executed equity commitment letter dated on or about the date hereof with the
Guarantors (as amended, modified, supplemented, or extended from time to time
after the date of this Agreement in compliance with _Section 6.11_, the "
_Equity Commitment Letter_ ") pursuant to which the Guarantors have agreed,
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to invest in Parent the cash
amount set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ "), and (b) (i) the debt
commitment letter dated on or about the date hereof with the financial
institutions identified therein and, including, without limitation, lenders,
agents and arrangers that have committed to provide or otherwise entered into
agreements in connection with the Debt Financing commitment or
alternative debt financings, and any joinder agreements, indentures or credit
agreements, in each case, entered into pursuant thereto or relating thereto
together with their Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and
representatives involved in the Debt Financing and their respective
successors and assigns (collectively, with GSO (as defined below), together
with their Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and representatives
involved in the Debt Financing and their respective successors and assigns
the " _Financing Sources_ "), together with a customary redacted fee letter
(with fee amounts, pricing caps, market flex and other economic terms redacted
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any terms that would
affect availability of the Debt Financing) (as amended, modified,
supplemented or extended from time to time after the date of this Agreement in
compliance with _Section 6.11_, the " _First Lien Debt Commitment Letter_ ")
and (ii) the debt commitment letter dated on or about the date hereof with
GSO Capital Partners LP (" _GSO_ "), together with a customary redacted fee
letter (with fee amounts, pricing caps, market flex and other economic
terms redacted excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any terms that would
affect availability of the Debt Financing) (as amended, modified supplemented
or extended from time to time after the date of this Agreement in compliance
with  _Section 6.11_ (the " _Second Lien Debt Commitment Letter_ " and,
together with the First Lien Debt Commitment Letter, the " _Debt Commitment
Letters_ "; the Debt Commitment Letters together with the Equity Commitment
Letter, the " _Commitment Letters_ "), in each case, pursuant to which the
lenders party thereto have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions
thereof, to provide Parent debt financing in the amounts set forth in
the applicable Debt Commitment Letter (the " _Debt Financing_ " and, together
with the Equity Financing, the " _Financing_ "), in each case for purposes of
financing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and related fees
and expenses.

(b) Except for customary redacted fee and engagement letters with respect to
fees and related arrangements with respect to the Financing, of which Parent
has delivered true, correct and complete copies to the Company prior to the
date of this Agreement (with fee amounts, pricing caps, market flex and other
economic terms redacted excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any terms that
would affect availability of the Debt Financing), there are no side letters or
other agreements, contracts or arrangements related to the funding of the full
amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment
Letters and delivered to the Company prior to the date of this Agreement.

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, each of the Commitment Letters is in
full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent
and Merger Sub and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each other party to such
Commitment Letters (except to the extent limited by the
Enforceability Exceptions). As of the date hereof, none of the Commitment
Letters have been amended, restated or otherwise modified or waived in any
respect, and the respective commitments contained in the Commitment Letters
have not been withdrawn, rescinded or otherwise modified in any respect. As
of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which would constitute a
breach or default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both
would constitute a breach or default), or the failure of any condition, on
the part of Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party to the
Commitment Letters. There are no conditions precedent to the funding of the
full amount of the Financing (including pursuant to any "flex" provisions in
the related fee letters) other than the conditions precedent set forth in the
Commitment Letters. Based on facts and events of which Parent has Knowledge as
of the date of this Agreement and assuming satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.3_ and in the
Commitment Letters, Parent has no reason to believe that, as of the date of
this Agreement, any of the conditions to closing of the Financing will not
be satisfied on the Closing Date. As of the date of this Agreement,

 



-29-  Parent is not aware of any fact or occurrence that makes any of the
assumptions, or the representations or warranties of Parent, in any of the
Commitment Letters inaccurate in any material respect. The aggregate proceeds
of the Financing when funded in accordance with the Commitment Letters are in
an amount sufficient to consummate the Merger upon the terms contemplated by
this Agreement (including to pay the Merger Consideration for all of the
shares of Common Stock and all other amounts required to be paid in connection
with the Closing pursuant to _Article III_ ), to make any repayment or
refinancing of the Notes and any other debt contemplated in this Agreement or
the Commitment Letters, and to pay all related fees and expenses of Parent,
Merger Sub and their respective Representatives pursuant to this Agreement and
the Financing. Parent (or an Affiliate thereof) has fully paid any and all
commitment fees or other fees required by the Commitment Letters to be paid.

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub is aware
of any direct or indirect limitation or other restriction on the ability of
the lenders party to the Financing to provide financing for other potential
purchasers of the Company.

 

(e) Parent acknowledges and agrees that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the consummation of the Financing shall not be a
condition to the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.7 _Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Parent has delivered to the Company the duly authorized and executed
Guaranty. The Guaranty is in full force and effect and is the legal, valid and
binding obligation of each of the Guarantors, enforceable against such
Guarantor in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability
Exceptions, and no event has occurred which would constitute a breach or
default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both could
constitute a breach or default) on the part of any Guarantor under such
Guaranty.

 

Section 5.8 _Finders or Brokers_. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
has employed any investment banker, broker or finder in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement who would be entitled to any fee
or any commission in connection with or upon consummation of the Merger.

 

Section 5.9 _Certain Arrangements_. Other than the Voting Agreements and the
Rollover Agreements, there are no Contracts, undertakings, commitments,
arrangements or understandings, whether written or oral, between Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any beneficial
owner of outstanding shares of Common Stock or any member of the Companys
management or the Board of Directors, on the other hand, relating in any way
to the Company, the Companys securities, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or to the operations or ownership of the Company after
the Effective Time.

Section 5.10 _Ownership of Common Stock_. Except pursuant to this Agreement
and the Rollover Agreements, (i) none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates beneficially owns, directly or
indirectly (including pursuant to a derivatives contract), any shares of
Common Stock or other securities convertible into, exchangeable for or
exercisable for shares of Common Stock or any securities of any Subsidiary of
the Company, and (ii) none of Parent, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates has any
rights to acquire, directly or indirectly, any shares of Common Stock. None
of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their "affiliates" or "associates" is, or at
any time during the last five (5) years has been, an "interested stockholder"
of the Company as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL.

Section 5.11 _Solvency_. Assuming (a) the satisfaction of the conditions to
Parents obligations to consummate the Merger, (b) the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article IV_ of this Agreement
(disregarding any materiality, Knowledge, Company Material Adverse Effect or
similar qualification or exception contained therein), and (c) that the
Company on a consolidated basis is Solvent immediately prior to the Effective
Time, after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Financing, any Alternative Financing, the payment of the
aggregate Merger Consideration, any repayment or

 



-30-  refinancing of the Notes and any other debt contemplated in this Agreement
or the Debt Commitment Letters, and the payment of all related fees and
expenses, the Surviving Corporation on a consolidated basis will be Solvent
as of the Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Solvent_
" when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of
determination, (i) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of
such Person will, as of such date, exceed (A) the value of all "liabilities of
such Person, including contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as
such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable
federal laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors and (B) the
amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person
on its existing debts (including contingent liabilities) as such debts become
absolute and matured, (ii) such Person will not have, as of such date, an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date and (iii)
such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and
other liabilities, as they mature.

 

Section 5.12 _No Additional Representations_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that it and its Representatives
have received access to such books and records, facilities, equipment,
Contracts and other assets of the Company which it and its Representatives
have desired or requested to review and that it and its Representatives have
had full opportunity to meet with the management of the Company and to discuss
the business and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that neither the Company nor
any other Person has made any representation or warranty, express or implied
as to, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub is relying upon, the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding the Company furnished or made
available to Parent and its Representatives except as expressly set forth in
_Article IV_ (as qualified by the Company Disclosure Letter and the Company
SEC Documents, as applicable), and none of the Company, its stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, agents or other representatives, or any other
Person shall be subject to any liability to Parent or any other Person
resulting from the Companys or its Representatives making available to
Parent or its Representatives or Parents or its Representatives use of
such information, including any management presentation materials delivered to
Parent, as subsequently updated, supplemented or amended, or any information,
documents or material made available to Parent in the due diligence materials
(formal or informal) provided to Parent, including in the Data Room or in any
other form in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(or any omissions therefrom), or any Required Information provided
in connection with the Debt Financing. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Company makes no representation or warranty to Parent or Merger Sub with
respect to any business or financial projection or forecast relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not included in the Data Room
or any management presentation or in any Required Information. Parent, on its
behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, expressly waives any claim relating to
the foregoing matters.

(b) Subject to _Section 6.4(c)_,  _Section 6.4(d)_ and _Section 6.4(f)_,

changes in such Alternative Proposal) prior to the earlier of (x) ten (10)
Business Days following such request and (y) five Business Days prior to the
Company Meeting, unless, in the case of this clause (y), it would be
inconsistent with the Board of Directors fiduciary duties to comply with
such request within such time period, in which case the Company shall comply

Directors fiduciary duties or fail to include in the Proxy Statement
when mailed, the Recommendation (any of the foregoing in clauses (iii) or
(iv), an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "); or (v) enter into any agreement

if at any time after the execution of this Agreement and prior to obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval, (i) the Company or any of its
Representatives has received an Alternative Proposal that the Board of
Directors believes in good faith after consultation with the Companys
outside legal and financial advisors, is or may reasonably be expected to lead
to a Superior Proposal and (ii) the Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company, directly or
indirectly through its Representatives, may (A) engage in negotiations
or discussions with such Third Party and its Representatives, (B) furnish to
such Third Party or its Representatives non-public information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the business, properties, assets, books

Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that the Company shall
promptly provide to Parent any such information that is provided to any such
Person which was not previously provided to or made available to Parent and
(C) take any nonappealable, final action that any court of competent
jurisdiction orders the Company to take.

 

(d) In addition, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company
or the Board of Directors or any committee thereof from (i) taking and
disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9
and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to its stockholders in connection with the making or
amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer) or from making any disclosure
to the Companys stockholders with regard to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or an Alternative Proposal which the Board of Directors or any
committee thereof determines is reasonably required by applicable Law or
fiduciary duty ( _provided_ that neither the Company nor its Board of
Directors (or any committee thereof) may recommend any Alternative Proposal

has made an Alternative Proposal solely for the purpose of clarifying such
Alternative Proposal and the terms thereof.

 

(e) After the execution of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company shall promptly, and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours, notify Parent after receipt by the Company (or any of
its Representatives) of any Alternative Proposal or any request for
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access
to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that the Company reasonably believes is
considering making, or has made, an Alternative Proposal, which notice shall
include the material terms and conditions of any such Alternative Proposal,
indication or request.

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of
Directors may, if the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, make an
Adverse Recommendation Change (i) in response to a written Alternative
Proposal that the Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisors,
constitutes a Superior Proposal (provided the Company has complied with
_Section 8.1(c))_, or (ii) in response to an Intervening Event.

 

(g) Prior to effecting any Adverse Recommendation Change or Superior Proposal
Termination, (i) the Company shall notify Parent, in writing at least three
(3) Business Days prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change or
Superior Proposal Termination (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its intention to
effect such Adverse Recommendation Change or Superior Proposal Termination
(which notice shall include the terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal,
the identity of the Person making such proposal and a copy of the most recent
draft of any written agreement related thereto (it being understood
and agreed that any amendment to the terms of such Superior Proposal,
including any revision to price, shall require a new Notice Period of at least
two (2) Business Days) or, if in response to an Intervening Event, shall
include reasonable detail regarding the Intervening Event), (ii) during the
applicable Notice Period, the Company shall negotiate with Parent in good

 



-37-  faith (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate) to make such adjustment to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that the Superior Proposal
ceases to be a Superior Proposal or the Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to the Intervening Event is no longer necessary, as applicable, and
(iii) at the end of the Notice Period, the Board of Directors shall determine
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors) that such Superior Proposal has not been withdrawn and
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (taking into account any changes
to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent) or the Intervening Event
continues to necessitate an Adverse Recommendation Change.

Agreement, (i) the Company shall prepare the Proxy Statement, which shall,

to be included in the Proxy Statement.

 

(b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments

so that the Proxy Statement or the other filings shall not contain an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the
party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
parties thereof, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. Prior to the
filing or mailing of the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or responding to any SEC comments on the Proxy Statement, each of the
Company, on the one hand, and Parent and its Affiliates, on the other hand,
shall (A) provide each other with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Proxy Statement and all amendments or supplements to the
foregoing documents and (B) consider in good faith such comments reasonably
proposed by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and its Affiliates, on
the other hand, as applicable.

DGCL) and its charter and bylaws to duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC, for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval (the " _Company Meeting_ "), and (ii) subject to
_Section 6.4_, use reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have the right to
make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the Company
Meeting (A) for the absence of a quorum, (B) to allow reasonable additional
time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure
which the Board of Directors or any committee thereof has determined in good
faith after consultation with outside counsel is reasonably necessary under
applicable Law (including fiduciary duty under applicable Law) and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the
Companys stockholders prior to the Company Meeting or (C) to allow reasonable
additional time to solicit additional proxies to the extent the Board of
Directors or any committee thereof reasonably believes necessary in order to
obtain the Company Stockholder Approval.

 



-38- Section 6.6 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For a period beginning on the Effective Time and concluding on December
31, 2016 (or, if earlier, the date of termination of the relevant employee),
Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each current employee
of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, for purposes of severance benefits,
each eligible former employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Company Employees_ "), (i) base cash
compensation (including commission rates) and annual cash bonus opportunities
that, in each case, are substantially similar to the base cash compensation
(including commission rates) and annual cash bonus opportunities that were
provided to the applicable Company Employee immediately before the Effective
Time and (ii) employee benefits or compensation in lieu thereof that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits that were
provided to the applicable Company Employee immediately before the Effective
Time under the Company Benefit Plans listed on _Section 4.9(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter. For purposes of determining the employee benefits
that are provided to a Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time
under the immediately preceding sentence, employee benefits shall include
annual cash incentive compensation and retirement plans but shall exclude
compensatory equity-based incentive awards, retention payments and enhanced
bonus payments made in connection with the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement. Any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding and except as set forth on _Section 6.6(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to
each Company Employee whose employment terminates prior to December 31, 2016,
severance benefits equal to the greater of (A) the severance benefits
provided for under the Company Severance Pay Plan in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and (B) the severance benefits provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries.

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of vacation
or severance and retiree welfare benefits under the employee benefit plans of
Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees and
eligible former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries after the
Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited
with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as
such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for
such service for the same purpose under any similar Company Benefit Plan in
which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing shall
not apply with respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension
plan or to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits or to the extent that Parent establishes a new broad based employee
benefit plan providing benefits that are materially different from any
benefits provided at the Effective Time and such new plan provides no service
credit for periods before the effective date of such new plan. In addition,
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Company Employee and his or her
eligible dependents and domestic partners to be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company
Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before
the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii)
for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents and domestic partners, unless such
conditions would not have been waived under the comparable plans of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or
her covered dependents and domestic partners during the portion of the plan
year of the Old Plans ending on the date such participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying the corresponding deductible, coinsurance and maximum
out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents and domestic partners for the applicable plan year as if such
amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 



-39- (c) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" (or similar phrase)
with respect to the Company Benefit Plans set forth on _Section 6.6(c)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter (as such Company Benefit Plans are in effect on
the date hereof) will occur at or prior to the Effective Time.

 

(d) Prior to making any material written communications to the Company
Employees pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall provide
Parent with a copy of the intended communication, Parent shall have no fewer
than three (3) Business Days to review and comment on the communication (
_provided_ that Parent shall review and comment as soon as practicable
following receipt thereof, but no later than within three (3) Business Days),
and Parent and the Company shall cooperate in providing any such mutually
agreeable communication. The Company shall provide Parent five (5) Business
Days in lieu of three (3) Business Days for purposes of this _Section 6.6(d)_
if Parent timely makes a good faith reasonable request for an extension.

 

(e) Nothing in this _Section 6.6_ or any other provision of this Agreement
shall (i) confer upon any Company Employee any right to continue in the
employ or service of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of
Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, which rights are
hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any
Company Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause,
except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement
between Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent and the
Company Employee, (ii) prevent the amendment, modification or termination of
any Company Benefit Plan after the Effective Time (in each case in accordance
with and subject to the terms of the applicable Company Benefit Plan) or
(iii) be construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit or compensation
plan, program, agreement, contract, policy or arrangement.

 

(f) The provisions of this _Section 6.6_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no other Person (including any Company
Employee or any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any
purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of
this _Section 6.6_ shall create such rights in any such Persons.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take promptly,

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates shall make an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby

Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) respond as promptly as practicable to any

the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except with the prior written consent of the other parties hereto.

(c) Parent shall offer to take (and if such offer is accepted, commit to take
and take) with respect to itself and its controlled Affiliates and the
Company and its Subsidiaries any and all actions necessary, proper or
advisable to avoid and eliminate each and every impediment under any
antitrust, competition, trade regulation or other applicable Law that may
be asserted by the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any State Attorney General,
any other Governmental Entity or any other Person with respect to the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement so as to
enable the consummation thereof as promptly as practicable after the date
hereof, and in any event no later than the End Date, including (i) proposing,

Subsidiaries or controlled Affiliates), and if the offer is accepted,
committing to take and taking such action, (iii) terminating, relinquishing,

of such action is expressly conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby), in each case, as may be
necessary, proper or advisable in order to obtain clearance under the HSR Act,
to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or to vacate or lift,
any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that would otherwise have the effect of restraining,
preventing or delaying the consummation of the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby, or to avoid the commencement of any
action or proceeding that seeks to prohibit the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, Parent shall defend
(including through litigation on the merits) against any claim asserted by any
Governmental Entity or any other Person in order to avoid the entry of, or
have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that could restrain, prevent or delay the
consummation of the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including by defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings,

its counsel shall cooperate with and keep informed the Company and its counsel
in connection with such litigation, action, suit or proceeding.

(d) Parent shall not (and shall cause its controlled Affiliates not to) take
any action (including the acquisition by it or its Affiliates of any interest
in any Person that derives revenues from products, services or lines of
business similar to the products, services or lines of business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries) if such action could make it more likely that there
would arise any impediments under any antitrust, competition, trade regulation
or other applicable Law that may be asserted by the FTC, the Antitrust
Division, any State Attorney General or any other Governmental Entity to the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable after the date hereof.

 



-41- (e) Each party hereto shall (i) promptly notify the other parties hereto of
any written communication to that party from the FTC, the Antitrust Division,

applicable Law, permit the other parties hereto to review in advance any
proposed written communication to any of the foregoing and incorporate the
other partys reasonable comments, (ii) not participate in or agree to
participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or inquiry concerning any
antitrust, competition or trade regulation matters in connection with this
Agreement or the Merger unless it consults with the other parties hereto in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives
the other parties hereto the opportunity to attend and participate thereat
and (iii) furnish the other parties hereto with copies of all correspondence,
filings, and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance
thereof) between them and their Affiliates and their respective
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members or

competition or trade regulation matters in connection with this Agreement and
the Merger, except that any materials concerning the Companys valuation of
the transaction, the Companys internal financial information or competitively
sensitive information of the Company and its Subsidiaries may be redacted or
limited to outside counsel pursuant to any applicable joint defense or common
interest agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent agrees that, at any
time in an investigation, if a Governmental Entity suggests or proffers
a settlement of the investigation to permit the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated, Parent shall
promptly (and in any event within two (2) calendar days) communicate the terms
of the offer to the Company.

Section 6.8 _Takeover Statute_. If any Takeover Law shall become applicable to
the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub and the members of their respective boards of directors shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

Section 6.9 _Public Announcements_. Neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of
their respective Affiliates, shall issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other announcement with respect to this Agreement, the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated hereby without first providing the
other party the opportunity to review and comment upon such release
or announcement, unless such party determines in good faith that it is
required by applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or the listing
rules of a national securities exchange or trading market to issue or cause
the publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to
this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, in
which event such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide an
opportunity for the other party to review and comment upon such press release
or other announcement prior to making any such press release or other
announcement; _provided_ that (i) the Company shall not be required to provide
any such review or comment to Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the
receipt and existence of an Alternative Proposal and matters related thereto
or an Adverse Recommendation Change and (ii) each party and their respective
Affiliates may make statements that are substantially similar to previous
press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by Parent and the

Company may otherwise communicate in the ordinary course with its employees,
customers, suppliers and vendors as it deems appropriate.

Section 6.10 _Indemnification and Insurance_. Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do
the following:

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless, and provide advancement of
expenses to, the present and former officers, directors, employees and
fiduciaries of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified
Person_ ") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time to the fullest extent the Company would be permitted to do so
under applicable Law and to the fullest extent required under the certificate
of incorporation, bylaws, any indemnification agreements and any other
governing documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries in effect on the date
hereof. In the event of any threatened or pending claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether

 



-42-  civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and whether formal or
informal (each, an " _Action_ ") to which an Indemnified Person is, has been
or becomes a party or with respect to which an Indemnified Person is, has
been or becomes otherwise involved (including as a witness), arising in whole
or in part out of, or pertaining in whole or in part to, the fact that the
Indemnified Person is or was an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or
agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the
request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as an officer, director,
employee, fiduciary or agent of another enterprise (including any
Action arising out of or pertaining to matters occurring or existing or
alleged to have occurred or existed, or acts or omissions occurring or alleged
to have occurred, at or prior to the Effective Time, or arising out of or
pertaining to this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated
hereby), (i) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
advance fees, costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements)
incurred by each Indemnified Person in connection with and prior to the final
disposition of such Actions, such fees, costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees and disbursements) to be advanced within ten (10) Business
Days of receipt by the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Person of a
request therefor, (ii) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Action in
which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Person hereunder,
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Person from all liability arising out of such
Action or such Indemnified Person otherwise consents in writing, and (iii)
the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter.
If any claim for indemnification is asserted or made by any Indemnified Person
pursuant to this _Section 6.10_, any determination (if any) required to be
made with respect to whether such Indemnified Persons conduct complies with
the standards under the DGCL, the Surviving Corporations certificate of
incorporation, other applicable Law or any applicable indemnification
agreement shall be made by independent legal counsel selected by such
Indemnified Person that is reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Corporation
(it being understood and agreed that the burden of proof shall be on Parent
and the Surviving Corporation to establish that such Indemnified Person did
not so comply). If any Action is brought against any Indemnified Person in
which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Person under this
_Section 6.10_, (A) the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to
control the defense thereof after the Effective Time (it being understood
that, by electing to control the defense thereof, the Surviving Corporation
will be deemed to have waived any right to object to the Indemnified
Persons entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect thereto), (B)
each Indemnified Person shall be entitled to retain his or her own counsel in
connection with such Action, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall
elect to control the defense of any such Action, (C) the Surviving
Corporation shall pay all fees and expenses of any counsel retained by an
Indemnified Person promptly after statements therefor are received, whether or
not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the defense of any such
Action, and (D) no Indemnified Person shall be liable for any settlement
effected without his or her prior express written consent.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in
effect all provisions in the Surviving Corporations certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) and in the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws and other governing documents of the Companys
Subsidiaries regarding (i) elimination of liability of directors, (ii)
indemnification of officers, directors and employees and (iii) advancement of
expenses, that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the
corresponding provisions in existence on the date of this Agreement.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, following consultation
with Parent and using the nationally recognized insurance broker designated
by Parent and after contacting the Companys insurance broker (but not using
the Companys insurance broker), obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-
cancellable extension of the directors and officers liability coverage of
the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies and the
Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, " _D
andO Insurance_"), or, if the Company is unable to or does not obtain or fully
pay the premium for the DandO Insurance, from and after the Effective Time
Parent shall and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain and fully
pay the premium for the DandO Insurance, in each case for a claims reporting or
discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time
with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the
Effective Time, from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current

 



-43-  insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable in the aggregate
than the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies with respect
to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act,
omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of his or her
serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective
Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or
actions contemplated hereby). If the Company or the Surviving Corporation for
any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least
six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place
as of the date hereof with the Companys current insurance carrier or with an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than
the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies as of the date
hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall purchase from the Companys
current insurance carrier or from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO
Insurance comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than
as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof;
_provided_ that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual
premium amount in excess of 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in
its last full fiscal year; and _provided, further_ , that if the aggregate
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for
a cost not exceeding such amount.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if an Indemnified Person
is or has been a party to or is or has been otherwise involved (including as
a witness) in any Action (whether arising before, at or after the Effective
Time) on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
provisions of this _Section 6.10_ shall continue in effect until the final
disposition of such Action.

(e) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this  _Section 6.10_.

(f) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this _Section 6.10_ shall be
in addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other governing documents of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, under the DGCL or any other applicable Law or under any
agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

 

(g) The provisions of this _Section 6.10_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each present and former director and
officer, employee or fiduciary referred to in this _Section 6.10_ and his or
her heirs and representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person
may have by contract or otherwise.

Section 6.11 _Parent Financing_.

 

(a) _Efforts to Obtain Financing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, obtain
and consummate the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in
the Debt Commitment Letters (taking into account any "market flex"

 



-44-  provisions in the fee letter) on or prior to the Closing Date. Such actions
shall include: (i) maintaining in full force and effect the Debt Commitment
Letters in the form provided to the Company concurrently with the execution
of this Agreement (except to the extent additional or alternative financing
would then be available to consummate the transactions on the Closing Date) or
as otherwise permitted to be amended in accordance with the terms hereof,
(ii) satisfying on a timely basis all of the conditions precedent and
covenants to the Debt Financing applicable to Parent and/or Merger Sub that
are to be satisfied by Parent and/or Merger Sub, (iii) negotiating, executing
and delivering the Debt Financing Documents that reflect the terms contained
in the Debt Commitment Letters (including, as necessary, agreeing to any
requested changes to the commitments thereunder in accordance with any
"flex" provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters or any related fee
letter), in each case which terms shall not in any respect expand on the
conditions to the funding of the proceeds from the Debt Financing at the
Closing or reduce the aggregate amount of the proceeds from the Debt
Financing available to be funded on the Closing Date unless a corresponding
increase in alternative financing is then made available, or, if available, on
other terms that are acceptable to Parent and Merger Sub and would not
adversely affect (including with respect to timing, taking into account the
expected timing of the Marketing Period) the ability of Parent and Merger Sub
to consummate the transactions contemplated herein, (iv) using
reasonable best efforts to fully enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment
Letters and the Debt Financing Documents in order to consummate the Debt
Financing at or prior to the closing, (v) promptly commencing the syndication
activities contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters and (vi) borrowing an
amount necessary in accordance with the terms of the Debt Financing Documents
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder. Parent and Merger Sub
shall not without the prior written consent of the Company take or fail to
take any action or enter into any transaction that would reasonably be
expected to materially impair, delay or prevent consummation of the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall comply in all material respects with all of its obligations
under each of the Debt Financing Documents. Parent shall obtain the Equity
Financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter upon satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter. Without
the prior written consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall permit
or consent to (A) any amendment, supplement or modification to be made to the
Equity Commitment Letter (other than to increase the amount of the Equity
Financing) or (B) any amendment, supplement or modification to be made to the
Debt Commitment Letters if such amendment, supplement or modification would
(1) change, expand or impose new conditions precedent to the funding of the
proceeds from the Debt Financing from those set forth therein on the date
hereof (2) change the timing of the funding of the proceeds of the Debt
Financing thereunder in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A)
materially delay (taking in account the Marketing Period), impair or prevent
the Closing Date or (B) adversely impact in any respect the ability of Parent
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or under the
Commitment Letters or (3) reduce the aggregate cash amount of the proceeds of
the Debt Financing below the amount required to consummate the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement (including by changing the amount of fees to
be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing (except as set forth
in any "flex" provisions existing on the date hereof)) (unless any such
reduction is matched with an equal increase of the Equity Financing under the
Equity Commitment Letter or otherwise done pursuant to the terms of the
Commitment Letter) or (4) otherwise adversely affect the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the timing of the Closing; _provided_ , that subject to the limitations set
forth in this _Section 6.11_, Parent or Merger Sub may, without the consent
of the Company, amend the Debt Commitment Letters (i) to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not
executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date hereof and (ii) in
connection with the implementation of any flex provision. For purposes of
this Agreement, references to the "Debt Commitment Letters" shall include such
documents as permitted or required by this _Section 6.11_ to be amended,
modified or waived, in each case from and after such amendment, modification
or waiver. Each of Parent and Merger Sub (i) acknowledges and agrees that its
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
not conditioned or contingent upon receipt of the proceeds from the Financing
and a failure of the Closing to occur solely because Parent and Merger Sub
shall not have received the proceeds of the Financing shall constitute a
breach of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and (ii) reaffirm their
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
irrespective and independently of the availability of the Financing, subject
to fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_.

 



-45- (b) Parent and Merger Sub shall keep the Company fully informed, in all
reasonable detail, of the status of their efforts to arrange the Debt
Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger
Sub shall give the Company prompt written notice (i) of any breach or default
that would reasonably be expected to materially delay (taking into account
the Marketing Period), impair or prevent the Closing Date (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to result in a breach or default that would reasonably
be expected to materially delay (taking into account the Marketing Period),
impair or prevent the Closing Date), (ii) if and when Parent or Merger Sub
becomes aware that any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters may not be available to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) of the receipt of any written notice or
other written communication from any Person with respect to any (A) actual
or potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the
Debt Commitment Letters or any other Debt Financing Document or (B) dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt Commitment Letters or
any other Debt Financing Document (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
any ordinary course negotiations with respect to the terms of the Debt
Financing or Debt Financing Documents), (iv) if for any reason Parent or
Merger Sub believes in good faith it will not be able to obtain any portion
of the Debt Financing on the terms, in the manner and from the sources
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters or the Debt Financing Documents
and (v) of any termination of the Debt Commitment Letters. Parent and Merger
Sub shall provide the Company, upon reasonable request, with copies of any
Debt Financing Documents and such other information and documentation as
reasonably requested regarding the Debt Financing as shall be reasonably
necessary to allow the Company to monitor the progress of such financing
activities.

(c) In the event of any notification or communication that the Debt Financing
will not be available to Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with the terms
hereof (subject to any permitted modifications herein), Parent and Merger Sub
shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange for and obtain as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of any such financing failure event, alternative debt financing
(the " _Alternative Financing_ ") from alternative sources on whatever terms
and conditions that are no less favorable (including with respect to
conditionality), in the aggregate, to Parent and Merger Sub than those set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letters (taking into account any "market flex"
provisions), in an amount, together with the Equity Financing, sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and satisfy the
obligations of the Parent under this Agreement, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event but in no event later than the date on
which the Closing is scheduled to occur pursuant to _Section 2.2_, it being
understood and agreed that if Parent and Merger Sub proceed with any
Alternative Financing, Parent and Merger Sub shall be subject to the same
obligations with respect to such Alternative Financing as set forth in this
Agreement with respect to the Debt Financing. In the event that
Alternative Financing is obtained, Parent shall promptly provide the Company
with a copy of the new financing commitment that provides for such Alternative
Financing (the " _Alternative Financing Commitment Letter_ "). If applicable,
any reference in this Agreement to "Debt Financing" shall include
"Alternative Financing", any reference to "Debt Commitment Letters" shall
include the "Alternative Financing Commitment Letter" and any references
to "Debt Financing Documents" shall include the definitive documentation
relating to any such Alternative Financing and any reference to "Financing
Sources" shall include the financing institutions contemplated to provide any
such Alternative Financing.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing in this _Section 6.11_ will require, and in no event will the
reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to require, Parent to
pay any fees materially in excess of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters or any fee letters contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters
(including flex provisions), or agree to any "market flex" term less favorable
to Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation than such corresponding
market flex term contained in or contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters
(in either case, whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained therein
or otherwise).

(e) _Financing Cooperation_. From the date hereof and ending at the earlier
of (i) the Closing Date and (ii) termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1_, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its 

 



-46-  Subsidiaries to, cooperate and cause the respective officers, employees and
advisors, including legal and accounting, of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries to provide to Parent and/or Merger Sub, at Parents sole
expense, such reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the
Debt Financing as is customary and may be reasonably requested by Parent,
including using reasonable best efforts to:

 

(i) upon reasonable notice, participate in a reasonable number of meetings and
presentations with prospective lenders or investors and due diligence and
drafting sessions;

(ii) assist with the preparation of materials for bank information memoranda,
private placement memoranda or prospectuses and similar documents reasonably
necessary in connection with the Debt Financing (including executing customary
authorization letters); _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to
the consummation of the transaction hereunder, neither the Company nor its
Subsidiaries will be required to issue any securities; _provided_ , _further_
, that any such memoranda or prospectuses shall contain disclosure and
financial statements with respect to the Company or the Surviving Corporation
reflecting the Surviving Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries as the
obligor(s);

 

(iii) prepare and furnish to Parent or Merger Sub and the Financing Sources as
promptly as practicable all Required Information and to the extent customary

asset based loan component of the Debt Financing;

(iv) have the Company designate members of senior management of the Company
to participate in a reasonable number of presentations and sessions, upon

lenders in the Financing;

(v) assist Parent in obtaining any corporate credit and family ratings from
any ratings agencies contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters;

a certificate of an appropriate officer of the Company with respect to
solvency of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis to the
extent required by the Financing Sources) and other customary documents as may
be reasonably requested by Parent and that are not effective until as of or
after the Closing;

(vii) assist the Financing Sources in benefiting from the existing lending
relationships of the Company and its Subsidiaries;

(viii) request from the Companys existing lenders such customary payoff
letters and lien release and termination documentation in connection with
refinancings as reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the
Financing and collateral arrangements; and

 

(ix) furnish Parent and the Financing Sources with all documentation and other
information required by Governmental Entities with respect to the Debt
Financing under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations, pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act
(Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001);

_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to provide, or
cause any of its Subsidiaries to provide, cooperation under this _Section
6.11(e)_ that: (u) unreasonably interferes with the ongoing business of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (w) causes any representation or warranty
in this Agreement to be breached; (x) causes any closing condition set forth
in _Article VII_ to fail to be satisfied or otherwise causes the breach of
this Agreement; (y) requires the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take
any action that would reasonably be expected to conflict with or violate its
organizational documents or any Law and for which it would be subject to
liability for which it is not indemnified hereunder; or (z) requires (i) the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective pre-Closing directors,
officers, managers, general partners or employees to execute, deliver or enter

 



-47-  into, or perform any agreement, document or instrument, including any Debt
Financing Document, with respect to the Debt Financing or (ii) the pre-Closing

to adopt resolutions approving the agreements, documents and instruments
pursuant to which the Debt Financing is obtained, in each case of clauses

or that would be effective prior to the Effective Time. The Company hereby
consents to the reasonable use of the Companys and the Subsidiaries logos in
connection with the Debt Financing, provided that such logos are used in a
manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries.

 

(f) Prior to the consummation of the Merger, in no event shall the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries be required to pay any commitment or similar fee or
incur any liability (including due to any act or omission by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives) or expense
in connection with assisting Parent in arranging the Debt Financing or as
a result of any information provided by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their Affiliates or Representatives in connection therewith. Parent
shall, from and after the Closing or promptly after the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_, (i) promptly upon request by the
Company reimburse the Company for all out-of-pocket costs incurred in good
faith by the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation

consummation of the Merger, and (ii) eliminate any obligation under the terms
of the note purchase agreement governing the 2022 Notes for the Company or

redeem in full the entire unpaid principal amount, along with unpaid interest,
fees, premiums and any other amounts owed under each series of Company Notes
(such aggregate amount being the " _Notes Takeout Amount_ "); _provided_ that
in the event the Notes Amendments are not effective on or prior to the Closing

of redemption in accordance with the terms of each series of the Notes to
allow Merger Sub to redeem the outstanding Notes within 30 days of the Closing
Date and (y) deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the Notes Takeout
Amount that will be applied to redeem the Notes in full following such 30 day
period.

(b) In the event that the Company is unable to successfully consummate the

selected by Parent, commence a change of control offer to purchase all of the
2022 Notes (subject to the terms of and in accordance with the requirements
of the note purchase agreement governing the 2022 Notes) at the price required

connection with such change of control offer. The closing of the change of
control offer shall be conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, and the
parties shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the change of control offer
to close on the Closing Date. Concurrent with the Effective Time, and in
accordance with the terms of the change of control offer for the 2022 Notes,
the Surviving Corporation shall accept for purchase and purchase each of the
2022 Notes properly tendered and not properly withdrawn in such change of
control offer using funds provided by or at the direction of Parent. Parent
hereby covenants and agrees to provide (or to cause to be provided)
immediately available funds to the Company for the full payment at the
Effective Time of all 2022 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn to
the extent required pursuant to the terms of such change of control offer.

 

(c) The Company shall waive any of the conditions to any change of control
offer for the 2022 Notes (other than that the Merger shall have been
consummated and that there shall be no Order prohibiting consummation of such
change of control offer) as may be reasonably requested by Parent in writing
and shall not, without the written consent of Parent, waive any condition to
such change of control offer or make any changes to such change of control
offer other than as agreed between Parent and the Company.

 



-49- (d) In connection with the change of control offer for the 2022 Notes, Parent
may select one or more dealer managers, information agents, depositaries and
other agents, in each case as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company,
to provide assistance in connection therewith and the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, enter into customary agreements (including
indemnities) with such parties so selected. Parent shall pay the fees and out-
of pocket expenses of any dealer manager, information agent, depositary or
other agent retained in connection with such change of control offer upon the
incurrence of such fees and out-of-pocket expenses.

(e) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses
incurred by or on behalf of the Company at the request of Parent in connection
with the Companys compliance with its obligations under this  _Section
6.18_, including all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, fees and
expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Company in connection with any

excess of a _de minimis_ amount and (y) each of the representations and
warranties of the Company contained in _Section 4.3_, _Section 4.20_ and
_Section 4.22_ shall be true in all material respects at and as of the
Closing as if made at and as of such time (other than any such representation
and warranty that by its terms addresses matters only as of another specified
time, which shall be true in all material respects only as of such time).

(b) The Company shall have performed in all material respects all obligations
and complied in all material respects with all covenants required by this
Agreement to be performed or complied with by it at or prior to the Closing.

(c) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, there shall not
have occurred any Circumstance, which has had, or would reasonably be expected

Section 7.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. None of the Company, Parent
or Merger Sub may rely, either as a basis for not consummating the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby or terminating this Agreement and
abandoning the Merger, on the failure of any condition set forth in _Section
7.1_, _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_, as the case may be, to be satisfied
if such failure was caused by such partys breach of any provision of this
Agreement.

TERMINATION

 

Section 8.1 _Termination and Abandonment_. Anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated
and abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after
the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained and whether before or after
the effectiveness of the Merger Sub Stockholder Consent:

 

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

 

(b) by either the Company or Parent:

 

(i) if (A) the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before February
12, 2016 (the " _End Date_ ") and (B) the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ shall not have breached in any
material respect its obligations under this Agreement in any manner that has
been the cause of or resulted in the failure to consummate the Merger on or
before such date;

(ii) prior to the Effective Time, if any court of competent jurisdiction
shall have issued or entered an injunction or similar order or taken any other
action permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
Merger and such injunction or similar order or other action shall have become
final and non-appealable; _provided_ that the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ shall have used such efforts
as required by _Section 6.7_ to prevent, oppose and remove such injunction
or similar order; or

(iii) if the Company Meeting (including any adjournments or
postponements thereof) shall have concluded and the Company Stockholder
Approval contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been obtained;

(c) by the Company:

(i) if, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of
Directors authorizes the Company to enter into a written agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal, but only if the Company (A) has complied in
all respects with the provisions of _Section 6.4_ and (B) pays the Company
Termination Fee in accordance with  _Section 8.3(a)_ and (C) shall enter
into such written agreement immediately after such termination (a " _Superior
Proposal Termination_ ");

 

(ii) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of their representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A)
would result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or
_Section 7.2(b)_ or failure of the Closing to occur and (B) cannot be cured
by the End Date or, if curable, is not cured (1) within forty-five (45) days
following the Companys delivery of written notice to Parent of such breach
(which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of such breach or
failure) or (2) within any shorter period of time that remains between the
date the Company delivers the notice described in the foregoing subclause (1)
and the day prior to the End Date;  _provided_ that the Company is not then
in material breach of any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant
contained in this Agreement; or

 

(iii) if all of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.3_
have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to
be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of which shall be capable
of being satisfied at the Closing), the Company has given irrevocable written
notice to Parent and Merger Sub that it is prepared to consummate the
Closing, and Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by no later than the third (3rd) Business Day
following the later of (A) delivery of the written notice described in this
_Section 8.1(c)(iii)_ and (B) the date by which the Closing should have
occurred pursuant to _Section 2.2_; _provided_ that the Company is not then
in material breach of any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant
contained in this Agreement.

 



-52- (d) by Parent:

 

(i) if an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred or the Board of
Directors publicly proposes to make an Adverse Recommendation Change; or

(ii) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform in any material
respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would
result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section
7.3(b)_ and (B) cannot be cured by the End Date or, if curable, is not cured
(1) within forty-five (45) days following Parents delivery of written notice
to the Company of such breach (which notice shall specify in reasonable detail
the nature of such breach or failure) or (2) within any shorter period of
time that remains between the date Parent delivers the notice described in the
foregoing subclause (1) and the day prior to the End Date; _provided_ that
Parent or Merger Sub is not then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, agreement or covenant contained in this Agreement.

 

Section 8.2 _Manner and Effect of Termination_. Any party terminating this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_ shall give written notice of such
termination to the other party in accordance with this Agreement specifying
the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is being
effected and the basis therefor. In the event of termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith
become null and void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part
of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent,
consultant or representative of such party); _provided_ , however, that,
except as otherwise provided in _Section 8.3_ or in any other provision of
this Agreement, no such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any
liability or damages resulting from any willful breach of this Agreement prior
to such termination, in which case, except as otherwise provided in _Section
8.3_, the aggrieved party shall be entitled to all remedies available at law
or in equity; and provided, further, that the Confidentiality Agreement and
the provisions of _Section 6.3(b)_, the Guaranty, the expense reimbursement
and indemnity provisions of _Section 6.11_,  _Section 6.18_, this _Section
8.2_, _Section 8.3_, and _Article IX_ shall survive any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_ in accordance with their respective
terms.

 

Section 8.3 _Termination Fee_.

 

(a) In the event that:

 

(i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (x) _Section 8.1(b)(i)_, (y)
_Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ (with respect to clauses (x) and (y), so long as the
Company did not concurrently have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii))_, or (z) _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, and (A) at
any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Company Meeting an
Alternative Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise been
publicly communicated to the Companys stockholders and (B) within twelve
months following the date of such termination, an Alternative Proposal shall
have been consummated (provided that for purposes of this clause (B), each
reference to "20%" in the definition of Alternative Proposal shall be deemed
to be a reference to "50%"); 

(ii) the Company shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(i)_; or

 

(iii) Parent shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(i)_;

 

then, the Company shall, (A) in the case of clause (i) above, no later than
two (2) Business Days after the date of the occurrence of the applicable
event described in clause (B) of _Section 8.3(a)(i)_ pay Parent (or one or
more of its designees) the Company Termination Fee; (B) in the case of clause
(ii) above, prior to or on the day of such termination, and as a condition to
such termination, pay Parent (or one or more of its designees) the Company
Termination Fee; and (C) in the case of clause (iii) above, within two (2)
Business Days of such termination, pay Parent (or one or more of its
designees) the Company Termination Fee, in each case by wire transfer of same
day funds to one or more accounts designated by Parent.

 



-53- (b) In the event that:

 

(i) the Company shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_; or

 

(ii) the Company shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(iii)_

 

then, Parent shall, within two (2) Business Days of such termination, pay the
Company the Reverse Termination Fee, by wire transfer of same day funds
to one or more accounts designated by the Company.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to the Companys right set forth in the second to last sentence of
this _Section 8.3(c)_ and _Section 9.5_, the Companys right to receive
payment of the Reverse Termination Fee shall constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Company and its Subsidiaries and any other Company
Related Parties against Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantors, the Financing
Sources or any of their respective Affiliates or any direct or indirect,
former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, members,
managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, or
assignees of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Parent Related
Parties_ ") for all losses and damages suffered in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including as a result of
the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and
upon payment of such amount, none of the Parent Related Parties shall have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Equity
Commitment Letter, the Debt Commitment Letters or in respect of any other
document or theory of law or equity or in respect of oral representations made
or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether in equity
or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise it being understood and the
Company agrees that the maximum aggregate liability of the Parent Related
Parties shall be limited to an amount equal to the amount of the Reverse
Termination Fee, and in no event shall the Company seek or be entitled
to recover any money damages, recovery or judgment in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in excess of the Reverse
Termination Fee, and in no event shall the Company seek or be entitled to
multiple, special or punitive damages against any Parent Related Party in
excess of the Reverse Termination Fee (except that Parent shall also be
obligated with respect to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and the
provisions of _Section 6.3(b)_,  _Section 8.3(d)_ and _Section 9.2_ and
for any of its expense reimbursement and indemnification obligations contained
in _Section 6.11_ and _Section 6.18_ and the Guarantors shall also be
obligated with respect to the terms and conditions of the Guaranty).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to _Section 9.5_, Parents right to receive payment from the Company
of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_, in
circumstances where the Company Termination Fee is owed and paid in full
pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_, shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy
of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of
their respective, direct or indirect, former, current or future general or
limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers,
employees, agents, representatives, Affiliates or assignees (collectively,
the " _Company Related Parties_ ") for all losses and damages suffered as a
result of any breach or failure to perform hereunder giving rise to such
termination, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company Related
Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby with respect to
such breach or failure to perform (except that the Company shall also be
obligated with respect to the terms of _Section 8.3(d)_ and _Section 9.2_).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the Company shall
be entitled to obtain an injunction, or other appropriate form of
specific performance or equitable relief, to cause Parent and Merger Sub to
cause, or for the Company to directly cause, in accordance with its third
party beneficiary rights under the Equity Commitment Letter, the Equity
Financing to be funded on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in the Equity Commitment Letter and this Agreement if, and only if, each of
the following conditions has been satisfied: (i) all conditions in _Section
7.1_ and _Section 7.3_ (other than those conditions that by their terms are
to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of which shall be
capable of being satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied at the time
when the Closing would have occurred but for the failure of the Equity
Financing to be funded, and remain satisfied, (ii) the financing provided for
by the Debt Commitment Letters (or, if Alternative Financing is being used in
accordance with _Section 6.11_, pursuant to the commitments with respect
thereto) has been funded in accordance with its terms or will be funded at the
Closing in accordance

 



-54-  with its terms if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, (iii) with
respect to any funding of the Equity Financing to occur at the Closing, the
Company has irrevocably confirmed that if specific performance is granted and
the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the Closing will
occur and (iv) Parent fails to consummate the Closing in accordance with
_Section 2.2_. For the avoidance of doubt, while the Company may pursue a
grant of specific performance of the type provided in the preceding sentence
and the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee under _Section 8.3(b)_, under
no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance and any monetary damages, including any monetary
damages in lieu of specific performance and all or any portion of the Reverse
Termination Fee.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties hereto agree that in no event shall the Company or Parent be required
to pay the Company Termination Fee or the Reverse Termination Fee, as the case
may be, on more than one occasion. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges
that (i) the agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) each of the Company
Termination Fee and the Reverse Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is
liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such fee
is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision and
(iii) without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails
to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ and, in order to
obtain such payment, either Parent or the Company, as the case may be,
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the other party for the
payment of any amount set forth in this _Section 8.3_, such paying party
shall pay the other party its costs and expenses in connection with such suit,
together with interest on such amount at the annual rate of five percent (5%)
plus the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made through the date such payment was
actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted
by applicable Law.

ARTICLE IX.

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

Section 9.1 _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Merger. This _Section
9.1_ shall not limit any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or
in any document or instrument delivered pursuant to or in connection
with this Agreement that by its terms contemplates performance in whole or in
part after the Effective Time.

Section 9.2 _Expenses_. Except as set forth in _Sections 6.11(e)_ , _6.11(f)_
, _6.18_ and _8.3_ or as otherwise expressly provided herein, whether or not

the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be

the Proxy Statement (including applicable SEC filing fees) shall be borne by
the Company and (ii) all fees paid in respect of any HSR or other regulatory

delivered in counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties, it being
understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.
Signatures transmitted by facsimile or other electronic transmission shall be
accepted as originals for all purposes of this Agreement.

 



-55- Section 9.4 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement and all claims or
causes of action (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) that may be based
upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution
or performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based
upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or
in connection with this Agreement) shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. In addition, each
of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding
with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of
this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by any
party hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined
exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery, or, solely if the Delaware
Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any federal court within the State of Delaware, or, solely if both the
Delaware Court of Chancery and the federal courts within the State of Delaware
decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any other state court
within the State of Delaware, and, in each case, any appellate court
therefrom. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard
to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property,
generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the
aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any action or proceeding
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this
Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction
of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in
accordance with this _Section 9.4_, (b) any claim that it or its property is
exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal
process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by
the applicable Law, any claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in such
court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action
or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter
hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that service of process upon such party in any such action or
proceeding shall be effective if such process is given as a notice in
accordance with _Section 9.7_ or in any other manner permitted by applicable
Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party hereto, nor any of its
Affiliates, will bring, or support the bringing of, any claim, whether at law
or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any
Financing Source, in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letters or the performance
thereof, anywhere other than in (i) New York State court sitting in the
County of New York or (ii) United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York.

Section 9.5  _Specific Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, subject to
the penultimate sentence of  _Section 8.3(c)_, each party agrees that in the
event of any breach or threatened breach by any other party of any covenant or
obligation contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall be
entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether
in law or equity, including monetary damages) to obtain (i) a decree or order
of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such
covenant or obligation and (ii) an injunction restraining such breach or
threatened breach. It is acknowledged and agreed that, in the event of a
failure or threatened failure of Parent to enforce the terms of the Debt
Commitment Letter, the Company shall be entitled to specific performance to
cause Parent to use its reasonable best efforts to enforce the terms of the
Debt Commitment Letter or any financing agreements related thereto. Subject to
the penultimate sentence of _Section 8.3(c)_, each party acknowledges and
agrees that (A) each party is entitled to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement notwithstanding the availability of any monetary
remedy, (B) the availability of any monetary remedy (1) is not intended
to and does not adequately compensate for the harm that would result from a
breach of this Agreement

 



-56-  and (2) shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any
respect any partys right to specific enforcement, and (C) the right of
specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would
have entered into this Agreement. Each party further agrees that (i) no such
party will oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that the other party
has an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity and (ii) no other party or
any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or
similar instrument or prove actual damages in connection with or as a
condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 9.5_, and
each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, this _Section 9.5_ is not intended
and shall not be construed to limit in any way, and shall be subject in all
respects to, the provisions of _Section 8.3(c)_, including the penultimate
sentence thereof.

 

Section 9.6 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING ANY SUIT AGAINST THE FINANCING
SOURCES OR EQUITY PROVIDER). EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY
AND SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS CONTAINED IN THIS _SECTION 9.6_ (INCLUDING ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING, CLAIM OR COUNTERCLAIM INVOLVING FINANCING SOURCES UNDER
THE DEBT FINANCING (AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES).

sufficient if in writing, and sent (i) by facsimile transmission with written
confirmation of receipt, (ii) by reliable overnight delivery service (with
proof of service), or (iii) by hand delivery or certified or registered mail

Section 9.8 _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_.

 

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns, and no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights,
benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other
than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns,
other than: (i) at and after the Effective Time, with respect to the
provisions of _Section 6.10_ which shall inure to the benefit of the persons
or entities benefiting therefrom who are intended to be third-party
beneficiaries thereof, (ii) at and after the Effective Time, the rights of
the holders of shares of Company Stock to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (iii) at and

provisions of _Section 3.3_, in each case, at the Effective Time in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; _provided_ that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this _Section 9.8(a)_ and
_Section 8.3(c)_, the last sentence of _Section 9.4_, _Section 9.5_,
_Section 9.6_, the last sentence of _Section 9.11_ and _Section 9.12_
shall be enforceable by each Financing Source and each Financing Source shall
be an intended third party beneficiary of this Section and such Sections and
shall be entitled to enforce such provisions as if direct parties to this
Agreement. The representations and warranties in this Agreement and the
indemnification obligations of Parent in _Section 6.11(f)_ are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties.

 



-58- (b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each of the other
parties; _provided_ that each of Parent and Merger Sub may (i) assign, by
operation of law or otherwise, in whole or in part, this Agreement or any or
all of its rights and obligations hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates
and (ii) after the Closing, may assign all of its rights under this Agreement
for collateral security purposes to any Financing Source; _provided, further_
, that no such assignment shall (i) relieve such party of any of its
obligations under this Agreement or (ii) be permitted if such assignment would
reasonably be expected to prevent, impair or materially delay the consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Any assignment,
delegation or transfer in violation of this _Section 9.8_ shall be null and
void _ab initio_.

 

Section 9.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the sole extent of such invalidity or unenforceability
without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remainder of such term or
provision or the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement in
any jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable.

 

Section 9.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits,
annexes and schedules hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement (which shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement), the Guaranty, the
Equity Commitment Letter, the Company Disclosure Letter and the other
documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof.

 

Section 9.11 _Amendments; Waivers_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if,
such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an
amendment, by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, or in the case of a waiver,
by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective; _provided_
that after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval or the effectiveness
of the Merger Sub Stockholder Consent, if any such amendment or waiver shall
by applicable Law require further approval of the stockholders of the Company
or stockholder of Merger Sub, the effectiveness of such amendment or waiver
shall be subject to the approval of the stockholders of the Company or the
stockholder of Merger Sub, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
failure or delay by the Company or Parent in exercising any right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this  _Section 9.11_ and _Section 8.3(c)_,
the last sentence of _Section 9.4_, _Section 9.5_, _Section 9.6_, the last
sentence of _Section 9.11_ and _Section 9.12 _(and the related definitions
in this Agreement used therein) shall not be amended, modified, supplemented
or waived in a manner that is adverse in any material respect to any Financing
Source without the prior written consent of such Financing Source.

 

Section 9.12 _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement may only be made against the entities that are expressly identified
as parties hereto and no Parent Related Party or stockholder of the
Company (other than, (i) in the case of the Parent Related Parties, the
Guarantors to the extent set forth in the Guaranty or Equity Commitment Letter
and (ii) in the case of a Company stockholder, to the extent set forth in the
Voting Agreements, the Rollover Agreements or any other documents executed by
such stockholder in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby) shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the
parties to this Agreement or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or
otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated hereby or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged
to be made in connection herewith. Without limiting the rights of the Company
against Parent or Merger Sub hereunder, in no event shall the Company or any
Company Related Party, and the Company agrees not to and to cause any Company
Related Party not to, seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims
for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages
from, any Parent Related Party and that the Company and the Company Related
Parties has and shall have no right of recovery against and no liability shall
attach to any of the Parent Related Parties (other

 



-59-  than any payment from the Guarantors to the extent set forth in the
Guaranty, or in connection with the Companys third party beneficiary rights
under the Equity Commitment Letter), including whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability
company veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of Parent, by the
enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by
virtue of any applicable Law, through a claim based in tort, contract, statute
or otherwise. Without limiting the rights of Parent and Merger Sub against the
Company hereunder, in no event shall Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent Related
Party, and Parent and Merger Sub agree not to and to cause any Parent Related
Party not to, seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for
breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages from,
any Company stockholder and agree that Parent, Merger Sub and the Parent
Related Parties have and shall have no right of recovery against and no
liability shall attach to any of the Companys stockholders (other than
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Voting Agreements, the Rollover
Agreements or any other documents executed by such Company stockholder in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby), including
whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited
partnership or limited liability company veil, by or through a claim by or on
behalf of Parent, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or
equitable proceeding, by virtue of any applicable Law, through a claim based
in tort, contract, statute or otherwise.
