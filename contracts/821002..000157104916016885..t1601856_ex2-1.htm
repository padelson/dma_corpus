2.2 _Estimated Measurement Date Balance Sheet Statement_. Seller
shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser, no less than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing, a good-faith estimated consolidated balance sheet (based
on the DK Group's books and records, DK Group's management's best estimates
and other information then available) in the form attached hereto as Appendix
C and in accordance with the Accounting Principles (the "Estimated Measurement
Date Balance Sheet Statement") for the DK Group as of the Measurement Date,
which shall include a determination (based on the balance sheet included in
the Estimated Measurement Date Balance Sheet Statement) of (a) the estimated
Net Financial Debt as of the Measurement Date; (b) the estimated Working
Capital as of the Measurement Date; (c) the Cash Consideration (based on (i)
the estimates provided pursuant to clauses (a) and (b) above, (ii) the
estimated Unpaid Restructuring Costs and the Closing Tax Adjustment, (iii) the
Delayed Employee Costs and (iv) if applicable, the Estimated DK Group
Internal Debt Costs (the "Estimated Cash Consideration")); and (d) the
estimated Share Consideration (based on the estimates provided pursuant to
clauses (a), (b) and (c) above). The parties agree and acknowledge that the
Estimated Cash Consideration shall be calculated using the formulas specified
in the definitions of "Cash Consideration" and "Share Consideration" in
_Section 1_ above using Working Capital (to determine the Positive Working
Capital Adjustment Amount or Negative Working Capital Adjustment Amount, as
applicable) and the Net Financial Debt set forth in the Estimated Measurement
Date Balance Sheet Statement as if such amounts were the actual amounts of Net
Financial Debt and Working Capital as of the Measurement Date.

  



  

2.3 _Payments at Closing_. At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay to
Seller:

  



  

(a) an amount equal to the Estimated Cash Consideration by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller;

  



  

(b) Seventy Five Million Dollars ($75,000,000) by the issuance of a

amount of Seventy Five Million Dollars ($75,000,000), in the form of Exhibit B
(the "Note Consideration"); and

  



  

(c) Seventy Five Million Dollars ($75,000,000) by the issuance of an
integral number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock (the "G-III Stock
Consideration") equal to Seventy Five Million Dollars ($75,000,000) divided by
the average VWAP of the Purchaser Common Stock for the five (5) Trading Day
period preceding the Closing Date (any fractional share equal to or in excess
of 0.50 of a share of Purchaser Common Stock to be rounded up to the nearest
whole share of Purchaser Common Stock and any fractional share of less than
0.50 of a share of Purchaser Common Stock to be rounded down to the nearest
whole share of Purchaser Common Stock);  _provided, however_ , that if an ex-
dividend date for

  



    

 | -18-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Purchaser Common Stock occurs during such five (5) Trading Day period, then
the VWAP for each Trading Day during such period that precedes such ex-
dividend date shall be reduced by the amount of the applicable dividend
payable on a share of Purchaser Common Stock.

  



  

2.4 _Preparation and Review of Measurement Date Balance Sheet
Statement_. Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser will

"Preliminary Measurement Date Balance Sheet Statement") for the DK Group as
of the Measurement Date in the same form and prepared on the same basis
(including the application of the Accounting Principles) as the Estimated
Measurement Date Balance Sheet Statement, which shall include a determination
(based on the balance sheet included in the Preliminary Measurement Date
Balance Sheet Statement) of the Net Financial Debt, the Working Capital, the
Unpaid Restructuring Costs, each as of the Measurement Date and in
accordance with the Accounting Principles, along with the calculation of the
final Cash Consideration and Share Consideration based thereon (other than
the Final Tax Adjustment, which shall be calculated and adjusted as between
Purchaser and Seller pursuant to _Section 6.4(i)(ii)_ ). Following its
delivery of the Preliminary Measurement Date Balance Sheet Statement to
Seller, Purchaser will provide access to Seller and its Representatives to

Restructuring Costs and the final Cash Consideration based thereon) as
requested by Seller. The Preliminary Measurement Date Balance
Sheet Statement, the determination of the Net Financial Debt, the Working
Capital and the Unpaid Restructuring Costs as of the Measurement Date and the
resulting calculation of the final Cash Consideration based thereon and on the
Delayed Employee Costs (other than the Final Tax Adjustment, which shall be
calculated and adjusted as between Purchaser and Seller pursuant to _Section
6.4(i)(ii)_ ) will all be binding and conclusive on the parties upon the

Measurement Date Balance Sheet Statement, the determination of Net Financial
Debt, the Working Capital and the Unpaid Restructuring Costs as of the

), or (ii) forty-five (45) days following the delivery to Seller of the
Preliminary Measurement Date Balance Sheet Statement, the determination of
Net Financial Debt, the Working Capital and the Unpaid Restructuring Costs as
of the Measurement Date and the calculation of the final Cash Consideration
based thereon and on the Delayed Employee Costs (other than the Final Tax
Adjustment, which shall be calculated and adjusted as between Purchaser and
Seller pursuant to _Section 6.4(i)(ii)_ ), unless within such forty-five (45)
day period Seller provides written notice to Purchaser describing in
reasonable detail its objections to the Preliminary Measurement Date Balance
Sheet Statement, the calculation of the Working Capital, the Net Financial
Debt or the Unpaid Restructuring Costs as of the Measurement Date or the
calculation of the final Cash Consideration or Share Consideration based
thereon (the "Notice of Disagreement").

Purchaser and Seller agree in writing on the resolution of such disagreement,
such resolution shall be conclusive and binding on all of the parties hereto.

Disagreement, Purchaser and Seller will submit the issues remaining in dispute
to KPMG LLP or another nationally recognized independent accounting firm that
is mutually agreed to by Seller and Purchaser (the "Selected Accountant") for
resolution in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and with the
Accounting Principles. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this _Section 2.5_, the Selected Accountant's engagement pursuant to this
_Section 2.5_ shall be limited solely to resolving the remaining disputed
items set forth in the Notice of Disagreement and not otherwise
previously resolved by the parties hereto pursuant to the provisions of this
_Section 2.5_. If issues are submitted to the Selected Accountant for
resolution, (A) Purchaser and Seller will furnish or cause to be furnished to
the Selected Accountant access to the management of each member of the DK
Group and their accountants and to such work papers and other documents and
information relating to the disputed issues as the Selected Accountant may
reasonably request and are available to that party or its agents and will be
afforded the opportunity to present to the Selected Accountant any material
relating to the disputed issues and to discuss the issues with the Selected
Accountant; (B) the Selected Accountant shall deliver its written
determination of the issues remaining in dispute to Purchaser and Seller
within sixty (60) days of the submission of the issues remaining in dispute to
the Selected Accountant, which determination will be final, binding and
conclusive on the parties and will be used in the calculation of the Working
Capital, the determination of Net Financial Debt and the calculation of Unpaid
Restructuring Costs, each as of the Measurement Date, and the resulting Cash
Consideration and Share Consideration; and (C) the fees, costs and expenses of
the Selected Accountant shall be shared equally by Purchaser and Seller. For
purposes of this Agreement, the "Measurement Date Balance Sheet Statement"
shall mean the Preliminary Measurement Date Balance Sheet Statement together
with, if applicable, any revisions thereto pursuant to this _Section 2.5_.

Financial Debt, the Working Capital and the Unpaid Restructuring Costs, each
as of the Measurement Date, and the finally determined Cash Consideration
based

(other than the Final Tax Adjustment, which shall be calculated and adjusted
as between Purchaser and Seller pursuant to  _Section 6.4(i)(ii)_ ), are
finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.4_ or _Section 2.5_ above.

  



  

2.7 _Non-Transfer and Reservation of Pre-Closing Privilege_. At
the Closing, all documents, records and privileged communications
(including emails) between the Company, its Subsidiaries and Seller and their

3. _ _Representations and Warranties regarding Seller and the Company__. Subject to such exceptions as are set forth in the appropriate section, subsection or subclause of the disclosure schedule supplied by Seller to Purchaser on the date hereof (the "Disclosure Schedule") or in any other section, subsection or subclause of the Disclosure Schedule if the relevance of such disclosure to such other section, subsection or subclause of this _Section 3_ is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure without reference to the documents referenced therein, Seller hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser as of the date hereof as follows:

  



  

3.1 _Organization, Standing and Power._

  



  

(a) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. There is no
pending or threatened in writing Proceeding for the dissolution, liquidation
or insolvency of the Company. The Company has all requisite corporate power
to own its properties and to carry on the Current Company Business.
_Section 3.1_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth each jurisdiction in
which the Company is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation.
The Company is duly qualified to do business, and is in good standing (if
such concept is applicable in the relevant jurisdiction), in each
jurisdiction where the operation of the Current Company Business by the
Company requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
qualified does not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has
made available to Purchaser a true and correct copy of its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws as in effect as of the date of this Agreement and the
board of directors of the Company has not approved or proposed any amendment
to such certificate of incorporation or bylaws. The

Company is not in violation of any of the provisions of its certificate of
incorporation or bylaws.

liability company duly incorporated or organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization and is duly licensed or qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation, partnership or limited liability company, as applicable, in each
other jurisdiction in which the character of its properties or in which the
transaction of its business makes such qualification necessary except where
the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. _Section 3.2_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth each
jurisdiction in which each Subsidiary of the Company is qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation or other foreign entity. Except as set
forth on _Section 3.2_ of the Disclosure Schedule, none of the business of

members, boards of directors or managers or committees of the boards of
directors or managers of any such member of the DK Group has been held for
which minutes have not been prepared and are not contained in such minute
books. At the Closing, all those books and records will be in the possession
or under the control of the DK Group.

been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Seller
and no other authorization or consent of its direct or indirect stockholders

last six (6) years with respect to any Company Employee Plan that is a funded
"pension plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA), including copies
of such material correspondence relating to any pending application for a
favorable determination letter.

  



  

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 3.19(c)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule, each Company Employee Plan other than a Multiemployer Plan and, to
the Knowledge of Seller, each Multiemployer Plan, has been established,
maintained, operated, funded and administered in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and in all material respects in compliance with the
requirements of applicable Legal Requirements (including ERISA and the Code),
and, to the Knowledge of Seller, no event has occurred or condition exists
with respect to any Company Employee Plan which could reasonably be expected
to result in the imposition of any material penalty or liability. Each
Company Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code is covered by a favorable IRS determination letter, is the subject
of an application for a determination letter from the IRS or is entitled
to rely upon an opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service to the plan
sponsor as to its qualified status under the Code and the exempt status under
the Code of its related trust, including all currently effective amendments to
the Code, and, to the Knowledge of Seller, no events or circumstances have
occurred that have resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in the
loss of the tax-qualified status of any such Company Employee Plan. All
contributions, benefit payments, premium deposits or other payments required
to be made to or under any Company Employee Plan (other than a Multiemployer
Plan) have been timely made, and all contributions, benefit payments, premium

under Title I of ERISA that would, individually or in the aggregate, result in

or obligation to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. With respect to
each Company Employee Plan that is not a Multiemployer Plan, and, to the
Knowledge of Seller, with respect to each Multiemployer Plan, there are no
claims (other than routine claims for benefits), lawsuits, audits (other than

pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened.

  



  

(d) Except as set forth in _Section 3.19(d)_ of the Disclosure

except as set forth on _Section 3.19(d)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, none of
the Company or any of the Subsidiaries has any liability under or with
respect to any Company Employee Plan or otherwise arising out of the
misclassification of any service provider as a consultant or independent
contractor and not as an employee. Except as set forth in _Section 3.19(d)_
of the Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has incurred or could reasonably be expected to incur any obligation or
liability, whether direct, indirect, contingent or otherwise (including on

pension plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) that is or
was subject to Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA,
or (y) on account of any violation of the health care
continuation requirements of Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or
Section 4980B of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in any transaction described in Section 4069, 4204
or 4212 of ERISA.

  



  

(e) Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any of its or
their ERISA Affiliates has incurred any liability on account of a
"complete withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal" (within the meaning of
Sections 4203 and 4205 of ERISA, respectively) from any Multiemployer Plan,
and, to the Knowledge of Seller, no circumstance exists that would reasonably
be expected to give rise to any such withdrawal. Except as set forth in
_Section 3.19(e)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any
of its ERISA Affiliates has received notice since January 1, 2013 of any
Multiemployer Plan's (i) failure to satisfy the minimum funding requirements
of Section 412 of the Code or application for or receipt of a waiver of such
minimum funding requirements, (ii) "endangered status" or "critical status"
(within the meaning of Section 432 of the Code) or (iii) insolvency,
"reorganization" (within the meaning of Section 4245 or 4241 of ERISA) or
proposed or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened termination. All
contributions, surcharges and premium payments owed by the Company and its
ERISA Affiliates with respect to each Multiemployer Plan have been paid when
due. Seller has furnished or made available to Purchaser true and
complete copies of any material correspondence or notifications received by
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate since January 1,

health, life, disability or other welfare benefits following retirement or
other termination of employment to any current or former employees or their
respective beneficiaries or dependents. Except as noted on _Section 3.19(g)_
 of the Disclosure Schedule or as restricted by Legal Requirement, each
Company Employee Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan", as defined
in Section 3(1) of ERISA but excluding a plan or arrangement that provides
severance or vacation benefits to employees generally or to a specified class
of employees and/or any plan sponsored by Seller or any of its Affiliates

neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the Transaction or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will (either alone or together with any other event) (i) entitle
any current or former employee or other service provider of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or benefits or any other pay or benefits
(including change in control, golden parachute, retention bonus or other
similar payment under any Company Employee Plan or other arrangement), (ii)
accelerate the time of payment, funding or vesting of any
payment, distribution, benefits or equity award, (iii) increase the amount of
any compensation or benefit payable by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (iv) result in any forgiveness of indebtedness of any current
or former employee or service provider of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
obligated under any plan, agreement, policy or arrangement pursuant to which
the Company, any such Subsidiary or, following the Closing, the
Purchaser and/or any Subsidiary of Purchaser has, will have or may incur an
obligation to (x) make any payment that would be nondeductible by reason of

3.26 _Securities Law Matters._

  



  

(a) _General_.

  



  

(i) The acquisition of the G-III Stock Consideration by Seller
pursuant to this Agreement will not contravene any Legal Requirement
binding on Seller or any restriction applicable to Seller.

  



  

(ii) Seller is not acquiring the G-III Stock Consideration as a
nominee or agent or otherwise for any other person.

  



  

(iii) Seller understands that the offer and sale of the G-III Stock
Consideration to Seller is being made without registration of the shares of
Purchaser Common Stock comprising the G-III Stock Consideration under the
Securities Act, or any securities law of any state of the United States or of
any other jurisdiction.

  



  

(b) _Information Concerning Purchaser_.

  



  

(i) Seller confirms that it is not relying on any communication
(written or oral) of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, as
investment advice or as a recommendation to purchase the G-III Stock
Consideration.

  



  

(ii) Seller is familiar with the business and financial condition and
operations of Purchaser and has had access to such information
concerning Purchaser and the Purchaser Common Stock as it deems necessary to
enable it to make an informed investment decision concerning the purchase of
the G-III Stock Consideration. Seller has been afforded an opportunity to ask
questions of Purchaser in connection with its investment in the Purchaser
Common Stock.

  



    

 | -41-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) Seller understands that no federal or state agency has passed
upon the merits or risks of an investment in the Purchaser Common
Stock comprising the G-III Stock Consideration or made any finding or
determination concerning the fairness or advisability of this investment.

  



  

(c) _Status of Seller_.

  



  

(i) Seller has such knowledge, skill and experience in business,
financial and investment matters that Seller is capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of an investment in the Purchaser Common Stock. With the
assistance of Seller's own professional advisors, to the extent that Seller
has deemed appropriate, Seller has made its own legal, tax, accounting and
financial evaluation of the merits and risks of an investment in the
Purchaser Common Stock as provided herein. Seller understands and accepts that
the purchase of the G-III Stock Consideration involves various risks and has
considered the suitability of the Purchaser Common Stock as an investment in

(i) Seller is acquiring the G-III Stock Consideration solely for
Seller's own beneficial account, for investment purposes, and not with a view
to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution of the G-III Stock
Consideration. Seller understands that the shares of Purchaser Common Stock
comprising the G-III Stock Consideration have not been registered under the
Securities Act or any state securities laws by reason of specific exemptions
under the provisions thereof which depend in part upon the investment intent
of Seller and of the other representations made by Seller in this Agreement.
Seller understands that Purchaser is relying upon the representations and
agreements of Seller contained in this Agreement for the purpose of
determining whether the sale of the G-III Stock Consideration to Seller meets
the requirements for such exemptions.

  



  

(ii) Seller understands that the shares of Purchaser Common Stock
comprising the G-III Stock Consideration are "restricted securities" under
applicable federal securities laws and that the Securities Act and the rules
of the SEC provide in substance that Seller may dispose of the G-III Stock
Consideration only pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act or an exemption therefrom, and Seller understands that
Purchaser has no obligation or intention to register any of the G-III Stock
Consideration except as provided in the Registration Rights Agreement.

economic risks of the investment in the Purchaser Common Stock for an
indefinite period of time.

  



  

(iii) Seller agrees: (A) that Seller will not sell, assign, pledge,
give, transfer or otherwise dispose of the G-III Stock Consideration or any
interest therein, or make any offer or attempt to do any of the foregoing,
except pursuant to an effective registration

to any purported transfer of any shares of Purchaser Common Stock comprising
the G-III Stock Consideration except upon compliance with the foregoing
restrictions.

Person offered to sell Purchaser Common Stock to it by means of any form of
general solicitation or advertising, including but not limited to: (A) any

SECURITIES ACT), UNLESS THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED AN OPINION OF COUNSEL
REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO IT THAT SUCH TRANSACTION DOES NOT REQUIRE
REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT AND SUCH OTHER APPLICABLE LAWS."

  



  

3.27 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this _Section 3_ (as modified by
the Disclosure Schedule), neither Seller nor any other Person on behalf of

own its properties and to carry on its business as presently conducted and is
qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation or
similar entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation
of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in
such good standing, or to have such power or authority, are not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect. Purchaser is not in violation of any of the provisions of its
certificate of incorporation or bylaws.

  



  

4.2 _Authorization and Binding Obligation of Purchaser_.
Purchaser has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to consummate the Transaction and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to perform its
obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery by Purchaser of this

pursuant hereto, the performance by Purchaser of its obligations hereunder and
the consummation of the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action
on the part of Purchaser, and no other authorization or consent of Purchaser
or its stockholders is necessary. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Purchaser, and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid and
binding obligation of Seller, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of Purchaser, enforceable against Purchaser in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating to
creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity, regardless of
whether asserted in a proceeding in equity or at law.

  



  

4.3 _Noncontravention_. Neither the execution and delivery by
Purchaser of this Agreement, nor the consummation by Purchaser of the
Transaction or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
will: (a) conflict with or violate any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Purchaser; (b) except as set forth on _Section
4.3_ of the Disclosure Schedule, conflict with, result in a breach of,
constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default
under, result in the acceleration of obligations under, create in any party
any right to terminate or modify, or require any notice, consent or waiver
under, any contract or agreement to which Purchaser is a party or by which
Purchaser is bound, except for any conflict, breach, default, acceleration or
right to terminate or modify, or, notice, consent, or waiver (which if not
made or obtained) would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the ability of Purchaser to execute and deliver this Agreement or
consummate the Closing; (c) violate any Legal Requirement applicable to
Purchaser or any of its properties or assets, except for any violation that
would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
ability of Purchaser to execute and deliver this Agreement or consummate
the Closing; or (d) render Purchaser insolvent or unable to pay its debts as
they become due. Except as may be required by the HSR Act or comparable
Legal Requirements in

  



    

 | -44-|

foreign jurisdictions, no consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, or any permit, order, authorization,
consent or approval of, any Governmental Authority is required to be obtained
or made by Purchaser at or prior to the Closing Date in order for
Purchaser to execute and deliver this Agreement or to consummate the Closing.

  



  

4.4 _Litigation_. There is no Proceeding pending or threatened in
writing against Purchaser that challenges the validity of this Agreement or
the Transaction or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and to the Knowledge of Purchaser there is no basis for any
such proceedings. There is no Proceeding pending or threatened in writing
against Purchaser that, if decided adversely, would reasonably be expected to
have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

4.5 _Financing_. Purchaser has delivered to Seller a true correct
and complete fully executed copy of the debt commitment letter dated as of the
date of this Agreement (together with the exhibits, schedules and annexes
thereto, as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified in accordance with
the terms therein and herein, the "Debt Commitment Letter") and a true and
correct copy of the fee letter referenced therein (subject to redaction of
the fee amounts and "flex" provisions which do not, for the avoidance
doubt, create or modify any conditions to the Financing) (as amended,

herein, the "Fee Letter"), pursuant to which the Lenders have committed, on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to provide to
Purchaser the amount of financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter
(the "Financing"). As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment
Letter is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser and, to the
Knowledge of the Purchaser, the Lenders, enforceable against Purchaser and, to
the Knowledge of the Purchaser, the Lenders in accordance with its terms
(except, in each case, as may be limited by any bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or similar laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general principles of
equity), is in full force and effect, has not been amended, modified,
withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect, and no event has occurred
or fact exists which (with or without notice, lapse of time or both)
would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach thereunder on the part of
Purchaser or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, the Lenders. There are no
conditions precedent to the funding of the Financing, other than as expressly
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. The net proceeds of the Financing,
when funded on the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of the Debt
Commitment Letter, and the Note Consideration and G-III Stock Consideration,
will be sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Purchaser's
obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the Cash
Consideration and the repayment of all LVMH Intercompany Debt owing as of the
Closing Date. As of the date hereof, Purchaser has no reason to believe that
any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or that the
Financing will not be available in full to the Purchaser on the Closing Date
assuming the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to Purchaser's
obligations to effect the Closing under this Agreement. Purchaser has paid
all fees under the Fee Letter due and payable thereunder through the date
hereof.

  



  

4.6 _Stock Issuance_. At the Closing, the G-III Stock
Consideration will have been duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, non-
assessable and free and clear of all Encumbrances and free of all transfer
restrictions other than those restrictions under applicable federal and state
securities laws. Subject to the accuracy of Seller's representations and

  



    

 | -45-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

warranties set forth in _Section 3.26_ , the G-III Stock Consideration will
be issued in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements, including the
Securities Act and the NASDAQ Rules, and none of the G-III Stock
Consideration will be issued in violation of any preemptive or other rights
of any Person to acquire securities of Purchaser. Purchaser has reserved a
sufficient number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock in order to fulfill its
obligations hereunder.

  



  

4.7 _SEC Reports; Financial Statements; Registration Rights._

  



  

(a) Purchaser has timely filed all forms, reports, statements,
certifications and other documents (including all exhibits, amendments and
supplements thereto) required to be filed by it with the SEC since February
1, 2015 under Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (all such forms,
reports, statements, certificates and other documents filed since February 1,
2015, collectively, the "Purchaser SEC Documents"). As of their respective
dates, or, if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment, each of the
Purchaser SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act as in effect on the date so filed. As of
their respective filing dates and in the case of Purchaser's proxy
statement on the date of mailing (or, if amended or superseded by a
subsequent filing, as of the date of such amendment or superseding
filing), none of the Purchaser SEC Documents (including any financial
statements or schedules included therein) contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated or
incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. No Subsidiary of Purchaser is, or since February 1,
2015 has been, required to file any form, report, registration statement or
other document with the SEC. As used in this _Section 4.7_, the term
"filed" shall be broadly construed to include any manner in which a document
or information was filed, furnished, transmitted, supplied or otherwise made
available to the SEC.

  



  

(b) There are no outstanding or unresolved comments in any comment
letters received by Purchaser from the SEC. To the Knowledge of Purchaser,
none of the Purchaser SEC Documents is the subject of any ongoing review by
the SEC.

  



  

(c) The audited consolidated financial statements of Purchaser
(including any related notes thereto) contained in or incorporated by
reference in the Purchaser SEC Documents were prepared in accordance with
U.S. GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the period
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Purchaser and
its Subsidiaries at the date thereof and the results of their operations and
cash flows for the periods indicated, all in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The
unaudited consolidated financial statements of Purchaser (including any
related notes thereto) included in Purchaser's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q
filed with the SEC since January 31, 2016 have been prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or may be permitted by the
SEC under the Exchange Act) and fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and the results of their operations and cash flows
for the periods indicated (subject to normal period-end adjustments), all in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. The financial statements referred to in this
_Section 4.7_ reflect the consistent application of such
accounting principles throughout the periods involved, except as disclosed

  



    

 | -46-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

in the notes to such financial statements. No financial statements of any
Person other than Purchaser and its Subsidiaries are, or since February 1,
2015 have been, required by U.S. GAAP to be included in the consolidated
financial statements of Purchaser.

  



  

(d) Purchaser has no agreement, arrangement or understanding that is
currently in effect to register any securities of Purchaser or any of
its Subsidiaries under the Securities Act or under any state securities law
and has not granted registration rights to any Person (other than agreements,
arrangements or understandings with respect to registration rights that are no
longer in effect).

  



  

4.8 _Capital Structure._

  



  

(a) The authorized capital stock of Purchaser consists of (i)
1,000,000 shares of "blank check" preferred stock, none of which has been
issued, and (ii) 120,000,000 shares of Purchaser Common Stock. As of July 18,

In addition, as of July 18, 2016, 2,135,449 shares of Purchaser Common Stock

to which Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the

4.9 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since January 31, 2016 to the
date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, there has not been any
change or effect that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or is
reasonably likely to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

4.10 _Brokers ' and Finders' Fee_. Except as set forth on _Section
4.10_ of the Disclosure Schedule, no broker, finder or investment banker is
or may be entitled to brokerage or finders' fees or agents' commissions or
investment bankers' fees or any similar charges from Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates in connection with this Agreement or the Transaction or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

4.11 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this _Section 4_, neither
Purchaser nor any other Person on behalf of Purchaser makes any other express
or implied representation or warranty with respect to Purchaser or any
Subsidiary of Purchaser or the Transaction, and Purchaser disclaims any other
representations or warranties, whether made by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives. The Parties agree that neither Purchaser
nor any other Person on behalf of Purchaser makes any representation or
warranty with respect to Purchaser or any Subsidiary of Purchaser regarding

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, after
execution of this Agreement, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates may disclose
any and all information regarding this Agreement and/or the transactions

that the recipient of any such information is subject to a confidentiality
obligation.

  



  

6.3 _Best Efforts; Government Approvals and Financing._

  



  

(a) Purchaser and Seller shall each use best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions necessary or appropriate to execute and
deliver this Agreement and consummate the Closing and the Transaction and
bring about the fulfillment of the conditions precedent contained in this
Agreement. Each of Purchaser and Seller shall execute and deliver such
further instruments of conveyance and transfer and take such additional
action as any other Party may reasonably request to effect, consummate,
confirm, or evidence the consummation of the Transaction. Without limiting

any filings and give any notices required to be made or given by such Party in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
consummation of the Closing and the Transaction, (ii) use best efforts to
obtain any consent or authorization from any Governmental Authority required

 | -52-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

by such Party in connection with this Agreement, the consummation of the
Closing and the Transaction, and (iii) use best efforts to lift any restraint,
injunction or other legal bar to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the consummation of the Closing and the Transaction. Subject

Purchaser and Seller shall promptly deliver to the other a copy of each such
filing made, each such notice given and each such consent obtained during the
Pre-Closing Period.

  



  

(b) Purchaser shall use its best efforts to obtain the
authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of all Governmental Authorities
that may be or become necessary for the consummation of the Transaction, and
Seller will cooperate with Purchaser in promptly seeking to obtain all such
approvals. Purchaser shall (i) file, as promptly as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, all notices, reports and other documents required to
be filed with any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement,
the consummation of the Closing and the Transaction, and (ii) submit promptly
any additional information requested by any such Governmental Authority and
to cause to be taken, on a timely basis, all other actions necessary or
appropriate for the purpose of consummating the Closing and the Transaction,
and Seller will cooperate with Purchaser and provide information to Purchaser
as is reasonably necessary for Purchaser to accomplish the same. If required
by the HSR Act, each of Purchaser and Seller agrees to file or cause to be
filed any notifications and report forms (including any supporting materials
required under applicable Legal Requirements) with respect to the Transaction
required to filed under the HSR Act for the Transaction as soon as reasonably
practicable following the date hereof, but in all events no later than
September 15, 2016, and to submit all filings or notifications related to
other Antitrust Laws as soon as reasonably practicable following the date
hereof, and to supply promptly any additional information and documentary
material that may be subsequently requested by the relevant Governmental
Authority. Neither Purchaser nor Seller will take any action that will have
the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any required
approvals or expiration of required waiting periods. Purchaser shall pay, or
cause to be paid, the filing or any similar fees in connection with required
filings or notifications, if any, by any of the Parties under the HSR Act or
other Antitrust Laws.

  



  

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of
Purchaser contained in this Agreement, Purchaser shall use best efforts
to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission, U.S. Department of Justice or other regulatory body with
respect to the Transaction; _provided, however,_ that nothing in this _Section
6.3_ shall require Purchaser to divest, dispose, license or lease any of
Purchaser's or Seller's assets, businesses, product lines, licenses
or operations or take or agree to take any other action or agree to any
limitation or restriction on Purchaser or the Company.

  



  

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each
Party hereto agrees to reasonably cooperate with one another to the
extent permitted by Legal Requirement in (i) the receipt of any necessary
approvals and (ii) the resolution of any investigation or other inquiry of
any such Governmental Authority. Purchaser, in consultation with Seller,
shall take the lead in communicating with any Governmental Authority and
developing strategy for responding to any investigation or other inquiry by
any Governmental Authority under any applicable Antitrust Laws.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, except as prohibited by any
applicable Legal Requirement, and except where impracticable,

  



    

 | -53-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

each of Purchaser and Seller shall promptly notify the other of, and if in
writing, furnish the other with copies of (or, in the case of oral
communications, advise the other of) any substantive communications with any
Governmental Authority. Purchaser and Seller shall (i) consult with
the other prior to taking any substantive position with respect to the
filings under any applicable Antitrust Laws, shall permit the other to review
and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in
connection with, any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions and proposals to be submitted to any Governmental Authority with
respect to filings under any applicable Antitrust Laws, (ii) shall not
participate in any meeting or have any substantive communication with any such
Governmental Authority unless it has given the other an opportunity to
consult with it in advance and to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, shall give the other the opportunity to attend and
participate therein, and (iii) shall coordinate with the other in preparing
and exchanging such information and promptly provide the other (and its
counsel) with copies of all filings, material correspondence, presentations
or submissions (and a summary of any oral presentations) made by the Company
with any Governmental Authority under any applicable Antitrust Laws relating
to this Agreement or the Transaction. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 6.3(d)_ , competitively sensitive information will
be redacted from the drafts and final written communications to be shared
among the Parties and will be provided (on an unredacted basis) only to the
external legal counsel or external expert of the other and shall not be
shared by such counsel or expert with the other Party, _provided, however,_
 that information that is deemed commercially sensitive in relation to the
negotiations or positions of the Parties in relation to the transaction may
be redacted from the materials provided to the external legal counsel and
expert.

  



  

(e) Purchaser shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt
Commitment Letter (including any "flex" provisions contained in the Fee
Letter) or, if applicable, on other terms and conditions no less favorable to
the Purchaser than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including
any "flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter), which terms shall not in
any respect, and Purchaser shall not permit any amendment, modification or
supplement to be made to, or waive any provision or remedy under, the Debt
Commitment in any manner that may, expand on the conditions to the funding of
the Financing at the Closing, reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing
available to be funded on the Closing Date or otherwise adversely affect
Purchaser's ability to consummate the Closing and pay the Share
Consideration, including to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment
Letter, and (ii) enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter in the
event of a breach by the Financing Sources that materially impedes or delays,
or may materially impede or delay, the Closing, including by seeking specific
performance thereunder. Purchaser shall keep Seller reasonably informed on a
current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange
the Financing and upon written request shall provide to Seller copies of all
documents related to the Financing. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that
none of the Financing, any alternative financing or any syndication of the
Financing or Seller's compliance with _Section 6.3(f)_ is a condition to
Purchaser's obligations to consummate the Transaction or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt and purposes of clarity,

  



    

 | -54-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Purchaser covenants and agrees that it is obligated to consummate the Closing
regardless of whether the Financing or any syndication of the Financing is
funded or available.

  



  

(f) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective employees, agents and representatives (including independent
public accountants and attorneys) (with appropriate seniority and expertise)
to, cooperate with Purchaser to provide the following reasonable assistance
relating to the arrangement of the Financing:

  



  

(i) executing and delivering as of (but not before) the Closing
customary definitive financing documentation, including pledge and
security documents, guarantees, certificates, instruments and other matters
ancillary to the Financing of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and otherwise
facilitating the pledging of collateral (including providing reasonable and
customary information required in connection with the pledging and
identification of real property and intellectual property to the extent
specifically requested of the Company);

  



  

(ii) taking all customary corporate, limited liability company or
similar administrative or organizational actions as of (but not before)
the Closing reasonably necessary to permit the consummation of the Financing,
such as by having the board of directors, managers, members, or other
equivalent governing bodies of the Company and its Subsidiaries provide, and
causing the Company's and its Subsidiaries' respective Representatives to
provide, any resolutions, consents or approvals on behalf of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as may be required pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter at
or as of the Closing Date;

  



  

(iii) furnishing Purchaser and the Lenders such financial and other
pertinent information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as shall
be reasonably requested and prepared in the Ordinary Course of Business by
the Company and its Subsidiaries and supplementing any such information to
the extent that, to the Knowledge of Seller, any such information, when taken
as a whole, contains any material misstatement of material fact or omits to
state a material fact necessary to make such information, when taken as a
whole, not materially misleading;

  



  

(iv) furnishing Purchaser and the Lenders with information regarding
the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses, to the
extent reasonably available to the Company or its Subsidiaries, in
preparation of customary bank information documents, rating agency, lender
presentations and other customary marketing materials relating to the
arrangement of loans contemplated by the syndication of the Financing;

  



  

(v) assisting in the application for (i) public corporate/family
ratings for the borrower under the Financing and (ii) public ratings for
the Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, in each case, from
each of Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and SandP Global Ratings (but no
specific ratings shall be required in any case);

  



  

(vi) (i) cooperating with Purchaser's legal counsel in connection with
any legal opinions that may be required to be delivered in connection with
the Financing and (ii) furnishing any information reasonably requested by, and
cooperating with,

  



    

 | -55-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Purchaser or its advisors in connection with their preparation, updating and
supplementing of the quality of earnings report with respect to the Company
and its Subsidiaries;

  



  

(vii) obtaining customary assistance from the Company's accounting firm
with respect to financial information customarily derived from the financial
statements of the Company in financing transactions of this type and providing
the financial information requested by the Company's accounting firm to
enable it to provide such assistance;

  



  

(viii) arranging for delivery a reasonable time prior to Closing Date of
any required lien releases, each in customary form for transactions of this
nature and as necessary for the payoff, discharge and termination in full of
all financial debt (including intercompany debt) required to be paid and
released pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; and

  



  

(ix) taking actions reasonably requested by Purchaser necessary to
permit the Lenders to evaluate the Company's and its Subsidiaries' inventory,
current assets, cash management and accounting systems and the policies and
procedures relating thereto for the purpose of establishing collateral
arrangements (including in connection with conducting the commercial finance
examination and inventory appraisal contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter).

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing (A) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any fees or incur any liability in
connection with the Financing prior to the Closing except to the extent
subject to reimbursement or an indemnity right from Purchaser reasonably
satisfactory to Seller and Seller shall not be required to pay any fees or
incur any liability in connection with the Financing whatsoever, (B) the pre-
Closing Board of Directors of the Company and the directors, managers and
general partners of the Subsidiaries of the Company shall not be required to
adopt resolutions approving the agreements, documents and instruments pursuant
to which the Financing is funded which are not contingent upon the Closing or
that would be effective prior to the Closing, (C) none of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries shall be required to execute any definitive financing
documents, including any credit or other agreements, pledge or security
documents, or other certificates, legal opinions or documents in connection
with the Financing which are not contingent upon the Closing or that would be
effective prior to the Closing, and (D) none of Seller, the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be obligated to provide any cooperation or take any
action that may unreasonably interfere with (x) the operations of Seller, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (y) the other obligations of Seller
under this Agreement. Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Seller, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates,
officers, directors, employees and advisors for any Damages related to or
arising out of the Financing or any of the actions taken by any of the
foregoing pursuant to this _Section 6.3(f)_. Purchaser shall reimburse
Seller, the Company and its Subsidiaries for any out of pocket costs and
expenses incurred by any of them in connection with the consummation of the
Financing or any of the actions taken by the foregoing pursuant to this
_Section 6.3(f)_. In no event shall Seller's failure to comply with this
_Section 6.3(f)_ give rise to any remedy in favor of Purchaser except in the
event of Seller's material breach of this _Section 6.3(f)_. In no event
shall Seller be deemed to be in material breach of this  _Section 6.3(f)_
unless Purchaser has delivered written notice of any alleged failure of Seller
to comply with its obligations under this _Section 6.3(f)_ , which notice
shall describe in reasonable detail the nature of the breach, including the

  



    

 | -56-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

assistance requested by Purchaser and the date requested pursuant to this
_Section 6.3(f)_ , and Seller fails to comply with its obligations to use
commercially reasonable efforts under this _Section 6.3(f)_ with respect to
such request within fifteen (15) days following the delivery of such
notice; provided, however, that in no event may Purchaser deliver such a
notice less than fifteen (15) days prior to the Outside Closing Date.

  



  

6.4 _Tax Matters._

  



  

(a) _Straddle Period Tax Allocation_. Seller will cause the Company
to, unless prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements, close the
taxable period of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, as of the
close of business on the Closing Date. If applicable law does not permit the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to close its taxable year on the Closing
Date, or in any case in which a Tax is assessed with respect to a Straddle
Period, then for purposes of this Agreement (i) in the case of real property,
personal property and other Taxes not imposed on the basis of income or
receipts, such Taxes shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period
and the Post-Closing Tax Period based on a daily proration of such Taxes by
multiplying the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing Tax
Period or Post-Closing Tax Period, as the case requires, and the denominator
of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period and (ii) in
the case of all other Taxes, such Taxes shall be allocated between the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period based on an interim
closing of the books of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries as of the
close of the Closing Date , except that to the extent such Taxes are
attributable to extraordinary transaction(s) entered into by the Company or
its Subsidiaries after the Closing, such Taxes attributable to or arising
from the extraordinary transaction(s) will be allocated to the Post-
Closing Tax Period to the extent permitted by Treas. Reg.
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B).

  



  

(b) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Purchaser and Seller shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the
other Party, in connection with the filing of any Tax Return or amended Tax
Return filed by any of the Parties with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, and in connection with any audit, litigation or other Proceeding with
respect to Taxes involving a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the other Party's request) the provision of
records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and information relevant to any
such Tax Return, audit, litigation or other Proceeding within thirty (30)
calendar days of such Party's request therefor and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder within thirty (30) calendar
days of such Party's request therefor. Subject to compliance with _Section
6.4(l)_ , Purchaser agrees and, after the Closing will cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries, to (i) retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until one (1) year after
the expiration of the statute of limitations (and any extensions thereof) of
the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any taxing authority, (ii) give Seller reasonable
written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books
and records and, if Seller so requests, Purchaser shall allow Seller to take
possession of such books and records and (iii) maintain the ability to access
such books and records, including in the event that any

  



    

 | -57-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

member of the DK Group changes its accounting systems until sixty (60) days
after such statute of limitation expires and any extensions thereof.

  



  

(c) _Tax Returns_. 

  



  

(i) _Seller 's Obligations_. Seller shall include the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries to extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements
(including any deferred items triggered into income by Treas. Reg. 1.1502-13
and any excess loss account taken into income by Treas. Reg. 1.1502-19) on
the Consolidated Returns for the Pre-Closing Tax Period and Seller shall
prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all
Consolidated Returns that include the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and shall pay any and all Taxes due in
respect of such Consolidated Returns. Seller shall not deduct the Unpaid
Restructuring Costs or the Delayed Employee Costs on any Tax Return covering a
Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which
consent may be withheld in its sole discretion. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall prepare and timely file or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all other Tax Returns in respect of a Pre-Closing Tax Period relating
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are required to be filed on or
before the Closing Date, and shall pay any and all Taxes due in respect of
such Tax Returns. All Tax Returns described in this _Section 6.4(c)(i)_
 shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with past practices and
customs (unless otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements). No
later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing any such Tax
Return (including extensions thereof), Seller shall deliver such Tax Returns
(or, in the case of a Consolidated Return, the portion of such Consolidated
Return relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) to Purchaser for
its review, comment and approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The failure of Purchaser to
propose any changes to any such proposed Tax Return within fifteen (15) days
after having been provided with a draft of such Tax Return shall be deemed
approval thereof. Seller and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith mutually
to resolve any disagreements regarding such Tax Returns prior to the due
date for filing thereof; _provided, however,_ that if Seller and Purchaser
are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to such Tax Return prior to
its filing, such dispute shall be resolved by the Selected Accountant which
shall be binding on the parties.

  



  

(ii) _Purchaser 's Obligations_. Purchaser shall prepare and timely
file (or cause the Company to prepare and timely file) all Tax
Returns relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries that are required to be
filed after the Closing Date that are not described in _Section 6.4(c)(i)_.
To the extent any Taxes shown due on any such Tax Return relating to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period were not treated as a liability in the calculation of the
finally determined Working Capital (and the finally determined Cash
Consideration based thereon) and are indemnifiable by Seller pursuant to
_Section 9.2(c)_ , (A) such Tax Return shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with past practices and customs of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (unless otherwise required by applicable Legal
Requirements), and (B) no later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date
for filing such Tax Returns (including extensions thereof), Purchaser shall
deliver such Tax Returns (or, in the case of a Consolidated Return, the
portion of such Consolidated Return relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) to Seller for its review, comment and approval, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The failure of
Seller to propose any changes to any such proposed Tax Return within
fifteen (15) days after having been provided with a draft of such Tax Return
shall be deemed

  



    

 | -58-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

approval thereof. Not later than five (5) days prior to the filing date of
any such proposed Tax Return (including extensions thereof), Seller shall pay
to Purchaser an amount equal to that portion of the Taxes shown on such Tax
Returns for which Seller has an obligation to indemnify the
Purchaser pursuant to _Section 9.2_. Seller and Purchaser shall attempt in
good faith mutually to resolve any disagreements regarding such Tax Returns
prior to the due date for filing thereof; _provided, however,_ that if Seller
and Purchaser are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to such Tax
Return prior to its filing, such dispute shall be resolved by the
Selected Accountant which shall be binding on the parties. Nothing contained
in this _Section 6.4(c)(ii)_ shall in any manner terminate, limit or
adversely affect any right of Purchaser to receive indemnification pursuant to
any provision of this Agreement. Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for the
costs of preparing or amending any income Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period other than a Tax Return for a Straddle Period within ten (10) days
following Purchaser's written request for such reimbursement.

  



  

(d) _Tax Audits and Contests_.

  



  

(i) Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company, to promptly notify
Seller of any inquiries, claims, assessments, audits or similar events
with respect to Taxes relating to the Pre-Closing Tax Period for which Seller
may be liable under this Agreement (such inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or
similar event, a "Tax Contest"); _provided, however,_ that the failure of
Purchaser to promptly notify Seller of any such Tax Contest shall not forfeit
Purchaser's right to indemnity except to the extent that Seller is prejudiced
as a result of the failure or delay in giving such notice. Seller shall have
the authority to represent the interests of the Company and shall have
control of the defense, compromise or other resolution of any Tax
Contest relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, not involving any Straddle
Period; _provided, however_ , that Purchaser shall be entitled to participate
in such Tax Contest at its own expense and Seller shall not settle, compromise
and/or concede any portion of such Tax Contest that could reasonably be
expected to affect the Tax liability of the Company, its Subsidiaries or
Purchaser for any Post-Closing Tax Period or adversely affect the Tax
attributes of the Company or its Subsidiaries without the prior written
consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned.

  



  

(ii) Excluding Tax Contests involving unitary Tax Returns, Seller and
Purchaser jointly shall represent the interests of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in any Tax Contest relating to any Straddle Period for which
Seller could reasonably have an obligation to indemnify Purchaser.
Any disputes regarding the conduct or resolution of any such Tax Contest
shall be resolved by the Selected Accountant which shall be binding on the
parties and the all costs, fees and expenses paid to third parties in the
course of such proceeding shall be borne by the Seller and Purchaser in the
same ratio as the ratio in which, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
Seller and Purchaser would share the responsibility for payment of the Taxes
asserted by the Governmental Authority in such Tax Contest if such
Tax Contest were sustained in the Governmental Authority's favor in its
entirety. For Tax Contests involving unitary Tax Returns for any Straddle
Period, Seller shall have the authority to represent the interests of the
Company and shall have control of the defense, compromise or resolution;
_provided, however_ , that (A) Seller shall provide Purchaser with copies of
all correspondence, notices or other written materials received from any
Governmental Authority, and shall otherwise keep Purchaser and its advisors
advised of significant developments in the Tax Contest and of significant

  



    

 | -59-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

communications involving representatives of the Governmental Authority, and
(B) Seller shall not settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of such Tax
Contest that could reasonably be expected to affect the Tax liability of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or Purchaser for any Post-Closing Tax Period or
adversely affect the Tax attributes of the Company or its Subsidiaries without
the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  



  

(iii) Subject to the provisions of clauses (i) and (ii) of this
_Section 6.4(d)_ , Seller shall be entitled to control in all respects,
and Purchaser shall not be entitled to participate in, any Tax Contest with
respect to (x) any Tax Return of Seller or (y) any Tax Return of a
consolidated, combined or unitary group that includes the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries and any other member of the Seller Group; _provided, however_ ,
that Seller shall meaningfully consult with Purchaser relating to any such Tax
Contest that could reasonably be expected to affect the Tax liability of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or Purchaser for any Post-Closing Tax Period or
adversely affect the Tax attributes of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(iv) Purchaser shall have the sole right to represent the interests of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and shall have sole control of the
defense, compromise or other resolution of any Tax Contest relating to a
Post-Closing Tax Period.

  



  

(e) _Refunds and Tax Benefits_. Any Tax refund, credit or similar
benefit that are received by Purchaser, the Company or any of the Company's
Subsidiaries, and any amounts credited against Tax to which Purchaser, the
Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries become entitled, that relate to
the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries for Tax periods or
portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date (other than with
respect to deductions taken relating to the Unpaid Restructuring Costs and
the Delayed Employee Costs) shall be for the account of Seller, except to the
extent taken into account in Working Capital, as finally determined, and
Purchaser shall pay over to Seller any such refund or the amount of any such
credit for which Seller is entitled to, net of any adverse impact on the
Purchaser's, Company or its Subsidiaries' Tax position, within thirty (30)
days after receipt or entitlement thereto.

  



  

(f) _Post-Closing Actions Affecting Seller 's Tax Liability_.
Except as required by Legal Requirement, Purchaser shall not (and shall not
cause or permit any of its Affiliates, the Company or any of the Company's
Subsidiaries to) amend, re-file or otherwise modify any Tax Return relating
in whole or in part to the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or with respect to any Straddle
Period) without the prior written consent of Seller.

  



  

(g) _Termination of Existing Tax Sharing Agreements_. All
liabilities, obligations and other rights between any member of the Seller
Group, on the one hand, and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the
other hand, under any Tax Sharing Agreement in effect on or prior to the
Closing Date shall cease and terminate as of the Closing Date and the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall have no liability with respect to any Tax Sharing
Agreement following the Closing.

  



    

 | -60-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(h) _No NOL Carryback/Other Carrybacks Permitted_. Purchaser will
not cause or permit the Company to carry back to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
any net operating loss that is attributable to a Post-Closing Tax Period.
Purchaser will make a proper and timely election (or cause such proper and
timely election to be made) to relinquish the carryback of net operating
losses, if any, of the Company pursuant to either Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-21(b)(3)(ii)(B) or 1.1502-21T(b)(3)(ii)(C) or Section
172(b)(3) of the Code, or any similar or comparable provision under Legal
Requirement; _provided, however_ , that Seller shall immediately pay to
Purchaser any Tax refund (or reduction in Tax liability) resulting from a
carryback of a post-acquisition Tax attribute or Tax credit (other than a net
operating loss) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries into the Seller's
consolidated Tax Return, when such refund (or reduction) is realized by
Seller's consolidated group. At Purchaser's request to obtain such refund
(or reduction) pursuant to this _Section 6.4(h)_ , Seller will elect, in its
sole discretion, to either (i) cooperate with the Company and its
Subsidiaries in obtaining such refund (or reduction), including through the
filing of amended Tax Returns or refund claims; or (ii) pay Purchaser the
equivalent amount of such a refund or reduction, net of any adverse impact on
the Seller's Tax position. Purchaser agrees to indemnify Seller for any Taxes
resulting from the disallowance of such post-acquisition Tax attribute or Tax
Credit on audit or otherwise. The provisions of this _Section 6.4(h)_  shall
be inapplicable in the event that the Company, Seller and Purchaser make a
Section 338(h)(10) Election as provided in _Section 6.4(i)_.

  



  

(i) _Section 338(h)(10) Election_.

  



  

(i) At Purchaser's election, the Company and Seller shall join with
Purchaser in making a timely election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code
(and any corresponding election under state, local, and foreign law) with
respect to the purchase and sale of the Shares of the Company hereunder
(collectively, a "Section 338(h)(10) Election"). Purchaser shall
notify Seller of its intent to make the Section 338(h)(10) Election at least
five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Seller shall pay any Tax
attributable to the making of the Section 338(h)(10) Election. The Allocation
Schedule shall be prepared by Purchaser in accordance with the principles and
methodologies attached hereto as Appendix D and Purchaser shall deliver such
Allocation Schedule to Seller no later than one hundred twenty (120) days
prior to the IRS deadline for making a Section 338(h)(10) Election. If a
Section 338(h)(10) Election is made, Seller and Purchaser agree that the Share
Consideration and the liabilities of the Company (plus other relevant items)
shall be allocated among the assets of the Company for all purposes
(including Tax and financial accounting) as shown on the allocation schedule
(the "Allocation Schedule"). Purchaser, the Company and Seller shall file
all Tax Returns (including amended returns and claims for refund) and
information reports in a manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule.

  



  

(ii) Prior to the date hereof, the parties prepared the schedule
attached hereto as Appendix E ("Section 338(h)(10) Election Schedule")
setting forth the methodology to determine the additional consideration
necessary to cause Seller's after-Tax net proceeds from the sale of the
Shares of the Company with the Section 338(h)(10) Election to be equal to the
after-Tax net proceeds that Seller would have received had the Section
338(h)(10) Election not been made, taking into account all appropriate state,
federal and local income Tax implications, including any Tax on any such
additional consideration (i.e., on a "grossed-up"

  



    

 | -61-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

basis) (such additional consideration, the "Tax Adjustment"), which Section
338(h)(10) Election Schedule includes the estimated amount of the Tax
Adjustment based on such methodology. The amount set forth as "Closing Tax
Adjustment" on Appendix E is the amount of the Tax Adjustment that the
parties have agreed to use for purposes of the Estimated Cash Consideration
(the "Closing Tax Adjustment"). In the event a Section 338(h)(10) Election
is made, Seller shall provide Purchaser with a final version of the Section
338(h)(10) Election Schedule, including a final calculation of the Tax
Adjustment based on the methodology set forth in the Section 338(h)(10)
Election Schedule (the "Final Tax Adjustment"). The Final Tax Adjustment
shall be delivered to Purchaser together with and at the same time as the
portion of the Consolidated Return relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date is required
to be delivered by Seller to Purchaser under _Section 6.4(c)(i)_. Seller
shall provide Purchaser information necessary to verify and confirm the Final
Tax Adjustment. If within twenty (20) days after the receipt of the Final Tax
Adjustment, Purchaser notifies Seller in writing that Purchaser objects to
the calculation of the Final Tax Adjustment, Seller and Purchaser shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute; provided, however, that if
Seller and Purchaser are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to the
calculation of the Final Tax Adjustment within thirty (30) days of Purchaser's
objection to the calculation of the Final Tax Adjustment, such dispute shall
be resolved by the Selected Accountant. The fees and expenses of the
Selected Accountant shall be borne equally by Seller and Purchaser. In the
event that the Final Tax Adjustment exceeds the Closing Tax Adjustment,
Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold Seller harmless for the entirety of the
excess only if such excess is greater than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000)
and, in connection therewith, shall pay such entirety of such excess amount to
Seller within ten (10) days following the later of (A) the date on which
Seller pays the Final Tax Adjustment with its federal income Tax Return for
its taxable year that includes the Closing Date or (B) the resolution of the
matter by the Selected Accountant, if applicable. In the event that the
Final Tax Adjustment is less than the Closing Tax Adjustment, Seller agrees to
indemnify and hold Purchaser harmless for the entirety of such shortfall only
if such shortfall is in excess of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) and, in
connection therewith, shall pay such entirety of such shortfall amount to
Purchaser within ten (10) days following the later of (A) the date on which
Seller pays the Final Tax Adjustment with its federal income Tax Return for
its taxable year that includes the Closing Date or (B) the resolution of the
matter by the Selected Accountant, if applicable. In the event a Tax Contest
results in an increased or decreased Tax liability, the Final Tax Adjustment
shall be adjusted accordingly ("Post-Tax Contest Final Tax Adjustment"); and
for the avoidance of doubt, all interest, penalties and other additions to
Taxes shall be included in the determination of the Post-Tax Contest Final
Tax Adjustment. In the event the Post-Tax Contest Final Tax Adjustment
exceeds the Final Tax Adjustment, Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold
Seller harmless for the entirety of the excess only if such excess is
greater than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) and, in connection therewith,
shall pay such entirety of such excess amount to Seller within ten (10) days
following the date on which Seller pays the amount of the Post-Tax Contest
Final Tax Adjustment to the relevant Governmental Authority. In the event
the Final Tax Adjustment exceeds the Post-Tax Contest Final Tax Adjustment,
Seller agrees to indemnify and hold Purchaser harmless for the entirety of
the excess only if such excess is greater than One Million Dollars
($1,000,000) and, in connection therewith, shall pay such entirety of such
excess amount to Purchaser within ten (10) days following the date on which
Seller receives such amounts of the Post-Tax Contest Final Tax Adjustment from
the relevant Governmental Authority.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(j) _Elections to Reduce Potential for Loss Duplication_. Seller
agrees (i) to make an election under Treas. Reg. 1.1502-36(d)(6)(i) to reduce
the tax basis it has in its shares in the amount necessary to avoid reducing
the tax attributes of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) to not make
any other elections under Treas. Reg. 1.1502-36(d) without the prior written
consent of the Purchaser. Clause (i) of this _Section 6.4(j)_ shall be
inapplicable in the event that the Company, Seller and Purchaser make a
Section 338(h)(10) Election as provided in _Section 6.4(i)_.

  



  

(k) _DK Group Internal Debt Costs_. In the event the DK Group
Internal Debt is not completely settled by Seller prior to the fourth (4th)
Business Day prior to the Closing Date in accordance with _Section 6.12_ ,
Seller shall prepare a good faith estimate of the additional Taxes and
professional fees that Purchaser would incur, taking into account all
appropriate federal, state, local and foreign income Tax implications
(including withholding obligations), to fully settle such DK Group
Internal Debt in accordance with the then-current Step Plan (the "DK Group
Internal Debt Costs" and such estimate, the "Estimated DK Group Internal Debt
Costs," and the actual amount of the DK Group Internal Debt Costs, the "Final
DK Group Internal Debt Costs") and Seller shall inform Purchaser at least
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date of such Estimated DK Group
Internal Debt Costs. Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a schedule of the
Final DK Group Internal Debt Costs no later than twelve (12) months following
the Closing Date and Purchaser shall provide Seller all information necessary
to verify and confirm the Final DK Group Internal Debt Costs. If within
forty-five (45) days after the receipt of the Final DK Group Internal Debt
Costs, Seller notifies Purchaser in writing that Seller objects to the
calculation of the Final DK Group Internal Debt Costs, Seller and Purchaser
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute; _provided, however,_
that if Seller and Purchaser are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to
the calculation of the Final DK Group Internal Debt Costs within thirty (30)
days of receipt by Seller of the Final DK Group Internal Debt Costs, such
dispute shall be resolved by the Selected Accountant. The fees and expenses
of the Selected Accountant shall be borne equally by Seller and Purchaser.
In the event that the Final DK Group Internal Debt Costs exceeds the
Estimated DK Group Internal Debt Costs, Seller agrees to indemnify and hold
Purchaser harmless from such excess amount and, in connection therewith,
shall pay the entirety of such excess amount to Purchaser within ten (10) days
following the later of (A) the date on which Purchaser pays the DK Group
Internal Debt Costs and provides evidence of such payment to Seller or (B) the
resolution of the matter by the Selected Accountant, if applicable. In the
event that the Final DK Group Internal Debt Costs are less than the Estimated
DK Group Internal Debt Costs, Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold Seller
harmless from such shortfall and, in connection therewith, shall pay the
entirety of such shortfall amount to Seller within ten (10) days following the
later of (A) the date on which the Parties agree to the amount of the Final
DK Group Internal Debt Costs or (B) the resolution of the matter by the
Selected Accountant, if applicable.

  



  

(l) _Destruction of Tax Related Due Diligence Items_. Following
the Closing Date, and within twenty (20) days following a written request
made by Seller to Purchaser, Purchaser shall certify to Seller in writing that
Purchaser has destroyed all documents in its possession containing Tax
information that relates to Seller, or any of its Affiliates, including any
member of DK Group, and obtained in written or electronic form by

  



    

 | -63-|

Purchaser from Seller prior to the Closing through due diligence,
negotiations, and other parts of this transaction.

  



  

6.5 _Termination of Intercompany Arrangements; Transition
Services._

  



  

(a) Effective upon the consummation of the Closing, (i) the Parties
shall cause each agreement and contract between a member of the DK Group, on
the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than members of the
DK Group), on the other hand, to be terminated and (ii) the Company and its
Subsidiaries will be removed from any insurance policies held by Seller or any
of its Affiliates (other than members of the DK Group) under which members of
the DK Group are covered. 

  



  

(b) Seller agrees that, for a period of up to four (4) months from
the Closing Date (the "Transition Period"), it will, or will cause its
Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to the Company
and its Subsidiaries the services described on Appendix F (the "Transition
Services") to substantially the same extent such services were provided by
Seller or its Affiliates (other than members of the DK Group) prior to the
Closing Date and subject to any restrictions imposed by any applicable
contract or Legal Requirement. With respect to each Transition Service,
Purchaser shall take, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to
take, any and all actions, and make any and all preparations, to permit
the Company and its Subsidiaries to take full responsibility for such
Transition Service, without any further assistance from Seller or its
Affiliates, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing. Seller
or its Affiliates shall provide the Transition Services to the Company and
its Subsidiaries and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall pay customary
charges for such Transition Services (consistent with the charges customarily
made within the Seller Group) and shall reimburse Seller and its
Affiliates for all out-of-pocket costs incurred by Sellers and its Affiliates
in connection with the Transition Services without reimbursement or
indemnification of any kind by Seller.

  



  

(c) Neither the performance of the Transition Services, nor anything
else set forth in this Agreement, shall cause or be construed to cause any
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be considered an
employee of Seller, and Seller shall have no liability for any acts or
omissions of any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall have or exercise any control or
direction over any such employees during the Transition Period. Nothing
contained herein shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any
current or former employee of, or other Person who provides or has provided
services to, Seller, the Company or any of its or their Affiliates (or any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) with respect to the Transition Services
arrangement.

  



  

(d) Purchaser hereby releases Seller and its Affiliates, and their
respective employees, agents, officers and directors, from any and all
Damages arising from or in connection with the Transition Services, except to
the extent such Damages result from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of any such Person. Seller makes no warranty in connection with
the Transition Services and hereby disclaims any and all implied or statutory
warranties, including all implied warranties of title, merchantability,
noninfringement and fitness for a particular purpose regarding the Transition
Services.

  



    

 | -64-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) Except as specified in _Section 6.5(d)_ , notwithstanding any
other provision to the contrary contained herein, neither Purchaser nor any
of its Affiliates and their respective stockholders, partners, members,
officers, directors employees, controlling person, agents and representatives
shall have any rights or claims against Seller in connection with the
Transition Services, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise.

  



  

6.6 _Delivery of Financial Information_. Prior to the Closing,
Seller shall cause to be delivered to Purchaser: (i) the audited consolidated
financial statements of the Company (which shall include the Company and its
Subsidiaries and only the Company and its Subsidiaries), prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP and audited by Ernst and Young LLP or another
accounting firm of national standing selected by Seller that is registered
with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and reasonably acceptable
to Purchaser (the "Auditing Firm"), consisting of audited consolidated
balance sheets as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015 and audited
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss),
statements of cash flows and statements of stockholders' equity for each of
the fiscal years of the Company and its Subsidiaries ended December 31,
2013, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015 (collectively, the "DK Group
Audited Financial Statements"), and (ii) unaudited interim consolidated
financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP consisting of (A)
an unaudited interim consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of (I) the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter
(other than the fourth fiscal quarter of any fiscal year) of the Company and
its Subsidiaries that has been completed prior to the Closing Date and that
has ended at least 45 days before the Closing Date and (II) the last day of
the corresponding fiscal quarter of the 2015 fiscal year and (B) unaudited
interim consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss),
statements of cash flows and statements of stockholders' equity of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for (I) the most recent six or nine month, as
applicable, fiscal period (other than the fourth fiscal quarter of any fiscal
year) of the Company and its Subsidiaries that has been completed prior to
the Closing Date and that has ended at least 45 days before the Closing Date
and (II) the corresponding six or nine month, as applicable, fiscal period of
the 2015 fiscal year (collectively, the "DK Group Interim
Financial Statements"), in each case referred to in this sentence that
conform to, and are required to be filed by Purchaser pursuant to, the
applicable requirements of Regulation S-X ("Regulation S-X") under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). In addition, from the
date hereof and prior to the Closing, Seller shall provide such information,
or reasonable access thereto, with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser to permit Purchaser
to prepare or file pro forma financial information required by Legal
Requirement to be prepared or filed in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby. Seller also shall cooperate with Purchaser to provide
any additional information, or reasonably access thereto, requested by
Purchaser, in connection with Purchaser's analysis of the DK Group Audited
Financial Statements or DK Group Interim Financial Statements required to be
included in any reports or other filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in connection with the Transaction. Seller shall keep Purchaser
informed on a reasonably current basis (and at any time upon Purchaser's
reasonable request) in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
prepare the DK Group Audited Financial Statements and the DK Group Interim
Financial Statements and obtain the audit described in this _Section 6.6_.
All costs and expenses incurred by Seller, the Company and its Subsidiaries
in connection with this _Section 6.6_ shall be

  



    

 | -65-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

shared equally by Purchaser and Seller (i.e., 50/50); _provided, however,_
that Purchaser's obligation to share in the payment of such costs and expenses
shall not exceed $500,000. In no event shall Purchaser, prior to the
Closing, take any action, including filing an registration statement with the
SEC or seeking the effectiveness of any registration statement, that requires
Purchaser to file the DK Group Audited Financial Statements or DK Interim
Financial Statements prior to the Closing as a result of the execution of this
Agreement.

  



  

6.7 _No Solicitation of Other Bids._

  



  

(a) Seller shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its
Affiliates or any of its or their Representatives to, directly or
indirectly, (i) encourage, solicit, initiate, facilitate or continue
inquiries regarding an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter into discussions or
negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person concerning a
possible Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into any agreements or other
instruments (whether or not binding) regarding an Acquisition Proposal. Seller
shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and shall cause its
Affiliates and all of its and their Representatives to immediately cease and
cause to be terminated, all existing discussions or negotiations with any
Persons conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal. For purposes hereof, "Acquisition Proposal" means any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates) relating to the direct or indirect disposition, whether
by sale, merger or otherwise, of all or any portion of the DK Group or its
assets.

  



  

(b) Seller agrees that the rights and remedies for noncompliance
with this _Section 6.7_ shall include having such provision
specifically enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction, it being
acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach shall cause
irreparable injury to Purchaser and that money damages would not provide an
adequate remedy to Purchaser.

  



  

6.8 _Employee Matters._

  



  

(a) At the Purchaser's written request, the Company will terminate
the Company 401(k) Plan, effective no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date. Any such request must be made, if at
all, at least ten (10) Business Days before the Closing Date. The form and
substance of any documents (including any amendments, resolutions, employee
communications or otherwise) in connection with the termination of the
Company 401(k) Plan shall be subject to prior review and comment by Purchaser
and its counsel. If the Company 401(k) Plan is terminated before the Closing
pursuant to this _Section 6.8(a)_ , Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause a new or existing 401(k) plan of
Purchaser to accept any distribution from the Company 401(k) Plan as a
rollover contribution and the transfer of any promissory note representing an
outstanding participant loan, if so directed by a participant whose
employment continues with the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries following
the Closing.

  



  

(b) For the purposes hereof, all individuals who are employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing and
who thereupon become employees of the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries are
referred to herein as

  



    

 | -66-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

"Covered Employees." Purchaser shall provide or cause to be provided to each
Covered Employee: (i) for a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing
Date, a base salary that is not less than the Covered Employee's base salary
in effect immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) for the fiscal year in which
the Closing Date occurs, a target bonus opportunity, expressed as a percentage
of base salary, that is not less than the percentage target bonus opportunity
in effect for such Covered Employee for 2016 set forth in _Section 3.14_  of
the Disclosure Schedule, and (iii) for a period of six (6) months following
the Closing Date, severance protection on a basis and in an amount that is
not less favorable than the severance protection that would have been provided
in accordance with the Company's general severance policy as in effect on the
date of this Agreement. To the extent that any Covered Employee who
participates in a Company Employee Plan becomes eligible to participate in a
new or existing employee benefit plan, policy, program, arrangement or
agreement of Purchaser (a "Purchaser Employee Plan"), Purchaser shall
cause such Purchaser Employee Plan to take into account the Covered
Employee's credited service with the Company or a Subsidiary for eligibility
and vesting (but not benefit accrual) purposes to the same extent such service
was credited to such Covered Employee under a corresponding Company Employee
Plan immediately prior to the Closing. In addition, and without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, as of the Closing, Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide that (i) any waiting period
requirement for participation in a Purchaser Employee Plan by a Covered
Employee shall be waived if and to the extent that a similar waiting period
requirement under a corresponding Company Employee Plan was satisfied by such
Covered Employee as of the Closing Date, (ii) for purposes of each Purchaser
Employee Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or similar
benefits to any Covered Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such Purchaser Employee Plan shall be waived
for such Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents, if and to the
extent similar conditions and requirements had been waived under the Company
Employee Plan in which such Covered Employee, as applicable, participated or
was eligible to participate as of the Closing Date, and (iii) any eligible
expenses incurred by such a Covered Employee and his or her
covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Company
Employee Plan ending on the Closing shall be taken into account under a
corresponding Purchaser Employee Plan if and to the extent such eligible
expenses were incurred during the plan year of the Purchaser Employee Plan in
which the Closing occurs for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Covered
Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Purchaser Employee Plan.
Nothing in this Agreement shall vary the at-will nature of the employment of
a Covered Employee and nothing shall prevent Purchaser from terminating the
employment of a Covered Employee at any time after the Closing.

  



  

(c) Except as the Parties otherwise agree pursuant to _Section
6.5(b)_ , prior to the Closing Date, Seller and the Company will take
such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to ensure that the Company
and its Subsidiaries cease to be participating employers under any Company
Employee Plan that is sponsored by the Seller or any ERISA Affiliate (other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries).

  



  

6.9 _WARN Act_. Following Closing, Purchaser shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to comply with any and all applicable notice or
filing requirements under the

  



    

 | -67-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

WARN Act for any terminations, plant closings, or layoffs, or any other such
triggering events under the WARN Act occurring after the Closing Date.

  



  

6.10 _KYC_. At least four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Seller shall cause the Company to provide all documentation and
other information about the Company and each of its Subsidiaries as is
reasonably requested in writing by Purchaser at least nine (9) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date with respect to applicable "know your customer" and
anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act.

  



  

6.11 _LVMH Guaranties_. Subsequent to the Closing, Purchaser shall
use its commercially reasonable best efforts, which shall not require the
payment of money by Purchaser, to terminate the guaranties provided by Seller
or any of its Affiliates (other than members of the DK Group) for or on
behalf of the Company or any member of the DK Group set forth on _Section
3.12_ of the Disclosure Schedule ("LVMH Guaranties").

  



  

6.12 _Settlement of DK Group Internal Debt_. Seller shall, and
shall cause the Company to, use commercially reasonable best efforts to cause
the DK Group Internal Debt to be settled on or prior to the Closing Date, in
accordance with the step plan attached hereto as Appendix G, as it may be
amended by Seller prior to the Closing Date with the written approval of
Purchaser, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed (as so amended, the "Step Plan"). Seller shall promptly provide
Purchaser copies of any documentation entered into by Seller or any member of
the DK Group to effectuate the Step Plan. If Seller and the Company do not
complete the settlement of the DK Group Internal Debt prior to the
Closing, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to settle
the DK Group Internal Debt in accordance with the Step Plan as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Closing; _provided, however,_ that in the
event that Purchaser wishes to proceed with such completion of the settlement
of the DK Group Internal Debt in a manner inconsistent with the Step Plan,
Purchaser shall obtain the prior written approval of Seller to the proposed
changes to the Step Plan, such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed (and, for the avoidance of doubt, to the
extent the Step Plan is not impossible to consummate, Seller shall have the
right not to provide such approval in the event that the proposed changes to
the Step Plan may increase the cost of the settlement of the DK Group
Internal Debt unless Purchaser agrees to bear the increased cost of such
settlement).

  



  

6.14 _Lease Matters_. 

  



  

(a) Seller shall, and shall cause the Company to, use commercially
reasonable best efforts to obtain prior to the Closing the written
consent, effective as of the Closing, to the Transaction of the Lessor under
each of the Leases identified on Appendix H, and Seller shall provide
Purchaser with a copy of each written consent for Purchaser's review and
comment before execution.

  



  

(b) In the event that the Lessor under any Lease identified on
Appendix H requests the payment of additional rent or other amounts as a
condition to providing a written consent to the Transaction prior to Closing
and Seller desires, in its sole discretion, to accept such request, Seller
(or its applicable Affiliate that is not a member of the DK Group) may cause
the Company or its applicable Subsidiary to agree to such additional

  



    

 | -68-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

rent or other amounts (and to amend the applicable Lease accordingly) and, in
such event, Seller shall indemnify and hold Purchaser harmless with respect to
any such additional rent or other amounts agreed to with Lessor. In
addition, Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller in connection with its
efforts to obtain such consents prior to Closing.

  



  

(c) If the written consent of the Lessor under any Lease identified
on Appendix H is not obtained prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain such written consent after the
Closing and Purchaser shall keep Seller reasonably informed regarding the
status of discussions with such Lessors, including any terms or conditions
requested by any Lessor to provide such consent. If (i) the Lessor under any
such Lease refuses to provide its written consent or Purchaser does not agree
to Lessor's terms and conditions to provide such consent (and Seller does not
agree to indemnify Purchaser with respect to the additional cost to the
Company or its Subsidiaries of such terms and conditions), and (ii) Lessor
seeks Damages from a member of the DK Group as a result of the failure of the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries to obtain such consent, Seller shall
indemnify and hold Purchaser harmless with respect to any such Damages related
to such enforcement of the Lease and such matters shall be subject to the
procedures and other provisions set forth in _Section 9.6_ ; provided, that
Purchaser uses commercially reasonably efforts to reduce or limit such
Damages to the extent reasonably practicable.

  



  

(d) With respect to the Lease of the Conduit store, in the event
that the existing subtenant under the Lease fails to pay any amounts
required under the sublease or otherwise defaults under the sublease, Seller
agrees to indemnify and hold Purchaser harmless with respect to any amounts
paid by Purchaser or Damages to Purchaser in connection with such failure or
default, and in such event, Seller shall be subrogated to the rights of the
Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to the subtenant and Purchaser shall
cause the Company or its Subsidiaries to cooperate with Seller to recover
from the subtenant.

  



  

6.15 _Non-Solicitation_. From the date hereof to the date that is
six (6) months from and after the Closing (the "Restricted Period"),
without the prior written consent of Purchaser, Seller shall not, and shall
not permit any of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, hire or solicit
any employee of the DK Group employed by the DK Group at any time during the
Restricted Period or encourage any such employee to leave such employment or
hire any such employee who has left such employment, except pursuant to a
general solicitation which is not directed specifically to any such
employees; _provided, however,_ that nothing in this _Section 6.15_
shall prevent Seller or any of its Affiliates from hiring any such employee
whose employment has been terminated by the DK Group or Purchaser after the
Closing. Seller acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach of this
_Section 6.15_ would give rise to irreparable harm to Purchaser, for which
monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, and hereby agrees that in
the event of a breach or a threatened breach by Seller of any such
obligations, Purchaser shall, in addition to any and all other rights and
remedies that may be available to it in respect of such breach, be entitled to
seek equitable relief, including a temporary restraining order, an
injunction, specific performance and any other relief that may be available
from a court of competent jurisdiction (without any requirement to post
bond). Seller acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this _Section
6.15 _ are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of
Purchaser and constitute a material inducement to Purchaser to enter into
this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

7. _ _Conditions to the Closing__.

  



  

7.1 _Conditions to Obligations of Each Party_. Subject to the
limitations in _Section 7.4_ , the respective obligations of each Party to
this Agreement to consummate the Transaction and the other transactions

Requirements):

  



  

(a) _No Injunctions or Restraints; Illegality_. No temporary
restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order issued

and the Transaction, that makes such Transaction illegal.

  



  

(b) _Antitrust Laws Compliance_. Any waiting period (and any
extension thereof) under the HSR Act, and filings and notifications related
to other Antitrust Laws, applicable to the Transaction shall have expired or
been terminated or, if applicable, any required material approvals of any

obtained.

Subject to the limitations in _Section 7.4_ , the obligations of Purchaser to
consummate the Closing shall be subject to:

2017, the DK Group Audited Financial Statements, the DK Group
Interim Financial Statements and an unqualified audit opinion on the DK Group
Audited Financial Statements by the Auditing Firm, all in accordance with
_Section 6.6_ ; _provided, however_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, the
inclusion of any explanatory language in the Auditing Firm's audit opinion as
contemplated by paragraph 11 of the PCAOB's AS (Auditing Standard) 3101,
Reports on Audited Financial Statements, shall not cause such opinion to be a
qualified audit opinion;

  



  

(b) the satisfaction (or waiver in writing by Purchaser) at or prior
to the Closing of the condition that the representations and warranties of
Seller in this Agreement shall be true and correct as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing Date, with the same effect as though made as
of the Closing Date ( _provided, however,_ that the accuracy of
representations and warranties that by their terms speak as of a specified
date will be determined as of such date), in each case, in all respects except
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect; _provided,_

  

 _ _

    

 | -70-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

 _ _

  

 _however,_ that notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this _Section
7.2(b)_ , the Fundamental Representations of Seller shall be true and correct
in all respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date,
except for _de minimis_ inaccuracies in such Fundamental Representations; and

  



  

(c) Seller shall be prepared to deliver, and shall deliver at or
prior to Closing, all documents and other closing deliverables required to be
delivered by, and shall take all actions required to be taken by, Seller
pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_.

  



  

7.3 _Additional Condition to the Obligations of Seller_. Subject
to the limitations in _Section 7.4_ , the obligation of Seller to consummate
the Closing shall be subject to the satisfaction (or waiver in writing by
Seller) at or prior to the Closing of the conditions that:

  



  

(a) at the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver to the Company an amount
__ sufficient to enable the Company and the other members of the DK Group to
pay off all Financial Debt (including LVMH Intercompany Debt but not the items
listed on Appendix B) as of the Closing Date;

  



  

(b) the satisfaction (or waiver in writing by Seller) at or prior to
the Closing of the condition that the representations and warranties of
Purchaser in this Agreement shall be true and correct as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing Date, with the same effect as though made as
of the Closing Date ( _provided, however,_ that the accuracy of
representations and warranties that by their terms speak as of a specified
date will be determined as of such date), in each case, in all respects except
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect; _provided, however,_  that
notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this _Section 7.3(b)_ , the
Fundamental Representations of Purchaser shall be true and correct in all
respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date, except
for _de minimis_ inaccuracies in such Fundamental Representations; and

  



  

(c) Purchaser shall be prepared to deliver, and shall deliver at or
prior to Closing, all documents and other closing deliverables required to be
delivered by, and shall take all actions required to be taken by, Purchaser
pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_.

  



  

7.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. No Party may rely on the
failure of any condition set forth in _Sections 7.1_ , _7.2_  or _7.3_ to be
satisfied as a reason to delay or cancel the Closing if such failure was
caused by such Party's failure to act in good faith or to use its best
efforts to satisfy such condition as required by the provisions of this
Agreement, including  _Section 6.3_. The condition in _Section 7.3_ shall
be deemed to be waived by Seller to the extent that any such condition fails
to be satisfied as a result of any action taken or omitted to be taken by
Seller. The condition in _Section 7.2_ shall be deemed to be waived by
Purchaser to the extent that any such condition fails to be satisfied as a
result of any action taken or omitted to be taken by Purchaser.

  



    

 | -71-|

8. _ _Termination__.

  



  

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing (with respect to _Sections 8.1(b)_ , by notice from the
terminating Party to the other Party setting forth a brief description of the
basis for termination) only (and in no other circumstance):

  



  

(a) by the mutual written consent of Purchaser and Seller; or

  



  

(b) by Purchaser or Seller if the Closing shall not have been
consummated by February 1, 2017 (the "Outside Closing Date");  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
8.1(b)_ shall not be available to any Party whose failure to comply with or
perform in any material respect any covenant under this Agreement has been the
cause of or resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such
date.

  



  

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section 8.1_ , this Agreement shall be of no
further force or effect, and there shall be no liability on the part of
Purchaser, Seller, any Financing Source or their respective officers,
directors or stockholders, except to the extent that such liability results
from any prior breach by a Party of any of its covenants or agreements;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions of _Section 10_ and the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and survive
any termination of this Agreement.

  



  

9. _ _Indemnification__.

  



  

9.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. All
representations and warranties made by Seller and Purchaser in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing for a period beginning on the Closing
Date and ending on the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date
(the "Release Date"), at which time such representations and warranties shall
expire and terminate and be of no further force and effect (the date of
expiration of any representation or warranty in this Agreement being a
"Representation Termination Date"); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the

(giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof). All covenants
and agreements of the Parties contained herein shall survive the Closing
indefinitely or for the period explicitly specified therein. No action
for or based on a breach of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement shall be brought after the expiration of the Representation
Termination Date of such representation or warranty, except for claims of
which the Indemnitor has received an Indemnification Claim Notice prior to
the expiration of the applicable Representation Termination Date, in which
case such claim asserted in such notice shall survive such applicable
Representation Termination Date, until such time as such claim is fully and
finally resolved as provided by this Agreement. It is the express intent of
the Parties

  



    

 | -72-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

that, if the applicable Representation Termination Date for an item as
contemplated by this _Section 9.1_ is shorter than the statute of limitations
that would otherwise have been applicable to such item, then, by contract,
the applicable statute of limitations with respect to such item shall
be reduced to the shortened survival period contemplated by this Agreement.
The Parties further acknowledge that the time periods set forth in this
_Section 9.1_ for the assertion of claims under this Agreement are the result
of arms'-length negotiation among the Parties and that they intend for the
time periods to be enforced as agreed by the Parties. Following the delivery
of an Indemnification Claim Notice, the Parties shall give, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates and Representatives to provide the other Party
reasonable access to such documents and information as may be reasonably
requested for the purposes of resolving any disputes or responding to any
matters or inquiries raised in such Indemnification Claim Notice.

  



  

9.2 _Indemnification by Seller_. Subject to the limitations set
forth in this _Section 9.2_ and _Section 9.4_ , from and after the Closing
Date, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold Purchaser and its successors in
interest and assigns (each of the foregoing being referred to individually as
an "Indemnified Person" and collectively as "Indemnified Persons") harmless
from and against all Damages suffered or incurred by such Indemnified Person
(regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to any Third-Party Claim)
resulting from or arising out of any one or more of the following:

  



  

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of
Seller set forth in _Section 3_ of this Agreement;

  



  

(b) the breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement of
Seller made pursuant to this Agreement;

  



  

(c) except to the extent treated as a liability in the calculation
of the finally determined Working Capital (and the finally determined
Cash Consideration based thereon) (i) any and all Taxes imposed on the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to (x) all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods of the Company or of its Subsidiaries ending on or prior to December
31, 2015 or (y) all Pre-Closing Tax Periods of the Company or of its
Subsidiaries ending on or after January 1, 2016 (for the avoidance of doubt,
which are in excess of the Tax accruals set forth as a liability on the
Measurement Date Balance Sheet Statement and included in the calculation of
the finally determined Working Capital, computed in accordance with the
Accounting Principles consistent with past practices and methods), (ii) all
Taxes of any consolidated, affiliated, combined, unitary or similar group of
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or was a member on or prior
to the Closing Date (without duplication of any Taxes indemnified under
_Section 9.2(c)(i)_ ) that are imposed on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a result of having been a member of any such group (including
Taxes for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may be liable pursuant
to Treasury Regulation §1.1502-6 or any comparable provision of foreign,
state, or local law) and any Taxes resulting from the Company or its
Subsidiaries ceasing to be a member of any such group (for the avoidance of
doubt, including as a result of any Subsidiary of the DK Group ceasing to be a
member of the "UK group relief"), (iii) any and all Taxes of any person
imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or for which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries may otherwise be liable, as a transferee or
successor by contract or by operation of any law, rule or regulation, which
Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring before the Closing, (iv) any
and all Taxes related to

  



    

 | -73-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

or arising from the Section 338(h)(10) Election as provided under _Section
6.4(i)(i)_ (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not affect Seller's right
to receive the Final Tax Adjustment (or, as applicable, the Post-Tax Contest
Final Tax Adjustment but only to the extent the amount of the Post-Tax
Contest Final Tax Adjustment exceeds the amount for which Purchaser may seek
indemnification under this clause (iv) of  _Section 9.2(c)_ by reason of
Seller's failure to pay all Taxes related to or arising from the Section
338(h)(10) Election as provided under _Section 6.4(i)(i)_ ) as part of the
Share Consideration); and (v) any and all Taxes imposed on the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries in a Post-Closing Tax Period arising from or with respect
to the termination, repayment or unwinding of any DK Group Internal Debt
and/or LVMH Intercompany Debt, including Taxes arising from the termination,
repayment or unwinding of any (1) DK Group Internal Debt in connection with
the repayment of all LVMH Intercompany Debt at Closing and (2) internal
DK Group debt incurred or arising on or after the Closing in connection with
the repayment of the DK Group Internal Debt as provided in _Section 6.12_
above or the repayment of all the LVMH Intercompany Debt at Closing; and

  



  

(d) any of the matters described on Appendix I (the "Indemnified
Liabilities").

  



  

9.3 _Indemnification by Purchaser_. From and after the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold Seller and its successors in
interest and assigns (each of the foregoing being referred to individually
also as an "Indemnified Person" and collectively also as "Indemnified
Persons") harmless from and against all Damages suffered or incurred by such
Indemnified Person (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to any
Third-Party Claim) resulting from or arising out of any one or more of the
following:

  



  

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of
Purchaser set forth in _Section 4_ of this Agreement;

  



  

(b) the breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement of
Purchaser made pursuant to this Agreement; and

  



  

(c) any claims against LVMH Guaranties, to the extent paid by the
applicable guarantor, and related to matters arising after the Closing.

  



  

9.4 _Limitations of Liability._

  



  

(a) _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, the
right of the Indemnified Persons to be indemnified pursuant to this _Section
9_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to all Damages which
such Indemnified Persons have now or may have in the future regarding this
Agreement or the Transaction, including any Damages attributable to any
inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty, or any failure to
perform the covenants, agreements or undertakings contained in
this Agreement, any disclosure schedule or certificate delivered pursuant
hereto or any agreement or other document contemplated hereby, except for (x)
claims for injunctive relief or specific performance or (y) claims based on
fraud. Except as provided in clauses (x) and (y) above, from and after the
Closing, no Indemnified Person may commence any Proceeding against any other
Party hereto or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to the
subject matter of this

  



    

 | -74-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Agreement or the Transaction, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, except
to enforce such Party's express rights under this _Section 9_. The provisions
of this _Section 9_ were specifically bargained for and reflected in the
amounts payable to Seller in connection with the Transaction under _Section
2_.

  



  

(b) _ _De Minimis__ _Claims_. The Indemnified Parties shall not be
entitled to recover under _Section 9.2(a)_  or _Section 9.3(a)_ on any
individual claim (or series of related claims arising from the same facts or
circumstances) unless the Damages associated with such claim (or series of
related claims arising from the same facts or circumstances) exceeds
$20,000 in the aggregate. For the avoidance of doubt, any individual claim
(or series of related claims arising from the same facts or circumstances)
under _Section 9.2(a)_ or _Section 9.3(a)_ that does not have Damages in
excess of $20,000 in the aggregate shall not count toward the calculation of
the Basket. Additionally, the Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
recover under _Section 9.2(a)_ or _Section 9.3(a)_ for any Damages arising
out of or caused by the negotiation (including activities relating to due
diligence), execution, delivery or public announcement or the pendency of
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein.

  



  

(c) _Basket and Cap_. The Indemnified Parties shall not be
entitled to recover under _Section 9.2(a)_ or _Section 9.3(a)_  (i) until the
total amount which the Indemnified Parties would otherwise recover under
_Section 9.2(a)_ or _Section 9.3(a)_ , as applicable, exceeds (without taking
into account the Basket referenced in this _Section 9.4(c)_ ) on a cumulative
basis one percent (1%) of the Share Consideration (the "Basket") and, in such
event, Seller shall be required to pay the amount of all such Damages in
excess of the Basket and (ii) for Damages in excess of twenty percent (20%)
of the Share Consideration (the "Cap"); _provided_ , that the Basket and Cap
limitation shall not apply to (i) Damages arising out of the inaccuracy of
any Fundamental Representation and (ii) Damages arising out of or related
to fraud.

  



  

(d) _Taxes_. The limitations on indemnification set forth in
_Section 9.4(b)_ and _Section 9.4(c)_ shall not apply to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ for breaches of the
representations and warranties with respect to Taxes set forth in
_Section 3.18_.

  



  

(e) _Calculation of Damages_. For purposes of determining the
extent of and limitations on indemnification under this _Section 9_  or
otherwise in this Agreement or any other agreement entered into in connection
with this Agreement, the amount of any Damages that may be subject to
indemnification hereunder will be determined net of any Loss Tax Benefit and
net of the sum of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Person
under insurance policies with respect to such Damages, net of costs of
collection and any other costs incidental thereto, such as increased premiums
(it being understood and agreed that the Indemnified Parties shall have no
obligation to seek coverage of any Damages under any insurance policy) and net
of any reserves for the applicable Damages, and/or any other reserves that
are no longer required, contained in the Company Financial Statements. 

  



  

(f) _Reliance_. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that,
in entering into this Agreement, such Party (i) has relied only upon its own
investigation and analysis and the representations and warranties of the
Parties expressly set forth in this

  



    

 | -75-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Agreement and (ii) has not relied upon, and specifically disclaims, any
statement, covenant, representation or warranty not contained herein.

  



  

(g) _No Double Recovery_. Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, (i) no Indemnified Person shall be entitled
to indemnification under any provision of this Agreement or any other
agreement entered into in connection with this Agreement for any Damages to
the extent such Indemnified Person has been indemnified or otherwise
compensated for such Damages (including by receipt of any insurance proceeds
or through the Working Capital, Net Financial Debt, Unpaid Restructuring
Costs or the DK Group Internal Debt Costs) pursuant to this Agreement and
(ii) any item with respect to which a Person is entitled to indemnification
under this Agreement or any other agreement entered into in connection with
this Agreement shall not be included in Working Capital, Net Financial Debt,
Unpaid Restructuring Costs or DK Group Internal Debt Costs.

  



  

9.5 _Indemnification Claim Procedures._

  



  

(a) An Indemnitor shall be obligated to indemnify an Indemnified
Person pursuant to the terms of this _Section 9_ upon receipt from such
Indemnified Person of a written notice meeting the requirements set forth
below in this _Section 9.5_ (a notice meeting such requirements is referred
to as an "Indemnification Claim Notice"). An Indemnification Claim Notice
shall (i) state that an Indemnified Person has paid, incurred, suffered or
sustained Damages, (ii) specify in reasonable detail the individual items of
such Damages, the date each such item was paid, incurred, suffered or
sustained, and, the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or
covenant to which such item is related and (iii) set forth the amount of the
Damages incurred or reasonably be expected to be incurred by an Indemnified
Person as a result of such breach (the "Claimed Damages").

  



  

(b) If the Indemnitor shall not object in writing within the 90-day
period after receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice (the
"Objection Period") by delivery of a written notice of objection (an
"Objection Notice"), such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable
acknowledgment by such Indemnitor that the Indemnified Person is entitled to
the full amount of the claim for Damages set forth in such Indemnification
Claim Notice, subject to the limitations of this _Section 9_.

  



  

(c) In the event that the Indemnitor shall deliver an Objection
Notice in accordance with this _Section 9.5_ , the Indemnitor and the
Indemnified Person shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the
respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Indemnitor
and the Indemnified Person should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and the
indemnification claim should be resolved accordingly.

  



  

(d) If Indemnitor and the Indemnified Person fail to reach an
agreement before the expiration of the Objection Period, then the
Indemnified Person may elect to pursue any and all remedies available under
Legal Requirements to enforce the provisions of this Agreement and to obtain
payment of such Damages.

9.6 _Defense of Third-Party Claims._

  



  

(a) Any Indemnified Person making a claim for indemnification under
this _Section 9_ shall notify the indemnifying party (an "Indemnitor") of any
claim against such Indemnified Person (or, in the case Purchaser is the
Indemnified Person, against a member of the DK Group with respect to which
Purchaser is making a claim for indemnification under this _Section 9_ ) by a
third-party, whether or not involving a Proceeding ("Third-Party Claim") in
writing promptly after receiving notice of such claim (if by a third-party),
describing the claim, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the
basis thereof; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the failure to so notify an
Indemnitor shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder
except to the extent that (and only to the extent that) the Indemnitor has
been prejudiced thereby. Any Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in
the defense of such action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim
giving rise to an Indemnified Person's claim for indemnification at such
Indemnitor's expense, and at its option (subject to the limitations set forth
below) shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof. The Indemnitor will
not be liable to the Indemnified Person for legal or other expenses incurred
by the Indemnified Person in connection with such defense (other than as
provided in (b) below), and the Indemnified Person shall, to the best of its
ability, assist the Indemnitor, at the expense of the Indemnitor, in the
defense of such claim, and shall promptly send to the Indemnitor, at the
expense of the Indemnitor, copies of any documents received by the
Indemnified Person which relate to such claims; and _provided further_ , that:

  



  

(b) the Indemnified Person shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; 
_provided_ that the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne
by the Indemnified Person, except that the Indemnitor shall pay all of the
fees and expenses of such separate counsel if the Indemnified Person has been
advised in writing by counsel reasonably acceptable to Indemnitor, with a
copy to the Indemnitor (to the extent it would not waive Indemnified
Person's attorney client privilege), that a reasonable likelihood exists of a
conflict of interest between the Indemnitor and the Indemnified Person);

  



  

(c) the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to assume control of such
defense (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Indemnified Person) and
shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Person
if (i) the claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection with
any criminal or quasi criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or
investigation; (ii) the claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against
the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person has been advised in
writing by counsel reasonably acceptable to Indemnitor, with a copy to the
Indemnitor, that a reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of interest
between the Indemnitor and the Indemnified Person; or (iv) upon petition by
the Indemnified Person, the appropriate court or arbitrator rules that the
Indemnitor failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such claim;

  



  

(d) if the Indemnitor shall control the defense of any such claim,
the Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Person before entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing
to defend such claim if, pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or
cessation, (i) injunctive or other equitable relief will be imposed against
the Indemnified Person, (ii) the Indemnified Person is not expressly and
unconditionally released from all liabilities and obligations with respect to
such claim, without prejudice, or (iii) such

  



    

 | -77-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

settlement requires any admission of wrongdoing or attributes Liability to
the Indemnified Person; and

  



  

(e) if the Indemnitor is not entitled to assume control of a Third-
Party Claim pursuant to this Section, the Indemnified Person shall obtain the
prior written consent of Indemnitor before entering into any settlement of a
claim or ceasing to defend such claim if, pursuant to or as a result of such
settlement or cessation, (i) injunctive or other equitable relief will be
imposed against the Indemnitor, or (ii) such settlement requires any
admission of wrongdoing or attributes Liability to the Indemnitor.

  



  

9.7 _Miscellaneous_. Any amounts paid in satisfaction of
indemnification claims under _Section 9_ or other provisions of this Agreement
or any other agreement entered into in connection with this Agreement, shall
be treated as adjustments to the Share Consideration for Tax purposes and
such agreed treatment will govern for purposes of this Agreement, unless
otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements.

demand, claim, or other communication required or permitted hereunder to the
intended recipient at the address set forth above using any other means
(including personal delivery, messenger service, facsimile transmission,
ordinary mail or electronic mail); _provided, however_ , that no such notice,

Any Party may change the address to which notices, requests, demands, claims,
and other communications required or permitted hereunder are to be
delivered by giving the other Parties notice in the manner herein set forth.

  



  

10.2 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (any of which may be delivered by facsimile or other electronic
transmission), all of

  



    

 | -79-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that all
Parties need not sign the same counterpart.

  



  

10.3 _Entire Agreement; Nonassignability; Parties in Interest_.
This Agreement and the documents and instruments delivered pursuant hereto,
including the exhibits hereto, the Disclosure Schedule and the other schedules
hereto: (a) together constitute the entire agreement and understanding among
the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof, except for the
Confidentiality Agreement and (b) are not intended to confer upon any other
person any rights or remedies hereunder, except as provided in the final
sentence of this _Section 10.3_. None of the Parties hereto shall be
permitted to assign this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations
hereunder (by operation of law or otherwise) without the written consent of
each of the Parties hereto, provided that, after the Closing Date, the
Purchaser's rights hereunder may be pledged as collateral for the Financing.
The Financing Sources shall be express third party beneficiaries of _Section
10.8_ (Governing Law; Court of Competent Jurisdiction) and _Section 10.13_
(Exculpation).

  



  

10.4 _Severability_. In the event that any term or other provision
of this Agreement, or the application thereof becomes, or is declared by any
rule of law, under public policy or by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement, and the
application of such provision to other persons or circumstances other than
those as to which it is determined to be illegal, void or unenforceable, will
not be impaired or otherwise affected and will continue in full force and
effect and be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Legal
Requirement.

  



  

10.5 _Expenses_. Other than as set forth in this Agreement, the
Parties agree that all fees and expenses incurred by them arising in whole or

incurring such fees and expenses, including, all fees of counsel
and accountants, and such fees and expenses shall not be borne by the
Company.

  



  

10.6 _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur and that the Parties would not have
any adequate remedy at law in the event any provision of this Agreement was
not performed in accordance with the specific terms hereof or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties hereto shall be entitled
(in addition to any other remedies available to them) to specific performance
of the terms of this Agreement (which may include an order compelling a
Party's counterparty hereto to close the Transaction) and injunctive relief
(without bond or other security being required and without the necessity of
proving the inadequacy of money damages) to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity.

10.7 _Confidential Arbitration._

  



  

(a) Subject to _Section 10.6_ above, any claims or disputes arising
out of, relating to, or in connection with this Agreement will be finally
settled by arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International
Chamber of Commerce in force at the date of the request for arbitration (the
"ICC Rules"), including the rules thereof pertaining to the production of
documents and other information, except as they may be modified herein
(including in _Section 10.7(c)_ below) or by mutual agreement of the
parties. The seat of the arbitration will be New York, New York, and it will
be conducted in the English language. To the extent feasible, multiple
claims shall be consolidated in a single proceeding. It is the intention of
the parties that all proceedings initiated pursuant to this _Section 10.7_ be
conducted as expeditiously as reasonably possible. Each party hereto
understands that by entering into this Agreement, it is waiving any right it
may have to file a lawsuit or other civil action or proceeding relating to
this Agreement, and that it is waiving any right that it may have to resolve
disputes through trial by jury.

  



  

(b) For purposes of this _Section 10.7_ , where Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates and Seller or any of its Affiliates are each parties to an
arbitration, Purchaser and its Affiliates will be deemed to be one party and
Seller and its Affiliates will be deemed to be one party.

  



  

(c) A party seeking arbitration (the "Claimant") will nominate an
arbitrator in the request for arbitration and statement of claim (the
"Request for Arbitration"), subject to confirmation by the International Court
of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC Court") or
Secretary General of the International Chamber of Commerce (the "Secretary
General"), as provided in the ICC Rules. After filing the Request
for Arbitration is complete pursuant to the ICC Rules, the Claimant will
serve the Request for Arbitration upon the Claimant. Within ten (10)
Business Days of receipt of the filed Request for Arbitration, the party
against whom the claim is made (the "Respondent") will file and serve the
Answer to the Request for Arbitration and notify the Claimant and the ICC
Court of an arbitrator that it nominates, subject to confirmation as provided
in the ICC Rules. Upon confirmation by the ICC Court or the
Secretary General of the two arbitrators nominated by the parties, such two
arbitrators will select a third arbitrator, who, once confirmed, shall serve
as chairman of the arbitral panel; the nomination of the third arbitrator
shall be made within ten (10) Business Days of the confirmation of the
arbitrators nominated by the parties. If the arbitrators nominated by the
Claimant and the Respondent cannot agree on a third arbitrator within such
time period, then the ICC Court will appoint the third arbitrator, who shall
serve as chairman of the arbitral panel. By whomever appointed, the three
arbitrators will act as the sole arbitrators in the arbitral proceeding. The
parties specifically agree that, as to any proceeding initiated pursuant to
this _Section 10.7_: (i) the arbitrators will be empowered to award and
order equitable or injunctive relief with respect to matters brought before
them; (ii) any taking of evidence that may be required shall be handled
expeditiously, and all disputes regarding the taking of evidence shall be
resolved by the arbitrators within ten (10) Business Days, or as soon
thereafter as practicable. It is the intent of the parties that barring
extraordinary circumstances or unavailability of members of the arbitral
panel, (i) a hearing on the merits of all claims for which arbitration is
sought by either party shall be commenced not later than ninety (90)
days from the date the ICC arbitration panel conducts the initial case
management conference, following issuance of the arbitral panel's "Terms of
Reference," in

  



    

 | -81-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

accordance with the ICC Rules, and (ii) the arbitral panel will submit a
written draft Award to the ICC Court for its review, which shall reveal the
essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, within thirty
(30) days after the conclusion of such hearing. Failure to adhere to these
time limits shall not be a basis for challenging the award or challenging the
arbitral tribunal's jurisdiction. With respect to any arbitration proceeding
arising under this Agreement, the parties further agree that with respect to
any discovery in such proceeding: (i) the arbitrators will not be empowered
to provide for any requests for documents beyond one (1) set of requests by
each party for the production of documents by the other party, which requests
shall be submitted within five (5) Business Days of Respondent's submission
of its Answer to the Request for Arbitration; and (ii) each party will be
limited to one deposition, with the Seller entitled to take a single
deposition of one (1) corporate representative of the Purchaser and the
Purchaser entitled to take a single deposition of one (1) corporate
representative of the Seller, such corporate representative depositions to be
consistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(6). The award will be
final and binding and non-appealable, and judgment thereon may be entered by
any Court of Competent Jurisdiction.

  



  

(d) The parties agree that each of them shall bear all of their own
fees, costs and expenses in connection with any arbitral proceeding initiated
pursuant to this _Section 10.7_ , including but not limited to attorneys'

 _GUARANTY OF PAYMENT AND PERFORMANCE_

  



  

THIS GUARANTY OF PAYMENT AND PERFORMANCE (this "Guaranty") is executed and
delivered this _____________, 2016 by LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE
("Guarantor"). All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have
the same meaning as given to such term in the Purchase Agreement (as defined
below).

  



  

1\. _THE GUARANTY_.

  

 _ _

  

1.1 _Guarantor 's Agreement_. Guarantor unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees to G-III Apparel Group, Ltd., a Delaware corporation
("Purchaser") to pay in full and perform when due the Obligations (as
hereinafter defined). This Guaranty is absolute, independent and
continuing under all circumstances, and is a guaranty of payment and
performance, not of collection. Guarantor hereby acknowledges that
Purchaser has given sufficient consideration for this Guaranty by entering
into that certain Stock Purchase Agreement dated of even date herewith (the
"Purchase Agreement") with LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Seller"), and agreeing to purchase all of the issued and
outstanding shares of Donna Karan International, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the "Transaction"), and to otherwise perform its obligations thereunder.

  



  

1.2 _Obligations_. For all purposes of this Guaranty, the term
"Obligations" shall mean: all monetary and performance obligations of Seller
to Purchaser of any kind whatsoever, howsoever created, arising or evidenced,
under the Purchase Agreement and the agreements and the letters ancillary
thereto, including, without limitation, the obligation to pay any
indemnification obligations of Seller thereunder.

  



  

1.3 _Continuing Guaranty_. This Guaranty shall in all respects be
a continuing guaranty, remaining in full force and effect until all of the
following have occurred: (i) all of the Obligations have been satisfied in
full, and (ii) all of the obligations of Guarantor hereunder have been
satisfied in full. No notice of discontinuance or revocation shall affect any
of the obligations of Guarantor hereunder or of Seller under any of the
Obligations.

  



  

2. _COVENANTS, CONDITIONS AND AGREEMENTS_. Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees with Purchaser as follows:

  



  

2.1 _Certain Events Not Affecting Obligations of Guarantor_. The
obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by any of the
following: (i) the release or discharge of Seller in any creditors',
receivership, bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, or other proceedings;
(ii) the rejection or disaffirmance in any such proceeding of any of the
Obligations; or (iii) the impairment or modification of any of the
Obligations, or of any remedy for the enforcement thereof, or of the estate of
Seller in bankruptcy, resulting from any present or future federal or state
bankruptcy law or any other law of any kind or from the decision or order of
any court or other governmental authority.

  



  

2.2 _Waivers by Guarantor_. Guarantor hereby expressly waives each
of the following: (i) notice of the acceptance by Purchaser of this Guaranty,
notice of the existence, creation or non-payment of any of the Obligations,
presentment, demand, notice __

  

 _ _

    



 



    



  

of dishonor, protest, notice of protest, and all other notices except any
specifically required by this Guaranty or required by law; (ii) any obligation
Purchaser may have to disclose to Guarantor any facts Purchaser now or
hereafter may know or have reasonably available to it regarding Seller or the
financial condition of Seller, whether or not Purchaser has a reasonable
opportunity to communicate such facts or has reason to believe that any such
facts are unknown to Guarantor or materially increase the risk to Guarantor
beyond the risk Guarantor intends to assume hereunder; (iii) all diligence in
collection of any of the Obligations, any obligation hereunder, or any
guaranty or other security for any of the foregoing; (iv) the benefit of all
appraisement, valuation, marshaling, forbearance, stay,
extension, redemption, homestead, exemption and moratorium laws now or
hereafter in effect; (v) any defense based on the incapacity, lack of
authority, death or disability of any other person or entity or the failure of
Purchaser to file or enforce a claim against the estate of any person or
entity in any administrative, bankruptcy or other proceeding; (vi) any defense
based on an election of remedies by Purchaser, whether or not such election
may affect in any way the recourse, subrogation or other rights of
Guarantor against Seller or any other person in connection with the
Obligations; and (vii) any rights arising because of Guarantor's payment or
performance of any of the Obligations against Seller, by way of subrogation of
the rights of Purchaser or otherwise; provided, that at such time, if ever,
as the Obligations are paid and performed in full, the waiver set forth in
this Section 3.3(vii) shall be of no further force or effect.

  



  

To induce Purchaser to enter into the Purchase Agreement,
Guarantor represents and warrants that this Guaranty constitutes Guarantor's
valid and legally binding agreement in accordance with its terms and that the
execution, delivery and performance of this Guaranty have been duly authorized
by any necessary action and will not violate any Legal Requirement applicable
to Guarantor.

Obligations, and notwithstanding such assignment or transfer, such Obligations
shall remain Obligations for purposes of this Guaranty. Each immediate and
successive assignee or transferee of any interest in any of the Obligations

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

3.8 _Confidential Arbitration_.

  



  

(a) Any claims or disputes arising out of, relating to, or in
connection with this Guaranty will be finally settled by arbitration
under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in
force at the date of the request for arbitration (the "ICC Rules"), including
the rules thereof pertaining to the production of documents and other
information, except as they may be modified herein (including in _Section
3.8(b)_ below) or by mutual agreement of the parties. The seat of the
arbitration will be New York, New York, and it will be conducted in the
English language. To the extent feasible, multiple claims shall be
consolidated in a single proceeding. It is the intention of the parties that
all proceedings initiated pursuant to this _Section 3.8_ be conducted as
expeditiously as reasonably possible. Each of Guarantor and Purchaser
understands that by making or accepting this Guaranty, it is waiving any right
it may have to file a lawsuit or other civil action or proceeding relating to
this Guaranty, and that it is waiving any right that it may have to resolve
disputes through trial by jury.

  



  

(b) A party seeking arbitration (the "Claimant") will nominate an
arbitrator in the request for arbitration and statement of claim (the
"Request for Arbitration"), subject to confirmation by the International Court
of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC Court") or
Secretary General of the International Chamber of Commerce (the "Secretary
General"), as provided in the ICC Rules. After filing the Request
for Arbitration is complete pursuant to the ICC Rules, the Claimant will
serve the Request for Arbitration upon the other party. Within ten (10)
Business Days of receipt of the filed Request for Arbitration, the party
against whom the claim is made (the "Respondent") will file and serve the
Answer to the Request for Arbitration and notify the Claimant and the ICC
Court of an arbitrator that it nominates, subject to confirmation as provided
in the ICC Rules. Upon confirmation by the ICC Court or the
Secretary General of the two arbitrators nominated by the parties, such two
arbitrators will select a third arbitrator, who, once confirmed, shall serve
as chairman of the arbitral panel; the nomination of the third arbitrator
shall be made within ten (10) Business Days of the confirmation of the
arbitrators nominated by the parties. If the arbitrators nominated by the
Claimant and the Respondent cannot agree on a third arbitrator within such
time period, then the ICC Court will appoint the third arbitrator, who shall
serve as chairman of the arbitral panel. By whomever appointed, the three
arbitrators will act as the sole arbitrators in the arbitral proceeding. The
parties specifically agree that, as to any proceeding initiated pursuant to
this _Section 3.8_ : (i) the arbitrators will be empowered to award and
order equitable or injunctive relief with respect to matters brought before
them; (ii) any taking of evidence that may be required shall be handled
expeditiously, and all disputes regarding the taking of evidence shall be
resolved by the arbitrators within ten (10) Business Days, or as soon
thereafter as practicable. It is the intent of the parties that barring
extraordinary circumstances or unavailability of members of the arbitral
panel, (i) a hearing on the merits of all claims for which arbitration is
sought by either party shall be commenced not later than ninety (90) days
from the date the ICC arbitration panel conducts the initial case management
conference, following issuance of the arbitral panel's "Terms of Reference,"
in accordance with the ICC Rules, and (ii) the arbitral panel will submit a
written draft award to the ICC Court for its review, which shall reveal the
essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, within thirty
(30) days after the conclusion of such hearing. Failure to adhere to these
time limits shall not be a basis for challenging the award or challenging the

  



    

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

arbitral tribunal's jurisdiction. With respect to any arbitration proceeding
arising under this Guaranty, the parties further agree that with respect to
any discovery in such proceeding: (i) the arbitrators will not be empowered
to provide for any requests for documents beyond one (1) set of requests by
each party for the production of documents by the other party, which requests
shall be submitted within five (5) Business Days of Respondent's submission
of its Answer to the Request for Arbitration; and (ii) each party will be
limited to one deposition, with Guarantor entitled to take a single
deposition of one (1) corporate representative of Purchaser and
Purchaser entitled to take a single deposition of one (1) corporate
representative of Guarantor, such corporate representative depositions to be
consistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(6). The award will be
final and binding and non-appealable, and judgment thereon may be entered by
any Court of Competent Jurisdiction.

  



  

(c) The parties agree that each of them shall bear all of their own
fees, costs and expenses in connection with any arbitral proceeding initiated
pursuant to this _Section 3.8_ , including but not limited to attorneys' fees.
The cost of the three arbitrators shall be shared equally by the Claimant and
the Respondent.

  



  

(d) Arbitration pursuant to this _Section 3.8_ shall be the
exclusive method available for resolution of claims, disputes and
controversies described in this _Section 3.8_ , and the parties stipulate
that the provisions hereof shall be a complete defense to any suit, action,
or proceeding in any court or before any administrative or arbitration
tribunal with respect to any such claim, controversy or dispute.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding the terms of this _Section 3.8_ , each party
acknowledges and agrees that the other parties may be damaged irreparably if
this Guaranty is not performed in accordance with its terms or otherwise is
breached, and that, at any time before and after a demand notice is
presented, the parties shall be free to apply to any Court of Competent
Jurisdiction for interim or conservatory measures (including temporary
conservatory injunctions), in each case to prevent breaches of this Guaranty,
and to enforce specifically this Guaranty and its terms. The parties
acknowledge and agree that any such action by a party shall not be deemed
to be a breach of such party's obligation to arbitrate all disputes under
this _Section 3.8_ or infringe upon the powers of any arbitral panel.

  



  

(f) The parties shall keep confidential, and not disclose the fact
that there is a dispute between the parties, the details of the dispute, the
fact of the arbitration and all details relating to the proceeding, except as
required by Legal Requirement and consistent with the parties' right to
limited judicial review of the arbitrator's award. All statements,
documents, claims, demands, transcripts, evidence, discovery materials or
communications, whether oral, written, electronic or in any other form, that
are submitted or prepared by any party in connection with an arbitration
proceeding initiated pursuant to this _Section 3.8_ shall be Confidential
Information for the purposes of the Purchase Agreement.

  

 _ _

  

3.9 _Governing Law; Court of Competent Jurisdiction_. This Guaranty
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State
of New York without regard to applicable principles of choice or conflicts of
law that would cause application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any
proceeding initiated pursuant to _Section 3.8_ above shall incorporate
the substantive laws of the State of New York, except

  

 _ _

    

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

as modified by the terms of _Section 3.8_. Guarantor and Purchaser agree that
any permissible action arising out of or relating to this Guaranty, including
but not limited to an action for injunctive or provisional relief or in
connection with an arbitral award or proceeding, shall be brought
exclusively in a state or federal court of competent subject matter
jurisdiction located in the State of New York, New York County (a "Court of
Competent Jurisdiction"), irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction of
any such court, and waive any objection to the venue of such court and any
argument that such court is an inconvenient forum.

  

 _ _

  

3.10 _No Third Party Beneficiary_. This Guaranty is made for the
sole benefit of Guarantor and Purchaser, and no other person shall be deemed
to have any privity of contract hereunder nor any right to rely hereon to any
extent or for any purpose whatsoever, nor shall any other person have any
right of action of any kind hereon or be deemed to be a third party
beneficiary hereunder.

  



  

3.11 _Interpretation; Headings_. The terms "herein," "hereof,"
"hereunder" and any other similar terms used herein shall be deemed to refer
to this Guaranty in its entirety. The headings contained in this Guaranty are
inserted only for reference as a matter of convenience and in no way define,
limit, or describe the scope or intent of this Guaranty, and will not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Guaranty.

  

 _ _

  

3.12 _Amendments; Waiver_. No amendment or waiver of any provision
of this Guaranty shall be valid and binding unless it is in writing
and signed, in the case of an amendment, by Guarantor and Purchaser, or in
the case of a waiver, by the party against which the waiver is to be
effective. No failure to exercise or delay in exercising by Purchaser of any
right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege preclude
any other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other right or
remedy provided by law. No consent or waiver, expressed or implied, by
Purchaser to or of any breach or default by Guarantor in the performance of
its obligations hereunder shall be deemed or construed to be a consent or
waiver to or of any other breach or default in the performance of the same or
any other obligations of Guarantor hereunder.

  

 _ _

  

3.13 _Severability_. Any provision of this Guaranty which is
unenforceable or invalid or contrary to law, or the inclusion of which would
adversely affect the validity, legality or enforcement of this Guaranty,
shall be of no effect and, in such case, all the remaining terms and
provisions of this Guaranty shall subsist and be fully effective according to
the tenor of this Guaranty the same as though any such invalid portion had
never been included herein. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the
contrary, if any provisions of this Guaranty or the application thereof are
held invalid or unenforceable only as to particular situations, the remainder
of this Guaranty, and the application of such provision to situations other
than those to which it shall have been held invalid or unenforceable, shall
not be affected thereby, but shall continue valid and enforceable to the
fullest extent permitted by law.

  

 _ _

  

3.14 _Cumulative Rights and Obligations_. All rights and remedies of
Purchaser and all obligations of Guarantor under this Guaranty
are cumulative. In

6.1 _Failure to Pay_. The Borrower fails to pay (a) any principal
amount of the Loan when due or (b) interest or any other amount when due and
such failure continues for five (5) Business Days after the due date thereof.

6.3 _Breach of Covenants_. The Borrower fails to observe or
perform in any material respect any covenant, obligation, condition or
agreement contained in this Note or the Security Agreement that is not
qualified as to materiality, or fails to observe or perform in any respect
any other covenant, obligation, condition or agreement contained in this Note,
the Purchase Agreement or the Security Agreement that is qualified as to
materiality, in each case, other than those specified in _Section 6.1_ hereof
and such failure continues for thirty (30) days after written notice by the
Noteholder to the Borrower.

  



  

6.4 _Cross-Acceleration_. The Borrower shall default under any
mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which
there is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the
Borrower or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Borrower (other
than Indebtedness owed to any subsidiary of the Borrower), whether such
Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the date hereof, if
both:

  



  

(a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such
Indebtedness at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any
applicable grace periods) or relates to an obligation other than the
obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated final
maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing
such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated final maturity; and

  



  

(b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal
amount of any other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal
at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace
periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates $[
].0 million or more at any one time outstanding.

8. _ _Indemnification__. The Borrower shall and hereby does indemnify the Noteholder against any and all losses and expenses (including attorneys' reasonable fees and costs), and shall pay to the Holder on demand the amount of all such losses and expenses, that the Noteholder sustains or incurs, whether directly or indirectly, as a consequence of the occurrence of any event or condition that entitles or would, with the passage of time, giving of notice, or both, entitle the Noteholder to accelerate the indebtedness of the Borrower due under this Note. Any loss or expense due and owing to the Noteholder pursuant to the terms and provisions of this _Section 8_ shall bear interest at the Default Rate from and after the date that is ten (10) Business Days after demand is made to the indemnifying party for payment of such loss or expense and continuing through the date on which all such losses, expenses and interest are paid in full.

9.6 _Confidential Arbitration_. 

  



  

(a) Any claims or disputes arising out of, relating to, or in
connection with this Note will be finally settled by arbitration under
the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in force at
the date of the request for arbitration (the "ICC Rules"), including the
rules thereof pertaining to the production of documents and other information,
except as they may be modified herein (including in _Section 9.6(a)_ below)
or by mutual agreement of the Parties. The seat of the arbitration will be
New York, New York, and it will be conducted in the English language. To the
extent feasible, multiple claims shall be consolidated in a single
proceeding. It is the intention of the Parties that all
proceedings initiated pursuant to this _Section 9.6_ be conducted as
expeditiously as reasonably possible. Each Party understands that by making
or accepting this Note, it is waiving any right it may have to file a lawsuit
or other civil action or proceeding relating to this Note, and that it is
waiving any right that it may have to resolve disputes through trial by jury.

  



  

(b) A Party seeking arbitration (the "Claimant") will nominate an
arbitrator in the request for arbitration and statement of claim (the
"Request for Arbitration"), subject to confirmation by the International Court
of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC Court") or
Secretary General of the International Chamber of Commerce (the "Secretary
General"), as provided in the ICC Rules. After filing the Request
for Arbitration is complete pursuant to the ICC Rules, the Claimant will
serve the Request for Arbitration upon the other Party. Within ten (10)
Business Days of receipt of the filed Request for Arbitration, the Party
against whom the claim is made (the "Respondent") will file and serve the
Answer to the Request for Arbitration and notify the Claimant and the ICC
Court of an arbitrator that it nominates, subject to confirmation as provided
in the ICC Rules. Upon confirmation by the ICC Court or the
Secretary General of the two arbitrators nominated by the Parties, such two
arbitrators will select a third arbitrator, who, once confirmed, shall serve
as chairman of the arbitral panel; the nomination of the third arbitrator
shall be made within ten (10) Business Days of the confirmation of the
arbitrators nominated by the Parties. If the arbitrators nominated by the
Claimant and the Respondent cannot agree on a third arbitrator within such
time period, then the ICC Court will appoint the third arbitrator, who shall
serve as chairman of the arbitral panel. By whomever appointed, the three
arbitrators will act as the sole arbitrators in the arbitral proceeding. The
Parties specifically agree that, as to any proceeding initiated pursuant to
this _Section 9.6_ : (i) the arbitrators will be empowered to award and order
equitable or injunctive relief with respect to matters brought before them;
(ii) any taking of evidence that may be required shall be handled
expeditiously, and all disputes

  



    

 | 6| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

regarding the taking of evidence shall be resolved by the arbitrators within
ten (10) Business Days, or as soon thereafter as practicable. It is the
intent of the Parties that barring extraordinary circumstances or
unavailability of members of the arbitral panel, (i) a hearing on the merits
of all claims for which arbitration is sought by either Party shall be
commenced not later than ninety (90) days from the date the ICC arbitration
panel conducts the initial case management conference, following issuance of
the arbitral panel's "Terms of Reference," in accordance with the ICC Rules,
and (ii) the arbitral panel will submit a written draft award to the
ICC Court for its review, which shall reveal the essential findings and
conclusions on which the award is based, within thirty (30) days after the
conclusion of such hearing. Failure to adhere to these time limits shall not
be a basis for challenging the award or challenging the arbitral tribunal's
jurisdiction. With respect to any arbitration proceeding arising under this
Note, the Parties further agree that with respect to any discovery in such
proceeding: (i) the arbitrators will not be empowered to provide for any
requests for documents beyond one (1) set of requests by each Party for the
production of documents by the other Party, which requests shall be submitted
within five (5) Business Days of Respondent's submission of its Answer to the
Request for Arbitration; and (ii) each Party will be limited to one
deposition, with the Noteholder entitled to take a single deposition of one
(1) corporate representative of the Borrower and the Borrower entitled to take
a single deposition of one (1) corporate representative of the Noteholder,
such corporate representative depositions to be consistent with Federal Rule
of Civil Procedure 30(b)(6). The award will be final and binding and non-
appealable, and judgment thereon may be entered by any Court of Competent
Jurisdiction.

  



  

(c) The Parties agree that each of them shall bear all of their own
fees, costs and expenses in connection with any arbitral proceeding initiated
pursuant to this _Section 9.6_ , including but not limited to attorneys' fees.
The cost of the three arbitrators shall be shared equally by the Claimant and
the Respondent.

  



  

(d) Arbitration pursuant to this _Section 9.6_ shall be the
exclusive method available for resolution of claims, disputes and
controversies described in this _Section 9.6_, and the Parties stipulate
that the provisions hereof shall be a complete defense to any suit, action,
or proceeding in any court or before any administrative or arbitration
tribunal with respect to any such claim, controversy or dispute.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding the terms of this _Section 9.6_ , each Party
acknowledges and agrees that the other Parties may be damaged irreparably if
this Note is not performed in accordance with its terms or otherwise is
breached, and that, at any time before and after a demand notice is
presented, the Parties shall be free to apply to any Court of Competent
Jurisdiction for interim or conservatory measures (including temporary
conservatory injunctions), in each case to prevent breaches of this Note, and
to enforce specifically this Note and its terms. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that any such action by a Party shall not be deemed to be a breach of
such Party's obligation to arbitrate all disputes under this _Section 9.6_ or
infringe upon the powers of any arbitral panel.

  



  

(f) The Parties shall keep confidential, and not disclose the fact
that there is a dispute between the Parties, the details of the dispute, the
fact of the arbitration and all details relating to the proceeding, except as
required by Legal Requirement and consistent with the Parties' right to
limited judicial review of the arbitrator's award. All statements,

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

documents, claims, demands, transcripts, evidence, discovery materials or
communications, whether oral, written, electronic or in any other form, that

shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State
of New York. Any proceeding initiated pursuant to  _Section 9.6_ above shall
incorporate the substantive laws of the State of New York, except as modified
by the terms of _Section 9.6_. The Parties agree that any permissible action
arising out of or relating to this Note, including but not limited to an
action for injunctive or provisional relief or in connection with an arbitral
award or proceeding, shall be brought exclusively in a state or federal court
of competent subject matter jurisdiction located in the State of New York, New
York County (a "Court of Competent Jurisdiction"), irrevocably submit to the
personal jurisdiction of any such court, and waive any objection to the venue
of such court and any argument that such court is an inconvenient forum.

  



  

9.8 _No Third Party Beneficiary_. This Note is made for the sole
benefit of the Parties, and no other Person shall be deemed to have any
privity of contract hereunder nor any right to rely hereon to any extent or
for any purpose whatsoever, nor shall any other Person have any right of
action of any kind hereon or be deemed to be a third party beneficiary
hereunder.

respect to an offering by the Company of any equity securities for its own
account (other than a registration statement (A) on Form S-4, Form S-8 or any

 | -3-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

give each Holder written notice of such filing at least ten (10) Business
Days' prior to the anticipated filing date (the "Piggyback Notice").
The Piggyback Notice shall offer the Holders the opportunity to include in
such registration statement the number of Registrable Securities as they may
request (a "Piggyback Registration"); _provided, however_ , that such number
of Registrable Securities multiplied by the VWAP (as defined in the Stock

Piggyback Registration all Registrable Securities with respect to which the
Company has received a written request from the Holders for inclusion therein
within five (5) Business Days after notice has been given to the Holders.

  



  

(b) If any of the securities to be registered pursuant to the
Registration Statement giving rise to the Holders' rights under this 
_Section 2.1_ are to be sold in an underwritten offering, then each Holder
shall be permitted to include all Registrable Securities requested to be
included in such Registration Statement in such offering on the same terms and
conditions as the securities of the Company or its security holders included
therein; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such offering involves a
firm commitment underwritten offering and the managing underwriter of such
underwritten offering advises the Company in writing that it is the managing
underwriter's good faith opinion that the total number or dollar amount of
Registrable Securities proposed to be sold by the Holders in such offering,
together with all Other Securities that the Company and any other Persons
having rights to participate in such registration intend to include in such
offering, exceeds the total number or dollar amount of such securities that
can be sold without having an adverse effect on the price, timing or
distribution of such Registrable Securities to be so included together with
all such Other Securities, then there shall be included in such firm
commitment underwritten offering the number or dollar amount of such
Registrable Securities and such Other Securities that in the opinion of such
managing underwriter can be sold without so adversely affecting such
offering; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the number
of Registrable Securities proposed to be sold by the Holders in such offering
be reduced unless all Other Securities that are not entitled to registration
rights pari passu with those of the Holders (other than securities to be sold
by the Company) are first entirely excluded from such offering.

  



  

(c) The Company shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any
registration initiated by it under this _Section 2.1_ prior to the
effectiveness of the related Registration Statement and shall have no
obligation to register any Registrable Securities in connection with such
registration, except to the extent provided herein. Each Holder shall have the
right to withdraw its request for inclusion of its Registrable Securities in
any Piggyback Registration by giving written notice to the Company of its
request to withdraw at least two (2) Business Days prior to the planned
effective date of the related Registration Statement. The Registration
Expenses of any such withdrawn Piggyback Registration shall be borne by the
Company in accordance with _Section 2.2_.

of securities that may be registered in a particular Piggyback
Registration, the Company may reduce the number of securities to be
registered in such Piggyback Registration to such number of securities
as allowed by the SEC.

Statement continuously effective until all Registrable Securities included in
such Registration Statement have actually been sold, which Registration
Statement shall comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the applicable form and include or incorporate by reference
all financial statements required by the SEC to be filed therewith or
incorporated therein and upon the occurrence of any event that would cause the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus contained therein (A) to contain a
material misstatement or omission or (B) not to be effective and usable for
resale of Registrable Securities, the Company shall file promptly an
appropriate amendment to the Registration Statement, a supplement to the
Prospectus or a report filed with the SEC pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14
or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, in the case of clause (A), correcting any such
misstatement or omission, and, in the case of either clause (A) or (B), the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such amendment to
be declared or deemed effective and the Registration Statement and the
related Prospectus to become usable for their intended purposes as soon as
practicable thereafter.

  



  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Company may delay filing or suspend the effectiveness of a Registration
Statement and the

  



    

 | -5-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Investor's right to sell thereunder (each such period, a "Suspension Period")
if (A) the Company is pursuing a material acquisition, merger,
reorganization, disposition or similar transaction and the Board of Directors
of the Company determines in good faith that the Company's ability to pursue
or consummate such a transaction would be materially adversely affected by any
required disclosure of such transaction in the registration statement, or (B)
the Company has experienced some other material non-public event the
disclosure of which at such time could reasonably be expected to materially
adversely affect the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Suspension
Period shall exceed ninety (90) consecutive days and all such Suspension
Periods shall not exceed one hundred eighty (180) days in the aggregate in
any twelve (12) month period; _provided_ , _further_ , that no Suspension
Period may be implemented under this _Section 2.3(a)(ii)_ unless the same or

directors and officers and all other holders of registration rights granted by
the Company.

  



  

(iii) Prepare and file with the SEC such supplements, amendments and
post-effective amendments to each Registration Statement as may be

instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Company for such
Registration Statement or by the Securities Act or by any other rules and
regulations thereunder for registrations; respond as promptly as reasonably
possible to any comments received from the SEC with respect to such
Registration Statement, or any amendment, post-effective amendment or

all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to it with
respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement in accordance with the intended method or methods of
distribution by the selling Holders thereof.

  



  

(iv) Advise each Holder and Legal Counsel promptly (which notice
pursuant to clauses (B) through (D) below shall be accompanied by an
instruction to suspend the use of the Prospectus until the Company shall have
remedied the basis for such suspension and shall include the steps the
Company intends to remedy such basis and the Company shall promptly thereafter
notify the Holder of such remediation):

  



  

(A) when the Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or post-
effective amendment is proposed to be or has been filed, and, with respect to
the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto, when the
same has become effective;

  



  

(B) of any request by the SEC or any other Governmental Authority
received by the Company for amendments to the Registration Statement or
amendments or supplements to the Prospectus or for additional information
relating thereto;

required, or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such
purpose; or

  



  

(E) of the existence of any fact or the happening of any event,
during the pendency of a distribution of Registrable Securities pursuant to a
Registration Statement, that makes any statement of a material fact made in
such Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any amendment or supplement
thereto, or any document incorporated by reference therein untrue, or that
requires the making of any additions to or changes in the Registration
Statement or the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein not
misleading; _provided_ ,  _however_ , the Company shall not be required to
disclose confidential information to any Holders or their Legal Counsel (i)
unless and until a mutually acceptable confidentiality agreement is in place
with the Holders, and/or (ii) if such information is subject to attorney-
client privilege, if such disclosure would result in loss of attorney-client
privilege, unless such Holders sign a reasonable joint defense agreement.

  



  

(v) Unless any Registrable Securities shall be in book-entry form

Securities to be in such denominations and registered in such names as the
Holder may request at least two (2) Business Days before any sale of
Registrable Securities.

  



  

(vi) Use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly register or
qualify any Registrable Securities under such other securities or blue sky
laws of such jurisdictions within the United States as the Holder reasonably
requests and which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable the
Holder to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Registrable
Securities owned by the Holder, keep such registrations or qualifications in
effect for so long as the applicable Registration Statement is required
to remain in effect and do any and all other acts and things which may be
reasonably necessary or advisable to enable the Holder to consummate the

Holder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company will not be required to (A)

otherwise be required to qualify but for this Agreement, (B) subject itself

United States as may be necessary to enable the Holder to consummate the
disposition of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended
methods of disposition set forth in such Registration Statement.

expenses in connection with satisfying its obligation under this _Section
2.3(a)(viii)_.

  



  

(ix) In connection with an underwritten offering, enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form, scope and substance, and take all
such other actions reasonably requested by the Holder or by the managing

of such Registrable Securities and deliver such documents and certificates as

underwriter, if any.

  



  

(x) Use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent, or obtain the
withdrawal of, any stop order or other order suspending the use of

(xi) Deliver to the Holder and each underwriter, if any, without
charge, as many copies of the applicable Prospectus and any amendment or
supplement thereto as the Holder or underwriter may reasonably request.

  



  

(xii) Cooperate with the Holder and the underwriters, if any, of such
Registrable Securities and their respective counsel in connection with
any filings required by law to be made with FINRA.

  



  

(xiii) Obtain customary opinions of counsel to the Company and updates
thereof addressed to the Holders and their underwriters, if any, covering the
Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement and such other
matters as are covered in any opinions relating to such Registration
Statement that are delivered to the Company, any holder of Other Securities or
their respective underwriters.

  



  

(xiv) Obtain for the benefit of the underwriters the independent right
to rely upon "comfort" letters and updates thereof from the Company's
independent certified public accountants relating to such Registration
Statement (and for the Holders if _Section 2.6(b)_ is applicable).

  



  

(xv) Make available for inspection by each Holder, the underwriters, if
any, and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by a Holder or the
underwriters, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents
and properties of the Company, and cause the Company's officers, directors,
employees and independent accountants to supply all information reasonably
requested by a Holder or any such underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent
in connection with such registration statement, provided that any of the
foregoing parties shall enter into a mutually acceptable confidentiality
agreement if reasonably requested by the Company.

  



  

(b) The Company may require the Holders whose Registrable Securities
are included in a Registration Statement to furnish to the Company such
customary information regarding the Holders and the distribution of such
Shares as the Company may reasonably require for inclusion in such
Registration Statement. The Holders agree promptly to

  



    

 | -8-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

furnish to the Company all information required to be disclosed in order to
make the information previously furnished to the Company by the Holders not
misleading. The Company may exclude from such Registration Statement the
Registrable Securities of any Holder if such Holder fails to furnish such
information at least three (3) Business Days prior to the filing of the
applicable Registration Statement or Prospectus. The Company shall not
include in any Registration Statement any information regarding, relating to
or referring to the Holders or their plan of distribution without the
approval of the Holders in writing; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
approval shall be required for information previously provided to the Company
as part of a selling stockholder questionnaire in connection with such
Registration Statement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the Holders shall also provide the Company as a condition to
including Registrable Securities in a Registration Statement, such
information as is reasonably requested by the Company in response to the
Company's customary selling stockholder questionnaire seeking the information
required by the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder. In addition, the Holders shall enter into customary custody and
related agreements if reasonably requested by the Company or the underwriters
in connection with a sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Piggyback
Registration.

  



  

(c) The Company shall permit outside legal counsel for the Holders
("Legal Counsel") to review and comment upon (i) a Registration Statement at
least five (5) Business Days prior to its filing with the SEC and (ii) all
amendments and supplements to all Registration Statements (except for Annual
Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on
Form 8-K, and any similar or successor reports) within a reasonable number of
days prior to their filing with the SEC. The Company shall furnish to Legal
Counsel, without charge, (i) copies of any correspondence from and to the SEC
or the staff of the SEC relating to any Registration Statement, (ii) promptly
after the same is prepared and filed with the SEC, one copy of any
Registration Statement and any amendment(s) thereto, including financial
statements and schedules, all documents incorporated therein by reference, if
requested by Legal Counsel, and all exhibits and (iii) upon the effectiveness
of any Registration Statement, one copy of the prospectus included in such
Registration Statement and all amendments and supplements thereto. The
Company shall reasonably cooperate with Legal Counsel in performing the
Company's obligations pursuant to this _Section 2.3_.

  



  

2.4 _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, (1) each Holder if any of the Holder's Registrable
Securities are covered by a Registration Statement or Prospectus, (2) each of
the Holders' Affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, employees,
advisors, agents, (3) each underwriter (including the Holders if deemed to be
an underwriter pursuant to any SEC comments or policies), if any, and (4)
each Person who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities
Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) such underwriter (collectively, "Holder
Indemnitees"), from and against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
penalties, judgments, suits, costs and expenses (including reasonable legal
fees and disbursements, which shall be reimbursed periodically as incurred)
(collectively, "Losses") in connection with any sale of Registrable
Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement under this Agreement arising
out of or based upon (i) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact contained in any such

  



    

 | -9-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Registration Statement or any Prospectus (including preliminary or final)
relating to the registration of such Registrable Securities or any amendment
or supplement thereto or any document incorporated by reference therein or
any omission or (ii) or any alleged omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading, and will reimburse to each of the Persons listed above, for any
reasonable legal or any other expenses actually suffered or incurred and paid
in connection with investigating and defending any such Losses; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not be liable to such Holder Indemnitee in
any such case to the extent that any such Loss arises out of or is based upon
an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission made in such Registration Statement, including any such preliminary
or final Prospectus contained therein or any such amendments or supplements
thereto, or contained in any free writing prospectus (as such term is defined
in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) prepared by the Company or
authorized by it in writing for use by such Holder Indemnitee (or any
amendment or supplement thereto), in reliance upon and in conformity with
information regarding such Holder Indemnitee which was furnished in writing to
the Company expressly for use in connection with such Registration Statement,
including any such preliminary or final Prospectus contained therein or any
such amendments or supplements thereto.

  



  

(b) In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder
is participating by registering Registrable Securities, such Holder agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
Company, its Affiliates, the officers, directors, shareholders, advisors,
agents, representatives or other employees of the Company, each Person who
controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section
20 of the Exchange Act) the Company, each underwriter, if any, and
each Person who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities
Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) such underwriter (collectively,
"Company Indemnitees"), from and against all Losses, as incurred, arising out
of or based on any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in any such Registration Statement or preliminary or
final Prospectus relating to the registration of such Registrable Securities
or any amendment or supplement thereto or any document incorporated by
reference therein, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading, in each case solely to the extent that such untrue or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission is made in such Registration
Statement or in any preliminary or final Prospectus contained therein or any
such amendments or supplements thereto or contained in any free
writing prospectus (as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities
Act) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to
the Company by such Holder expressly for inclusion in such document;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the liability of any Holder
hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the net proceeds
received by such Holder upon the sale of Registrable Securities under the
Registration Statement giving rise to such indemnification obligation.

  



  

(c) If any Person shall be entitled to indemnity hereunder (an
"Indemnified Party"), such Indemnified Party shall give prompt notice to the
party from which such indemnity is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of any
claim or of the commencement of any Proceeding with respect to which such
Indemnified Party has actual

  



    

 | -10-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

notice and seeks indemnification or contribution pursuant hereto; _provided_
, _however_ , that the delay or failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation or liability
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has been actually
materially prejudiced by such delay or failure. The Indemnifying Party shall
have the right, exercisable by giving written notice (which shall include an
acknowledgement of its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party therefor
on the terms set forth herein) to an Indemnified Party promptly after the
receipt of written notice from such Indemnified Party of such claim or
Proceeding, to assume, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, the defense of
any such Proceeding, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified
Party; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that an Indemnified Party shall have the
right to employ separate counsel in any such Proceeding and to participate in
the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the
expense of such Indemnified Party unless: (i) the Indemnifying Party agrees
to pay such fees and expenses; (ii) the Indemnifying Party fails promptly to
assume or diligently defend, or in the event of a conflict of interest cannot
assume or continue to defend, the defense of such Proceeding or fails to
employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, in which
case the Indemnified Party shall also have the right to employ counsel and to
assume the defense of such Proceeding or (iii) in the Indemnified Party's
reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such Indemnified Party and
Indemnifying Party may exist in respect of such Proceeding; _provided_ , 
_further_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any one
such Proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related Proceedings
in the same jurisdiction, arising out of the same general allegations or
circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one firm of
attorneys (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for all of
the Indemnified Parties, or for fees and expenses that are not reasonable.

  



  

(d) Neither party shall settle, compromise, discharge or consent to
an entry of judgment with respect to a claim or liability subject to
indemnification under this _Section 2.4_ without the other party's prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party
may agree without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party solely
to any settlement, compromise, discharge or consent to an entry of judgment,
in each case that relates only to money damages and by its terms obligates
the Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection
with such claim and which unconditionally releases the Indemnified Party from
all liability or obligation in connection with such claim.

  



  

(e) If the indemnification provided for in this _Section 2.4_ is
unavailable to hold harmless each of the Indemnified Parties against any
Losses to which such parties may become subject under the Securities Act, then
the Indemnifying Party shall, in lieu of indemnifying each party entitled to
indemnification hereunder, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
party as a result of such Losses in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party, on the one hand,
and such Indemnified Parties, on the other hand, in connection with the
statements or omissions or alleged statements or omissions that resulted in
such Losses; _provided_ , _however_ , that the liability of the Indemnifying
Party shall not exceed the applicable limitations set forth in _Section
2.4(a)_ or _Section 2.4(b)_, respectively. The relative fault of such
parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the
untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact, or omission or alleged
omission to state a material fact, relates to information supplied by or

  



    

 | -11-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

concerning the Indemnifying Party on the one hand, or by such Indemnified
Party on the other, and such party's relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to have corrected or prevented such statement or
omission.

  



  

2.5 _Notice_. Each time a Registration Statement is declared
effective, the Company shall notify each such Holder as promptly as
practicable, and in any event no later than the next Business Day, when such
Registration Statement has become effective and take such other actions as
are reasonably necessary to permit sales of the Registrable Securities,
including providing each Holder a reasonable number of copies of the
Prospectus which is a part of such Registration Statement as requested by such
Holder in writing.

  



  

2.6 _Miscellaneous_.

  



  

(a) Except for the registration rights granted to the Investor and
the other Holders hereunder, the Company has not granted registration
rights (that remain in force and effect) to any other holder or prospective
holder of any securities of the Company. From and after the date hereof, the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of the Holders, enter
into any agreement granting any other holder or prospective holder of any
securities of the Company registration rights with respect to such securities
unless such new registration rights, including with respect to underwriters'
"cutbacks," do not conflict with, the registration rights granted to the
Investor and the other Holders hereunder (it being understood that any grant
by the Company of pari passu registration rights shall not be deemed to
conflict with the rights of the Holders hereunder).

  



  

(b) If a Holder is required under applicable securities laws to be
described in a Registration Statement as an underwriter or the
Holder believes that it could reasonably be deemed to be an underwriter of
Registrable Securities, at the request of the Holder, the Company shall
furnish to the Holder, on the date of the effectiveness of such Registration
Statement and thereafter from time to time on such dates as the Holder may
reasonably request (i) a letter, dated such date, from the Company's
independent certified public accountants in form, scope and substance as is
customarily given by independent certified public accountants to
underwriters in an underwritten public offering, addressed to the Investor,
and (ii) an opinion, dated as of such date, of counsel representing the
Company for purposes of such Registration Statement, in form, scope and
substance as is customarily given in an underwritten public offering,
addressed to the Holder.

  



  

(c) If a Holder is required under applicable securities laws to be
described in a Registration Statement as an underwriter or a Holder believes
that it could reasonably be deemed to be an underwriter of Registrable
Securities, the Company shall make available for inspection by (i) the
Holder, (ii) Legal Counsel and (iii) one firm of accountants or other agents
retained by the Holder, all pertinent financial and other records, and
pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company, as shall
be reasonably deemed necessary by any such party set forth in clauses
(i)-(iii), and cause the Company's officers, directors and employees to
supply all information which any Holder or their Legal Counsel may reasonably
request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall be under no
obligation to share any confidential information to any Holders or their Legal
Counsel (i) unless and until a mutually acceptable confidentiality agreement
is in place with the Holders, and/or (ii) if such

  



    

 | -12-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

information is subject to attorney-client privilege, if such disclosure would
result in loss of attorney-client privilege, unless such Holders enter into a
reasonable joint defense agreement.

  



  

(d) Neither the Company nor any Affiliate thereof shall identify any
Holder as an "underwriter" in any public disclosure or filing with the SEC or
any securities exchange without the prior written consent of such Holder (it
being understood, that if the Company is required to name the Holder as an
"underwriter" in such Registration Statement by the SEC (after a good faith
discussion with the SEC to lift such requirement, including any reduction in
the number of Registrable Securities of the Holder to be registered on such
Registration Statement (to the extent necessary to lift such requirement)),
the Holder shall have the option of electing to exclude all such Registrable
Securities from such Registration Statement or to be named as an "underwriter"
in such Registration Statement).

  



  

3. _ _Other Covenants_._

  



  

3.1 _Reports Under the Exchange Act_. With a view to making
available to the Investor and the other Holders the benefits of certain
rules and regulations of the SEC which may at any time permit the sale of the
Registrable Securities to the public without registration, the Company
agrees, so long as there are outstanding Registrable Securities, to:

  



  

(a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are
understood and defined in Rule 144;

  



  

(b) file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other
documents as the SEC may prescribe under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act at any time while the Company is subject to such reporting
requirements of the Exchange Act and the filing of such reports and other
documents is required for the applicable provisions of Rule 144; and

  



  

(c) furnish or make available, including by filing on EDGAR, to each
Holder so long as such Holder owns Registrable Securities, promptly
upon request, (i) a written statement by the Company, if true, that it has
complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144, the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act, (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of
the Company and such other reports and documents so filed by the Company, and
(iii) such other information as may be reasonably requested to permit the
Holders to sell such securities pursuant to Rule 144 without restriction.

  



  

3.2 _Removal of Legend_. In connection with a sale of Registrable
Securities by any Holder in reliance on Rule 144, the applicable Holder or
its broker shall deliver to the Company a broker representation letter
providing to the Company any information the Company deems necessary to
determine that the sale of such Registrable Securities is made in compliance
with Rule 144, including, as may be appropriate, a certification that the
Holder is not an Affiliate of the Company and regarding the length of time the
Registrable Securities have been held. Upon receipt of such representation
letter, in a customary form, the Company shall promptly direct its transfer
agent to exchange stock certificates bearing a restrictive legend for stock
certificates without the legend (or a credit for such shares to book-entry
accounts maintained by the transfer agent), and the Company shall bear all
costs associated therewith. After any Holder has held

  



    

 | -13-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Registrable Securities for six months, if the certificate for such
Registrable Securities still bears a restrictive legend, the Company agrees,
upon request of such Holder, to take all steps necessary to promptly effect
the removal of such restrictive legend from such Registrable Securities, and
the Company shall bear all costs associated therewith, regardless of whether
the request is made in connection with a sale or otherwise, so long as such
Holder provides to the Company customary information reasonably necessary to
determine that the legend is no longer required under the Securities Act or
applicable state laws, including a certification that such Holder is not an
Affiliate of the Company (and a covenant to inform the Company if it should
thereafter become an Affiliate and to consent to exchange its
certificates for certificates bearing an appropriate restrictive legend) and
regarding the length of time the Registrable Securities have been held.

  



  

3.3 _Confidentiality_. The Company shall hold in confidence and
not make any disclosure of information concerning the Holders provided to the
Company unless (i) disclosure of such information is necessary to comply with
federal or state securities laws, (ii) the disclosure of such information is
required in any Registration Statement, (iii) the release of such information
is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other final, non-appealable order from a
court or governmental body of competent jurisdiction, or (iv)
such information has been made generally available to the public other than
by disclosure in violation of this Agreement or any other agreement. To the
extent permitted by applicable law, the Company agrees that it shall, upon
learning that disclosure of such information concerning the Holder is sought
in or by a court or governmental body of competent jurisdiction or through
other means, give prompt written notice to the Holder and allow the Holder,
to undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure of, or to obtain a
protective order for, such information.

  



  

4. _ _Miscellaneous__.

  



  

4.1 _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate (a) at any time
upon the mutual written agreement of the Company and the Holders holding
a majority in interest of the Registrable Securities and (b) as to any
particular Holder, at such time as the Holder ceases to Beneficially Own any
Registrable Securities; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such termination
shall affect the parties' rights and obligations pursuant to _Section 2.2_ or
_Section 2.4_.

  



  

4.2 _Amendment and Modification_. This Agreement (including all
exhibits hereto) may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified, and any provision hereof may be waived, only by written agreement
making specific reference to this Agreement or the applicable provision to be
waived, in each case duly executed by the Company and Holders holding a
majority in interest of the Registrable Securities.

  



  

4.3 _Titles and Subtitles; Interpretation_. Unless otherwise
indicated herein, with respect to any reference made in this Agreement to
a Section (or Article, Subsection, Paragraph, Subparagraph or Clause), such
reference shall be to a section (or article, subsection, paragraph,
subparagraph or clause) of, or an exhibit or schedule to, this Agreement. Any
article, section, subsection, paragraph or subparagraph headings contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Any reference made in this
Agreement to a statute or statutory provision shall mean such statute or
statutory provision as it has been amended through the date as of which the
particular portion

  



    

 | -14-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

of the Agreement is to take effect, or to any successor statute or statutory
provision relating to the same subject as the statutory provision so referred
to in this Agreement, and to any then applicable rules or regulations
promulgated thereunder. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed, as the context
indicates, to be followed by the words "but (is/are) not limited to." The
words "herein," "hereof," "hereunder" and words of like import shall refer to
this Agreement as a whole, unless the context clearly indicates to the
contrary. Words used herein, regardless of the number and gender specifically
used, shall be deemed and construed to include any other number, singular or
plural, and any other gender, masculine, feminine or neuter, as the context
indicates is appropriate. Where specific language is used to clarify or
illustrate by example a general statement contained herein, such specific
language shall not be deemed to modify, limit or restrict the construction of
the general statement which is being clarified or illustrated.

  



  

4.4 _Waiver_. No failure on the part of a party to this Agreement
to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy under
this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party to this
Agreement preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right, power or remedy. Any such agreement on the part of a party
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed by such party.

  



  

4.5 _Binding Nature; Assignment_. This Agreement will be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective
successors and permitted assigns of the parties hereto. Neither party to this
Agreement may assign (whether by operation of law or otherwise) this
Agreement or any rights, interests or obligations provided by this Agreement
without prior written consent of the other party;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Investor may Transfer any or all of the Shares or other Registrable
Securities and assign this Agreement and any or all rights, interests or
obligations hereunder to an Affiliate of the Investor and any such
Affiliate of the Investor may further assign this Agreement and any or all
its rights, interests or obligations hereunder to any other Affiliate of the
Investor. For the sake of clarity, each transferee as permitted in the
previous sentence shall be deemed to be a "Holder" for purposes of this
Agreement. Any attempted assignment in violation of this _Section 4.5_ shall
be void _ab initio_.

  



  

4.6 _Severability_. In the event that any term or other provision
of this Agreement, or the application thereof becomes, or is declared by any
rule of law, under public policy or by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement, and the
application of such provision to other persons or circumstances other than
those as to which it is determined to be illegal, void or unenforceable, will
not be impaired or otherwise affected and will continue in full force and
effect and be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

parties. The seat of the arbitration will be New York, New York, and it will
be conducted in the English language. To the extent feasible, multiple
claims shall be consolidated in a single proceeding. It is the intention of
the parties that all proceedings initiated pursuant to this _Section 4.9_ be
conducted as expeditiously as reasonably possible. Each party hereto
understands that by entering into this Agreement, it is waiving any right it
may have to file a lawsuit or other civil action or proceeding relating to
this Agreement, and that it is waiving any right that it may have to resolve
disputes through trial by jury.

  



  

(b) A party seeking arbitration (the "Claimant") will nominate an
arbitrator in the request for arbitration and statement of claim (the
"Request for Arbitration"), subject to confirmation by the International Court
of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC Court") or
Secretary General of the International Chamber of Commerce (the "Secretary
General"), as provided in the ICC Rules. After filing the Request
for Arbitration is complete pursuant to the ICC Rules, the Claimant will
serve the Request for Arbitration upon the Claimant. Within ten (10)
Business Days of receipt of the filed Request for Arbitration, the party
against whom the claim is made (the "Respondent") will file and serve the
Answer to the Request for Arbitration and notify the Claimant and the ICC
Court of an arbitrator that it nominates, subject to confirmation as provided
in the ICC Rules. Upon confirmation by the ICC Court or the
Secretary General of the two arbitrators nominated by the parties, such two
arbitrators will select a third arbitrator, who, once confirmed, shall serve
as

  



    

 | -17-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

chairman of the arbitral panel; the nomination of the third arbitrator shall
be made within ten (10) Business Days of the confirmation of the arbitrators
nominated by the parties. If the arbitrators nominated by the Claimant and
the Respondent cannot agree on a third arbitrator within such time period,
then the ICC Court will appoint the third arbitrator, who shall serve as
chairman of the arbitral panel. By whomever appointed, the three arbitrators
will act as the sole arbitrators in the arbitral proceeding. The parties
specifically agree that, as to any proceeding initiated pursuant to this
_Section 4.9_: (i) the arbitrators will be empowered to award and order
equitable or injunctive relief with respect to matters brought before them;
(ii) any taking of evidence that may be required shall be handled
expeditiously, and all disputes regarding the taking of evidence shall be
resolved by the arbitrators within ten (10) Business Days, or as soon
thereafter as practicable. It is the intent of the parties that barring
extraordinary circumstances or unavailability of members of the arbitral
panel, (i) a hearing on the merits of all claims for which arbitration is
sought by either party shall be commenced not later than ninety (90) days from
the date the ICC arbitration panel conducts the initial case management
conference, following issuance of the arbitral panel's "Terms of Reference,"
in accordance with the ICC Rules, and (ii) the arbitral panel will submit a
written draft Award to the ICC Court for its review, which shall reveal the
essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, within thirty
(30) days after the conclusion of such hearing. Failure to adhere to these
time limits shall not be a basis for challenging the award or challenging the
arbitral tribunal's jurisdiction. With respect to any arbitration proceeding
arising under this Agreement, the parties further agree that with respect to
discovery in such proceeding: (i) the arbitrators will not be empowered to
provide for any requests for documents beyond one (1) set of requests by each
party for the production of documents by the other party, which requests
shall be submitted within five (5) Business Days of Respondent's submission of
its Answer to the Request for Arbitration; and (ii) each party will be
limited to one deposition, with the Company entitled to take a single
deposition of one (1) corporate representative of the Investor and the
Investor entitled to take a single deposition of one (1) corporate
representative of the Company, such corporate representative depositions to
be consistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(6). The award will
be final and binding and non-appealable, and judgment thereon may be entered
by any Court of Competent Jurisdiction.

  



  

(c) The parties agree that each of them shall bear all of their own
fees, costs and expenses in connection with any arbitral proceeding initiated
pursuant to this _Section 4.9_, including but not limited to attorneys' fees.
The cost of the three arbitrators shall be shared equally by the Claimant and
the Respondent.

  



  

(d) Arbitration pursuant to this _Section 4.9_ shall be the
exclusive method available for resolution of claims, disputes and
controversies described in this _Section 4.9_, and the parties stipulate
that the provisions hereof shall be a complete defense to any suit, action,
or proceeding in any court or before any administrative or arbitration
tribunal with respect to any such claim, controversy or dispute.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding the terms of this _Section 4.9_, each party
acknowledges and agrees that the other parties may be damaged irreparably if
this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its terms or otherwise is
breached, and that, at any time before and after a demand notice is
presented, the parties shall be free to apply to any Court of Competent
Jurisdiction for (i) in the case of  _Section 3.3_ , any temporary or
permanent

injunctive or equitable relief that is available to such party, and (ii) in
all other cases, interim or conservatory measures (including temporary
conservatory injunctions), in each case to prevent breaches of this
Agreement, and to enforce specifically this Agreement and its terms. The
parties acknowledge and agree that any such action by a party shall not be
deemed to be a breach of such party's obligation to arbitrate all disputes
under this _Section 4.9_ or infringe upon the powers of any arbitral panel.

  



  

(f) The parties shall keep confidential, and not disclose the fact
that there is a dispute between the parties, the details of the dispute, the
fact of the arbitration and all details relating to the proceeding, except as
required by law and consistent with the parties' right to limited judicial
review of the arbitrator's award. All statements, documents, claims, demands,
transcripts, evidence, discovery materials or communications, whether oral,
written, electronic or in any other form, that are submitted or prepared by
any party in connection with an arbitration proceeding initiated pursuant to
this _Section 4.9_ shall be Confidential Information (as defined in, and for
the purposes of, the Stock Purchase Agreement).

  



  

4.10 _Governing Law; Court of Competent Jurisdiction_. This
Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of New York without regard to applicable principles of choice or
conflicts of law that would cause application of the laws of any other
jurisdiction. Any proceeding initiated pursuant to _Section 4.9_ above shall
incorporate the substantive laws of the State of New York, except as modified
by the terms of _Section 4.9_. The parties agree that any permissible action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including but not limited to an
action for injunctive or provisional relief or in connection with an arbitral
award or proceeding, shall be brought exclusively in a state or federal court
of competent subject matter jurisdiction located in the State of New York, New
York County (a "Court of Competent Jurisdiction"), irrevocably submit to the
personal jurisdiction of any such court, and waive any objection to the
venue of such court and any argument that such court is an inconvenient
forum.

to herein collectively constitute and contain the entire agreement
and understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof and supersede any prior negotiations,
correspondence, understandings and contracts by or between the parties
respecting the subject matter hereof and thereof.

benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, and, and, except with respect to the Holder Indemnitees and the
