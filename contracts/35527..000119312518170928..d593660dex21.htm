WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

waiver (subject to applicable law) of the latest to occur of the conditions
set forth in Article VII hereof (other than those conditions that by their
nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction
or waiver thereof), or such other date or time mutually agreed in writing by
the parties (the " _Closing Date_ ").

 

1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, on or before the Closing Date, the Company and Intermediary shall
file or cause to be filed (a) articles of merger containing such information

accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like or otherwise held in a
fiduciary or agency capacity, or (ii) shares held, directly or indirectly, in
respect of debts previously contracted, collectively the " _Excluded Shares_
"), shall be converted into the right to receive, without interest, (i) 1.45

in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on
the Parent Common Stock or New Parent Preferred Stock, as applicable,
deliverable in respect of each former share of the Company Common Stock or
the Company Preferred Stock such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to
this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of Parent, Intermediary, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any
former holder of shares of the Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock
for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant
to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(h) Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange
Agent to deduct and withhold, from any cash portion of the Merger
Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, cash
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to this Section 2.2 or any other
cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
the Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate governmental
authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, in respect of which the deduction and
withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in
such amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate
or Company Preferred Stock certificate, as applicable, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate or Company
Preferred Stock certificate, as applicable, the Merger Consideration, New
Parent Preferred Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and dividends or
distributions deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement, as
applicable.

Company concurrently herewith (the " _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ , that (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (b) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Parent Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Parent that
such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or
that such item is reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent, and (c) any disclosures made with respect to a section of this
Article IV shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of this Article
IV specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other sections of
Article IV to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face
(notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) from a reading of
the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections or (ii) as
disclosed in any Parent Reports filed by Parent since January 1, 2015 and
prior to the date hereof (but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained
under the heading "Risk Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any

similarly non-specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking
in nature), Parent and Intermediary hereby represent and warrant to the
Company as follows:

corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Ohio. Parent is a bank holding company duly registered
under the BHC Act, which has elected to be, and qualifies as, a financial
holding company under the BHC Act. Each of Parent and Intermediary has the
corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly
licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties
and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would
not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. True and complete copies of the Parents
Amended Articles of Incorporation (the " _Parent Articles_ ") and
Intermediary Articles and Parents Code of Regulations (the " _Parent Code of
Regulations_ ") and Intermediary Code of Regulations, as in effect as of the
date of this Agreement, have previously been made available by Parent to the
Company. 

(b) Each Subsidiary of Parent (a " _Parent Subsidiary_ ") is duly organized
and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, is
duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is recognized under
applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state,
local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct
of its business requires it to be so qualified and in which the failure to be
so qualified would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, and has all requisite
corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as now conducted in all material respects. There are no
restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of Parent to pay dividends
or distributions except for restrictions on dividends or distributions under
applicable law and, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity,
for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally applicable to all
such regulated entities. The deposit accounts of the Parent Bank are insured
by the FDIC to the fullest extent permitted by law, all premiums and
assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid when
due, and no proceedings for the termination of such insurance are pending or,
to the knowledge of Parent, threatened.

public accountants of Parent as a result of or in connection with any
disagreements with Parent on a matter of accounting principles or practices,
financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

of Parent or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that, either individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent
(x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information relating to Parent, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to
the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Parent by
others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y) has
reported, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
Parents outside auditors and the audit committee of Parents Board of

adversely affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information, and (ii) any fraud, to the extent known to Parent,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Parents internal controls over financial reporting. To
the knowledge of Parent, there is no reason to believe that Parents outside

be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the
rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, without qualification, when next due.

written or oral, that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney
representing Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by

the assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Parent has made available to
the Company true and complete copies of any private letter ruling requests,
closing agreements or gain recognition agreements with respect to Taxes
requested or executed in the last six (6) years. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation

arrangement exclusively between or among Parent and its Subsidiaries). Neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of an affiliated
group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a group the
common parent of which was Parent) or (B) has any liability for the Taxes of
any person (other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise. Neither

licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful
conduct of their respective businesses and ownership of their respective

fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except where
neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding such

(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use, and cause
their applicable Subsidiaries to use, their reasonable best efforts to
promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all
applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as
practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Requisite Regulatory Approvals and the Bank Merger), and to comply with the
terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all such Governmental Entities. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, as soon as practicable and in no event later than
twenty (20) business days after the date of this Agreement, Parent and the
Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, each prepare
and file any applications, notices, petitions and filings required to be filed
with any Governmental Entity in order to obtain the Requisite Regulatory
Approvals (including the Bank Merger) and, if requested by Parent, the
applications, notices, petitions and filings required in connection with the
Bank Merger.

 

(c) Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and,
to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case
subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the
information relating to the Company or Parent, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Bank Merger). In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree
that they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of
the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby. Each party shall consult with the other in advance of any meeting or
conference with any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, give the other party and/or its counsel the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent
and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the entry
of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, and (ii) avoid or eliminate each
and every impediment, including with respect to obtaining the Requisite
Regulatory Approvals, so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon
as possible. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall require Parent or permit the Company
to take, or agree to take, any action or agree to any condition or
restriction, in connection with the grant of a Requisite Regulatory Approval,
that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Parent
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger
(measured on a scale relative to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole) (a " _Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ ").

(e) Parent and the Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with
all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company agrees, as to
itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be
supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the S-4
will, at the time the S-4 and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any,
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) the Proxy
Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of
mailing to the Companys common and preferred stockholders and at the time of
the Companys Meeting to consider and vote upon the Company Stockholder
Matters, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which such
statement was made, not misleading.

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 Each of Parent and the Company further agrees that if it becomes aware that
any information furnished by it would cause any of the statements in the S-4
or the Proxy Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto to be false
or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof and to take
appropriate steps to correct the S-4 or the Proxy Statement and any amendment
or supplement thereto.

 

(f) Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving
any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of
any such approval will be materially delayed.

(g) As used in this Agreement, the " _Requisite Regulatory Approvals_ "
shall mean all regulatory authorizations, consents, orders or approvals (x)
from the Federal Reserve Board; (y) under the HSR Act, if required and (z) any
other approvals set forth in Sections 3.4 and 4.4 that are necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger and the Bank Merger, except for any such authorizations, consents,
orders or approvals the failure of which to be obtained would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent.

 6.2 _Access to Information_. (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable laws, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause each of
their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, counsel,
accountants and advisors of the other party, reasonable access, during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its
properties, books, contracts, personnel and records, and each shall
cooperate with the other party in preparing to execute after the Effective
Time conversion or consolidation of systems and business operations generally,
and, during such period, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause
its respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such party
may reasonably request. Neither Parent nor the Company nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of Parents or the Companys, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize
the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of
such information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any
common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the parties) or
contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The
parties hereto will use reasonable best efforts to cooperate and make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall hold all information furnished by
or on behalf of the other party or any of such partys Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the
confidentiality agreement, dated March 1, 2018, between Parent and the
Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

 

6.3 _Stockholders_ __ _Approval_ (a) . _(a)_ The Board of Directors of
the Company has resolved to recommend to its common and preferred stockholders
that they approve the Company Stockholder Matters, and will submit to the
Companys common and preferred stockholders the Company Stockholder
Matters and any other matters required to be approved by its common and
preferred stockholders in order to carry out the

 



-36- 

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 intentions of this Agreement. In furtherance of that obligation, the Company
shall, in accordance with applicable law and the Company Charter and Company
Bylaws, call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its common and
preferred stockholders (the " _Company Meeting_ ,") as soon as reasonably
practicable after the S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of obtaining
the Requisite Company Vote and the Requisite Preferred Vote required in
connection with the Company Stockholder Matters and, if so desired and
mutually agreed, upon other matters of the type customarily brought before an
annual or special meeting of common and preferred stockholders to approve a
merger or amendments to organizational documents. The Company shall engage a
proxy solicitor reasonably acceptable to Parent to assist in the solicitation
of proxies from the common and preferred stockholders of the Company relating
to the Requisite Company Vote and the Requisite Preferred Vote. The Board of
Directors of the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from
the common and preferred stockholders of the Company the Requisite Company
Vote and the Requisite Preferred Vote, including by communicating to its
common and preferred stockholders its recommendation (and including such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement) that they approve the Company
Stockholder Matters. However, subject to Sections 8.1 and 8.2, if the Board
of Directors of the Company, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel
and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor, determines in
good faith that it would more likely than not result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement,
then in submitting the Company Stockholder Matters to its common and preferred
stockholders, the Board of Directors of the Company may submit the Company
Stockholder Matters to its common and preferred stockholders without
recommendation (although the resolutions approving the Company Stockholder
Matters as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which
event the Board of Directors of the Company may communicate the basis for its
lack of a recommendation to its common and preferred stockholders in the Proxy
Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent
required by law; _provided_ , that the Board of Directors of the Company may
not take any actions under this sentence unless (i) it gives Parent at least
three (3) business days prior written notice of its intention to take such
action and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving rise
to its determination to take such action (including, in the event such action
is taken by the Board of Directors of the Company in response to an
Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms and conditions of, and the
identity of the third party making, any such Acquisition Proposal, or any
amendment or modification thereof, or describe in reasonable detail such other
event or circumstances) and (ii) at the end of such notice period, the Board
of Directors of the Company takes into account any amendment or modification
to this Agreement proposed by the Parent and after receiving the advice of its
outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisor, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless more likely than
not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to
continue to recommend this Agreement. Any material amendment to any
Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for
purposes of this Section 6.3(a) and will require a new notice period as
referred to in this Section 6.3(a).

 

(b) The Company shall adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting if, as of the
time for which such meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient
shares of the Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy)
to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or
if on the date of such meeting the Company has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite
Company Vote, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Company shall continue to use all reasonable best efforts, together with its
proxy solicitor, to solicit proxies from its common and preferred
stockholders in order to obtain the Requisite Company Vote and the Requisite
Preferred Vote. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company
Meeting shall be convened and the Company Stockholder Matters shall be
submitted to the common and preferred stockholders of the Company at the

reason" (or words of similar import) under the employment or severance
agreement covering each officer who is a member of the Companys Strategic
Oversight Committee.

 

(d) If Parent so requests (which request shall be made not less than 30
days prior to the Effective Time), the Company shall take any and all
actions, to the extent permitted by law and the terms of the applicable plan,
required (including without limitation, the adoption of resolutions by its

Company Benefits Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time (as permitted
by the terms of the applicable plan), and, if requested by Parent, to
implement any such actions.

 

(e) Upon written request by Parent at least ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall, or shall cause its applicable
Subsidiaries to, adopt resolutions terminating any and all Company Benefit

of one day preceding the Closing Date but contingent on the occurrence of the
Closing. The Company will provide Parent evidence that each Company 401(k)
Plan has been terminated prior to Closing pursuant to duly
adopted resolutions. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be
subject to review and reasonable approval of Parent and such resolutions shall
be provided to Parent at least seven (7) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date.

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Company, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or
shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the
Parent, Surviving Corporation, the Company, or any Subsidiary or affiliate
thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer,
director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates
at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. Nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company
Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any particular Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit
or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective
Time. Without limiting the generality of Section 9.11, nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person,
including any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _ Insurance_. (a)
From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each present and former
director, officer or employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries as well
as fiduciaries of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the Company
Benefit Plans (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the
" _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising in
whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, the fact that such person is

 



-39- 

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 or was a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, is or was a fiduciary under any of the Company Benefit Plans, or
is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as
a director or officer of another person and pertaining to matters, acts or
omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including
matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the consideration and
approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and Parent shall also advance expenses as
incurred by such Company Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, provided that the Company Indemnified Party to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking, in a reasonable and customary form, to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Company
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.

(b) Subject to the following sentence, for a period of six (6) years after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries and any similar policies covering fiduciaries
under the Company Benefit Plans ( _provided_ , that Parent may substitute
therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims against the present and
former officers and directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time
(including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_ ,
that Parent shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in
excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the
Company for such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for
such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then Parent shall
cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in Parents good faith
determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium
equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, the Company, in
consultation with, but only upon the consent of, Parent, may (and at the
request of Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to)
obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy under the
Companys existing directors and officers insurance policy and any similar
policy covering fiduciaries under the Company Benefit Plans providing
equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the
extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate,
does not exceed the Premium Cap. If the Company purchases such a
"tail policy," Parent shall maintain such "tail policy" in full force and
effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder.

 

(c) The obligations of the Parent and the Company under this Section 6.7
shall not be terminated or modified after the Effective Time in a manner so
as to adversely affect any Company Indemnified Party or any other person
entitled to the benefit of this Section 6.7 without the prior written consent
of the affected Company Indemnified Party or affected person.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If Parent
or any of its successors or assigns will consolidate with or merge into any
other entity and not be the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger, transfer all or substantially all of its assets or
deposits to any other entity or engage in any similar transaction, then in
each case, Parent will cause proper provision to be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent will expressly assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.7.

 

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the
parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to
this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary
action as may be reasonably requested by the other party.

 

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly
advise the other party of any fact, change, event or circumstance known to it
(i) that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) which it believes would
or would be 

 



-40- 

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained herein or that reasonably
could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the
failure of a condition in Article VII; provided, that any failure to give
notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not
be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 6.9 or the failure of any
condition set forth in Section 7.2 or Section 7.3 to be satisfied, or
otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give
such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would
independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2
or Section 7.3 to be satisfied.

 

6.10 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of Parent and the
Company shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in
respect of the Parent Common Stock and the Company Common Stock and the record
dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the
parties hereto that holders of the Company Common Stock shall not receive two
dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to
their shares of Company Common Stock and any shares of Parent Common Stock any
such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

6.11 _Corporate Governance_ _._ At the Effective Time, Parent shall
appoint two directors of the Companys Board of Directors (the " _Company
Directors_ ") to the Board of Directors of Parent as mutually agreed by the
Company and Parent (at least one of whom shall be an independent
Company Director), who shall be included in the slate of directors for the
next annual meeting of stockholders of Parent.

 6.12 _Acquisition Proposals_. (a) The Company shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their
officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in
any negotiations with any person concerning, or relating to, any Acquisition
Proposal or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data
to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any person relating to any
Acquisition Proposal;  _provided_ , that, prior to the approval of the Merger
by the stockholders of the Company by the Requisite Company Vote, in the event
the Company receives an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
after the date of this Agreement and its Board of Directors concludes in good
faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is more likely than not to result in a Superior Proposal, it
may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries
Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or
data and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent
that the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith (after
receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to financial
matters, its financial advisor) that failure to take such actions would more
likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law; _provided_ , _further_ , that, prior to providing any
nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing
proviso, the Company shall have provided such information to Parent and
entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no
less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality
agreement shall not provide such person with any exclusive right to
negotiate with the Company. The Company will, and will use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the
date of this Agreement with any person other than Parent with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company will promptly (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent in writing following receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the
material terms and conditions of and the identity of the person making such
inquiry or Acquisition Proposal), and will promptly (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent of any related developments, discussions
and negotiations, including any amendments to or revisions of the terms of
such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts, subject to applicable law and the fiduciary duties of the Board
of Directors of the Company, to enforce any existing confidentiality,
standstill or similar agreements to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party relating to an Acquisition Proposal in accordance with its terms. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, subject to applicable law, to,
within ten (10) business days after the date hereof,

 



-41- 

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 request and confirm the return or destruction of any confidential
information provided to any person (other than Parent and its affiliates)
pursuant to any such confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement. Unless
and until this Agreement shall have been duly terminated in accordance with
its terms, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Representatives not to
on its behalf, enter into any binding acquisition agreement, merger agreement
or other definitive transaction agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to and entered into in accordance with this Section
__6.12(a)) relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

 

(b) As used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, other

consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or 25% or more of any
class of equity or voting securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose
assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the
consolidated assets of the Company, (ii) any tender offer (including a self
tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such
third party beneficially owning 25% or more of any class of equity or voting
securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or
in the aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the consolidated assets of the
Company, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
other similar transaction involving the Company or its Subsidiaries whose
assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the
consolidated assets of the Company. As used in this Agreement, " _Superior
Proposal_ " shall mean a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the
Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith to be more favorable
to its stockholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, (i) after receiving the advice of its financial advisors (who shall
be a nationally recognized investment banking firm), (ii) after taking into
account the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the terms set
forth therein and (iii) after taking into account all legal (with the advice
of outside counsel), financial (including the financing terms of any such
proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such proposal (including any
expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to closing) and any other
relevant factors permitted under applicable law; provided, that for purposes
of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the references to "25%" in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to
"a majority."

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its
Board of Directors from complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A with respect to an

Companys stockholders; _provided_ , that such Rules will in no way eliminate
or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise
have under this Agreement.

6.13 _Public Announcements_. Each of the Company and Parent shall each
use their reasonable best efforts to develop a joint communications plan, to
ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint

applicable law or regulation, a request by a Governmental Entity or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities
exchange, to consult with each other and to obtain the advance approval of
the other party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) before issuing any press release or, to the extent
practical, otherwise making any public statement with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

6.14 _Takeover Statutes_. None of the Company, Parent, Intermediary or
their respective Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause
any Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or
any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all
necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby from
any applicable Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any
Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby, each party and the members of their
respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and take such actions
as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms

subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion
of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock and Company Equity
Awards in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to
the provisions of this Section 6.15. The Board of Directors of Parent and of
the Company, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term
is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall
reasonably promptly, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, take all
such steps as may be required to cause (in the case of the Company) any
dispositions of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock or Company
Equity Awards by the Company Insiders, and (in the case of Parent) any
acquisitions of Parent Common Stock, New Parent Preferred Stock, and/or
Company Stock Options exercisable for shares of Parent Common Stock converted
at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 1.9(a), by any Company Insiders who,
immediately following the Merger, will be officers or directors of the
Surviving Corporation subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule __16b-3 under the
Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

6.16 _Litigation and Claims_ _._ Each of Parent and the Company shall
promptly notify each other in writing of any action, arbitration,
investigation, litigation, or subpoena issued or commenced by or before, or
otherwise involving, any Governmental Entity or arbitrator pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent or the Company, as applicable, threatened against Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries that (a) questions or
would reasonably be expected to question the validity of this Agreement or the
other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby or any actions taken or to be
taken by Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries with respect
hereto or thereto, or (b) seeks to enjoin, materially delay or otherwise
restrain the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The Company shall
give Parent the opportunity to participate, at Parents own expense, in the
defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or
its directors or affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed without Parents prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) _._

 

6.17 _Assumption of the Company Debt_ 6.18 . Parent agrees to execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, by or on behalf of the
Surviving Corporation or Parent Bank (as the case may be), at or prior to the

Banks outstanding debt, guarantees, securities, and other agreements to the
extent required by the terms of such debt, guarantees, securities, and other
agreements.

failures of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct,

reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Such counsel
shall be entitled to rely upon representation letters from each of Parent,
Intermediary and the Company, in each case, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to such counsel. Each such representation letter shall be dated
as of the date of such opinion.

ARTICLE VIII

 

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

 

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the Merger by the
stockholders of the Company:

 

(a) by mutual consent of Parent and the Company in a written instrument;

 

(b) by either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Entity that must
grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger or
the Bank Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final
nonappealable order permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making
illegal the consummation of the Merger or the Bank Merger, unless the failure
to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to the failure of the
party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants
and agreements of such party set forth herein;

(c) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement
(the " _Termination Date_ "), unless the failure of the Closing to occur by
such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set
forth herein, provided that if on the Termination Date, the condition set
forth in 7.1(c) shall not have been satisified but all other conditions to
Closing shall have been satisfied or capable of being satisfied, then the
Termination Date may be extended for a period of three months at the option of
either the Company or Parent by written notice to the other on or prior to
the Termination Date;

(d) by either Parent or the Company ( _provided_ , that the terminating
party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a
breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or
warranties (or any such representation or warranty shall cease to be true)
set forth in this Agreement on the part of the Company, in the case of a
termination by Parent, or Parent or Intermediary, in the case of a termination
by the Company, which breach or failure to be true, either individually or in
the aggregate with all other breaches by such party (or failures of such
representations or warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring or
continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 7.2, in the case of a termination by Parent, or 7.3, in the case of a
termination by the Company, and which is not cured within the earlier of the
Termination Date and forty-five (45) days following written notice to
the Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, or Parent, in the case
of a termination by the Company, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured
during such period; or

 

(e) by Parent, if (i) prior to such time as the Requisite Company Vote is
obtained, the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company (A) submits
the Company Stockholder Matters to

 



-46- 

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 its stockholders without a recommendation for approval, or otherwise
withdraws or materially and adversely modifies (or publicly discloses its
intention to withdraw or materially and adversely modify) its recommendation
as contemplated by Section 6.3, or recommends to its stockholders an
Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger, or (B) materially breaches its
obligations under Section 6.3 or Section 6.12 or (ii) a tender offer or
exchange offer for 25% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company Common
Stock is commenced (other than by Parent or a Subsidiary thereof), and the
Board of Directors of the Company recommends that the stockholders of the
Company tender their shares in such tender or exchange offer or otherwise
fails to recommend that such stockholders reject such tender offer or exchange
offer within the ten (10) business day period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under
the Exchange Act.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c),
(d) or (e) of this Section 8.1 shall give written notice of such termination
to the other party in accordance with Section 9.5, specifying the provision or
provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is effected.

 

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. (a) In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Parent or the Company as provided in Section 8.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of Parent,
the Company, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers,
directors, employees, shareholders, agents or representatives of any of them
shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Section 6.2(b),
this Section 8.2, Article IX and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive
any termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Parent or Intermediary nor the
Company shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising
out of its fraud or Willful Breach of any provision of this Agreement
occurring prior to termination (which, in the case of the Company, shall
include the loss to the holders of the Company Common Stock and Company Equity
Awards of the economic benefits of the Merger, including the loss of the
premium offered to the stockholders of the Company). " _Willful Breach_ "
shall mean a material breach of, or material failure to perform any of the
covenants or other agreements contained in, this Agreement, that is a
consequence of an act or failure to act by the breaching or non-performing
party with actual knowledge that such partys act or failure to act would, or
would be reasonably expected to, result in or constitute a breach of or
failure of performance under this Agreement.

(b) (i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement, a bona fide __
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to senior management or the
board of directors of the Company or has been made directly to its
stockholders generally or any person shall have publicly announced (whether
or not withdrawn) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company, and (A)
thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 8.1(c) without the Requisite Company Vote having been
obtained or (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(d), and (C) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the
date of such termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement or
consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or
not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then, the
Company shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive
agreement and the date of consummation of such transaction, pay Parent, by
wire transfer of same day funds, a fee equal to $151,215,000 (the "
_Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ , that for purposes of this Section 8.2(b),
all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to "25%" shall
instead refer to "50%".

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(e), then the Company shall pay Parent, by wire transfer of same
day funds, the Termination Fee within two (2) business days of the date of
termination.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting
the right of any party to recover liabilities or damages, the maximum
aggregate amount of fees payable by the Company under this Section 8.2 shall
be equal to the Termination Fee. In no event shall the Company be obligated to
pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

(d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, Parent and Intermediary would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any
amount due pursuant to Section 8.2(b), and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company for
the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay the costs
and expenses of Parent (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit. In addition, if the Company fails to pay any amount
due pursuant to Section 8.2(b), then the Company shall pay interest on such
overdue amount (for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue
amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date that such
overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a rate per annum equal to the
"prime rate" (as announced by JPMorgan Chase and Co. or any successor thereto)
in effect on the date on which such payment was required to be made, for the
period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally
required to be paid. The amounts payable by the Company pursuant to Section
8.2(b) constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and, except in the
case of fraud or Willful Breach, shall be the sole monetary remedy of Parent
in the event of a termination of this Agreement specified in such section
under circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable and is paid in full.

ARTICLE IX

be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such

 portion of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction,
and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such
jurisdiction such that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision

adverse to any party hereto _._

shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment
hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a
contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.

Stock")._ The authorized number of shares of Series K Preferred Stock shall

may be increased from time to time in accordance with Ohio law up to the
maximum number of shares of Preferred Stock authorized to be issued under the
charter of the Corporation, as amended or supplemented, less all shares at the
time authorized of any other series of Preferred Stock, and any
such additional shares of Series K Preferred Stock would form a single series
with the shares of Series K Preferred Stock already then issued. Shares of
Series K Preferred Stock will be dated the date of issue. Shares of
outstanding Series K Preferred Stock that are redeemed, purchased or
otherwise acquired by the Corporation, or converted into another series of

Corporations outstanding Series H Preferred Stock, Series I Preferred Stock
and Series J Preferred Stock and any other class or series of capital stock of

The Corporation may authorize and issue additional shares of Series K Junior
Securities and Series K Parity Securities without the consent of the holders

Section 4\. _Dividends._

 

(a) Holders of Series K Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, when,
as and if declared by the Board or a duly authorized committee of the Board,
out of assets legally available for the payment of dividends under Ohio law,
non-cumulative cash dividends based on the liquidation preference of the
Series K Preferred Stock at a rate equal to 6.00% per annum for each Series K
Dividend Period from the Original Issue Date of the Series K Preferred Stock
to, but excluding, the redemption date of the Series K Preferred Stock, if
any.

 

(b) If declared by the Board or a duly authorized committee of the Board,
dividends will be payable on the Series K Preferred Stock (each such date, a
_"Series K Dividend Payment Date")_ quarterly, in arrears, on March 31, June
30, September 30 and December 31 of each year, beginning on [●]. If any Series
K Dividend Payment Date is not a Business Day, then the payment will be made
on the next Business Day without any adjustment to the amount of dividends
paid.

 

(c) Dividends will be payable to holders of record of Series K Preferred
Stock as they appear on the Corporations books on the applicable record
date, which shall be the 15th calendar day before the applicable

  ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 Series K Dividend Payment Date, or such other record date, no earlier than
30 calendar days before the applicable Series K Dividend Payment Date, as
shall be fixed by the Board or a duly authorized committee of the Board.

(d) Dividends payable on Series K Preferred Stock will be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Dollar amounts
resulting from that calculation will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-
half cent being rounded upwards. Dividends on the Series K Preferred Stock
will cease to accrue on the redemption date, if any, unless the Corporation
defaults in the payment of the redemption price of the Series K Preferred
Stock called for redemption.

(e) Dividends on the Series K Preferred Stock will not be cumulative. If
the Board or a duly authorized committee of the Board does not declare a
dividend on the Series K Preferred Stock in respect of a Series K Dividend
Period, then no dividend shall be deemed to have accrued for such Series K
Dividend Period, be payable on the applicable Series K Dividend Payment Date
or be cumulative, and the Corporation will have no obligation to pay any
dividend for that Series K Dividend Period, whether or not the Board or a duly
authorized committee of the Board declares a dividend for any future Series K
Dividend Period with respect to the Series K Preferred Stock or any other
class or series of the Corporations Preferred Stock.

 

(f) So long as any share of Series K Preferred Stock remains outstanding,
unless the full dividends for the most recently completed Series K Dividend
Period have been declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the
payment thereof has been set aside) on all outstanding shares of Series K
Preferred Stock, during a Series K Dividend Period:

 

(1) no dividend shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment and no
distribution shall be declared or made or set aside for payment on any Series
K Junior Securities (other than (i) a dividend payable solely in Series K
Junior Securities or (ii) any dividend in connection with the implementation
of a stockholders rights plan, or the redemption or repurchase of any rights
under any such plan); and

(2) no shares of Series K Junior Securities shall be repurchased, redeemed
or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or
indirectly (other than (i) as a result of a reclassification of Series K
Junior Securities for or into other Series K Junior Securities, (ii) the
exchange or conversion of one share of Series K Junior Securities for or into
another share of Series K Junior Securities, (iii) through the use of the
proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of Series K
Junior Securities, (iv) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of
shares of Series K Junior Securities in connection with any employment
contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of
employees, officers, directors or consultants, (v) purchases of shares of
Series K Junior Securities pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to
buy Series K Junior Securities existing prior to the most recently completed
Series K Dividend Period, including under a contractually binding stock
repurchase plan or (vi) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of
Series K Junior Securities pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions
of such stock or the security being converted or exchanged), nor shall any
monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of
any such securities by the Corporation.

(g) On any Series K Dividend Payment Date for which full dividends are not
paid, or declared and funds set aside therefor, upon the Series K Preferred
Stock and any shares of any class or series or any securities convertible into
shares of any class or series of other equity securities designated as
ranking on a parity with the Series K Preferred Stock as to payment of
dividends (" _Dividend Parity Stock_ "), all dividends paid or declared for
payment on that Series K Dividend Payment Date with respect to the Series K
Preferred Stock and the Dividend Parity Stock shall be shared: (i) first
ratably by the holders of any shares of such other series of Dividend Parity
Stock who have the right to receive dividends with respect to Dividend
Payment Periods prior to the then-current Dividend Payment Period, in
proportion to their respective amounts of the undeclared and unpaid dividends
relating to prior Dividend Payment Periods; and (ii) thereafter by the holders
of the shares of Series K Preferred Stock and the Dividend Parity Stock on a
_pro rata_ basis. Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, dividends
(payable in cash, stock or otherwise), as may be determined by the Board or a
duly authorized committee of the Board, may be declared and paid on the
Common Stock and any other Series K Junior Securities or any Series K

  ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 Parity Securities from time to time out of any assets legally available for
such payment, and the holders of Series K Preferred Stock shall not be
entitled to participate in any such dividend. 

(h) Dividends on the Series K Preferred Stock will not be declared, paid or
set aside for payment to the extent such act would cause the Corporation to
fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including applicable
capital adequacy guidelines.

 

Section 5\. _Liquidation._

 

(a) Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding
up of the Corporation, holders of Series K Preferred Stock are entitled to
receive out of assets of the Corporation available for distribution to
stockholders, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors and subject to
the rights of holders of any Series K Senior Securities, before
any distribution of assets is made to holders of Common Stock or any other
Series K Junior Securities, a liquidating distribution in the amount of the
liquidation preference of $1,000 per share plus any declared and unpaid
dividends, without regard to, or accumulation of, any undeclared dividends.
Holders of Series K Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any other amounts
from the Corporation after they have received their full liquidating
distribution.

 

(b) In any such distribution, if the assets of the Corporation are not
sufficient to pay the liquidation preferences plus declared and unpaid
dividends in full to all holders of Series K Preferred Stock and all holders
of Series K Parity Securities, if any, as to such distribution with the Series
K Preferred Stock, the amounts paid to the holders of Series K Preferred
Stock and to the holders of all Series K Parity Securities, if any, will be
paid _pro rata_ in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidating
distribution owed to those holders. If the liquidation preference plus
declared and unpaid dividends has been paid in full to all holders of Series
K Preferred Stock and Series K Parity Securities, if any, the holders of the
Corporations Series K Junior Securities shall be entitled to receive all
remaining assets of the Corporation according to their respective rights and
preferences.

(c) For purposes of this section, the merger or consolidation of the
Corporation with any other entity, including a merger or consolidation in
which the holders of Series K Preferred Stock receive cash, securities or
property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange of all
or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation for cash, securities or
other property, shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of the Corporation.

 

Section 6\. _Redemption_.

(a) Series K Preferred Stock is perpetual and has no maturity date. Series K
Preferred Stock is not subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or
other similar provisions. On and after November 25, 2022, Series K Preferred
Stock will be redeemable at the option of the Corporation, in whole or in
part, from time to time, on any Series K Dividend Payment Date, at a
redemption price equal to $1,000 per share, plus any declared and unpaid
dividends, without regard to, or accumulation of, any undeclared dividends,
on the shares of Series K Preferred Stock called for redemption, to but
excluding the redemption date, upon notice given as provided in Subsection (b)
below. Holders of Series K Preferred Stock will have no right to require the
redemption or repurchase of Series K Preferred Stock. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, within 90 days following the occurrence of a Regulatory Capital
Treatment Event, the Corporation, at its option, may redeem, at any time, all
(but not less than all) of the shares of the Series K Preferred Stock at the
time outstanding, at a redemption price equal to $1,000 per share, plus any
declared and unpaid dividends, without regard to, or accumulation of, any
undeclared dividends, on the shares of Series K Preferred Stock called for
redemption, to but excluding the redemption date, upon notice given as
provided in Subsection (b) below.

 

(b) If shares of Series K Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the notice of
redemption shall be given by first class mail to the holders of record of
Series K Preferred Stock to be redeemed, mailed not less than 30 days nor more
than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption thereof (provided that, if
the depositary shares representing Series K Preferred Stock are held in book-
entry form through DTC, the Corporation may give such

  ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 notice in any manner permitted by DTC). Each notice of redemption will
include a statement setting forth: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the number of
shares of Series K Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if less than all the
shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be
redeemed from such holder; (iii) the redemption price; (iv) the place or
places where the certificates evidencing shares of Series K Preferred Stock
are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (v) that
dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the redemption
date. If notice of redemption of any shares of Series K Preferred Stock has
been duly given and if the funds necessary for such redemption have been set
aside by the Corporation for the benefit of the holders of any shares of
Series K Preferred Stock so called for redemption, then, on and after
the redemption date, dividends will cease to accrue on such shares of Series
K Preferred Stock, and such shares of Series K Preferred Stock shall no longer
be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of such shares of Series K
Preferred Stock will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption
price plus any declared and unpaid dividends, to but excluding the redemption
date.

 

(c) In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series K Preferred
Stock at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected
either _pro rata_ or by lot. Subject to the provisions hereof, the Board shall
have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which
shares of Series K Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time. 

(d) Any redemption of the Series K Preferred Stock is subject to receipt by
the Corporation of any required prior approval by the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System (including any successor appropriate federal
banking agency) and to the satisfaction of any conditions set forth in the
capital regulations or guidelines of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (including any successor appropriate federal banking agency)
applicable to redemption of the Series K Preferred Stock.

Except as required by Ohio law, holders of the Series K Preferred Stock will
not have any voting rights and will not be entitled to elect any directors.
In situations in which Ohio law requires mandatory voting rights for a class
of shares, the corporation will, unless prohibited by Ohio law, treat each
series of the Corporations preferred stock, including the Series K Preferred
Stock, as a separate class for voting purposes.

Section 8\. _Conversion Rights_. The holders of shares of Series K
Preferred Stock shall not have any rights to convert such shares into shares

first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the holders of the Series K Preferred
Stock.

with the agreement between the Corporation and the registrar; provided that
