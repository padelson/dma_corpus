economic conditions; the state of capital markets; the impact of adverse changes in Laws or of
adverse regulatory initiatives or proceedings; the level of demand for products and services in the
satellite market; the Corporation&#146;s ability to manage costs and generate productivity improvements;

delay in delivery of satellites; the risk of lower returns on pension plan assets requiring
increased pension expenses and potentially pension plan funding; the financial condition and credit
risk of customers and uncertainties regarding collectibility of receivables; the availability and
cost of capital required to implement the Corporation&#146;s financing plan and fund capital and other
