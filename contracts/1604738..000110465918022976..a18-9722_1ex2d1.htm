object to the Closing Working Capital Statement by delivering to AINC a
written statement setting forth the PM Parties objections in reasonable
detail, indicating each disputed item or amount and the basis for the PM
Parties disagreement therewith (the " _Statement of Objections_ "). If the PM
Parties fail to deliver the Statement of Objections before the expiration of
the Review Period, the Closing Working Capital Statement and the Post-Closing
Adjustment, as the case may be, reflected in the Closing Working Capital
Statement will be deemed to have been accepted by the PM Parties. If the PM
Parties deliver the Statement of Objections before the expiration of the
Review Period, AINC and the PM Parties will negotiate in good faith to resolve
such objections within 30 days after the delivery of the Statement of
Objections (the " _Resolution Period_ "), and, if the same are so resolved
within the Resolution Period, the Post-Closing Adjustment and the Closing
Working Capital Statement with such changes as may have been previously agreed
in writing by AINC and the PM Parties, will be final and binding.

 



 

(iii) If the PM Parties and AINC fail to reach an agreement with respect to

be submitted for resolution to the office of the Independent Accountant who,
acting as experts and not arbitrators, will resolve the Disputed Amounts only
and make any adjustments to the Post-Closing

 



      
 

 



 

Adjustment, as the case may be, and the Closing Working Capital Statement. The
Parties agree that all adjustments will be made without regard to materiality.
The Independent Accountant will only decide the specific items under dispute
by the Parties and their decision for each Disputed Amount must be within the
range of values assigned to each such item in the Closing Working Capital
Statement and the Statement of Objections, respectively.

 



 

(iv) The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant will be paid by the
PM Parties, on the one hand, and by AINC, on the other hand, based upon the
percentage that the amount actually contested but not awarded to the PM
Parties or AINC, respectively, bears to the aggregate amount actually
contested by the PM Parties and AINC.

 



 

(v) The Independent Accountant will make a determination as soon as
practicable within 30 days (or such other time as the Parties agree in
writing) after their engagement, and their resolution of the Disputed Amounts
and their adjustments to the Closing Working Capital Statement and the Post-
Closing Adjustment will be conclusive and binding upon the Parties.

 



 

(vi) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any payment of the Post-
Closing Adjustment, together with interest calculated as set forth below, will
(1) be due (x) within five Business Days of acceptance of the applicable
Closing Working Capital Statement or (y) if there are Disputed Amounts, then
within five Business Days of the resolution described in _Section
2.06(c)(v)_; and (2) be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to such account as is directed by AINC or the PM WC Parties, as the case may
be. The amount of any Post-Closing Adjustment will bear interest from and
including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at a rate per
annum equal to 4.0%. Such interest will be calculated daily on the basis of a
365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed.

or, to the PM Parties Knowledge, threatened: (i) against or by the PM
Companies, in each case on or for their own accounts, affecting any of their
properties or assets used in the Project Management Business in any material
respect (or by or against any PM Party Related Party, in each case on or for
its own account, and relating to the Project Management Business); or (ii)
against or by the PM Companies or any PM Party Related Party, in each case on
or for its own account, that challenges or seeks to prevent, enjoin or
otherwise delay the Transactions, which if determined adversely to the PM
Company would be material to PM LLC or would adversely affect the ability of
the PM Parties to consummate the Transactions.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.16(b),_ there are no material
outstanding Governmental Orders and no material unsatisfied judgments,
penalties or awards against or affecting the Project Management Business or
any of the PM Companies properties or assets used in the Project Management
Business.

 



 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 3.16_ will not apply to any
Actions or Governmental Orders for which any of the PM Companies or any PM
Party Related Party is named therein solely as agent for a Person that is not
PM LLC or a PM Party Related Party.

effect, and will remain in full force and effect following the consummation of
the Transactions without any material increase in charges, fees or penalties
resulting from the Transactions. The Permits used in the Project Management

conditions of all Material Contracts that require the PM Companies to obtain
or keep in force Permits. All fees and charges with respect to such Permits
have been paid in full or, if due and payable prior to Closing, will be paid
prior to Closing in accordance with the payment terms of such Permit. To the

 



      
 

 



 

Knowledge of the PM Parties, no event has occurred that, with or without
notice or lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to result in the
revocation, suspension, lapse or limitation of any Permit set forth in
_Schedule 3.17_. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 3.17_ will not
apply to any Permits held in the name of, or required to be held in the name
of, any Person who is not a PM Company or a PM Party Related Party, even if a
PM Company or a PM Party Related Party acts as agent for such Person.

 



 

(c) None of the representations and warranties contained in this _Section
3.17_ will be deemed to relate to environmental matters (which are governed by
_Section 3.18_), employee benefits matters (which are governed by _Section

(b) To the Knowledge of the PM Parties, there has been no Release of Hazardous
Materials in contravention of Environmental Law with respect to the Project

agent for another Person in connection with the Project Management Business,
such real property operated by any of the PM Companies. During the periods
when any real property was operated by any of the PM Companies as agent for
another Person in connection with the Project Management Business, none of the
PM Companies or the Bennetts received an Environmental Notice that any such
real property (including soils, groundwater, surface water, buildings and
other structure located on any such real property) has been contaminated with
any Hazardous Material that could reasonably be expected to result in an
Environmental Claim against, or a violation of Environmental Law or term of
any Environmental Permit by the PM Companies.

 



 

(c) The PM Parties have provided or otherwise made available to AINC any and
all environmental reports, studies, audits, records, sampling data, site

each "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of § 3(3) of ERISA, whether or
not tax-qualified and whether or not subject to ERISA, which is or has been
maintained, sponsored, contributed to, or required to be contributed to by PM
LLC following the Closing for the benefit of any current or former employee,

any spouse or dependent of such individual, or under which PM LLC or any of
its ERISA Affiliates has or may have any material Liability, or with respect

Liability, contingent or otherwise (and excluding any such plans to be

within the meaning of § 3(37) of ERISA) (each a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") has
been established, administered and maintained in accordance, in all material
respects, with its terms and in compliance, in all material respects, with all
applicable Laws (including

 



      
 

 



 

ERISA, the Code, the Affordable Care Act and any applicable local Laws). Each
Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under § 401(a) of the Code (a "
_Qualified Benefit Plan_ ") is so qualified and has received a favorable and
current determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service, or with
respect to a prototype plan, can rely on an opinion letter from the Internal
Revenue Service to the prototype plan sponsor, to the effect that such
Qualified Benefit Plan is so qualified and that the plan and the trust related
thereto are exempt from federal income taxes under §§ 401(a) and 501(a),
respectively, of the Code, and nothing has occurred that could reasonably be
expected to cause the loss of the Qualified Benefit Plans tax-qualified

material penalty under § 4975 of the Code.

(f) Other than as required under § 601 et. seq. of ERISA, § 4980B of the Code,
or other similar Law, no Benefit Plan provides post-termination or retiree
welfare benefits to any Person for any reason, and PM LLC has no Liability to
provide post-termination or retiree welfare benefits to any Person.

 



 

(g) There is no pending or, to the PM Parties Knowledge, threatened Action
relating to a Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits), and no
Benefit Plan has within the three years prior to the date of this Agreement
been the subject of an examination or audit by a Governmental Authority or the
subject of an application or filing under or is a participant in, an amnesty,
voluntary compliance, self-correction or similar program sponsored by any
Governmental Authority that could reasonably be expected to subject PM LLC or,
with respect to any period on or after the Closing Date, AINC or any of its
Affiliates, to a material Liability.

 



 

(h) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the PM Companies relating
to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, any Benefit Plan

consultant, as applicable. None of the PM Companies has made any
representations to any current or former manager, officer, employee,
independent contractor or consultant, whether or not legally binding, to
adopt, amend, modify or terminate any Benefit Plan or any collective
bargaining agreement.

administered in all material respects in compliance with its terms and the

final regulations) thereunder. PM LLC does not have any obligation to gross
up, indemnify or otherwise reimburse any Person for any excise taxes, interest
or penalties incurred pursuant to § 409A of the Code.

 



 

(j) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Transactions will (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or
subsequent events): (i) entitle any current or former manager, officer,
employee, independent contractor or consultant of PM LLC to material severance
pay or any other material payment; (ii) accelerate the time of payment,
funding or vesting, or increase the amount of any material compensation due to
any such individual; (iii) limit or restrict the right of any of PM LLC to
merge, amend or terminate any Benefit Plan; or (iv) materially increase the

reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to AINCs management as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief
executive officer and chief financial officer of AINC required under the
Exchange Act with respect to such reports. AINC has disclosed, based on its

the PM Parties will be required to provide copies of their individual Tax

(b) In addition to the other obligations under this _Section 6.03_, the PM
Companies and the PM Parties will promptly (and in any event within two
Business Days after receipt thereof by any of the PM Companies, the PM Parties
or their Representatives) advise AINC orally and in writing of any PM Party
Acquisition Proposal, any request for information with respect to any PM Party

the identity of the Person making the same.

 



 

(c) The PM Companies and the PM Parties agree that the rights and remedies for
noncompliance with this _Section 6.03_ will include having such provision
specifically enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction, it being
acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach will cause

 **Section 6.04** ** No Solicitation by AINC; No Adverse AINC

discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted with respect to, or
that could lead to, an AINC Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 6.04(a)_, from the date of this Agreement until
the date that the Required Stockholder Vote has been obtained, following the
receipt by AINC of an unsolicited _bona fide_ written AINC Acquisition
Proposal, (i) AINC Board and the Special Committee will be permitted to
participate in discussions regarding such AINC Acquisition Proposal solely to
clarify the terms of such AINC Acquisition Proposal and (ii) if AINC Board
determines in good faith (A) that such AINC

 



      
 

 



 

Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to an
AINC Superior Proposal and (B) after consultation with outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take the actions set forth in _clauses (x)_ and _(y)_
below with respect to such AINC Acquisition Proposal would be inconsistent
with its duties under applicable law to AINC and its stockholders, then AINC
may, in response to such AINC Acquisition Proposal, (x) furnish access and
non-public information with respect to AINC and its Affiliates to the Person
that has made such AINC Acquisition Proposal and (y) participate in
discussions and negotiations regarding such AINC Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(c) In addition to the other obligations under this _Section 6.04_, AINC will
promptly (and, in any event, within 48 hours after receipt thereof by AINC or
its Representatives) notify the PM Parties orally and in writing if any
inquiries, proposals or offers that could reasonably be expected to result in
an AINC Acquisition Proposal are received by, any such information is
requested from, or any such discussions or negotiation are sought to be
initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms
and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of
any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and
thereafter will keep the PM Parties informed, on a current basis, of the
status and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any amendments
thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations, including any
change in AINCs intentions as previously notified.

 



 

(d) Except as set forth in _Section 6.04(e)_ and _Section 6.04(f)_, AINC
Board or any committee thereof (including the Special Committee) will not (i)
withdraw, modify or amend AINC Recommendation in any manner adverse to PM
Parties, (ii) approve, endorse or recommend an AINC Acquisition Proposal or
(iii) at any time following receipt of an AINC Acquisition Proposal, fail to
reaffirm its approval or recommendation of this Agreement and the Transactions
as promptly as practicable (but in any event within five Business Days after
receipt of any reasonable written request to do so from Bennetts) (any of the
above, an " _Adverse AINC Recommendation_ ").

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, AINC Board or the Special Committee may, at
any time before obtaining the Required Stockholder Vote, to the extent it
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its duties under
applicable law to AINC and its stockholders, in response to an AINC Superior
Proposal received by AINC Board or the Special Committee, make an Adverse AINC
Recommendation, but only if:

 



 

(i) AINC has first provided the PM Parties prior written notice, at least
three Business Days in advance, that it intends to make such Adverse AINC
Recommendation and is prepared to terminate this Agreement to enter into a
Contract with respect to an AINC Superior Proposal, which notice will include
the material terms and conditions of the transaction that constitutes such
AINC Superior Proposal, the

 



      
 

 



 

identity of the Person making such AINC Superior Proposal, and copies of any
Contracts that are proposed to be entered into with respect to such AINC
Superior Proposal; and

 



 

(ii) during the three Business Days after the receipt of such notice (it being
understood and agreed that any material change to the financial or other terms
and conditions of such AINC Superior Proposal will require an additional
notice to PM Parties of a two Business Day period that may, in whole or in
part, run concurrently with the initial three Business Day period), AINC has,
and has caused its Representatives to, negotiate with the PM Parties in good
faith (to the extent the PM Parties desire to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents so that there is no longer a basis for such AINC
Acquisition Proposal to constitute an AINC Superior Proposal.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, AINC Board may, at any time before
obtaining the Required Stockholder Vote, to the extent it determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its duties under applicable law to AINC
and its stockholders, in response to an AINC Intervening Event, make an
Adverse AINC Recommendation, but only if:

 



 

(i) AINC has first provided the PM Parties prior written notice, at least
three Business Days in advance, that it intends to make such Adverse AINC
Recommendation; and

 



 

(ii) during the three Business Days after the receipt of such notice, AINC
has, and has caused its Representatives to, negotiate with the PM Parties in
good faith (to the extent the Bennetts desire to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents so that there is no longer a basis for such withdrawal,
modification or amendment.

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.04_ will be deemed to prohibit AINC
Board from disclosing to the stockholders of AINC a position contemplated by
Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, _provided_ , that
if such disclosure does not reaffirm AINC Recommendation or has the
substantive effect of withdrawing or adversely modifying AINC Recommendation,
such disclosure will be deemed to be an Adverse AINC Recommendation (it being
understood that any "stop, look or listen" communication that contains only
the information set forth in Rule 14d-9(f) will not be deemed to be an Adverse
AINC Recommendation).

 



 

(h) AINC agrees that the rights and remedies for noncompliance with this
_Section 6.04_ will include having such provision specifically enforced by
any court having equity jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that
any such breach or threatened breach will cause irreparable injury to the PM
Parties and that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy to the PM
Parties.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 6.05** ** Notice of Certain Project Management Business Events**.

 



 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, the PM Companies and
the PM Parties will promptly notify AINC in writing of:

 



 

(i) any fact, circumstance, event or action the existence, occurrence or
taking of which (A) has had, or could reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a PM Material Adverse Effect, (B) has
resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, any representation
or warranty made by any of the PM Parties under this Agreement not being true
and correct or (C) has resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result
in, the failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.02_ to be
satisfied;

 



 

(ii) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions;

would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to _Section 3.16_ or
that relates to the consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

(b) AINCs receipt of information pursuant to this _Section 6.05_ will not
operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation, warranty or

and will not be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedules.

 



 

(c) From time to time prior to the Closing, the PM Companies and the PM
Parties will have the right (but not the obligation) to supplement or amend
the Disclosure Schedules hereto with respect to any matter hereafter arising
or of which it becomes aware after the date of this Agreement (each a " _PM
Schedule Supplement_ "). Any disclosure in any such PM Schedule Supplement
will not be deemed to have cured any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, including for purposes
of termination rights contained in this Agreement or of determining whether or
not the conditions set forth in _Section 8.02_ have been satisfied; provided,
however, that if AINC has the right to, but does not elect to, terminate this
Agreement within seven Business Days of its receipt of such PM Schedule

terminate this Agreement with respect to such matter.

Parties will hold, and will cause their Affiliates to hold, and will use their
best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to hold, in confidence

or any of their Affiliates or their respective Representatives are compelled
to disclose any information by judicial or administrative process or by other
requirements of Law, the PM Parties will promptly notify AINC in writing and
will disclose only that portion of such information that the PM Parties are
advised by their counsel in writing is legally required to be disclosed,
_provided that_ the PM Parties will use their reasonable best efforts to
obtain an appropriate protective order or other reasonable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded such information.

required by the MGCL and any other applicable Law or the rules of the New York
Stock Exchange. AINC will cause the Stockholder Meeting to be held as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the mailing of the Proxy Statement. As to be
further provided in the Merger Agreement, AINC will, as promptly as reasonably

6.04(e)_ and _Section 6.04(f)_, will use its reasonable best efforts to

Meeting any information relating to the PM Parties or AINC or any of their
respective Affiliates should be discovered that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement

make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading and (ii) prior to AINC filing the preliminary Proxy
Statement with the SEC, such Party will review the preliminary Proxy Statement
and represent that the Proxy Statement does not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

 



 

(b) The PM Companies and the PM Parties agree to cooperate with AINC in the

Statement or for additional information and will promptly supply the PM
Parties with copies of all correspondence between AINC or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand,
with respect to the Proxy Statement. Each of the Parties agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts, after consultation with the other Parties, to respond
promptly to all such comments of and requests by the SEC. No filing of, or
amendment or

 



      
 

 



 

supplement to, or correspondence to the SEC or its staff, with respect to the

reasonable opportunity to review and propose comments on the Proxy Statement.

Agreements_ "). From and after the Closing, AINC will cause PM LLC to comply
with all of its obligations under this _Section 6.14_ and under the Existing
Indemnification Agreements.

 



 

(e) In the event PM LLC or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and will not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, in any such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors
and assigns of PM LLC will assume the obligations set forth in this _Section
6.14_.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII 
TAX MATTERS**

 



 

 **Section 7.01** ** Tax Covenants**.

 



 

(a) The Parties intend that (i) the Merger and the transfers of PM LLC
Transferred Securities for New Holdco Stock pursuant to this Agreement and the
PM Contribution Agreement (collectively, the " _Exchanges_ ") will be treated
as part of a single plan and will qualify as an exchange under § 351 of the
Code, (ii) the PM

 



      
 

 



 

Contribution will be governed by "Situation 3" of Revenue Ruling 84-111 (or,
at the election of Remington in its sole discretion promptly communicated in
writing to the other Parties prior to the Closing Date (an " _Asset Election_
"), the PM Contribution will be treated by the Parties for U.S. federal income
tax purposes as a contribution of the PM Assets (subject to the applicable
liabilities of the Project Management Business) by the Bennetts and Sharkey to
New Holdco), and (iii) in this connection, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes (and applicable state and local tax purposes), (A) the holders of
AINC Common Stock will be treated as transferring their AINC Common Stock to
New Holdco in exchange for New Holdco Stock pursuant to the Merger, (B)
pursuant to this Agreement and the PM Contribution Agreement, Archie Bennett,
Jr., Monty J. Bennett (and/or, with respect to any applicable state or local
tax law under which MJB Investments is a regarded entity, MJB Investments),
and Sharkey will be treated as transferring the PM LLC Transferred Securities
to New Holdco (or, in the case an Asset Election is made, Archie Bennett, Jr.,
Monty J. Bennett (and/or MJB Investments, as applicable), and Sharkey will be
treated as transferring the PM Assets to New Holdco subject to the applicable
liabilities of the Project Management Business), and (C) New Holdco will be
treated as receiving the PM Assets comprising the Project Management Business
(subject to the applicable liabilities of the Project Management Business)
pursuant to the Contribution Agreement from Archie Bennett, Jr., Monty J.
Bennett (and/or, with respect to any applicable state or local tax law under
which MJB Investments is a regarded entity, MJB Investments), and Sharkey. The
Parties agree (and AINC agrees to cause the AINC Parties) to report the
consummation of such transactions as such for federal income tax (and
applicable state and local tax) purposes. The Parties will (and AINC will
cause the AINC Parties to) duly file their respective tax returns for the
taxable year including the Closing Date containing the information required
under Treasury Regulation § 1.351-3. The Parties will cooperate with each
other in timely providing the information necessary for the filing of such
information and, if requested by the other Parties, will consult with each
other in good faith in preparing such information. Notwithstanding any other
provision in this Agreement, none of the Parties will take (and, in the case
of AINC, AINC will cause the AINC Parties to not take) a position inconsistent
with the treatment described in this _Section 7.01(a)_ on any Tax Return, or
otherwise, except (1) as otherwise required pursuant to a "determination"
within the meaning of § 1313(a) of the Code (or any comparable provision of
any foreign, state, local or foreign law), (2) subject to _Section 7.01(b)_,
to the extent required as a result of a change in Tax Law (or the
clarification or interpretation thereof by a taxing authority in the form of
published guidance) after the date of this Agreement, or (3) with the prior
written consent of each of the Bennetts (or his applicable designated
representative, in the event of disability, or estate, in the event of death)
and AINC (or its applicable permitted successor or assign pursuant to _Section
11.06_), which consent may be withheld in such Partys sole discretion;
_provided_ that, solely with respect to the position described in clauses (ii)
and (iii)(B) of this _Section 7.01(a)_, such consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned with respect to a position that
Asset Treatment (or, in the case an Asset Election is made, Securities
Treatment) applies. Each Party will promptly notify the other Parties upon
receipt of written notice by such Party (or, in the case of AINC, by any AINC
Party) that any Governmental

 



      
 

 



 

Authority is challenging, or requesting information regarding, such tax
treatment or the treatment described in _Section 7.01(b)_. For purposes of
this _Article VII_, for the avoidance of doubt, any action or position taken
by any consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group including any Party
shall also be deemed to be taken by such Party.

 



 

(b) Prior to any AINC Party (or any consolidated, combined, unitary or similar
group including any AINC Party) or any other Party taking any position on a
Tax Return or in connection with any Tax claim or Action or any federal income
tax position reflected in audited financial statements that, in any of the
foregoing cases (i) is inconsistent with the treatment of the Bennetts, MJB
Investments and Sharkey as not recognizing any gain or income pursuant to the
Transactions (other than with respect to any cash received by the PM WC
Parties as a Closing Adjustment or Post-Closing Adjustment pursuant to
_Section 2.06_ or the payment for the Non-Compete in accordance with _Section
7.01(f)_), (ii) is taken pursuant to clause (2) of _Section 7.01(a)_
(relating to a change in, or clarification or interpretation of, the Tax Law),
or (iii) could reasonably be expected to otherwise adversely affect the tax
treatment to any Party (other than an AINC Party) of the Transactions or the
New Holdco Stock in any material respect, New Holdco (in the case of a
position taken by any AINC Party or any consolidated, combined, unitary or
similar group including any AINC Party) or such other Party, as applicable,
shall notify each of the Bennetts (or his applicable designated
representative, in the event of disability, or estate, in the event of death)
and AINC of such position and give each of the Bennetts (or his applicable
designated representative, in the event of disability, or estate, in the event
of death) a reasonable opportunity to dispute such position. The Parties
shall, and New Holdco shall cause the AINC Parties to, cooperate in good faith
to resolve any such dispute.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Closing, without the prior written consent of AINC, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, PM LLC (and
its Representatives) will not (i) make, change or rescind any Tax election of
PM LLC that would be binding on PM LLC for a Post-Closing Tax Period or could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the AINC Parties or (ii) file any
Tax Return of PM LLC on a separate-entity basis. Prior to the Closing, PM LLC
will timely pay all Taxes due and payable by it.

 



 

(d) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added
and other similar Taxes and similar fees (including any penalties and interest
thereon and including any real property transfer Tax and any other similar
Tax) (each, a " _Transfer Tax_ ") incurred in connection with the PM Formation
Transaction or the PM Contribution Transaction will be borne and paid by
Remington and the PM Companies (on behalf of themselves or their Affiliates),
as applicable and subject to _Section 11.01_, when due, and all Transfer
Taxes incurred in connection with the Merger or the New Holdco Restructuring
will be borne and paid by AINC when due. Remington and the PM Companies (on
behalf of themselves or their Affiliates), and the AINC Parties, as
applicable, will cooperate to timely file any Tax Return or other document
with respect to such Transfer Taxes, and the expense of filing such Tax
Returns or other

 



      
 

 



 

documents (" _Transfer Tax Return Expenses_ ") will be borne by the party
responsible for paying the applicable tax (subject to _Section 11.01_).

 



 

(e) Subject to _Section 7.01(c)_, Remington will prepare, or cause to be
prepared, all Excluded Tax Returns required to be filed by PM LLC with respect
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period in a manner consistent with the Transaction
Documents, and Remington shall submit such Tax Return to AINC for its review
and approval as soon as practicable prior to the due date of such Tax Return
(including extensions). Remington will file (or cause to be filed) such
Excluded Tax Returns; _provided_ that, to the extent Remington cannot legally
file (or cause to be filed) any such Excluded Tax Return, New Holdco will file
(or cause to be filed) such Tax Return as prepared by Remington and agreed by
New Holdco. New Holdco will prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or
cause to be filed, all other Tax Returns required to be filed by PM LLC after
the Closing Date with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (excluding any
Excluded Tax Return and any Tax Return of Remington and/or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than PM LLC) or any consolidated, combined, unitary or
similar group that includes any of the foregoing) that have not been filed
before the Closing. New Holdco will cause such Tax Returns to be prepared in a
manner consistent with the Transaction Documents and will submit to the PM
Parties for their review and approval any such Tax Return prior to the filing
thereof and as soon as practicable prior to the due date thereof (including
extensions). If a PM Party objects to any item on, or otherwise has any
objections with respect to, any such Tax Return prepared (or caused to be
prepared) by New Holdco, such PM Party will, within ten days after delivery of
such Tax Return, notify New Holdco in writing that he so objects, specifying
with particularity any such item or other objection and stating the specific
factual or legal basis for any such objection. If a notice of objection will
be duly delivered, New Holdco and such PM Party will negotiate in good faith
and use their reasonable best efforts to resolve such items or other
objections. If New Holdco and such PM Party are unable to reach such agreement
within ten days after receipt by New Holdco of such notice, the disputed items
or objections will be resolved by the Independent Accountant and any
determination by the Independent Accountant will be final. The Independent
Accountant will resolve any disputed items and objections within 20 days of
having the dispute referred to it pursuant to such procedures as it may
require. If the Independent Accountant is unable to resolve any disputed items
or objections before the due date for such Tax Return, New Holdco will cause
the Tax Return to be timely filed as prepared by New Holdco, and then amended
to reflect the Independent Accountants resolution, to the extent such
resolution differs from the Tax Return originally filed by New Holdco (or AINC
Party, as applicable). The costs, fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountant will be borne by New Holdco and the Bennetts in the same proportion
by which their respective positions as initially presented to the Independent
Accountant (based on the aggregate of all differences taken as a whole)
differs from the final resolution as determined by the Independent Accountant.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.01(e)_ or
otherwise, other than an Excluded Tax Return required to be filed by PM LLC,
Remington shall not be required to provide (and AINC shall have no right or
obligation to prepare (or cause to be prepared) or file (or cause to be filed)
or review rights with

 



      
 

 



 

respect to) any Tax Return of Remington and/or any of its Subsidiaries (other
than PM LLC) or any consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group that
includes any of the foregoing. If any Tax Return of Remington, any of its
Subsidiaries (other than PM LLC), or any consolidated, combined, unitary or
similar group would be treated as an Excluded Tax Return but for this
sentence, (i) Excluded Tax Returns will include only that portion of such Tax
Return, if any, relating solely to PM LLC, and (ii) if the portion of such Tax
Return relating solely to PM LLC cannot be readily determined (in the
reasonable good-faith discretion of Remington), then at the option of
Remington, such Tax Return shall not be treated as an Excluded Tax Return and
the term Excluded Tax Return shall instead include a pro forma of such Tax
Return prepared (or caused to be prepared) by Remington that reflects solely
the information on such Tax Return related to PM LLC. No election (if
available) comparable to the election under Section 706 of the Code, or
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii), for the ratable allocation of
income shall be made with respect to PM LLC or the Project Management Business
for the taxable year in which the Closing takes place, without the prior
written consent of all PM Parties and AINC.

 



 

(f) The Parties agree that the value of the Non-Compete for U.S. federal
income tax purposes (the " _Non-Compete Value_ ") and all other applicable
purposes is $10,000. Of this $10,000 value, an amount equal to $5,000 is
allocable to Archie Bennett, Jr., and an amount equal to $5,000 is allocable
to Monty J. Bennett. The consideration paid by the AINC Parties for such Non-
Compete is the assumption and payment by New Holdco of an applicable portion
of the Transaction Costs under _Section 11.01_ in an amount equal to the Non-
Compete Value. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents, none of the Parties will take (and AINC shall
cause each AINC Party to not take) any position on any Tax Return, or
otherwise, that is inconsistent with this _Section 7.01(f)_, except (i) as
otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of §
1313(a) of the Code (or any comparable provision of any state, local or
foreign law) or (ii) with the prior written consent of each of the Bennetts
(or his applicable designated representative, in the event of disability, or
estate, in the event of death) and AINC (or its applicable permitted successor
or assign pursuant to _Section 11.06_); _provided_ that each of the AINC
Parties, the Bennetts (or his applicable designated representative, in the
event of disability, or estate, in the event of death) and MJB Investments
shall be entitled to settle any deficiency or adjustment proposed by any
taxing authority resulting from a challenge to such treatment (after providing
written notice of the proposed settlement to the others) to the extent such
settlement is not binding on (and could not otherwise adversely affect) Archie
Bennett, Jr. (other than in the case of a settlement by Archie Bennett, Jr.),
Monty J. Bennett (other than in the case of a settlement by Monty J. Bennett
or MJB Investments), MJB Investments (other than in the case of a settlement
by Monty J. Bennett or MJB Investments) or the AINC Parties (other than in the
case of a settlement by any of the AINC Parties). The AINC Parties and each
Bennett (or his applicable designated representative, in the event of
disability, or estate, in the event of death) will promptly notify each other
upon receipt of written notice by such Party (or, in the case of AINC, any of
the AINC Parties) that

 



       
 

 



 

any Governmental Authority is challenging, or requesting information
regarding, the treatment described in this _Section 7.01(f)_.

 



 

(g) The Parties agree to use the alternate procedure (as set forth in Revenue
Procedure 2004-53) with respect to wage reporting for the Project Management
Business in connection with the Transactions.

 



 

(h) The AINC Parties, Sharkey and the Bennetts will not knowingly (and, as
applicable, will cause their respective subsidiaries to not) (i) take any
action, or fail to take any action, as a result of which the Exchanges would
fail to qualify as an exchange described in § 351 of the Code (and any
comparable provisions of applicable state or local law) or (ii) enter into any
contract, agreement, commitment or arrangement to take or fail to take any
such action; _provided_ that each Party may undertake any transaction
expressly contemplated in the Transaction Documents. Each of the AINC Parties,
Sharkey and the Bennetts will use commercially reasonable efforts (and, as
applicable, cause their respective subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable
efforts) to cause the Exchanges to qualify as an exchange described in § 351
of the Code (and any comparable provisions of applicable foreign, state or
local law).

 



 

 **Section 7.02** **Prohibited Actions**. Subject to and to the extent not
inconsistent with _Section 7.05_, without the prior written consent of the PM
Parties (which consent will not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or
withheld), the AINC Parties will not (and will cause their Affiliates,
subsidiaries and respective Representatives to not) (a) amend any Tax Return
of PM LLC for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period or file an Excluded
Tax Return (other than at the request of Remington pursuant to _Section
7.01(e)_), (b) initiate contact with taxing authorities regarding Taxes or Tax
items of PM LLC or with respect to the Project Management Business with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (c) make any voluntary disclosures with
respect to Taxes or Tax items of PM LLC or with respect to the Project
Management Business for Pre-Closing Tax Periods, (d) make any Tax election
that has retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period of PM LLC or the
Project Management Business, or (e) take any action having retroactive effect
to the Closing Date or prior to the Closing Date with respect to PM LLC (other
than taking a position in accordance with _Section 7.01(b)_) that could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the tax treatment of the PM
Formation Transaction to the Bennetts. Without the prior written consent of
AINC (which consent will not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or
withheld), the PM Parties will not (and will cause their Affiliates,
subsidiaries and respective Representatives (in each case, other than any AINC
Party) to not) (i) amend any Excluded Tax Return that was subject to the
approval of an AINC Party pursuant to _Section 7.01(e)_ in any manner that
could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on any AINC Party or
(ii) file any Tax Return in a manner that is not consistent with the
Transaction Documents.

 



 

 **Section 7.03Termination of Existing Tax Sharing Agreements**. Any and all
existing Tax sharing agreements (whether written or not), other than Excluded
Tax Contracts, binding upon PM LLC will be terminated as of the Closing Date.
After such

 



      
 

 



 

date none of PM LLC, the PM Parties or any of the PM Parties Affiliates or
their respective Representatives will have any further rights or liabilities
thereunder.

 



 

 **Section 7.04** **Straddle Period**. In the case of Taxes that are payable
with respect to a taxable period that begins on or before and ends after the
Closing Date (each such period, a " _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of any
such Taxes that are attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period for purposes of
this Agreement will be:

 



 

(a) in the case of (A) Taxes based upon, or measured by, income, receipts,
profits, or payroll, (B) sales, use and similar Taxes imposed in connection
with the sale, transfer or assignment of property, or (C) withholding Taxes
required to be withheld with respect to a particular payment, deemed equal to
the amount that would be payable if the taxable year ended on the Closing
Date; _provided_ that any taxable income or gain resulting from the New Holdco
Restructuring or from any action taken by an AINC Party after the Closing not
in the ordinary course of business or not consistent with the Transaction
Documents shall be allocated to the Post-Closing Tax Period for this purpose;
and

 



 

(b) in the case of other Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the
entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the number of days in the entire period.

 



 

 **Section 7.05** **Contests**. New Holdco agrees to give written notice to
the PM Parties of the receipt of any written notice by any AINC Party, and the
PM Parties agree to give to New Holdco written notice of the receipt of any
written notice by any of them, that relates (in whole or in part) to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period and involves the assertion of any claim,
or the commencement of any Action, with respect to PM LLC or the Project
Management Business (but excluding any partner-level proceeding or claim of
either of the Bennetts or MJB Investments or Sharkey) (a " _Tax Claim_ ")
which could result in liability for, or could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect, the other Party. The PM Parties (i) shall control, at their
own expense, the contest or resolution of any Tax Claim that is a Remington
Tax Claim and (ii) shall have the right (but not the obligation) to control,
at their own expense, the contest or resolution of any other Tax Claim that
relates solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period; _provided_ , that, if the Tax
Claim is not a Remington Tax Claim, (a) the PM Parties will have provided
written notice to New Holdco within 30 days of the receipt of written notice
of the Tax Claim of their intention to control such Tax Claim, and (b) the PM
Parties will obtain the prior written consent of New Holdco (which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) before entering into any
settlement or concession of such Tax Claim if such settlement or concession
could reasonably be expected to adversely affect any AINC Party; _provided_ ,
further, that to the extent such Tax Claim could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect any AINC Party, New Holdco will be entitled to participate in
the defense of such Tax Contest and to employ counsel of its choice for such
purpose, the fees and expenses of which separate counsel will be borne by New
Holdco. Unless the PM Parties have timely notified the AINC Parties that they
will control a Tax Claim (other than a Remington Tax Claim), the AINC Parties
may

 



      
 

 



 

control the contest or resolution of and defend against such Tax Claim;
_provided_ that the AINC Parties will promptly notify the PM Parties upon
taking control of such Tax Claim and the PM Parties will be entitled to
participate in the defense of such Tax Claim and to employ counsels of their
choice for such purpose, the fees and expenses of which separate counsel will
be borne by the respective PM Parties; _provided_ further that such Tax Claim
may not be settled or conceded without the prior written consent of the PM
Parties, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the
event of a conflict between this _Section 7.05_ and any other section of this
Agreement, this _Section 7.05_ will govern with respect to the control of Tax
Claims.

 



 

 **Section 7.06** **Cooperation and Exchange of Information**. The PM Parties
and New Holdco will provide each other with such cooperation and information
as either of them reasonably may request of the other in filing any Tax Return
pursuant to this _Article VII_ or in connection with any audit or other
proceeding in respect of Taxes of PM LLC or the Project Management Business,
including the execution of any power of attorney that is reasonably required
in connection with a Tax Claim controlled by the PM Parties pursuant to
_Section 7.05_ and the signing of any Tax Return of PM LLC prepared (or
caused to be prepared) by Remington. Such cooperation and information will
also include the AINC Parties providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or
portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules, related work papers
and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by tax authorities
(or applicable portions thereof). Upon the request of any AINC Party, the PM
Parties and Sharkey shall promptly provide tax basis information relating to
the PM Assets as of the Closing to New Holdco. New Holdco will retain all Tax
Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other documents in its
possession (or in the possession of any AINC Party) relating to Tax matters of
PM LLC or the Project Management Business for any taxable period beginning
before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations of
the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and other documents relate.
Prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any Tax Returns, schedules and
work papers, records and other documents in its possession relating to Tax
matters of PM LLC or the Project Management Business for any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date, the AINC Parties will provide the PM
Parties with reasonable written notice and offer the PM Parties the
opportunity to take custody of such materials.

 



 

 **Section 7.07** **Survival**. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the provisions of _Section 3.21_, _Section 4.08_ and this
_Article VII_ will survive for the full period of all applicable statutes of
limitations (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof)
plus six months.

 



 

 **Section 7.08** **PM LLC and AINC**. New Holdco shall cause PM LLC to
remain in existence and be treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal
income tax purposes (and any applicable foreign, state or local tax purposes,
to the extent permitted under applicable law) for all taxable periods (or
portions thereof) beginning at or after the effective time of the PM
Contribution and ending on or prior to the two-year anniversary of the Closing
Date, except to the extent each of the Bennetts (or his applicable designated
representative, in the event of disability, or estate, in the event of death)

 



      
 

 



 

provides prior written consent for an alternative treatment. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, without the prior written consent of each of
the Bennetts (or his applicable designated representative, in the event of
disability, or estate, in the event of death), New Holdco will ensure that no
election is made for PM LLC to be taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal
income tax purposes (and that no election is made for PM LLC to be taxable as
a corporation for any applicable foreign, state or local tax purposes) for any
taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the two-year
anniversary of the Closing Date (including any Pre-Closing Tax Period). AINC
hereby confirms that it does not have any current plan or intension to
dissolve or liquidate (or allow itself to be treated as having been dissolved
or liquidated, or being in the process of dissolving or liquidating, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes or applicable foreign, state or local tax
purposes), merge into any Person, or transfer all or substantially all of its
assets.

 



 

 **Section 7.09 Officers Certificates. **Officers of New Holdco and AINC
shall execute and deliver to tax counsel for the Bennetts certificates in the
form agreed to by the Parties at such time or times as may reasonably be
requested by such tax counsel, in connection with such tax counsels delivery
of the opinion pursuant to Section 8.03(j). Each AINC Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts (and cause its Subsidiaries to use
commercially reasonable efforts) not to take or cause to be taken any action
that would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be taken any
action which would cause to be untrue) any of the certifications and
representations included in the certificates described in this Section 7.09.

 



 

 **Section 7.10 Tax Opinions**. AINC shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take or cause to be taken any action reasonably necessary to ensure
the receipt of the opinions described in _Section 8.01(g), Section 8.02(h)_
and _Section 8.03(j)_ and will cooperate with the counsel or accountants that
are to render such opinions, including by providing to Norton Rose Fulbright
US LLP and New Holdcos REIT Lawyers (or such other applicable counsel)
certificates at such time or times and in such form as reasonably requested by
the recipient in connection with such recipients delivery of such opinion.
Subject to the final sentence of this _Section 7.10_, the PM Parties and the
PM Companies shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
take or cause to be taken any action reasonably necessary to ensure the
receipt of the opinions described in _Section 8.01(g)_, _Section 8.02(h)_
and Section 8.03(j) and will cooperate with the counsel or accountants that
are to render such opinions, including by providing to Norton Rose Fulbright
US LLP, New Holdcos REIT Lawyers and the Bennetts tax counsel (or such other
applicable counsel) certificates at such time or times and in such form as
reasonably requested by the recipient in connection with such recipients
delivery of such opinion. Each of the PM Parties and the PM Companies shall
use commercially reasonable efforts not to take or cause to be taken any
action that would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be taken
any action which would cause to be untrue) any of the certifications and
representations included in the certificates provided by it described in this
Section 7.10. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none
of the PM Parties or the PM Companies shall bear

 



      
 

 



 

or be responsible for any fees or expenses for or with respect to the issuance
of the opinions described in _Section 8.01(g)_ and _Section 8.02(h)_.

 



 

 **Section 7.11 **_Sharkey Interest_. Except as provided in the proviso to
the next succeeding sentence, the Parties hereto agree that any withholding or
other Tax Liability relating or attributable to the distribution of PM LLC
Transferred Securities to Sharkey pursuant to the PM Formation Transaction
and/or the receipt of New Holdco Stock by Sharkey under this Agreement and the
PM Contribution Agreement (or otherwise relating to the Interest) shall be the
responsibility of Remington or Sharkey and not the responsibility of New
Holdco, AINC, any of their Affiliates or PM LLC. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, no such withholding or other Tax Liability shall be treated as
assumed by New Holdco, AINC, any of their Affiliates or PM LLC, provided,
however, that any withholding or Tax Liability may be designated by Remington,
in its discretion, as a Transaction Cost that is reimbursable or assumable by
New Holdco in accordance with, and subject to the limitations specified in,
_Section 11.01_.

any provision or document to be drafted;

 



      
 

 



 

(f) the Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits referred to in this Agreement will
be construed with, and as an integral part of, this Agreement to the same
extent as if they were set forth verbatim in this Agreement:

 



 

(g) use of terms that imply gender will include all genders;

 



 

(h) defined terms will have their meanings in the singular and the plural
case;

 



 

(i) the headings in this Agreement are for reference only and will not affect
the interpretation of this Agreement;

 



 

(j) time is of the essence with respect to this Agreement; and

 



 

(k) the word "will" will not be deemed a mere prediction of future events.

 



 

 **Section 11.04** ** Severability**. If any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other term or
provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or
provision in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or
unenforceable, (a) the Parties will agree on a suitable and equitable
provision to be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be
valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable
provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will not be affected by such
invalidity or unenforceability, nor will such invalidity or unenforceability
affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application
thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

 



 

 **Section 11.05** ** Entire Agreement**. This Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents constitute the sole and entire agreement of the Parties
with respect to the subject matter contained in this Agreement and in the
other Transaction Documents, and supersede all prior written, and prior and
contemporaneous oral, understandings, negotiations, arrangements and
agreements, with respect to such subject matter. In the event of any
inconsistency between the statements in the body of this Agreement and those
in the other Transaction Documents, the Exhibits and Disclosure Schedules
(other than an exception expressly set forth as such in the Disclosure
Schedules), the statements in the body of this Agreement will control.

 



 

 **Section 11.06** ** Successors and Assigns**. This Agreement will be
binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. No Party may assign its rights or delegate
its obligations (by operation of law or otherwise) under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other Parties, which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. No assignment will relieve the assigning
Party of any of its obligations under this Agreement. Any assignment or
delegation in violation of this _Section 11.06_ is void and of no effect.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 11.07** ** No Third-Party Beneficiaries**. This Agreement is for
the sole benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to, or
will, confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties.
Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver
by the Parties hereto in accordance with _Article VIII_ without notice of
liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of
risks associated with particular matters regardless of knowledge of any of the
Parties. Consequently, Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 



 

 **Section 11.08** ** Amendment and Modification; Waiver**. This Agreement
may only be amended, modified or supplemented by an agreement in writing
signed by each Party. No waiver by any Party of any of the provisions of this
Agreement will be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed
by the Party so waiving. No waiver by any Party will operate or be construed
as a waiver in respect of any failure, breach or default not expressly
identified by such written waiver, whether of a similar or different
character, and whether occurring before or after that waiver. No failure to
exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege
arising from this Agreement will operate or be construed as a waiver thereof;
nor will any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or
privilege under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 11.08_, no amendment, modification,
supplement, or waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be effective,
and no determination may be made by AINC under this Agreement, and no action
with respect to this Agreement can be made by AINC, without the prior written
approval of the Special Committee.

 



 

 **Section 11.09** ** Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial**.

 



 

(a) This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of Maryland without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or rule or any other principle that could require
the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

 



 

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT

 



      
 

 



 

(I) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR
OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (II) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY,
AND (IV) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _Section
11.09(b)_.

 



 

 **Section 11.10** ** Specific Performance**. The Parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and that the Parties
will be entitled to specific performance of the terms of this Agreement, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity
without the need to demonstrate irreparable harm or to post any bond or
surety.

 



 

 **Section 11.11** ** Counterparts**. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts (including by portable document format (pdf)), each of which will
be deemed an original, but all of which together will be deemed to be one and
the same agreement. A signed copy of this Agreement delivered by facsimile,
e-mail or other means of electronic transmission will be deemed to have the
same legal effect as delivery of an original signed copy of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 11.12** ** Special Committee**. No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement will be effective, and no determination may be
made by AINC under this Agreement, and no action with respect to this
Agreement can be made by AINC, without the prior written approval of the
Special Committee.
