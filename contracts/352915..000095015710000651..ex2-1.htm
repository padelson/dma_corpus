ARTICLE II

  

  

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

  

  

SECTION 2.01 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities:

  

  

(a) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock
(all issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock being hereinafter
collectively referred to as the "Shares") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (except as set forth in Section 2.01(b) and any
Dissenting Shares) shall be canceled and shall be converted automatically into
the right to receive $33.75 in cash, without interest (the "Merger
Consideration"). The Merger Consideration is payable in accordance with
Section 2.02(b).

  

  

(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. Each Share held in
the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by Merger Sub or Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled
without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made
with respect thereto.

  

  

(c) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

SECTION 2.02 Exchange of Certificates. (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall (i) appoint a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the "Paying Agent"), and (ii) enter into a paying
agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company,
with such Paying Agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Article II. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Paying Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of Shares, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.01(a)
(such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; provided, however, that
such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States
of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of
such bank which are then publicly available). Any net profit resulting from,
or interest or income produced by, such investments shall be payable to the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause to be mailed to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of
record of Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.01(a): (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form
and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Shares to the
Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
certificates evidencing such Shares (the "Certificates") or the non-
certificated Shares represented by book-entry ("Book-Entry Shares") in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon (A) surrender of a Certificate to
the Paying Agent for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, or (B) receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agent's message" in the
case of Book-Entry Shares, and, in each case, such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration which such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II,
and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger
Consideration may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered are registered if the
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares representing such Shares shall be presented
to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the
person requesting such payment shall pay any fiduciary or surety bonds or any
transfer or other Taxes required solely by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Shares or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent
that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall
be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration to which the holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is entitled pursuant to this Article II.
No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this Article
II.

  

  

(c) No Further Rights. From and after the Effective Time, holders of Shares
shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, except as
provided herein or by Law.

  

  

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Shares one year after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any
holders of Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Corporation for, and Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of their claim
for the Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining
unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date which is immediately prior to such
time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

(e) No Liability. None of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any cash
(including any dividends or distributions with respect to such Shares)
delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

(f) Withholding Rights. Each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares or
Company Stock Options such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to such payment under all applicable federal, state or local Tax
Laws and pay such withholding amount over to the appropriate taxing authority.
To the extent that amounts are so properly withheld by the Paying Agent, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Shares or Company Stock Options in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

  

  

(g) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, then upon (i) the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and (ii) if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of an
indemnity bond in form and substance and with surety reasonably satisfactory
to the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the
holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(a).

  

  

SECTION 2.03 Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law. On or after the Effective
Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the Paying Agent or
Parent for any reason shall be canceled against delivery of the Merger
Consideration to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section
2.01(a).

  

  

SECTION 2.04 Company Stock Options and Restricted Stock. (a) Between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary
action (which action shall be effective as of the Effective Time), to (i)
terminate the Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. Equity Incentive Plan, the
Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. Outside Directors' Stock Incentive Plan and the
2010 Long-Term Equity Compensation Plan (collectively, the "Company Stock
Plans"), (ii) provide that each outstanding option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans (each, a "Company
Stock Option") that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, whether or not vested or exercisable, shall become fully
vested and exercisable as of the Effective Time, (iii) cancel, as of the
Effective Time, each Company Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised,
as of the Effective Time (in each case, without the creation of additional
liability to the Company or any Subsidiaries), subject, if applicable, to the
payment pursuant to Section 2.04(b) and (iv) provide that each share of
restricted Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully
vested and transferable and that all restrictions on such restricted Company
Common Stock shall lapse as of the Effective Time and accordingly will be
eligible to receive the per share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.01(a).

(b) Each holder of a Company Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and has an exercise price per
Share that is less than the per share Merger Consideration shall (subject to
the provisions of this Section 2.04) be paid by the Surviving Corporation
promptly after the Effective Time, in exchange for the cancellation of such
Company Stock Option, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the
difference between the per share Merger Consideration and the applicable
exercise price of such Company Stock Option, and (ii) the aggregate number of
Shares that remain issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option. Any
such payments shall be subject to all applicable federal, state and local Tax
withholding requirements. In the event that the exercise price per share of a
Company Stock Option is greater than or equal to the per share Merger
Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be canceled without
consideration and have no further force or effect.

  

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all steps reasonably
necessary to cause the Transactions and any other dispositions of Company
Common Stock or other equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities) in connection with this Agreement by each person who is a director
or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, as amended.

  

  

SECTION 2.05 Dissenting Shares. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary and to the extent available under the DGCL, Shares
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held
by any stockholder who is entitled to demand and properly demands the
appraisal for such Shares (the "Dissenting Shares") pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL
("Section 262") shall not be converted into, or represent the right to
receive, the Merger Consideration. Any such stockholder shall instead be
entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such stockholder's Dissenting
Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262; provided, however,
that all Dissenting Shares held by any stockholder who shall have failed to
perfect or who otherwise shall have withdrawn or lost such stockholder's
rights to appraisal of such Shares under Section 262 shall thereupon be deemed
to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon, upon surrender in the manner provided in Section 2.02 of any
Certificate or the Book-Entry Shares that formerly evidenced such Shares.

  

  

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands received
by the Company for appraisal of any Shares, withdrawals of such demands and
any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any
such demands.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  

  

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent and Merger Sub concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") (provided that, disclosure of
any fact or item in any section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall,
should the existence of such fact or item be relevant to any other section, be
deemed to be disclosed with respect to that other section so long as the
relevance of such disclosure to such other section is reasonably apparent on
its face), or as disclosed in the SEC Reports (but excluding any disclosures
set forth in any risk factor section, any disclosures in any section relating
to forward looking statements and any other disclosures included therein to
the extent they are predictive or forward-looking in nature) filed prior to

SECTION 3.01 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. (a) Each of the
Company and each Subsidiary of the Company is a corporation, limited liability
company, general partnership, or limited partnership duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization and has the requisite power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, validly existing and
in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and
each Subsidiary of the Company is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign
corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction
where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except
for such failures to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The term "Company Material Adverse Effect"
means (i) any event, circumstance, state of facts, change or effect that is
materially adverse to the business, financial condition or results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) any
event, circumstance, state of facts, change or effect that would prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Merger or otherwise prevent the
Company from performing its obligations under this Agreement; provided,
however, that in no event shall any of the following, alone or in combination,
be deemed to constitute, nor shall any of the following be taken into account
in determining whether there has been or would reasonably be expected to be, a
Company Material Adverse Effect (except, in the case of clauses (A)(1), (A)(2)
or 
 (A)(4) below, to the extent any of the matters referred to therein has had
or would reasonably be expected to have a disproportionate adverse effect on
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other for-
profit and comparable or similar companies operating in the industries in
which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate, after taking into account the
size of the Company relative to such other for-profit companies): (A) any
event, circumstance, state of facts, change or effect resulting from or
relating to (1) a change in general economic, political or financial market
conditions, including interest or exchange rates, (2) a change generally
affecting the industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate
(including seasonal fluctuations) or general economic conditions that
generally affect the industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries
conduct their business, (3) any change in accounting requirements or
principles required by GAAP (or any interpretations thereof) or required by
any change in applicable Laws (or any interpretations thereof), (4) any
adoption, implementation, promulgation, repeal, modification, reinterpretation
or proposal of any Law after the date hereof, (5) any Action, investigation,
review or examination undertaken by a Governmental Authority, or any sanction,
fine, operating restriction or other similar penalty arising as a result
thereof, with respect to any Company Health Care Business or Company Health
Care Facility (a "Regulatory Condition"), that is currently pending or arises
after the date of this Agreement, in each case to the extent such Regulatory
Condition is consistent in nature, scope and impact on the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, with Regulatory Conditions arising and fully
resolved from time to time in the conduct of the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries on or before December 31, 2009, (6) any acts of terrorism or
war or any weather related event, fire or natural disaster or any escalation
thereof, (7) the announcement of the execution of this Agreement or the
pendency or consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (collectively, the "Transactions"), including any Actions,
challenges or investigations to the extent relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions made or brought by any of the current or former stockholders of
the Company (on their own behalf or on behalf of the Company), (8) the
identity of Parent or any of its affiliates as the acquiror of the Company or
any facts or circumstances concerning Parent or any of its affiliates, or (9)
compliance with the terms of, the taking of any action required or the failure
to take any action prohibited by, this Agreement or the taking of any action
consented to or requested by Parent or (B) any failure, in and of itself, to
meet internal or published projections, forecasts, performance measures,
operating statistics or revenue or earnings predictions for any period or a
decline in the price or trading volume of the Company Common Stock (provided
that, except as otherwise provided in this definition, the underlying causes
of such failure or decline may be taken into account in determining whether
there is a Company Material Adverse Effect).

available to Parent a complete and correct copy of the Certificate of
Incorporation and the By-Laws (or similar organizational documents), each as
amended to date, of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries. Such
Certificates of Incorporation and By-Laws or similar organizational documents

is in violation of any of the provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation
or By-Laws or similar organizational documents, except, in the case of any
Subsidiary of the Company, for violations that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other
instrument or obligation to which the Company or any such Subsidiary is a
party or by which the Company or any such Subsidiary or any property or asset
of the Company or any such Subsidiary is bound or affected, except, with

state, local or foreign government, regulatory or administrative authority, or
any court, tribunal, or judicial or arbitral body (a "Governmental
Authority"), except for (i) applicable requirements, if any, of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), (ii) the filing with

the Company is in possession of all licenses, interim licenses,
qualifications, exemptions, registrations, permits, approvals, accreditations,
certificates of occupancy and other certificates, franchises and other
authorizations of any Governmental Authority necessary for each such entity to
own, lease and operate its properties or to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted (the "Company Permits"), except where the failure to have, or
the suspension or cancellation of, any of the Company Permits would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, no suspension or
cancellation of any of the Company Permits is pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened in writing, except where the failure to have, or the
suspension or cancellation of, any of the Company Permits would not,

or (ii) any contract or Company Permit to which such entity is a party or by
which such entity or any property or asset of such entity is bound, except,
with respect to clauses (i) and (ii), for any such conflicts, defaults,
breaches or violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, (x) each Company Healthcare Facility
is in compliance with the requirements of and conditions for participating in
the Government Programs such facility participates in as of the date of this
Agreement and (y) all claims for payment or cost reports filed or required to
be filed by each Company Healthcare Facility under any Government Program or
any private payor program have been prepared and filed in accordance with all

make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading, except that no representation is made by the Company
with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the

of its affiliates is subject to any continuing order of, consent decree,
settlement agreement or other similar written agreement with, any Governmental

its operations only as contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 4.08 Financing. Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete
copies of an executed commitment letter, including excerpts of those portions

conditions to funding or "flex" provisions or other substantive provisions
(excluding only those provisions related solely to fees and economic terms
agreed to by the parties) regarding the terms and conditions of the financing
to be provided thereby (together, the "Commitment Letter"), pursuant to which
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has committed to provide Parent and Merger Sub with
financing in an aggregate amount of $4,150.0 million. The Commitment Letter,
in the form so delivered, is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid
and binding obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent as of the
date of this Agreement, the other parties thereto. No event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default or breach on the part of Parent under the Commitment Letter. Parent
has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the
Commitment Letter to be paid as of the date hereof. Parent shall have at the
Closing and at the Effective Time immediately available funds in an amount

financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter is subject to no contingency
or conditions other than those set forth in the copies of the Commitment
Letter delivered to the Company. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has
no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the financing contemplated
by the Commitment Letter will not be satisfied or that such financing will not
be available to Merger Sub on the date of the Closing. For the avoidance of
doubt, it shall not be a condition to Closing for Parent to obtain any
financing.

SECTION 6.01 Proxy Statement; Company Stockholders' Meeting. (a) As promptly
as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall prepare and file with the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement. Each of
the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning itself and its
affiliates that is required to be included in the Proxy Statement or that is
customarily included in proxy statements prepared in connection with
transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Company
and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's stockholders as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the date on which the Proxy Statement
is cleared by the SEC. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC
or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement. If, at any
time prior to the Company Stockholders' Meeting, any information relating to
the Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates, officers or
directors should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy
Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholders'

sufficient favorable voting power to secure the vote of the stockholders of
the Company necessary to satisfy the condition set forth in Section 7.01(a),
shall not postpone or adjourn such meeting except to the extent required by
Law. Subject to Section 6.03(b), the Company Board shall (i) recommend to
holders of the Shares that they adopt this Agreement, (ii) include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (iii) use its reasonable best
efforts to solicit and obtain the Stockholder Approval. For clarity, the
Company acknowledges that its obligations pursuant to the first sentence of

Proposal.

  

  

SECTION 6.02 Access to Information; Confidentiality. (a) Except as otherwise
prohibited by applicable Law or the terms of any contract entered into prior
to the date hereof or as would be reasonably expected to violate any attorney-
client privilege, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to), at Parent's expense:
(i) provide to Parent and to the officers, directors, employees, accountants,
consultants, legal counsel, financing sources, agents and other
representatives (collectively, with respect to any person, its
"Representatives") of Parent reasonable access, during normal business hours
and upon reasonable prior notice to the Company by Parent, to the officers,
employees, agents, properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof, and (ii) furnish as
promptly as practicable to Parent such information concerning the business,
properties, Contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel and other aspects of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent or its Representatives may reasonably
request.

accordance with the confidentiality agreement, dated April 18, 2010 (the

SECTION 6.03 Solicitation. (a) Except as permitted by this Section 6.03, from
the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the
termination of the Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, the Company
agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, nor shall it
authorize or permit its Subsidiaries and Representatives to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage any inquiries or the
implementation or submission of any Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) participate
in discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any non-
public information in connection with, any Acquisition Proposal except to
notify such person of the existence of this Section 6.03(a) (including, in
each case, with respect to any person that has previously been invited into a
process to make, or participate in any discussions regarding, an Acquisition
Proposal); provided, however, that, prior to the adoption of this Agreement by
the Company's stockholders at the Company Stockholders' Meeting, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board
(acting through the Special Committee or otherwise) from furnishing
information to, or engaging in negotiations or discussions with, any person
that shall have submitted after the date hereof a written Acquisition Proposal
that is not a result of a breach of this Section 6.03(a), if prior to taking
such action (A) the Company Board (acting through the Special Committee or
otherwise) determines in good faith (after consultation with its advisors)
that such Acquisition Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to result
in, a Superior Proposal, and the Company Board (acting through the Special
Committee or otherwise) determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that its failure to take such actions would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (B) the
Company receives from such person an executed confidentiality agreement with
terms no less favorable with regard to confidentiality than the
Confidentiality Agreement. The Company shall provide to Parent, in accordance
with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and on a prompt basis, any
material non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries
provided to such person which was not previously provided to Parent. The
Company shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within two business
days) notify Parent, in the event that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or Representatives receives any Acquisition Proposal, of the material terms
and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the person
making such Acquisition Proposal, and the Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed of any material developments with respect to any such Acquisition
Proposal (including any material changes thereto). Except as set forth in this
Section 6.03, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company shall
enter into any Acquisition Agreement.

  

  

(b) Except as set forth in this Section 6.03, the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) shall not, and shall not publicly propose to: (i) withhold,
withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company
Board Recommendation; (ii) approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; or
(iii) approve or recommend, or cause or permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into, any letter of intent, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement or similar agreement with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, other than a confidentiality agreement in accordance with Section
6.03(a) (any such letter or agreement, an "Acquisition Agreement" and the
actions described above in each of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), collectively,
the "Specified Board Actions"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the
adoption of this Agreement by the Company's stockholders at the Company
Stockholders' Meeting, (x) in response to the receipt of a written Acquisition
Proposal that is not a result of a breach of Section 6.03(a), if the Company
Board (acting through the Special Committee or otherwise) (A) determines in
good faith (after consultation with its advisors) that such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal and (B) determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that its failure to take such
actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
then the Company Board (acting through the Special Committee or otherwise) may
approve and recommend such Superior Proposal (or any Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal) and, in connection with the approval
or recommendation of such Superior Proposal, withdraw or modify the Company
Board Recommendation and/or cause the Company to terminate this Agreement (in
each case subject to compliance with Section 8.03) or (y) other than in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal, if the Company Board (acting through
the Special Committee or otherwise) determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that its failure to take such
actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
then the Company Board (acting through the Special Committee or otherwise) may
withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation (any action by or on
behalf of the Company Board permitted by the foregoing clause (x) or (y), a
"Specified Acquisition Action"); provided, however, that no Specified
Acquisition Action may be taken until after the fifth business day (or such
subsequent business days as provided for by clause (2) of this sentence) (the
period inclusive of all such days, the "Notice Period") following Parent's
receipt of written notice from the Company advising Parent that the Company
Board intends to take such Specified Acquisition Action (a "Notice of Adverse
Action") and specifying the reasons therefor, including, if the basis of the
proposed action by the Company Board is a Superior Proposal, the material
terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (it being understood and
agreed that (1) during the Notice Period the Company shall, and shall cause
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel to, negotiate with Parent in
good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) and (2) any amendment
to the terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Adverse
Action and a two-business day extension of the Notice Period then applicable).
In determining whether to take a Specified Acquisition Action, the Company
Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent to the Company in response to a Notice of Adverse Action or
otherwise.

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to
the Company's stockholders if the Company Board (or any committee thereof)
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that it is required to do so under applicable Law; provided, however, that
neither the Company nor the Company Board (nor any committee thereof) shall
(i) recommend that the stockholders of the Company tender their Shares in
connection with any such tender or exchange offer (or otherwise approve or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal) or (ii) withdraw or modify the Company
Board Recommendation, unless in the case of each of clause (c)(i) and (c)(ii)
hereof, the requirements of Section 6.03(b) shall have been satisfied.

  

  

(d) Except as set forth in Section 8.03(d) with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal, for purposes of this Agreement:

  

  

(i) "Acquisition Proposal" means any bona fide proposal or offer (including
any proposal from or to the Company's stockholders) from any person other than
Parent or Merger Sub relating to (A) any direct or indirect acquisition of (1)
more than 15% of the assets of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or (2) more than 15% of any class of equity securities of
the Company; (B) any tender offer or exchange offer, as defined pursuant to
the Exchange Act, that if consummated would result in any person beneficially
owning, directly or indirectly, 15% or more of any class of equity securities
of the Company; or (C) any merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
involving the Company.

(ii) "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that
(A) relates to more than 50% of the outstanding Shares or more than 50% of the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B) is on terms
that the Company Board determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of
its financial advisor and outside counsel and after taking into account all
financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and of this
Agreement (including the relative risks of non-consummation and any changes to
the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company, prior to the
expiration of the Notice Period, in response to such proposal or otherwise))
are more favorable to the Company's stockholders than this Agreement and (C)
the Company Board determines is reasonably capable of being consummated.

  

  

(e) The Company shall (i) promptly request each person that has executed a
confidentiality agreement with the Company prior to the date of this Agreement
in connection with a process relating to an Acquisition Proposal to return or
destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such person or
its Representatives by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
(ii) not amend or waive, and shall enforce, the provisions of each such
confidentiality agreement, except that, without limiting any other provision
of this Agreement, this clause (ii) shall not apply to any standstill
provision contained therein to the extent compliance herewith would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable
Law and (iii) prohibit any access to any third party to any such physical or
electronic data room, except as permitted herein.

  

  

SECTION 6.04 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance. (a) The
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and all indemnification agreements
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective
present or former directors and officers (collectively, the "Indemnified
Parties"). In addition, the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the
Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect
to exculpation and indemnification than are set forth in Articles VII and VIII
of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as
amended, and Article VII of the By-Laws of the Company, respectively, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely
the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time,
were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless, each Indemnified
Party against all costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether
arising before or after the Effective Time), whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to any action or
omission in their capacity as an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or
agent, whether occurring on or before the Effective Time. In the event of any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (i) Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
selected by the Indemnified Parties, which counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation, promptly after statements therefor
are received, (ii) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or
threatened Action to which an Indemnified Party is a party (and in respect of
which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder),
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such
Action or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents, and (iii) the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter; provided,
however, that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for
any settlement effected without the Surviving Corporation's written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and provided,
further, that, in the event that any claim for indemnification is asserted or
made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of
such claim shall continue until the disposition of such claim. The rights of
each Indemnified Person under this Section 6.04(b) shall be in addition to any
rights such person may have under the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-
Laws or similar organizational documents of the Company and the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, or under any Law or under any
agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

  

  

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall either (i) cause to be obtained at the
Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six
years from the Effective Time with respect to directors' and officers'
liability insurance in amount and scope at least as favorable as the Company's
existing policies for claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or
prior to the Effective Time; or (ii) maintain in effect for six years from the
Effective Time, if available, the current directors' and officers' liability
insurance policies maintained by the Company (provided that the Surviving
Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage
containing terms and conditions that are not less favorable) with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no
event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to this
Section 6.04(c) more than an amount per year equal to 300% of current annual
premiums paid by the Company for such insurance; provided, however, that in
the event of an expiration, termination or cancellation of such current
policies, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be required to obtain as
much coverage as is possible under substantially similar policies for such
maximum annual amount in aggregate annual premiums.

  

  

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.04.

(e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.04.

  

  

SECTION 6.05 Employee Benefits Matters. (a) Parent hereby agrees that, for a
period of eighteen months immediately following the Effective Time, it shall,
or it shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, provide
each employee of the Company and of each of the Company's Subsidiaries as of
the Effective Time (each, an "Employee") with a base salary, employee
benefits, incentive compensation and other variable compensation (other than,
in each case, equity-based compensation) that, taken as a whole, is no less
favorable to the base salary, employee benefits, incentive compensation and
other variable compensation (other than, in each case, equity-based
compensation), taken as a whole, provided to each such Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor in accordance
with their terms, all contracts, agreements, arrangements, policies, plans and
commitments of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time that are applicable to any current or former employees
or directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including all
severance agreements listed on Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and excluding any of the foregoing to the extent related to equity-
based compensation. Parent hereby agrees that, for a period of eighteen months
immediately following the Effective Time, it shall, or it shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, provide each Employee with
equity-based compensation that is no less favorable than the equity-based
compensation then provided to other similarly situated employees of Parent and
its Subsidiaries.

  

  

(b) Employees shall receive credit for all purposes (including, for purposes
of eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to
receive benefits, but excluding benefit accruals under any defined benefit
pension plan) under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement
established or maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries under which each Employee may be eligible to
participate on or after the Effective Time to the same extent recognized by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under comparable Plans immediately
prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, credit need not be recognized
to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of
benefits. Such plan, program or arrangement shall credit each such Employee
for service accrued or deemed accrued on or prior to the Effective Time with
the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company and all affiliates where service
with the affiliate was credited under a comparable Plan of the Company prior
to the Effective Time; provided, however, service need not be recognized to
the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.

  

  

(c) With respect to the welfare benefit plans, programs and arrangements
maintained, sponsored or contributed to by Parent or its Subsidiaries (other
than the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) after the Effective Time
(collectively, "Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plans") and in which an Employee may
be eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time, Parent shall (i)
waive, or cause its insurance carrier to waive, all limitations as to
preexisting and at-work conditions, if any, with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to each participating Employee under any
Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plan (other than any dependent life insurance plan)
to the same extent waived under a comparable Plan, and (ii) provide credit to
each Employee for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid
by such Employee under the Plans during the relevant plan year up to and
including the Effective Time.

the Surviving Corporation) to, satisfy all obligations of the Company and all
of its Subsidiaries in respect of any accrued but unpaid vacation, holiday,
sick leave, paid time off or similar liability as of the Closing.

  

  

(e) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring Parent to
continue the employment of any specific person. Furthermore, no provision of
this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting or limiting the ability of
Parent to amend, modify or terminate any plans, programs, policies,
arrangements, agreements or understandings of Parent or the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries in accordance with their terms. Nothing in this
Section 6.05 shall confer any rights or remedies of any kind upon any Employee
or any other person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns.

  

  

(f) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take all steps necessary to ensure
that no holder of any options, warrants, rights or other instruments prior to
the Closing shall have any right to acquire following the Closing any capital
stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other equity interest
therein (including "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights).

  

  

SECTION 6.06 Financing. (a) The Company agrees to provide, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to provide, all reasonable
cooperation in connection with the arrangement of any financing necessary to
consummate the Transactions (the "Financing") as may be reasonably requested

efforts to obtain the Financing (provided that such requested cooperation does
not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries), including (i) participation in meetings, road shows, drafting
sessions, rating agency presentations and due diligence sessions, (ii)
furnishing Parent and its Representatives with real estate and other pertinent

executing and delivering any pledge and security documents, currency or
interest rate hedging arrangements or other definitive financing documents or
other certificates (including a certificate of the chief accounting officer of
the Company with respect to solvency matters relating to the Company) and
documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent, (iv) using reasonable best
efforts to obtain accountants' comfort letters, accountants' consent letters,
legal opinions, appraisals, lien searches, surveys and title insurance as

provided that any such offering document, bank information memoranda or
similar documents contains disclosure and financial statements with respect to
the Company or the Surviving Corporation reflecting the Surviving Corporation
and/or its Subsidiaries as primary obligors or guarantors; and (B) materials
for rating agency presentations; provided that none of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or any other fee or
incur any other liability in connection with the Financing prior to the
Effective Time; provided, further, that the effectiveness of any documentation
executed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be subject to the
consummation of the Closing. Parent shall, promptly upon termination of this
Agreement, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with such
cooperation or any actions contemplated by this Section 6.06(a). The Company
agrees to provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
Representatives to provide, all information and documents requested under this
Section 6.06(a) promptly and, in any event, at least 20 days prior to the date
of the Closing.

Confidentiality Agreement to the extent such information is required under the
federal securities Laws to be included in an offering document in connection
with the Financing. Parent acknowledges and agrees that the Company shall not
incur any liability to any person prior to the Effective Time in connection

receipt of a written request from Parent to do so, offers to purchase and
related consent solicitations with respect to any or all of the outstanding
debt securities of the Company specified by Parent and permitted by applicable
Law (collectively, the "Notes") on the terms and subject to conditions

documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the applicable
antitrust, competition, or trade regulation Law.

  

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of the undertaking of Parent pursuant to
Section 6.07(a), Parent agrees to take any and all steps necessary to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade
regulation Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority or any other
party so as to enable the parties hereto to consummate the Transactions, and
in any event prior to the Termination Date, including proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such of its assets,
properties or businesses or of the assets, properties or businesses to be
acquired by it pursuant hereto; provided, however, that any such sale,
divestiture, disposition or other arrangement shall be conditioned upon the
consummation of the Transactions. In addition, Parent shall defend through
litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any party in order to
avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or
judgment (whether preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the Closing
prior to the Termination Date. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, no provision of this Agreement shall require, or be construed to
require, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to agree to or take any action
that, individually or in the aggregate, would result in a Burdensome
Condition. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Burdensome Condition" shall mean
making proposals, executing or carrying out agreements (including consent
decrees) or submitting to Laws (i) providing for the license, sale or other
disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of a trust or
otherwise) of any assets or categories of assets of Parent, the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or the holding separate of the capital stock
of the Company or any such Subsidiary or (ii) imposing or seeking to impose
any limitation on the ability of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to conduct their respective businesses (including with
respect to market practices and structure) or to own such assets or to
acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of the business of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or of Parent or its Subsidiaries, that, in the
case of clause (i) and (ii), would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Behavioral Health Business Material
Adverse Effect.

(c) Each party shall promptly notify the other party hereto of any material
communication it or any of its affiliates receives from any Governmental
Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement. Each
party shall be entitled to review in advance any proposed substantive
communication by any other party to any Governmental Authority in connection
with the Transactions, and each party shall make any revisions thereto
reasonably requested by the other party. None of the parties to this Agreement
shall agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any filings, investigation (including any settlement of the
investigation), litigation or other inquiry relating to the matters that are
the subject of this Agreement unless it consults with the other party in
advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Authority,

with each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance
as the other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing.

material correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of
their Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or
members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that
materials may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of
the Company, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and
(iii) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege
concerns. In furtherance of the foregoing, all information exchanged between
or among the parties under this Section 6.07 shall be subject to appropriate
confidentiality arrangements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the
parties agree that, except as otherwise provided by Law, any and all
proceedings, hearings and other dealings with Governmental Authorities
relating to antitrust matters shall be led by Parent and its Representatives;
provided, that Parent may make all final strategic decisions after consulting
in good faith with the Company.

  

  

(d) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall enter into any agreement, transaction,
or any agreement to effect any transaction (including any merger or
acquisition) that might reasonably be expected to make it materially more
difficult, or to materially increase the time required, to: (i) obtain the
expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, or any
other applicable antitrust, competition, or trade regulation Law, applicable
to the Transactions, (ii) avoid the entry of, the commencement of litigation
seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other order that would materially delay or
prevent the consummation of the Transactions, or (iii) obtain all
authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of Governmental Authorities
necessary for the consummation of the Transactions, including any
authorizations, consents, orders or approvals required by any Health Care Law
or Government Program.

  

  

(e) With respect to any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its
directors relating to the Transactions, Company shall (i) promptly notify
Parent of the initiation of any such litigation, (ii) promptly notify Parent
of any material communication or development with respect to such litigation

Law or the requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market, in which case the issuing
party shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party
before issuing any press release or making any such public statements, and
except with respect to the matters described in Sections 6.03, 8.01 and 8.03.

contrary herein, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation agrees to assume
liability for and pay any sales, transfer, stamp, stock transfer, value added,
use, real property transfer or gains and any similar Taxes of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, as well as any transfer, recording, registration and

this Section 8.02, Section 8.03 and Article IX shall survive any such

of its obligations under this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 8.03 Fees and Expenses. (a) All Expenses incurred in connection with

Company under this Section 8.03 shall be paid to Parent or its designee by the
Company in immediately available funds as follows:

  

  

(i) in the case of Section 8.03(b)(iv), the applicable payment shall be made
concurrently with and as a condition to the effectiveness of a termination of
this Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(f);

  

  

(ii) in the case of Section 8.03(b)(ii)(A) or Section 8.03(b)(iii), the
applicable payment shall be made on or prior to the date of the event giving
rise to the obligation to make such payment; and

  

  

(iii) in the case of Section 8.03(b)(i), Section 8.03(b)(ii)(B) or Section
8.03(b)(v), (x) if the event giving rise to the obligation to make such

Company for adoption, an agreement with respect to, or consummating, any
Acquisition Proposal with a Competing Bidder, the applicable payment shall be
made on or prior to the date of such event or (y) if the event giving rise to
the obligation to make such payment is the Company entering into, or
submitting to the stockholders of the Company for adoption, an agreement with
respect to, or consummating, any Acquisition Proposal with any person other
than a Competing Bidder, the applicable payment shall be made on or prior to
the consummation of any Acquisition Proposal.

  

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the payment to
Parent or its designees of the Company Termination Fee and/or the Expense
Reimbursement shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent for any loss
suffered by Parent or Merger Sub as a result of the failure of the Merger and
the other Transactions to be consummated and upon such payment in accordance
with this Section 8.03, the Company shall not have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions

(d) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in
subsections (b) and (c) of this Section 8.03 are an integral part of the
Transactions, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not have
entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to pay any
amounts due and payable pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) of this Section
8.03, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commence a suit that
results in a judgment against the Company for the Company Termination Fee or
the Expense Reimbursement, the Company shall pay to Parent their costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount of the Company Termination Fee or
Expense Reimbursement, as the case may be, from the date such payment was
required to be made until the date of payment at the prime rate of JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

  

  

(e) For purposes of this Section 8.03, Acquisition Proposal shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in Section 6.03(d), except that references to
15% in clauses (1) and (2) of the definition thereof shall be deemed to be
references to 50% and clause (3) of the definition thereof shall be deemed
amended and replaced in its entirety by the following language: "(3) any
merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or other similar
transaction involving the Company pursuant to which stockholders of the
Company immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction would cease
to own directly or indirectly at least 50% of the voting power of the
outstanding securities of the Company (or of another person that directly or
indirectly would own all or substantially all the assets of the Company)
immediately following such transaction in the same proportion as they owned
prior to the consummation of such transaction."

(c) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Schedules or
Exhibits, such reference shall be to a Section, Schedule or Exhibit of this
Agreement, respectively, unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof,"
"herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this
Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not any particular
provision of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The definitions
contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the
plural forms of such terms. References to a person are also to its permitted
successors and assigns. Whenever the context may require, any pronoun shall
include the corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms.

  

  

SECTION 9.04 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

  

  

SECTION 9.05 Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties. Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company each acknowledges and agrees that, except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement (a) no
party makes, and has not made, any representations or warranties relating to
itself or its businesses or otherwise in connection with the Transactions, (b)
no person has been authorized by any party to make any representation or
warranty relating to such party or its businesses or otherwise in connection
with the Transactions and, if made, such representation or warranty must not
be relied upon as having been authorized by such party, and (c) any estimates,
projections, predictions, data, financial information, memoranda,
presentations or any other materials or information provided or addressed to
any party or any of its Representatives are not and shall not be deemed to be
or to include representations or warranties unless any such materials or
information is the subject of any representation or warranty set forth in this
Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 9.06 Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all
prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties
hereto, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.
This Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by
operation of law or otherwise), except that Parent and Merger Sub may assign
all or any of their rights and obligations hereunder to any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent; provided, however, that no such assignment
shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder if such
assignee does not perform such obligations.

SECTION 9.07 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, other than Section 6.04 (which is intended to be for
the benefit of the persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such
persons) and except for the right of (i) the Company, on behalf of the holders
of equity interests in the Company, to pursue damages (which the parties
acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or
out-of-pocket costs, and may include claims for damages based on the
consideration that would have otherwise been payable to the stockholders of
the Company and other relevant matters, including other combination
opportunities and the time value of money), which shall be deemed in such
event to be damages of holders of equity interests in the Company, in the
event of a failure by Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger as
required by this Agreement, which right is hereby acknowledged and agreed by
Parent and Merger Sub and (ii) Parent to pursue damages (which the parties
acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or
out-of-pocket costs, and may include claims for damages based on the synergies
and other benefits that would have otherwise accrued to Parent and other
relevant matters), which shall be deemed in such event to be damages of
holders of equity interests in Parent, in the event of a failure by the
Company to consummate the Merger as required by this Agreement, which right is
hereby acknowledged and agreed by the Company. For purposes of this Agreement,
any action of the Special Committee shall be binding upon and shall constitute
an act of the Company.

  

  

SECTION 9.08 Remedies; Specific Performance; Expenses. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the parties would be irreparably damaged if any of
the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or are otherwise breached and that any non-performance or
breach of this Agreement by any party hereto could not be adequately
compensated by monetary damages alone and that the parties hereto would not
have any adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, in addition to any other right
or remedy to which each party may be entitled, at law or in equity (including
monetary damages), such party shall be entitled to enforce any provision of
this Agreement by a decree of specific performance and to temporary,
preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement without posting any bond
or other undertaking. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, all Expenses of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub incurred in
connection with any Action brought by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub
relating to the terms and provisions of this Agreement provided for in the
foregoing sentence shall be paid by the Company in the event that Parent is
successful on the merits in such Action and shall be paid by Parent in the
event that the Company is successful on the merits in such Action.

  

  

SECTION 9.09 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts
executed in and to be performed in that State. All Actions arising out of or
relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in the
Delaware Court of Chancery (or any proper appellate court thereof). The
parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware
Court of Chancery for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to
this Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (b) irrevocably waive, and
agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such
Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the
courts described above, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment
or execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the
venue of the Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the Transactions
may not be enforced in or by the courts described above.

SECTION 9.10 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a
trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising
out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. Each
of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney
of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other
party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing
waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been
induced to enter into this Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable, by,
among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section
9.10.

  

  

SECTION 9.11 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by
action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any
time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that, after the adoption
of this Agreement and the Transactions by the stockholders of the Company, no
amendment shall be made except as allowed under applicable Law. This Agreement
may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the
parties hereto.

  

  

SECTION 9.12 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto
may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of
any other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and
warranties of any other party contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any agreement of any other
party or any condition to its own obligations contained herein. Any such
extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. The failure of any party
to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of those rights.

  

  

SECTION 9.13 Headings. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement
are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 9.14 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission) in two or more counterparts, and by the
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.
