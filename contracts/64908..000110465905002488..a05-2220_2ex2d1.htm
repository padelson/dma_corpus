virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of
shares of capital stock of the Bank, Parent or Merger Bank:

its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares
held for the account of clients, customers or other Persons) shall be
canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto;

  



  

(b) each Bank Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 3.02(a) or as adjusted pursuant
to Section 11.01(d)(iii), be converted into the following (collectively, the
" **Merger Consideration** "):

  



  

9   

     
   

  



  

(i) for each such Bank Share with respect to which an election to receive
cash has been effectively made and not revoked or deemed converted into the
right to receive the Stock Election Price pursuant to Section 3.04(b), or is
deemed made pursuant to Section 3.04(d), as the case may be (each, a "
**Cash Electing Bank Share** "), the right to receive an amount equal to
$20.375 in cash without interest (the " **Cash Election Price** "), as may

(the " **Exchange Ratio** ") of common stock, par value $2.00 per share ("

be entitled, with respect to any or all of such Bank Shares, to make an
election (a " **Cash Election** ") on or prior to such date to receive the
Cash Election Price on the basis hereinafter set forth.

  



  

Section 3.04. _Proration of Election_ _Price_. (a)  Subject to adjustment
pursuant to Section 11.01(d)(iii), the number of Bank Shares to be
converted into the right to receive the Cash Election Price at the Effective
Time (the " **Cash Election Number** ") shall equal the number of Bank Shares
which is 40% of the Bank Shares outstanding at the Effective Time (excluding
any Bank Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.02(a)).

  



  

(b) If the number of Cash Electing Bank Shares exceeds the Cash Election
Number, then such Cash Electing Bank Shares shall be treated in the following
manner:

  



  

(i) A cash proration factor (the " **Cash Proration Factor** ") shall be
determined by dividing the Cash Election Number by the total number of Cash
Electing Bank Shares.

  



  

(ii) A number of Cash Electing Bank Shares covered by each shareholders Cash
Election equal to the product of (x) the Cash Proration Factor and (y) the
total number of Cash Electing Bank Shares covered by such Cash Election shall
be converted into the right to receive the Cash Election Price.

  



  

(iii) Each Cash Electing Bank Share, other than those Bank Shares converted
into the right to receive the Cash Election Price in accordance with Section
3.04(b)(ii), shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Election
Price as if such Bank Shares were not Cash Electing Bank Shares.

  



  

10   

     
   

  



  

(c) If the number of Cash Electing Bank Shares is equal to the Cash Election
Number, then each Cash Electing Bank Share shall be converted into the right
to receive the Cash Election Price and each other Bank Share (other than Bank
Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.02(a)) shall be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Election Price.

  



  

(d) If the number of Cash Electing Bank Shares is less than the Cash Election
Number, then:

  



  

(i) Each Cash Electing Bank Share shall be converted into the right to
receive the Cash Election Price.

  



  

(ii) The Bank Shares as to which a Cash Election is not in effect, excluding
Bank Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 3.02(a), (the " **Non-
Electing Bank Shares** ") shall be treated in the following manner:

  



  

(A) A stock proration factor (the " **Stock Proration Factor** ") shall be
determined by dividing (x) the difference between the Cash Election Number
and the number of Cash Electing Bank Shares, by (y) the total number of Non-
Electing Bank Shares.

  



  

(B) A number of Non-Electing Bank Shares of each shareholder equal to the
product of (x) the Stock Proration Factor and (y) the total number of Non-
Electing Bank Shares of such shareholder shall be converted into the right to
receive the Cash Election Price (and a Cash Election shall be deemed to have
been made with respect to such Bank Shares).

  



  

(C) Each Non-Electing Bank Share of each shareholder as to which a Cash
Election is not deemed made pursuant to Section 3.04(d)(ii)(B) shall
be converted into the right to receive the Stock Election Price.

  



  

Section 3.05. _Election_ _Procedures; Exchange Agent._ (a) Prior to the date
of the Bank Shareholder Meeting (as defined in Section 7.02) Parent and the
Bank shall prepare a form (an " **Election Form** ") pursuant to which a
holder of record of Bank Shares may make a Cash Election with respect to each
Bank Share owned by such holder. The Bank shall cause an Election Form to
be included with the Bank Proxy Statement (as defined in Section 5.09(a)) and
mailed to each holder of record of Bank Shares as of the record date for such
meeting.

  



  

(b) Prior to the record date for the Bank Shareholder Meeting, Parent shall
appoint an agent (the " **Exchange Agent** ") for the purpose of (i) receiving
Election Forms and determining, in accordance with this Article 3, the form
of Merger Consideration to be received by each holder of Bank Shares, and
(ii)

  



  

11   

     
   

  



  

exchanging for the Merger Consideration (A) certificates representing Bank
Shares (the " **Certificates** ") or (B) uncertificated Bank Shares (the "
**Uncertificated Shares** "). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit
of the holders of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares, for
exchange in accordance with this Article 3, (i) subject to Section 3.06(a),
certificates representing the shares of Parent Stock that constitute the
stock portion of the Merger Consideration and (ii) an amount of cash necessary
to satisfy the cash portion of the Merger Consideration (the " **Exchange
Fund** "). The Exchange Fund will be distributed in accordance with the
Exchange Agents normal and customary procedures established in accordance
with merger transactions. At the Effective Time or promptly thereafter,
Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder
of record of Bank Shares at the Effective Time, a letter of transmittal and
instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

  



  

(c) A Cash Election shall be effective only if the Exchange Agent shall have
received no later than 5:00 p.m. Baltimore, Maryland time on the date of the
Bank Shareholder Meeting (the " **Election Deadline** ") an Election Form
covering the Bank Shares to which such Cash Election applies, executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions set forth in such Election
Form. Any Bank Share with respect to which the Exchange Agent has not
received an effective Cash Election meeting the requirements of this Section
3.05(c) by the Election Deadline shall be deemed to be a Non-Electing
Bank Share. A Cash Election may be revoked or changed only by delivering to
the Exchange Agent, prior to the Election Deadline, a written notice of
revocation or, in the case of a change, a properly completed revised Election
Form that identifies the Bank Shares to which such revised Election Form
applies.  Delivery to the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline of
a revised Election Form with respect to any Bank Shares shall result in
the revocation of all prior Election Forms with respect to all such Bank
Shares. Any termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article 11 shall
result in the revocation of all Election Forms delivered to the Exchange
Agent on or prior to the date of such termination.

  



  

(d) The Bank and Parent shall have the right to make rules, not inconsistent
with the terms of this Agreement, governing the validity and effectiveness of
Election Forms, the manner and extent to which Cash Elections and Stock
Elections are to be taken into account in making the determinations required
by this Section and the payment of the Merger Consideration.

  



  

Section 3.06 _. Exchange Procedures_ _; Surrender and Payment.  _(a) Each
holder of Bank Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of
transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent
(or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably

  



  

12   

     
   

  



  

request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the
Merger Consideration in respect of the Bank Shares represented by a
Certificate or Uncertificated Share. The shares of Parent Stock constituting
part of such Merger Consideration, at Parents option, shall be in
uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical certificate is requested by
a holder of Bank Shares or is otherwise required under applicable law. Until
so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all
purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.

  



  

(b) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

(c) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Bank Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Bank, they shall
be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and
in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 3.

  



  

(d) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 3.05(b) that remains unclaimed by the holders
of Bank Shares six months after the Effective Time shall be returned to
Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged Bank Shares
for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 3.06 prior to
that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger
Consideration, and any dividends and distributions with respect thereto, in
respect of such shares without any interest thereon.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of Bank Shares for any
amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws.  Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Bank
Shares two years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately
prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any governmental authority) shall become, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, the property of the Surviving Bank free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(e) No dividends or other distributions with respect to securities of Parent
constituting part of the Merger Consideration, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares as provided in Section 3.09, shall be paid to the holder of
any Certificates not surrendered or of any Uncertificated Shares not
transferred until

  



  

13   

     
   

  



  

such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are surrendered or transferred, as
the case may be, as provided in this Section. Following such surrender or
transfer, there shall be paid, without interest, to the Person in whose name
the securities of Parent have been registered, (i) at the time of such
surrender or transfer, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares to which such Person is entitled pursuant to Section 3.09 and the
amount of all dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time previously paid or payable on the date of such surrender with
respect to such securities, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time and prior to surrender or transfer and with a payment date
subsequent to surrender or transfer payable with respect to such securities.

  



  

Section 3.07 _. Stock __Options._ (a) At the Effective Time, each option
granted by the Bank to purchase Bank Shares pursuant to the Banks 1993
Director Incentive Stock Option Plan, the Banks 1993 Employees Incentive
Stock Option Plan and the Banks 1998 Stock Compensation Plan (collectively,
the " **Bank Option Plans** "), (each a " **Bank Option** "), which is then
outstanding, unexercised and vested shall cease to represent a right to
acquire Bank Shares and shall be converted automatically into a fully-vested
option to purchase shares of Parent Stock (a " **Parent Option** ") in an
amount and at an exercise price determined as provided below (and otherwise
subject to the terms of the Bank Option Plan under which such Bank Option was
granted, the agreements evidencing grants thereunder and any other agreements
between the Bank and an optionee regarding Bank Options):

  



  

(i) the number of shares of Parent Stock to be subject to the Parent Option
shall be equal to the product of the number of Bank Shares subject to the
original option and the Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional shares
of Parent Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to
the nearest whole share; and

  



  

(ii) the exercise price per share of Parent Stock under the Parent Option
shall be equal to the exercise price per share of Bank Shares under the
original option divided by the Exchange Ratio, provided that if the exercise
price resulting from such division includes a fractional cent, the exercise
price shall be rounded up to the nearest cent.

  



  

(iii) notwithstanding anything else contained in this Section 3.07(a), it is
the intention of the parties that the assumption of Bank Options hereunder
shall meet the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code, and that each
Parent Option shall qualify immediately after the Effective Time as an
incentive stock option (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) to the extent
the related Bank Option so qualified immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.07 shall be interpreted to
further such purpose and intention.

  



  

14   

     
   

  



  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall reserve for issuance the number
of shares of Parent Stock necessary to satisfy Parents obligations under
this Section 3.07.  Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later
than 10 Business Days thereafter), Parent shall file with the SEC a
registration statement on an appropriate form under the 1933 Act with respect
to the shares of Parent Stock subject to the Parent Options, and shall use
its best efforts to maintain the current status of the prospectus contained
therein, as well as comply with applicable state securities or "blue sky"
laws, for so long as such options remain outstanding.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Bank shall take all such
steps as may be required to cause any acquisitions of Parent equity
securities (including derivative securities with respect to any Parent equity
securities) and dispositions of Bank equity securities (including derivative
securities with respect to any Bank equity securities) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who
is anticipated to be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the 1934 Act with respect to Parent or who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act with respect to the Bank, to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act.

  



  

Section 3.08 _. Adjustments_ _. _If, during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Bank or Parent shall occur, including by reason of
any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange
or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement and, if applicable, the Cash Election Price,
Exchange Ratio and their determination shall be appropriately adjusted.

  



  

Section 3.09 _. Fractional __Shares. _No fractional shares of Parent Stock
shall be issued in the Merger. All fractional shares of Parent Stock that
a holder of Bank Shares would otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of
the Merger shall be aggregated and if a fractional share results from
such aggregation, such holder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof,
an amount in cash without interest determined by multiplying the closing
sale price of a share of Parent Stock on the NASDAQ National Market, as
reported in the New York City edition of _The Wall Street Journal_ , on the
trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time by the fraction of a
share of Parent Stock to which such holder would otherwise have been
entitled.

  



  

Section 3.10 _. Withholding Rights_ _._ Each of the Exchange Agent,
Surviving Bank and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Section 3.10
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or
foreign tax law. If the Exchange Agent, Surviving Bank or Parent, as the case
may be, so withholds amounts, such

  



  

15   

     
   

  



  

amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Bank Shares in respect of which the Exchange Agent,
Surviving Bank or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

  



  

Section 3.11 _. Lost Certificates_ _. _If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Bank, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Bank may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Bank Share
represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Section 3.11.

  



  

ARTICLE 4 
 The Surviving Bank

incorporation of the Merger Bank in effect at the Effective Time shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Bank until amended in

extensions of credit, if any, were at the time they were made and continue to
be

  



  

39   

     
   

  



  

permitted and in compliance with the provisions of Regulation O, 12 C.F.R.
Part 215.

  



  

(g) Since January 1, 2000, Parent and each of the Parent Banking Subsidiaries
has timely filed all required annual and quarterly statements and other
documents (including exhibits and all other information incorporated therein)
required to be filed with EDS, the banking agencies electronic collection
agent (collectively, the " **Parent RAP Statements** "). The Parent RAP
Statements, including the method for determining Parents and the Parent
Banking Subsidiaries provision for loan and lease losses, are and have been
prepared in conformity with regulatory accounting practices, applicable law
and supervisory policy, consistently applied, for the periods covered thereby
and (as may have been amended and restated or supplemented by Parent RAP
Statements filed subsequently but prior to the date hereof) fairly present in
all material respects the statutory financial position of Parent and
the Parent Banking Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof and the
results of operations of Parent and the Parent Banking Subsidiaries for the
respective periods then ended. The Parent RAP Statements comply in all
material respects with any requirement of law when filed and no material
deficiency has been asserted with respect to any Parent RAP Statements by the
FDIC or any other governmental authority. The annual statutory balance sheets
and income statements included in the Parent RAP Statements have been
audited, and the Parent has made available to the Bank true and complete
copies of all audit opinions related thereto. Neither Parents or the Parent
Banking Subsidiaries independent public accountants nor any employee of the
Parent or the Parent Banking Subsidiaries has alleged that any of the Parent
RAP Statements contains any misstatement or other defect which, if true,
would cause the representations and warranties contained in this Section
6.07(g) to be untrue.

  



  

Section 6.08 _.  Financial Statements. _The audited consolidated
financial statements and unaudited consolidated interim financial statements
of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents fairly present, in all
material respects, in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis

position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof
and their consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods
then ended (subject to normal year-end adjustments in the case of any
unaudited interim financial statements).

  



  

Section 6.09 _.  Disclosure Documents. _(a) None of the information provided
by Parent for inclusion in the Bank Proxy Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto, at the time the Bank Proxy Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto is first mailed to shareholders of the Bank and at the
time the shareholders vote on adoption of this Agreement and at the Effective
Time, will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  



  

40   

     
   

  



  

(b) The Registration Statement of Parent to be filed with the SEC with
respect to the offering of Parent Stock in connection with the Merger (the "
**Registration Statement** ") and any amendments or supplements thereto, when
filed, will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements
of the 1933 Act. At the time the Registration Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto becomes effective and at the Effective Time, the
Registration Statement, as amended or supplemented, will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein not misleading.  The representations and warranties contained in this
Section 6.09 will not apply to statements or omissions in the Registration
Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto based upon information
furnished to Parent or Merger Bank by the Bank specifically for use therein.

  



  

Section 6.10 _.  Absence of Certain Changes. _Since the Parent Balance
Sheet Date, the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries has been conducted in
the ordinary course consistent with past practice and, except as disclosed to
the Bank and as disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents filed prior to the

other securities of, or other ownership interests in, Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries; and

  



  

(c) any change in any material method of accounting or accounting practice by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except for any such change required by
reason of a concurrent change in GAAP or Regulation S-X under the 1934 Act.

  



  

Section 6.11 _.  No Undisclosed Material Liabilities. _There are no
liabilities or obligations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of any kind
whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined, determinable

circumstances that could reasonably be expected to result in such
a liability, other than:

Documents prior to the date hereof, there is no action, suit,
investigation or proceeding (or any basis therefor) pending against, or, to
the knowledge of Parent, threatened against or affecting, Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries, any present or former officer, director or employee of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person for whom Parent or any
Subsidiary may be liable or any of their respective properties before any
court or arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or official, domestic,
foreign or supranational, that, if determined or resolved adversely in
accordance with the plaintiffs demands, could reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

Third Party that is seeking to make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ that if the Bank receives an Acquisition Proposal from a Third

believes will lead to a Superior Proposal, (ii) furnish to such Third Party
nonpublic information relating to the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries

complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal.

considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. The Bank shall

Party making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. The Bank shall keep Parent

any of its Subsidiaries to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any
and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any
Third Party conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any
such Party (or its agents or advisors) in possession of confidential
information about the Bank that was furnished by or on behalf of the Bank to
return or destroy all such information.

written Acquisition Proposal for at least a majority of the outstanding Bank
Shares on terms that the Board of Directors of the Bank determines in good
faith by a majority vote, after considering the advice of a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation and taking into account all the terms
and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, including any break-up fees,
expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation, are more
favorable and provide greater value to all the Banks shareholders than as

Directors of the Bank.

waiver of the limitations period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment or

have the effect of materially increasing the Tax liability or reducing any
Tax asset of the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(b) To the extent required by GAAP, the Bank and each of its Subsidiaries
shall establish or cause to be established in accordance with GAAP on or

and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred
by the Bank in connection with and due before the Merger (including any real
property transfer tax and any similar Tax) shall be paid by the Bank when
due, and the Bank shall, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax returns
and other documentation due before the Merger with respect to all such Taxes
and fees, and, if required by applicable law, the Bank shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax returns and other
documentation.

  



  

Section 7.05 _.  Subordinated Debentures. _Between the date hereof and
the Closing Date, the Bank may issue a subordinated debenture in an
original principal amount not in excess of $10,000,000 if (i) the Bank
determines in its reasonable judgment that failure to do so could result in
the Banks representation in Section 5.23(i) with respect to the Banks
status as "well-capitalized" being untrue as of the Effective Time and (ii)
Parent provides its written consent to such issuance; _provided_ that if
Parent does not provide such consent, then for purposes of Section
10.02(a)(ii) and Section 10.02(a)(iii), the Banks representation in Section
5.23(i) shall be deemed to be modified such that the Bank shall only be
required to represent that the Bank is "adequately capitalized" within the
meaning of 12 U.S.C. 1831o(b).

Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to
Sections 5.12, 5.13, 5.17, 5.18, 5.19, 5.20, 5.28, 6.12, 6.13, or 6.17 as the

Section 9.07 _. Confidentiality. _Prior to the Effective Time and after any
termination of this Agreement, each of Parent and the Bank shall hold, and
shall use its best efforts to cause its officers, directors, employees,
accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and agents to hold, in
confidence, unless compelled

  



  

51   

     
   

  



  

to disclose by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of
law, all confidential documents and information concerning the other party
furnished to it or its Affiliates in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except to the extent that such information
can be shown to have been (i) previously known on a nonconfidential basis by
such party, (ii) in the public domain through no fault of such party or (iii)
later lawfully acquired by such party from sources other than the other

information to its officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel,
consultants, advisors and agents in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement so long as such party informs such Persons of
the confidential nature of such information and directs them to treat it
confidentially. Each of Parent and the Bank shall satisfy its obligation to
hold any such information in confidence if it exercises the same care with
respect to such information as it would take to preserve the confidentiality
of its own similar information. If this Agreement is terminated, each
of Parent and the Bank shall, and shall use its best efforts to cause
its officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants,
advisors and agents to, destroy or deliver to the other party, upon request,
all documents and other materials, and all copies thereof, that it or its

party in connection with this Agreement and that are subject to such
confidence.

  



  

Section 9.08 _. Tax-free Reorganization. _(a) Prior to the Effective Time,
each of Parent, Merger Bank and the Bank shall use its best efforts to cause
the Merger to qualify as a 368 Reorganization, and shall not take any action
reasonably likely to cause the Merger not so to qualify. Parent shall not
take, or cause or permit the Surviving Bank to take, any action after the
Effective Time that could cause the Merger not to qualify as a 368
Reorganization.

  



  

(b) Each of Parent, Merger Bank and the Bank shall use its best efforts
to obtain the opinions referred to in Sections 10.02(d) and 10.03(b).

  



  

Section 9.09 _. Affiliates.  _Within 30 days following the date of
this Agreement, the Bank shall deliver to Parent a letter identifying all
known Persons who may be deemed affiliates of the Bank under Rule 145 of the
1933 Act. The Bank shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain a written
agreement from each Person who may be so deemed as soon as practicable and,
in any event, at least 30 days prior to the Effective Time, substantially in
the form of Exhibit C hereto.

  



  

Section 9.10 _. Employees._

  



  

(a) Following the Effective Time, all employees of the Bank and its
Subsidiaries (the " **Bank Employees** ") shall be eligible to participate in
employee benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries in which similarly
situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries participate, to the same
extent that similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries
participate; _provided, however_ , that until January 1, 2006, Parent may
instead continue the Employee Benefit Plans for the

  



  

52   

     
   

  



  

benefit of such employees or provide such employees with participation in the
employee benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries on a basis that is no
less favorable to such employees than those Employee Benefit Plans in which
they participated immediately prior to the Effective Time (it being
understood that inclusion of Bank Employees in Parents employee
benefit plans may occur at different times with respect to different plans).
Following the Effective Time, the Bank Employees, upon executing an
appropriate release in the form reasonably determined by Parent, shall be
eligible to receive upon involuntary termination, if such termination occurs
within one year after the Effective Time, severance benefits upon the terms
set forth in Section 9.10(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, which terms
represent the benefits that have been in effect from time to time
for similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries. As soon as
practicable after termination of their employment on or following the Closing
Date and/or cancellation of their existing employment agreements with Bank on
or following the Closing Date, Parent or the appropriate Subsidiary shall pay
to the individuals listed on Section 9.10(a) of the Bank Disclosure Schedule
the amounts accrued by the Bank prior to Closing and set forth on Section
9.10(a) of the Bank Disclosure Schedule opposite their names.

  



  

(b) With respect to each Parent plan for which length of service is taken
into account for any purpose, service with the Bank or any of its
Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent the Bank or an Employee
Benefit Plan provides past service credit) shall be treated as service with
Parent for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting, and
entitlement to benefits, including for severance benefits and vacation
entitlement (but not for accrual of defined benefit pension benefits);
_provided, however_ , that such service shall not be recognized to the extent
that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. Such service
also shall apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of
insurability requirements, or the application of any pre-existing
condition limitations. Each Parent plan shall waive pre-existing condition
limitations to the same extent waived or to the extent that they do not apply
under the applicable Bank plan. Bank Employees shall be given credit
for amounts paid under a corresponding benefit plan during the same period
for purposes of applying deductibles, copayments and out-of-pocket maximums
as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Parent plan.

  



  

(c) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume and honor and shall cause
the appropriate Subsidiaries of Parent to assume and to honor in accordance
with their terms all Employee Benefit Plans and employment agreements, copies
of which have been provided to Parent. Parent acknowledges and agrees that
the Merger will constitute a "change in control" of the Bank for
all purposes under such agreements. This Section 9.10(c) is intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the individuals party to
such employment agreements solely for the limited purpose of enforcing the
obligations of Parent or its Subsidiaries to assume and honor such employment
agreements.

  



  

53   

     
   

  



  

(d) Parent and the Bank agree that, prior to the Effective Time, the Bank, in
consultation with and subject to the approval of Parent, may adopt a change
in control retention plan (the " **Retention Plan** ") which may include
a retention pool of no more than $200,000, substantially as provided in
Section 9.10(d) of the Bank Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Agreement, any Plan or otherwise, Parent agrees to
maintain in full force and effect, without amendment or modification, the
Retention Plan until such time as all Parent or Bank obligations are
fulfilled thereunder.

  



  

(e) Parent shall, or shall cause its appropriate Subsidiary to, assume, honor
and continue to maintain, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the
split dollar life insurance policies and executive plans identified on
Section 9.10(e) of the Bank Disclosure Schedule without reducing or impairing
the rights of participants therein and provided further that Parent or its
appropriate Subsidiary may substitute new life insurance policies for those
identified in Section 9.10(e) of the Bank Disclosure Schedule if
the substitution does not impair or reduce the rights of participants. The
Bank shall not, from the date herof until the Effective Time make any
withdrawals (other than to pay benefits coming due in the ordinary course
under the policies and affiliated executive plans) or take any loans from
such split dollar policies.  This Section 9.10(e) is intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the named insured in each such
policy and the participants in such executive plans solely for the limited
purpose of enforcing the obligations of Parent or its Subsidiaries to assume,
honor and continue to maintain such policies and executive plans.

  



  

(f) The Bank (or, if applicable, Parent or its appropriate Subsidiary) shall
cause to be refunded to a Bank Employee those funds, if any, deducted from
the Bank Employees compensation with respect to the Banks Employee Stock
Purchase Plan after the completion of the scheduled purchase of shares
thereunder that occurs immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Merger;

  



  

(ii) the Bank shall have entered into, or publicly announced its intention to

respect to a Superior Proposal; or

(1) the Average Closing Price shall be less than the product of 0.85 and the
Starting Price; and

  



  

(2) (a) the number obtained by dividing the Average Closing Price by the
Starting Price (such number being referred to herein as the " **Parent

Agreement and subtracting 0.15 from such quotient (such number being referred
to herein as the " **Index Ratio** "),

  



  

subject to the following provisions of this Section 11.01(d)(iii). If the Bank
elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence, it shall give prompt written notice of such election to
Parent. During the three-day period (the " **Decision Period** ") commencing
with its receipt of such notice, Parent may elect to increase the Exchange
Ratio and/or the Cash Election Price and/or change the Cash Election Number

failure of the conditions set forth in Sections 10.02(d) and 10.03(b) hereof.
 The condition set forth in clause (1) above shall be deemed not to exist if
the Exchange Ratio and/or the Cash Election Price is increased, or the
Cash Election Number changed, so that the Per Share Consideration after
such increase is equal to the Per Share Consideration that would have been in
effect if (i) the Average Closing Price were equal to the product of 0.85 and
the Starting Price and (ii) the Cash Election Number as in effect on the
date hereof were applicable. The condition set forth in clause (2) above
shall be deemed not to exist if the Exchange Ratio and/or the Cash Election
Price is increased, or the Cash Election Number changed, so that the Per
Share Consideration after such increase is equal to the Per Share
Consideration that would have been in effect if (i) the Parent Ratio were
equal to the Index Ratio and (ii) the Cash Election Number as in effect
on the date hereof were applicable. If Parent makes such election within the
Decision Period, it shall give prompt written notice to the Bank of such
election and the revised Exchange Ratio and/or the Cash Election Price and/or
the Cash Election Number, whereupon the Bank shall have no right to terminate
the Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.01(d)(iii) and this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms (except to the
extent that the Exchange Ratio and/or the Cash Election Price and/or the Cash
Election Number shall have been modified by Parent pursuant to this Section
11.01(d)(iii), and any references in this Agreement to the "Exchange Ratio",
the "Cash Election Price" or the "Cash Election Number" shall thereafter be
deemed to refer to each such term after giving effect to any applicable
adjustment made pursuant to this Section 11.01(d)(iii)).

  



  

If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Determination Date, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of
Parent shall occur, including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, the "Starting Price" shall be appropriately adjusted to
account for such change for the purposes of this Section 11.01(d)(iii).

10 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Determination Date.

(other than pursuant to Section 11.01(a)) shall give notice of such
termination to the other party.

  



  

Section 11.02 _. Effect of Termination. _If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 11.01, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect
without liability of any party (or any shareholder, director, officer,

willful (i) failure of either party to fulfill a condition to the performance
of the obligations of the other party or (ii) failure of either party to
perform a covenant hereof, such party shall be fully liable for any and all
liabilities and damages incurred or suffered by the other party as a result

MERCANTILE-SAFE DEPOSIT AND TRUST COMPANY,

  

A Maryland Corporation

  



  

# 1. _Merger_. Community Bank of Northern Virginia, a Virginia corporation
(the " _Merged Corporation_ "), shall, upon the effective time and date set
forth in the Articles of Merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") to be filed
with the State Corporation Commission (the " _SCC_ ") of the Commonwealth of
Virginia (such time being referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_ "), be
merged (the " _Merger_ ") with and into Mercantile-Safe Deposit and Trust
Company, a Maryland bank (" _Merger Sub_ "), a wholly owned subsidiary of
Mercantile Bankshares Corporation, a Maryland corporation (" _Parent_ ").
Merger Sub shall be, and shall continue as, the surviving corporation (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ") in the Merger, and the separate corporate
existence of the Merged Corporation shall cease.

  

# 

  

# 2. _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the Merger shall have
the effects set forth in Section 13.1-721 of the Virginia Stock Corporation
Act (the " _VSCA_ ") and Section 3-712 of the Financial Institutions Article
of the Annotated Code of Maryland. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Merger Sub and the Merged
Corporation shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of Merger Sub and the Merged Corporation shall
be the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  

# 

  

# 3. _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws_.

  

# 

  

## (a) The certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with applicable law.

  



  

2   

     
   

  



  

## (b) The bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in
accordance with applicable law.

  

## 

  

# 4. _Board of Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation at the
Effective Time until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until
their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may
be, except that effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
board of directors of the Surviving Corporation to be expanded by at least
two, but no more than three, members and shall appoint the individuals
designated by mutual agreement of the Merged Corporation and Parent to become
members of the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation.

  

# 

  

# 5. _Officers_. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time
until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

  

# 

  

# 6. _Manner and Basis of Converting Securities_. As of the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of
any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub, Parent or the Merged Corporation:

  

# 

  

## (a)   _Conversion of Shares of Common Stock of the Merged Corporation_.

  

## 

  

### (i) Each share of common stock, par value of $0.333-1/3 per share of
Merged Corporation (the " _Merged Shares_ "), owned by the Merged Corporation
(other than shares held for the account of clients, customers or other
persons) or owned by Parent or any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares held for the account of clients,
customers or other persons) shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made
with respect thereto.

  

### 

  

### (ii) Each Merged Share outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 6(a)(i) or as
adjusted pursuant to Section 11.01(d)(iii) of the Merger Agreement, be
converted into the following (the " _Merger Consideration_ "):

  

### 

  

#### (A) for each such Merged Share with respect to which an election
to receive cash has been effectively made and not revoked or deemed converted
into the right to receive the Stock Election Price (as defined herein)
pursuant to Section 6(c)(ii), or is deemed made pursuant to Section 6(c)(iv),
as the case may be (each, a " _Cash Electing Merged Share_ "), the right to
receive an amount equal to $20.375 in cash without interest (the " _Cash
Election Price_ "), as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 11.01(d)(iii) of
the Merger Agreement; and

  

#### 

  

#### (B) for each other such Merged Share, the right to receive
0.4005 share(s) (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of common stock, par value $2.00
per

  



  

2   

     
   

  



  

#### share (" _Parent Stock_ "), of the Parent (the " _Stock Election Price_
"), as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 11.01(d)(iii) of the Merger
Agreement.

  

#### 

  

## (b)   _Elections_. Each person (other than the Merged Corporation) who,
at the close of business on the date of the Merged Corporations Shareholder
Meeting (as defined herein) or on such other date as Parent and the Merged
Corporation publicly announce as the election date (such date, the "
_Election Date_ "), is a record holder of Merged Shares will be entitled,
with respect to any or all of such Merged Shares, to make an election (a "
_Cash Election_ ") on or prior to such date to receive the Cash Election
Price on the basis hereinafter set forth.

  

## 

  

## (c)   _Proration of Election Price_.

  

## 

  

### (i) Subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 11.01(d)(iii) of the Merger
Agreement, the number of Merged Shares to be converted into the right
to receive the Cash Election Price at the Effective Time (the " _Cash
Election Number_ ") shall equal the number of Merged Shares which is 40% of
the Merged Shares outstanding at the Effective Time (excluding any Merger
Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 6(a)(i)).

  

### 

  

### (ii) If the number of Cash Electing Merged Shares exceeds the
Cash Election Number, then such Cash Electing Merged Shares shall be treated
in the following manner:

  

### 

  

#### (A) a cash proration factor (the " _Cash Proration Factor_ ") shall be
determined by dividing the Cash Election Number by the total number of
Cash Electing Merged Shares;

  

#### 

  

#### (B) a number of Cash Electing Merged Shares covered by each
shareholders Cash Election equal to the product of (x) the Cash Proration
Factor and (y) the total number of Cash Electing Merged Shares covered by
such Cash Election shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Election Price; and

  

#### 

  

#### (C) each Cash Electing Merged Share, other than those Merged
Shares converted into the right to receive the Cash Election Price in
accordance with Section 6(c)(ii)(B), shall be converted into the right to
receive the Stock Election Price as if such Merged Shares were not Cash
Electing Merged Shares.

  

#### 

  

### (iii) If the number of Cash Electing Merged Shares is equal to the
Cash Election Number, then each Cash Electing Merged Share shall be converted
into the right to receive the Cash Election Price and each other Merged Share
(other than Merged Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 6(a)(i)) shall
be converted into the right to receive the Stock Election Price.

  



  

3   



  

      
  

  



  

### (iv)  If the number of Cash Electing Merged Shares is less than the
Cash Election Number, then:

  

### 

  

#### (A) each Cash Electing Merged Share shall be converted into the right to
receive the Cash Election Price; and

  

#### 

  

#### (B) the Merged Shares as to which a Cash Election is not in effect,
excluding Merged Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 6(a)(i), (the "
_Non-Electing Merged Shares_ ") shall be treated in the following manner:

  

#### 

  

(1) a stock proration factor (the " _Stock Proration Factor_ ") shall be
determined by dividing (x) the difference between the Cash Election Number
and the number of Cash Electing Merged Shares, by (y) the total number of
Non-Electing Merged Shares;

  



  

(2) A number of Non-Electing Merged Shares of each shareholder equal to the
product of (x) the Stock Proration Factor and (y) the total number of Non-
Electing Merged Shares of such shareholder shall be converted into the right
to receive the Cash Election Price (and a Cash Election shall be deemed to
have been made with respect to such Merged Shares); and

  



  

(3) Each Non-Electing Merged Share of each shareholder as to which a Cash
Election is not deemed made pursuant to Section 6(c)(iv)(B)(2) shall be
converted into the right to receive the Stock Election Price.

  



  

## **(d) _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Stock shall be
issued in the Merger.  All fractional shares of Parent Stock that a holder of
Merged Shares would otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of the
Merger shall be aggregated and if a fractional share results from such
aggregation, such holder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an
amount in cash without interest determined by multiplying the closing sale
price of a share of Parent Stock on the NASDAQ National Market, as reported
in the New York City edition of _The Wall Street Journal_ , on the trading
day immediately preceding the Effective Time by the fraction of a share of
Parent Stock to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled.**

  



  

## **(e) _Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each option granted by the
Merged Corporation to purchase Merged Shares pursuant to the Merged
Corporations 1993 Directors Incentive Stock Option Plan, the Merged
Corporations 1993 Employees Incentive Stock Option Plan and the
Merged Corporations 1998 Stock Compensation Plan, (collectively, the "
_Merged Corporation Option Plans_ "), (each a " _Merged Corporation Option_
"), which is then outstanding, unexercised and vested shall cease to
represent a right to acquire Merged Shares and shall be converted
automatically into a fully-vested option to purchase shares of Parent Stock
(a " _Parent Option_ ") in an amount and at an exercise price determined as
provided below (and otherwise subject to the terms of the Merged Corporation
Option Plan under which such Merged Corporation**

  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

## **Option was granted, the agreements evidencing grants thereunder and any
other agreements between the Merged Corporation and an optionee regarding
Merged Corporation Options):**

  

## ** **

  

### (i) the number of shares of Parent Stock to be subject to the Parent
Option shall be equal to the product of the number of Merged Shares subject
to the original option and the Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional
shares of Parent Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded
down to the nearest whole share; and

  

### 

  

### (ii) the exercise price per share of Parent Stock under the Parent Option
shall be equal to the exercise price per share of the Merged Shares under the
original option divided by the Exchange Ratio, provided that if the exercise
price resulting from such division includes a fractional cent, the exercise
price shall be rounded up to the nearest cent.

  

### 

  

### (iii) notwithstanding anything else contained in this Section 6(e), it is
the intention of the parties that the assumption of Merged Corporation
Options hereunder shall meet the requirements of Section 424(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and that each
Parent Option shall qualify immediately after the Effective Time as an
incentive stock option (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) to the extent
the related Merged Corporation Option so qualified immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and the foregoing provisions of this Section 6(e) shall be
interpreted to further such purpose and intention.

  



  



  

## **(f) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of
common stock, par value $10.00 per share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub
Common Stock_ ") shall be converted into and shall become one validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $10.00 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.**

  



  

# **7.** _Election Procedures; Exchange Agent_ _._

  



  

## **(a) Prior to the date of the meeting of the Merged Corporations
shareholders held for the purpose of voting on the approval and adoption of
the Plan of Merger (the " _Merged Corporation s Shareholder Meeting_"),
Parent and the Merged Corporation shall prepare a form (an " _Election Form_
") pursuant to which a holder of record of Merged Shares may make a Cash
Election with respect to each Merged Share owned by such holder. The
Merged Corporation shall cause an Election Form to be included with the
Merged Corporations proxy statement filed with the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation in connection with the Merger and mailed to each holder
of record of Merged Shares as of the record date for such meeting.**

  



  

5   

     
   

  



  

## **(b) Prior to the record date for the Merged Corporations Shareholder
Meeting, Parent shall appoint an agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the
purpose of (i) receiving Election Forms and determining, in accordance with
this Section 7, the form of Merger Consideration to be received by each
holder of Merged Shares, and (ii) exchanging for the Merger Consideration (A)
certificates representing Merged Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or (B)
uncertificated Merged Shares (the " _Uncertificated Shares_ "). At or prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with
the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of the Certificates and
the Uncertificated Shares, for exchange in accordance with this Section 7,
(i) subject to Section 8(a), certificates representing the shares of Parent
Stock that constitute the stock portion of the Merger Consideration and (ii)
an amount of cash necessary to satisfy the cash portion of the
Merger Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_ ").  The Exchange Fund will be
distributed in accordance with the Exchange Agents normal and customary
procedures established in accordance with merger transactions. At the
Effective Time or promptly thereafter, Parent shall send, or shall cause the
Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record of Merged Shares at the
Effective Time, a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify
that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) for use
in such exchange.**

  



  

## **(c) A Cash Election shall be effective only if the Exchange Agent shall
have received no later than 5:00 p.m. Baltimore, Maryland time on the date of
the Merged Corporations Shareholder Meeting (the " _Election Deadline_ ") an
Election Form covering the Merged Shares to which such Cash Election applies,
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions set forth in such
Election Form. Any Merged Share with respect to which the Exchange Agent has
not received an effective Cash Election meeting the requirements of this
Section 7(c) by the Election Deadline shall be deemed to be a Non-Electing
Merged Share. A Cash Election may be revoked or changed only by delivering to
the Exchange Agent, prior to the Election Deadline, a written notice of
revocation or, in the case of a change, a properly completed revised Election
Form that identifies the Merged Shares to which such revised Election Form
applies. Delivery to the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline of a
revised Election Form with respect to any Merged Shares shall result in the
revocation of all prior Election Forms with respect to all such Merged
Shares.**

  



  

## **(d) The Merged Corporation and Parent shall have the right to make
rules, not inconsistent with the terms of this Plan of Merger, governing the
validity and effectiveness of Election Forms, the manner and extent to which
Cash Elections and Stock Elections are to be taken into account in making the
determinations required by this Section and the payment of the Merger
Consideration.**

  



  

# **8.** _Exchange Procedures; Surrender and Payment_ _._

  



  

## **(a) Each holder of Merged Shares that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon
(i) surrender**

  



  

6   

     
   

  



  

## **to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agent s message" by
the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry
transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the
Merged Shares represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. The
shares of Parent Stock constituting part of such Merger Consideration, at
Parents option, shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a
physical certificate is requested by a holder of Merged Shares or is
otherwise required under applicable law. Until so surrendered or transferred,
as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall
represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive
such Merger Consideration.**

  



  

## **(b) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a
result of such payment to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.**

  



  

## **(c) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Merged Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they
shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for,
and in accordance with the procedures set forth herein.**

  



  

## **(d) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the
Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 7(b) that remains unclaimed by the holders
of Merged Shares six months after the Effective Time shall be returned to
Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged Merged Shares
for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 8(d) prior to
that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger
Consideration, and any dividends and distributions with respect thereto, in
respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent, the Merged Corporation and the Surviving Corporation shall
not be liable to any holder of Merged Shares for any amounts paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Merged Shares two years after
the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when
the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any governmental
authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the
property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.**

  



  

7   

     
   

  



  

## **(e) No dividends or other distributions with respect to securities of
Parent constituting part of the Merger Consideration, and no cash payment in
lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 6(d), shall be paid to the
holder of any Certificates not surrendered or of any Uncertificated Shares
not transferred until such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
are surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, as provided in
this Section. Following such surrender or transfer, there shall be paid,
without interest, to the person in whose name the securities of Parent have
been registered, (i) at the time of such surrender or transfer, the amount of
any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares to which such person is
entitled pursuant to Section 6(d) and the amount of all dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time previously paid or
payable on the date of such surrender with respect to such securities, and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and prior
to surrender or transfer and with a payment date subsequent to surrender
or transfer payable with respect to such securities.**

  



  

# **9.** _Adjustments_.  If, during the period between the date of the
Merger Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Merged Corporation or Parent shall occur, including
by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend
thereon with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration and
any other amounts payable pursuant to this Plan of Merger and, if applicable,
the Cash Election Price, Exchange Ratio and their determination shall be
appropriately adjusted.

  



  

# **10.** _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably direct,
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the Merged Share represented by such Certificate, as contemplated
by this Section 10.

  



  

# **11.** _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Exchange Agent,
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any person pursuant to this
Section 11 such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or
foreign tax law. If the Exchange Agent, Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Plan of Merger as having been paid to the holder of the
Merged Shares in respect of which the Exchange Agent, Surviving Corporation
or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

  



  

8   

     
   

  



  

# **12.** _Defined Terms_.  As used in this Plan of Merger, the following
terms shall have the meaning set forth below:

  



  

## **(a) " _Business Day_ " shall mean a day, other than Saturday, Sunday or
other day on which commercial banks in Baltimore, Maryland are authorized or
required by law to close.**

  



  

## **(b) " _Merger Agreement_ " shall mean the Agreement and Plan of Merger
by and between the Merged Corporation, Merger Sub and Parent, dated January

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

The undersigned has been advised that, as of the date of this letter, the
undersigned may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Community Bank of Northern
Virginia, a Virginia bank (the " **Bank** "), as the term "affiliate" is
defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the rules
and regulations (the " **Rules and Regulations** ") of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " **SEC** ") under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the " **1933 Act** ").  Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and
Plan of Merger dated as of January 24, 2005 (the " **Merger Agreement**
") among the Bank, Mercantile Bankshares Corporation, a Maryland corporation
(" **Parent** "), and Mercantile-Safe Deposit and Trust Company, a Maryland
bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" **Merger Bank** "), the Bank
will be merged with and into Merger Bank with Merger Bank the surviving bank
in the merger (the " **Merger** ").

  



  

As a result of the Merger, the undersigned may receive shares of common
stock, par value $2.00 per share, of Parent (" **Parent Common Shares**
") in exchange for shares owned by the undersigned of common stock, par
value $0.333-1/3 per share, of the Bank (the " **Bank Common Stock** ").

  



  

The undersigned represents, warrants and covenants to Parent and the Bank
that, as of the date the undersigned receives any Parent Common Shares as a
result of the Merger:

  



  

A. The undersigned shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of
the Parent Common Shares in violation of the 1933 Act or the Rules and
Regulations.

  



  

B. The undersigned has carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement
and discussed, to the extent the undersigned felt necessary with the

  

   

     
   

  



  

undersigneds counsel or counsel for the Bank, the requirements of such
documents and other applicable limitations upon the undersigneds ability to
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Parent Common Shares.

  



  

C. The undersigned has been advised that the issuance of Parent Common Shares
to the undersigned pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the SEC
under the 1933 Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. The undersigned
has also been advised that, because, at the time the Merger is submitted for
a vote of the shareholders of the Bank, the undersigned may be deemed an
affiliate of the Bank, the undersigned may not sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose of Parent Common Shares issued to the undersigned in the Merger
unless such sale, transfer or other disposition (i) has been registered under
the 1933 Act, (ii) is made in conformity with Rule 145 promulgated by the SEC
under the 1933 Act, or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable
to Parent, or pursuant to a "no action" letter obtained by the undersigned

D. Except as set forth in paragraph C above, the undersigned understands that
Parent is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other
disposition of the Parent Common Shares by the undersigned or on the
undersigneds behalf under the 1933 Act or to take any other action necessary
in order to enable the undersigned to make such sale, transfer or other
disposition in compliance with an exemption from such registration.

  



  

E. The undersigned also understands that there will be placed on the
certificates for the Parent Common Shares issued to the undersigned, or on
any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:

  



  

" **THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN
A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
1933 APPLIES. THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY BE SOLD,
TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF A
LETTER AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF AND MERCANTILE
BANKSHARES CORPORATION, A COPY OF WHICH AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL
OFFICES OF MERCANTILE BANKSHARES CORPORATION.**"

  

   

     
   

  



  

F. The undersigned also understands that, unless the transfer by the
undersigned of the undersigneds Parent Common Shares has been registered
under the 1933 Act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of
Rule 145, Parent reserves the right to put the following legend on the
certificates issued to the undersigneds transferee:

  



  

" **THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN
REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND WERE ACQUIRED FROM A PERSON
WHO RECEIVED SUCH SECURITIES IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 APPLIES. THE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN
ACQUIRED BY THE HOLDER WITH A VIEW TO, OR FOR RESALE IN CONNECTION WITH, ANY
DISTRIBUTION THEREOF WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND MAY
NOT BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN
EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION FROM THE
REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933.**"

  



  

It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraphs E and F
above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such
legend if (i) the securities represented thereby have been registered for
sale by the undersigned under the 1933 Act or (ii) Parent has received either
an opinion of counsel, which opinion and counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, or a "no-action" letter obtained by the undersigned
from the SEC staff to the effect that the restrictions imposed by Rule 145
under the 1933 Act no longer apply to the undersigned.

  



  

G. The undersigned further understands and agrees that the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the undersigned set forth herein are
for the benefit of Parent, the Bank and the Surviving Bank (as defined in the
Merger Agreement) and will be relied upon by such firms and their respective
counsel and accountants.

  



  

10   

     
   

  



  

H. The undersigned understands and agrees that this letter agreement shall
apply to all shares of the capital stock of Parent and the Bank that are
deemed beneficially owned by the undersigned pursuant to applicable federal
securities laws.

  



  

Execution of this letter should not be considered an admission on the part of
the undersigned that the undersigned is an "affiliate" of the Bank as
described in the first paragraph of this letter, nor as a waiver of any
rights that the undersigned may have to object to any claim that the
undersigned is such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

In connection with the opinions to be delivered pursuant to Sections 10.02(d)
and 10.03(b) of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " **Merger Agreement**
"),(1) dated as of January 24, 2005, between Community Bank of Northern
Virginia, a Virginia bank (the " **Bank** "), and Mercantile Bankshares
Corporation, a Maryland corporation (" **Parent** "), and Mercantile-Safe
Deposit and Trust Company, **** a Maryland bank and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent (" **Merger Bank** "), the undersigned officer of Parent
hereby certifies and represents as to Parent and Merger Bank that:

  



  

1. The consideration to be received by holders of common stock of the Bank (" **Bank Shares** ") in the merger (the " **Merger** ") of the Bank with and into Merger Bank was determined by arms length negotiations between the managements of Parent and the Bank.  In connection with the Merger, the holders of Bank Shares will not receive in exchange for such stock, directly or indirectly, any consideration other than common stock of Parent (" **Parent Stock** "), cash in an amount equal to no more than [ ]% of the fair market value of all Bank Shares outstanding and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock.

  



  

2. The fair market value of the Parent Stock and/or cash (including cash in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Stock) received by each Bank shareholder will be approximately equal to the fair market value of the Bank Shares surrendered in exchange therefor.

  

   

(1) All defined terms used herein and not otherwise defined have the meaning
ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

  

   

     
   

  



  

3. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock to holders of Bank Shares is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent of issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately bargained for consideration.

  



  

4. Neither Parent, any subsidiary of Parent, nor, to the best knowledge of the management of Parent, any partnership (or other entity taxable as a partnership for federal tax purposes) in which Parent or any subsidiary of Parent is a partner, has any plan or intention to redeem, purchase, exchange or otherwise reacquire (including by derivative transactions such as an equity swap which would have the economic effect of an acquisition) any of the Parent Stock to be issued in the Merger, other than stock repurchases made in the open market pursuant to a stock repurchase plan (adopted by Parent) for stock of Parent which is widely held and publicly.

  



  

5. No liabilities of the Bank or the Bank shareholders will be assumed by Parent, and Parent will not acquire in the Merger any Bank Shares subject to any liabilities. The liabilities of the Bank assumed by Merger Bank and the liabilities to which the transferred assets of the Bank are subject were incurred by the Bank in the ordinary course of its business (including liabilities of the Bank for expenses solely and directly related to the Merger).

  



  

6. After the Merger, no dividends or distributions will be made to the former Bank stockholders by Parent other than dividends or distributions made to all holders of Parent Stock.

  



  

7. To the best knowledge of the management of Parent, neither Parent any subsidiary of Parent, nor any partnership (or other entity taxable as a partnership for federal tax purposes) in which Parent or any subsidiary of Parent is a partner, owns or within the past 5 years has owned, beneficially or of record, any class of stock of the Bank or any securities of the Bank or any instrument giving the holder the right to acquire any such stock or securities.

  



  

8. Neither Parent nor any subsidiary of Parent (i) has transferred or will transfer cash or other property to the Bank or any subsidiary of the Bank in anticipation of the Merger or (ii) has made or will make any loan to the Bank or any subsidiary the Bank of in anticipation of the Merger.

  



  

9. Merger Bank has no plan or intention, and Parent has no plan or intention to cause or permit Merger Bank, to issue additional shares of stock (or securities, options, warrants or instruments giving the holder thereof the right to acquire Merger Bank stock) that would (or if exercised would) result in Parent losing control of the Merger Bank. For purposes of this Letter, "control" with respect to a corporation shall mean ownership of at least 80% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least 80% of the total number of shares of each other class of stock of the corporation.  Prior to

  

   

     
   

  



  

the Merger, Parent will be in control of Merger Bank and Merger Bank will
hold no Parent Stock.

  



  

10. After the Merger, to the best knowledge of the management of Parent and Merger Bank, Merger Bank will hold at least 90% of the fair market value of the net assets and at least 70% of the fair market value of the gross assets held by the Bank immediately prior to the Merger. For purposes of this representation, amounts used (or to be used) by the Bank to pay Merger expenses, amounts paid (or to be paid) to holders of Bank Shares pursuant to the exercise of dissenters rights, amounts paid (or to be paid) by the Bank (and not with funds provided by Parent) to redeem stock, securities, warrants or options of the Bank, or to repay any indebtedness of the Bank as part of any overall plan of which the Merger is a part, and amounts distributed (or to be distributed) by the Bank to stockholders (except for regular, normal dividends) as part of any overall plan of which the Merger is a part, in each case will be treated as constituting assets held by the Bank immediately prior to the Effective Time that Merger Bank will not hold.

  



  

11. Following the Merger, Parent will continue the conduct of the Banks historic business or use a significant portion of the Banks historic business assets in a business.  For this purpose, Parent will be treated as holding all of the businesses and assets of its Qualified Group.  A Qualified Group is one or more chains of corporations connected through stock ownership with Parent but only if Parent is in control of at least one other corporation and each of the corporations (other than Parent) is controlled directly by one of the other corporations.

  



  

12. Parent has no plan or intention to (i) liquidate the Merger Bank, (ii) merge the Merger Bank into another entity in a transaction in which the Merger Bank will not be the surviving entity, (iii) sell, exchange, distribute or otherwise dispose of any stock of Merger Bank, (iv) permit or cause the Merger Bank to sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of any of its assets except for dispositions in the ordinary course of its business **** or transfers or successive transfers of stock or assets to one or more members of the Parents Qualified Group.

  



  

13. Neither Parent, Merger Bank nor any other subsidiary of Parent has paid or will pay, directly or indirectly, any expenses (including transfer taxes) incurred by any holder of Bank Shares in connection with or as part of the Merger or any related transactions. Neither Parent, Merger Bank nor any other subsidiary of Parent has agreed to assume, nor will it directly or indirectly assume, any other expense or other liability, whether fixed or contingent, of any holder of Bank Shares.

  



  

14. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between (i) Parent or any of its subsidiaries and (ii) the Bank or any of its subsidiaries that was issued or acquired or will be settled at a discount.

  

   

     
   

  



  

15. Neither Parent nor Merger Bank is a regulated investment company, a real estate investment trust or a corporation more than 25 percent (25%) of the fair market value of whose total assets consists of stock and securities of any one issuer and more than 50 percent (50%) of the fair market value of whose total assets consists of stock and securities of five or fewer issuers (each, an " **Investment Company** "). For purposes of this representation, in making the 25% and 50% determinations under the preceding sentence, (i) stock and securities in any subsidiary corporation shall be disregarded and the parent corporation shall be deemed to own its ratable share of the subsidiarys assets, (ii) a corporation shall be considered a subsidiary if the parent owns 50% or more of the combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or 50% or more of the total value of shares of all classes of stock outstanding, (iii) all entities that are members of the same "controlled group" within the meaning of section 1563(a) of the Internal Revenue Code are treated as a single issuer, and (iv) in determining total assets, there shall be excluded cash and cash items (including receivables), government securities and assets acquired (through incurring indebtedness or otherwise) for purposes of ceasing to be an Investment Company.

  



  

16. None of the compensation received or to be received by any shareholder-employees of the Bank is or will be separate consideration for or allocable to, any of their Bank Shares to be surrendered in the Merger. None of the shares of Parent Stock to be received by any shareholder-employee of the Bank in the Merger is or will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any employment, consulting or similar arrangement.  Any compensation paid or to be paid to any shareholder of the Bank who will be an employee of or perform other services for Parent, Merger Bank or any affiliate thereof after the Merger, will be determined by bargaining at arms length.

  



  

17. The Merger will be carried out in accordance with the Merger Agreement and as described in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and none of the material terms and conditions therein has been or will be waived or modified.

  



  

18. There are no agreements regarding the Merger other than those expressly referred to in the Merger Agreement.

  



  

19. None of Parent, the Bank or Merger Bank will take any position on any Federal, state or local income or franchise tax return, or take any other tax reporting position, that is inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization for federal income tax purposes or with any of the foregoing representations.

  



  

We understand that you will rely on this letter in rendering your opinions as
to certain United States federal income tax consequences of the Merger.  As
of the date hereof, we believe that all of the facts, representations and
assumptions stated or referred to herein are consistent with the state
of facts that will be existing as of the Effective Time. We will immediately
inform you if, after

  

   

     
   

  



  

signing this letter, we have reason to believe that any of the facts
described herein, in the Merger Agreement or in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or any of the representations made in this letter are or
have become untrue, incorrect or incomplete in any respect.

6. After the Merger, to the best knowledge of the management of the Bank, no dividends or distributions will be made to the former Bank stockholders by Parent other than dividends or distributions made to all holders of Parent Stock.

  



  

7.

8. To the best knowledge of the management of the Bank, the Merger Bank has no plan or intention, and Parent has no plan or intention to cause or permit Merger Bank, to issue additional shares of stock (or securities, options, warrants or instruments giving the holder thereof the right to acquire Merger Bank stock) that would (or if exercised would) result in Parent losing control of the Merger Bank.  For purposes of this Letter, "control" with respect to a corporation shall mean ownership of at least 80% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least 80% of the total number of shares of each other class of stock of the corporation. To the best knowledge of the

  

   

     
   

  



  

management of the Bank, prior to the Merger, Parent will be in control of
Merger Bank and Merger Bank will hold no Parent Stock.

  



  

9. Neither Parent nor any subsidiary of Parent (i) has transferred or will transfer cash or other property to the Bank or any subsidiary of the Bank in anticipation of the Merger or (ii) has made or will make any loan to the Bank or any subsidiary the Bank in anticipation of the Merger.

  



  

10. In the Merger, Merger Sub will acquire at least 90% of the fair market value of the net assets and at least 70% of the fair market value of the gross assets held by the Bank immediately prior to the Merger. For purposes of this representation, amounts used (or to be used) by the Bank to pay Merger expenses, amounts paid (or to be paid) to holders of Bank Shares pursuant to the exercise of dissenters rights, amounts paid (or to be paid) by the Bank (and not with funds provided by the Parent) to redeem stock, securities, warrants or options of the Bank, or to repay any indebtedness of the Bank as part of any overall plan of which the Merger is a part, and amounts distributed (or to be distributed) by the Bank to stockholders (except for regular, normal dividends) as part of any overall plan of which the Merger is a part, in each case will be treated as constituting assets held by the Bank immediately prior to the Effective Time that Merger Bank will not acquire.

  



  

11. In anticipation of the Merger, neither the Bank, any subsidiary of the Bank, nor any partnership (or other entity taxable as a partnership for federal tax purposes) in which the Bank or any subsidiary of the Bank is a partner, has redeemed or acquired any shares of stock of the Bank or entered into any agreement, understanding or arrangement to acquire any such shares, other than shares acquired in the ordinary course of business in connection with employee incentive and benefit programs, and the Bank has not made any distributions with respect to its stock other than regular, normal dividends.

  



  

12. To the best knowledge of the management of the Bank, Parent has no plan or intention to (i) liquidate the Merger Bank, (ii) merge the Merger Bank into another entity in a transaction in which the Merger Bank will not be the surviving entity, (iii) sell, exchange, distribute or otherwise dispose of the stock of the Merger Bank or (iv) permit or cause the Merger Bank to sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of any of its assets except for dispositions in the ordinary course of its business or transfers or successive transfers of stock or assets to one or more members of the Parents Qualified Group.

  



  

13. Following the Merger, to the best knowledge of the management of the Bank, Parent will continue the conduct of the Banks historic business or use a significant portion of the Banks historic business assets in a business. For this purpose, Parent will be treated as holding all of the businesses and assets of its Qualified Group. A Qualified Group is one or more chains of corporations connected through stock ownership with Parent but only if Parent is in control of

  

   

     
   

  



  

at least one other corporation and each of the corporations (other than
Parent) is controlled directly by one of the other corporations.

  



  

14. The Bank has paid or will pay its expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, except that Merger Bank, as successor to the Bank, may pay after the Merger expenses of the Bank that are solely and directly related to the Merger and not paid before the Merger. Neither the Bank nor any other subsidiary of the Bank has paid or will pay expenses, if any, incurred by holders of Bank Shares in connection with or as part of the Merger or related transactions.

  



  

15. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Parent and Bank or any of its subsidiaries or between Merger Bank and Bank that was issued, acquired, or will be settled at a discount.

For purposes of this representation, in making the 25% and 50% determinations under the preceding sentence, (i) stock and securities in any subsidiary corporation shall be disregarded and the parent corporation shall be deemed to own its ratable share of the subsidiarys assets, (ii) a corporation shall be considered a subsidiary if the parent owns 50% or more of the combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or 50% or more of the total value of shares of all classes of stock outstanding, (iii) all entities that are members of the same "controlled group" within the meaning of section 1563(a) of the Internal Revenue Code are treated as a single issuer, and (iv) in determining total assets, there shall be excluded cash and cash items (including receivables), government securities and assets acquired (through incurring indebtedness or otherwise) for purposes of ceasing to be an Investment Company.

  



  

17. None of the compensation received or to be received by any shareholder-employees of the Bank is or will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any of their Bank Shares to be surrendered in the Merger. None of the shares of Parent Stock to be received by any shareholder-employee of the Bank in the Merger is or will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any employment, consulting or similar arrangement.  To the best knowledge of the management of the Bank, any compensation paid or to be paid to any shareholder of the Bank who will be an employee of or perform advisory services for Parent, Merger Bank, or any affiliate thereof after the Merger, will be determined by bargaining at arms length.

  



  

18. Either (a) no Bank Shares, if any, that were acquired in connection with the performance of services (including stock acquired through the exercise of an option or warrant acquired in connection with the performance of services) are

  

   

     
   

  



  

subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture within the meaning of section
83(c) of the Internal Revenue Code or (b) any shares of Parent Stock received
in exchange for Bank Shares that were acquired in connection with the
performance of services and are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture
within the meaning of section 83(c) of the Code will be subject to
substantially the same risk of forfeiture after the Merger.

  



  

19. Since April 16, 1997, the Bank has not distributed to its shareholders or security holders stock or securities of a controlled corporation, nor have Bank Shares been distributed, in a transaction to which section 355(a) of the Code applies.

21. There are no agreements regarding the Merger other than those expressly referred to in the Merger Agreement.

  



  

22. The Bank will not take any position on any Federal, state, or local income or franchise tax return, or take any other tax reporting position, that is inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization for federal income tax purposes or with any of the foregoing representations.
