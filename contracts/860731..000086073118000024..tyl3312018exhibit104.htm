ARTICLE III 
EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK 
OF THE CONSTITUENT COMPANIES

3.1 Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Socrata Stock or any capital stock of Merger Sub:

(a) Cancellation of Treasury Stock. Each share of Socrata Stock that is
directly owned by Socrata, as treasury stock, shall automatically be canceled
at the Effective Time and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

(b) Conversion of Series C Preferred Stock. Each share of Series C Preferred
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than (i) shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be cancelled in accordance with
Section 3.1(a), and (ii) shares of Series C Preferred Stock that are
Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive (without
interest) an amount in cash equal to $2.9017 (the "Series C Per Share Merger
Consideration"), which shall be payable in accordance with Section 3.4. At the
Effective Time, all such shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a Stock Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented any such shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Series C Per Share Merger
Consideration.

(c) Conversion of All Other Socrata Stock. Each share of (i) Socrata Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, determined on an as-
converted-to-Socrata Common Stock basis, issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (in each case, other than (A) shares of such
Socrata Stock to be cancelled in accordance with Section 3.1(a), and (B) such
shares that are Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to
receive (without interest) an amount in cash (the "Other Per Share Merger
Consideration") equal to the Total Merger Consideration less the Series C
Merger Consideration, and then divided by the Fully Diluted Shares, as may be
adjusted pursuant to Section 3.5, which shall be payable in accordance with
Section 3.4. At the Effective Time, all such shares of Socrata Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a Stock Certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such shares of Socrata Stock shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Other Per Share Merger
Consideration.

(d) Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

3.2 Treatment of Options and Warrants.



(a) At the Effective Time, each Option that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or
exercisable, shall be, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of any Party, the Optionholder, or any other Person, cancelled and each
Optionholder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, other than
the right to receive with respect only to Vested In-Money Options an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of
shares of Socrata Stock subject to such Vested In-Money Option, multiplied by
(ii) the excess of the Other Per Share Merger Consideration over the per share
exercise price under such Vested In-Money Option, as may be adjusted pursuant
to Section 3.5, which shall be payable in accordance with Section 3.4. After
the Effective Time, each Optionholder shall only be entitled to the payments
described in this Section 3.2(a). For the avoidance of doubt, all unvested or
Out-of-Money Options shall be cancelled and the holders thereof shall not have
any right to receive any consideration in respect thereof or otherwise have
any rights with respect thereto.

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Socrata's board of directors shall
adopt, or cause to be adopted, any resolutions and take any actions necessary
to (i) effectuate the provisions of Section 3.2(a) and (ii) cause the Stock
Plan to terminate at or prior to the Effective Time.

(c) At the Effective Time, each Warrant that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any Party, the Warrantholder, or any other
Person, cancelled and each Warrantholder shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, other than the right to receive with respect only to In-Money
Warrants an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the
aggregate number of shares of Socrata Stock subject to such In-Money Warrant,
multiplied by (ii) the excess of the Other Per Share Merger Consideration over
the per share exercise price under such In-Money Warrant, as may be adjusted
pursuant to Section 3.5, which shall be payable in accordance with Section
3.4. After the Effective Time, each Warrantholder shall only be entitled to
the payments described in this Section 3.2(c). For the avoidance of doubt, all
Out-of-Money Warrants, if any, shall be cancelled and shall not have any right
to receive any consideration in respect thereof.

3.3 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, including Section 3.1, shares of Socrata Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of
Socrata Stock cancelled in accordance with Section 3.1(a)) and held by a
holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented
thereto in writing and who has properly exercised appraisal rights of such
shares of Socrata Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such
shares of Socrata Stock being referred to collectively as the "Dissenting
Shares" until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses
such holder\'s appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares of
Socrata Stock) shall not be converted into a right to receive a portion of the
Total Merger Consideration, but instead shall be entitled to only such rights
as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that if, after
the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws, or loses such
holder\'s right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court
of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to
the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of Socrata Stock
shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into
the right to receive the portion of the Total Merger Consideration, if any, to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.1, without interest
thereon. Socrata shall provide Tyler prompt written notice of any demands
received by Socrata for appraisal of shares of Socrata Stock, any withdrawal
of



any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to
Socrata prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relates to such
demand, and Tyler shall have, at Tyler's sole cost and expense, the
opportunity and right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Tyler, Socrata shall
not make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
demands.

minus (G) the Settlement Adjustment Amount.

(ii) The term "Closing Merger Consideration" means the Total Merger
Consideration less (A) the Working Capital Holdback, and less (B) the
Stockholders' Representative Expense Holdback; provided that for purposes of
calculating the Closing Merger Consideration prior to Closing and for the
purposes of the Consideration Spreadsheet, the Total Merger Consideration
shall be calculated based on the Estimated Closing Company Cash and the
Estimated Closing Working Capital.

(b) Consideration Spreadsheet.

(i) No later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date Socrata shall
deliver to Tyler a spreadsheet (referred to herein as the "Consideration
Spreadsheet") setting forth the following:

(A) the Estimated Closing Company Cash as set forth on the Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet;

(B) the Estimated Closing Working Capital as set on the Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet;

(C) the amount of Closing Company Debt and the holders thereof;

(D) the amount of Transaction Expenses and the payees thereof;

(E) a calculation by Socrata of the Total Merger Consideration;

(F) the allocation by Socrata of the Total Merger Consideration, in accordance
with Sections 3.1(b) and 3.1(c), among the Stockholders, Participating
Warrantholders, and the Participating Optionholders;



(G) the allocation of the Working Capital Holdback among Non-Series C

(ii) The Consideration Spreadsheet shall also set forth any required
withholding amounts, in accordance with Section 3.4(g), for any Stockholder or
Participating Warrantholders.

(iii) If, after initial delivery of the Consideration Spreadsheet, there shall
be any issuances of shares of Socrata Stock upon the exercise of In-Money
Warrants or Vested In-Money Option or any transfers of shares of Socrata
Stock, Socrata shall promptly, and in any event prior to the Closing Date,
deliver to a Tyler an appropriately updated Consideration Spreadsheet that
reflects such issuances or transfers.

(c) Payment Procedures.

(i) Appointment of Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Tyler shall
appoint American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC (the "Paying Agent") to
act as its paying agent in the Merger.

(ii) Paying Agent; Payment Procedures. Tyler shall cause the Paying Agent as
promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any event not
later than two Business Days thereafter, to make available (electronically or
by mail) to each Stockholder and Participating Warrantholder, using the e-mail
address or physical address for such Stockholder or Participating
Warrantholder set forth in the Consideration Spreadsheet, a letter of
transmittal in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (a "Letter
of Transmittal"). From and after the Effective Time, Tyler shall cause the
Paying Agent on behalf of Tyler, to pay to each registered holder of record of
Socrata Stock and each registered holder of In-Money Warrants as of
immediately before the Effective Time (other than to those holders of
Dissenting Shares not entitled to payment and holders of Socrata Stock
referred to in Section 3.3) by wire transfer or check, as directed by each
Stockholder or Participating Warrantholder, the amount of cash from the
Closing Merger Consideration as set forth for such Stockholder or
Participating Warrantholder on the Consideration Spreadsheet, as promptly as
practicable following (a) the submission of a Letter of Transmittal duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
(b) the surrender of Stock Certificates to the Paying Agent by such registered
holder of record, and (c) submission of any other customary documents that the
Paying Agent may



reasonably require in connection therewith, if any. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a registered holder of record of an In-Money Warrant need not
surrender such Warrant to the Paying Agent in order to receive the applicable
consideration such Participating Warrantholder has the right to receive in
respect of such In-Money Warrant pursuant to Section 3.2(c). At the Effective
Time, all Socrata Stock will cease to exist and each outstanding Stock
Certificate that prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Socrata
Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed from and after the
Effective Time, for all purposes, to evidence the right to receive the portion
of the Total Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.1; provided,
however, that, Stock Certificates representing Dissenting Shares will entitle
the holder thereof only the right to receive fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of the DGCL). If after the Effective Time, any
Stock Certificate is presented to the Paying Agent, it shall be exchanged as
provided in this Section 3.4(c)(ii).

(iii) Option Payment Procedures. Tyler shall cause the payroll agent or agents
of the Surviving Corporation (the "Socrata Payroll Agent") on behalf of Tyler,
no later than three Business Days after the Closing Date to cause to pay to
each Participating Optionholder (excluding the Non-Employee Participating
Optionholders), as a special payroll, the cash amount such Participating
Optionholder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.2(a) as set forth
for such Participating Optionholder on the Consideration Spreadsheet, subject
to Section 3.4(g). Tyler shall cause the Paying Agent on behalf of Tyler, no
later than three Business Days after the Closing Date to cause to pay to each
Non-Employee Participating Optionholder, the cash amount such Non-Employee
Participating Optionholder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.2(a)
as set forth for such Participating Optionholder on the Consideration
Spreadsheet.

(d) No Further Ownership Rights in Socrata Stock. The Closing Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE III, subject
to the indemnification provisions set forth herein, the post-Closing
adjustment provisions set forth in Section 3.5, and the rights of the
Stockholders with respect to the Working Capital Holdback, the Stockholders'
Representative Expense Holdback, each as provided herein, shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Socrata Stock formerly represented by such Stock Certificates. From and after
the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of
shares of Socrata Stock on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation.

(e) Lost Stock Certificates. If any Stock Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen, or destroyed, the
Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen, or destroyed
Stock Certificate the Closing Merger Consideration applicable to the type and
number of shares of Socrata Stock evidenced thereby as set forth on
Consideration Spreadsheet for such Stockholder.

(f) Adjustments. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if
at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of Socrata Stock shall
occur, including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split (including reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or distribution paid in stock,
the applicable Per Share Merger



Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall
be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change.

(g) Withholding. As set forth on, and only as set forth on, the Consideration
Spreadsheet (or as may be required with respect to any amounts paid to
Participating Optionholders through the Socrata Payroll Agent) there shall be
deducted and withheld from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any Stockholder or Participating Optionholder such amounts
of Taxes as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local, or
foreign Tax Law. Tyler or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall
promptly pay over, or cause to be promptly paid over, to the appropriate
Governmental Authority responsible for Taxes all such Taxes and promptly
provide evidence of such payment to the applicable Stockholder or
Participating Optionholder. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and
paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority responsible for Taxes by
Tyler or the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the respective
Stockholder or Participating Optionholder in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by Tyler or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable.
In no event shall Tyler or the Surviving Corporation withhold under FIRPTA,
provided that Socrata delivers the FIRPTA Statement as provided in Section
7.11. The Parties agree to cooperate to minimize the amount of any withholding
pursuant to this Section 3.4(g).

3.5 Post-Closing Total Merger Consideration Adjustment.

(a) Not later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Socrata
shall prepare and deliver to Tyler a good faith estimate of the Closing
Balance Sheet (the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet"), including a calculation
of estimated Closing Working Capital (the "Estimated Closing Working Capital")
and estimated Closing Company Cash (the "Estimated Closing Company Cash").
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Socrata may make
cash distributions to the Stockholders prior to the Closing, but only to the
extent Socrata reasonably believes that the Closing Working Capital will be
equal to or greater than zero.

(b) As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 90 days after the
Closing Date, Tyler shall in good faith prepare and deliver to the
Stockholders' Representative an unaudited balance sheet of Socrata as of the
opening of business on the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet"), and set
forth Tyler's calculation of the Closing Working Capital and Closing Company
Cash, in each case prepared in accordance with GAAP (provided that the Closing
Balance Sheet need not contain footnote disclosures) and the Accounting
Guidelines. Tyler shall permit the Stockholders' Representative and its
Representatives to have full access to the books, records, and other documents
of Socrata or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, necessary for the
Stockholders' Representative and its Representatives to review Tyler's
preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and Tyler's calculation of the
Closing Working Capital and Closing Company Cash.

(c) If the Stockholders' Representative disagrees with any part of Tyler's
calculation of the Closing Working Capital or Closing Company Cash, the
Stockholders' Representative shall, within 30 days after the Stockholders'
Representative's receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet and Tyler's calculation
of the Closing Working Capital and Closing Company Cash, notify Tyler in
writing of such disagreement by setting forth the Stockholders'
Representative's calculation of the Closing Working Capital and/or Closing
Company Cash and describing in



reasonable detail the basis for such disagreement (an "Objection Notice"). If
an Objection Notice is delivered to Tyler, then the Stockholders'
Representative and Tyler shall negotiate in good faith to resolve their
disagreements with respect to the computation of the Closing Working Capital
and/or Closing Company Cash. If the Stockholders' Representative and Tyler are
unable to resolve all such disagreements within 30 days after Tyler's receipt
of the Objection Notice, the Stockholders' Representative and Tyler shall
submit such remaining disagreements to BDO USA LLP, or if such firm declines,
such other nationally or regionally-recognized accounting firm as is
acceptable to the Stockholders' Representative and Tyler (the "Accountant").

(d) The Accountant shall resolve all remaining disagreements with respect to
the computation of the Closing Working Capital and Closing Company Cash as
soon as practicable, but in no event later than 60 days after its retention.
The Accountant shall consider only those items and amounts in Tyler's and the
Stockholders' Representative's respective calculations of the Closing Working
Capital and/or Closing Company Cash that are identified as being items and
amounts to which Tyler and the Stockholders' Representative have been unable
to agree. In resolving any disputed item, the Accountant may not assign a
value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by
either Tyler or the Stockholders' Representative or less than the smallest
value for such item claimed by either Tyler or the Stockholders'
Representative. The Accountant's determination of the Closing Working Capital
and/or Closing Company Cash shall be based solely on written materials
submitted by Tyler and the Stockholders' Representative (i.e., not on an
independent review) and on the definitions of "Socrata Working Capital" and
"Closing Company Cash" included in this Agreement and made in accordance with
GAAP, the Accounting Guidelines, and the terms of this Agreement. The
determination of the Accountant shall be conclusive and binding upon the
Parties. The costs and expenses of the Accountant in determining the Closing
Working Capital and/or Closing Company Cash shall be borne by the Party (in
the case of the Stockholders' Representative, the costs and expenses of the
Accountant shall be borne by the Non-Series C Stockholders, Participating
Warrantholders, and Participating Optionholders) whose calculation thereof (or
if both Closing Working Capital and Closing Company Cash are in dispute, the
sum of such calculated amounts) reflects the larger variance from the
Accountant's determination thereof (or if both Closing Working Capital and
Closing Company Cash are in dispute, the sum of the Accountant's
determinations of such amounts). The full amount of such costs and expenses
shall be paid directly by Tyler or the Surviving Corporation, but if such
costs and expenses are to be borne by the Non-Series C Stockholders,
Participating Warrantholders, and Participating Optionholders, Tyler shall
deduct such amount from the Working Capital Holdback. The Closing Working
Capital, as finally determined pursuant to this Section 3.5, shall be referred
to as the "Final Closing Working Capital" and the Closing Company Cash, as
finally determined pursuant to this Section 3.5, shall be referred to as the
"Final Closing Company Cash."

(e) Within five Business Days after the earlier of (i) the Stockholders'
Representative's confirmation that it agrees with Tyler's calculation of the
Closing Working Capital and Closing Company Cash, each as set forth on the
Closing Balance Sheet, and the resulting Closing Merger Consideration, (ii)
the expiration of the 30-day notice period pursuant to Section 3.5(c) without
receipt of an Objection Notice from the Stockholders' Representative, or (iii)
the final resolution of any dispute pursuant to Sections 3.5(c) or 3.5(d):

(i) if the sum of the Final Working Capital and the Final Closing Company Cash
exceeds (or is equal to) the sum of the Estimated Working Capital and the



Estimated Closing Company Cash, then Tyler shall pay an amount in cash equal
to the balance of the Working Capital Holdback plus the amount of such excess
to the Non-Series C Stockholders, the Participating Warrantholders, and the
Participating Optionholders based on their respective Pro Rata Shares, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the Paying Agent for further
distribution to the Non-Series C Stockholders and the Participating
Warrantholders and to the Socrata Payroll Agent for further distribution to
the Participating Optionholders; and

(ii) if the sum of the Final Working Capital and the Final Closing Company
Cash is less than the sum of the Estimated Working Capital and the Estimated
Closing Company Cash, then Tyler shall deduct such amount from the balance of
the Working Capital Holdback and pay the remaining amount of the Working
Capital Holdback to the Non-Series C Stockholders, the Participating
Warrantholders, and the Participating Optionholders based on their respective
Pro Rata Shares, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Paying
Agent for further distribution to the Non-Series C Stockholders and the
Participating Warrantholders and to the Socrata Payroll Agent for further
distribution to the Participating Optionholders. If the balance of the Working
Capital Holdback is insufficient to compensate Tyler, then Tyler shall deliver
written notice thereof to the Non-Series C Stockholders, Participating
Warrantholders, and Participating Optionholders of their obligation to pay to
Tyler, based on their respective Pro Rata Shares, the amount of such
deficiency and setting forth for each the respective amount due, within 30
days of receipt of such notice.

(f) Any payments made pursuant to this Section 3.5 shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Total Merger Consideration by the Parties for Tax purposes,
unless otherwise required by applicable Tax Law.

jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing, or
operation of its properties makes such qualification or registration
necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified
or registered would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have



a Material Adverse Effect. Each such jurisdiction in which Socrata is
qualified or registered to do business is set forth on Schedule 4.1(b).

4.2 Authorization; Binding Agreement. The execution, delivery, and performance
by Socrata of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents to which it is a
party, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, including the Merger, have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Socrata, including by the board of directors
of Socrata, subject only, in the case of the consummation of the Merger, to
the requisite affirmative vote or consent of the Stockholders. This Agreement
has been, and the Ancillary Documents to which Socrata is a party will be,
duly executed and delivered by Socrata and, assuming the due authorization,
execution, and delivery hereof and thereof by each of the Tyler Entities that
are parties thereto, constitutes or, with respect to such Ancillary Documents
upon execution and delivery will each constitute, a valid and binding
obligation of Socrata, enforceable against Socrata in accordance with its
terms, subject to (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar Laws affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors'

Socrata under, or result in the creation of any Encumbrance upon any of the
properties or assets of Socrata under, any Material Contract, or (c) subject
to the Authorizations or filings referred to in Section 4.4(a), violate any
judgment, order, decree, or Law applicable to Socrata, other than, in the case
of clauses (b) and (c), any such conflicts, breaches, violations, defaults,
rights, losses, or Encumbrances that would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

4.4 Consents and Authorizations.

(a) No Authorization of, action by or in respect of, or registration,
declaration, or filing with, or notice to, any Governmental Authority or
consent or approval by or notice to any counterparty to a Material Contract is

Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except for:
(i) the Merger Filing; (ii) as set forth on Schedule 4.3; and (iii) such other
Authorizations or Third Party consents, approvals, or notices, the failure of
which to be made or obtained, individually or in the aggregate, would not

would not prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Socrata has obtained all Authorizations that are necessary to carry on the
businesses conducted by it as currently conducted, except for any such
Authorization with respect to which the failure of Socrata to possess would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material



Adverse Effect. To Socrata's Knowledge, no event has occurred, and no
circumstance or condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) would reasonably be expected to constitute or result in a
violation by Socrata of, or a failure to comply with the terms of, any
Authorization, other than any violation or failure that would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on Schedule
4.4(b), Socrata has not received from any Governmental Authority specific
written notification that any such Authorization (i) is not in full force and
effect, (ii) has been violated in any respect, or (iii) is subject to any
suspension, revocation, modification, or cancellation in any circumstance

Effect. There is no Proceeding pending or, to Socrata's Knowledge, threatened
regarding suspension, revocation, modification, or cancellation of any of such
Authorizations, except in any circumstances in which the suspension,
revocation, modification, or cancellation of such Authorizations would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

note, security agreement, guaranty agreement, and mortgage or deed of trust,
or any similar instrument, to which Socrata is a party, (C) each operating
lease in excess of $50,000 per annum and each capital lease to which Socrata
is a party with respect to equipment or other personal property regardless of
the dollar amount thereof, and (D) the licenses,



sub-licenses, agreements, or permissions with respect to Socrata's license
from Third Parties of material Intellectual Property (including a description

all material commitments and obligations pertaining to it, and is not in
default under, any of the Material Contracts, in each case, except for matters

Knowledge, no other party to a Material Contract is in material breach thereof
or in material default thereunder. No written notice of material default or
material dispute has been received by Socrata with respect to a Material
Contract, and Socrata has no Knowledge of any basis therefor. To Socrata's
Knowledge, (i) no other party to any Material Contract is currently entitled,
or will be become entitled as a result of the Merger, to receive software
source code or other physical embodiment of any Intellectual Property and (ii)
no event has occurred that constitutes a material breach or material default
by Socrata or any other party thereto (including with the giving of notice or
lapse of time or both).

"Owned Intellectual Property." All material Owned Intellectual Property is in
full force and effect and all required filings and fees related to the
registered Owned Intellectual Property have been timely filed with and paid to
the relevant Governmental Authorities and authorized registrars, and all
registered Owned Intellectual Property is otherwise in good standing. To
Socrata's Knowledge, as of the date of this Agreement, the Owned Intellectual
Property does not include any other U.S. or foreign items of registered
Intellectual Property other than those listed in Schedule 4.12(a)(i)-(vi).



(b) Socrata possesses all right, title, and interest in and to all of the
Owned Intellectual Property, free and clear of any Encumbrances other than
Permitted Encumbrances. To Socrata's Knowledge, no Person has either asserted
any rights in, or any other right of use with respect to, the Owned
Intellectual Property. To Socrata's Knowledge, Socrata does not have any
obligation to compensate any Person for any development, license, or
modification, use, sale, or distribution of any of the Owned Intellectual
Property, except as described on Schedule 4.12(b). Except as set forth on
Schedule 4.12(b), to the Knowledge of Socrata, there is no unauthorized use,
disclosure, infringement, or misappropriation of any Owned Intellectual
Property by any current or former employee of Socrata or other Third Party.
None of the Owned Intellectual Property has been adjudicated by a United
States court to be invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, and to
Socrata's Knowledge, the Owned Intellectual Property is valid and enforceable,
and Socrata has not received any written notice from a Third Party alleging
that any Owned Intellectual Property is invalid or unenforceable. No Owned
Intellectual Property is subject to any outstanding injunction, judgment,
order, decree, ruling, charge, settlement, or other disposition of any dispute
in a United States court regarding any Owned Intellectual Property.

(c) The Owned Intellectual Property, together with (i) the Intellectual
Property licensed by Socrata from Third Parties and (ii) the material Software
described in Section 4.12(a)(vii) and on Schedule 4.12(c) that is licensed by
Socrata (collectively, the "Licensed Intellectual Property"), constitutes all
of the material Intellectual Property necessary for the conduct of Socrata's
business as conducted on the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date.

(d) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.12(d), Socrata has not granted any
license of any kind relating to any material Owned Intellectual Property,
except incidental, nonexclusive licenses to end-users, customers or third
parties providing services to Socrata in the ordinary course of business.
Except as set forth on Schedule 4.12(d), Socrata is not bound by or a party to
any agreement materially restricting the use of any material Owned
Intellectual Property (including, by way of example, any coexistence agreement
or settlement agreement).

(e) To the Knowledge of Socrata, the conduct and operation of Socrata's
business does not infringe, misappropriate, dilute, violate, or otherwise
impair any valid Intellectual Property right of any other Person. There is (i)
no Proceeding pending, or to Socrata's Knowledge, threatened, with respect to
the Owned Intellectual Property, or (ii) no judgment or order regarding any
Proceeding has been rendered by any competent Governmental Authority and no
settlement agreement or similar contractual obligation has been entered into
by Socrata with respect to any Proceeding regarding the Owned Intellectual
Property. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.12(e), Socrata has not received in
the past two years any written notice (i) regarding the infringement,
misappropriation, or other violation of any Intellectual Property of any
Person claiming that use of the Owned Intellectual Property infringes the
Intellectual Property rights of any such person or (ii) challenging the
validity, enforceability, ownership, or use of any Owned Intellectual Property
(including cease and desist letters or invitations to take a license), or
(iii) trademark oppositions, cancellation, or invalidation actions of the
Owned Intellectual Property. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.12(e), Socrata
does not have any pending claims against Third Parties alleging infringement
of the Owned Intellectual Property or oppositions or cancellation actions
against Third-Party trademark applications.



(f) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.12(f), no Socrata employee or former
Socrata employee: (i) is in material violation, to the Knowledge of Socrata,
of any term or covenant of any employment Contract relating to Intellectual
Property, patent disclosure agreement, invention assignment agreement,
nondisclosure agreement, or noncompetition agreement with any Third Party by
virtue of such employee being employed by, or performing services for,
Socrata; (ii) has failed to execute and deliver to Socrata a Contract
regarding the protection of Socrata's or its customer's and business partner's
proprietary information and trade secrets; (iii) has failed to execute and
deliver a written Contract assigning to Socrata all right, title, and interest
in any inventions and works of authorship, whether or not patentable,
invented, created, developed, conceived, or reduced to practice during the
term of such employee's work for Socrata, and all Intellectual Property rights
therein; or (iv) to the Knowledge of Socrata, has any right, license, claim,
or interest whatsoever in or with respect to any Owned Intellectual Property.

(g) To the Knowledge of Socrata, no Third Party has any rights to terminate
any assignment or license to Socrata with respect to the Owned Intellectual
Property or the Licensed Intellectual Property.

(h) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.12(h) or in the ordinary course of
business (including in any customer contracts entered into by Socrata in the
ordinary course of business regardless of whether such contract is on
Socrata's or its customer's form of agreement), Socrata has not agreed to
indemnify any entity or Person for any infringement of any Intellectual
Property of any Third Party in connection with the providing, selling,
licensing, marketing, or distributing any Socrata products or services.

(i) To Socrata's Knowledge, its business as currently conducted does not
involve the use or development of, or engagement in, encryption technology, or
other technology, the development, commercialization, or export of which is
restricted under applicable Law.

(j) Socrata employed commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all
material source code for the Software created by Socrata employees involved in
its business ("Socrata Developed Software") is documented in accordance with
general software industry standards. To Socrata's Knowledge, no portion of the
Socrata Developed Software and no other Software constituting Owned
Intellectual Property, contains any disabling mechanism or protection feature
designed to prevent its use, computer virus, worm, Software lock, drop dead
device, trojan-horse routine, trap door, time bomb, or any other codes or
instructions that may be used to access, modify, delete, damage, or disable
any computer system.

(k) Socrata owns or has a valid and enforceable right to use all material
Internal Use Software, and all computer hardware and telecommunications
systems used by Socrata (the "Information Systems"). The Internal Use Software
and the Information Systems, and Socrata's rights with respect to the Internal
Use Software and Information Systems, are adequate in all material respects to
serve the needs of its business in the manner and to the extent presently
conducted. Socrata's back-up and disaster recovery plans and policies adopted
or in effect with respect to the Internal Use Software, the Information
Systems, and the information and data used in the conduct of Socrata's
business in the manner and to the extent presently conducted are adequate to
meet the needs of the business of Socrata as presently conducted.



(l) To the Knowledge of Socrata, Socrata is in compliance in all material
respects with applicable Laws relating to privacy, data protection and
personally identifiable information and similar consumer protection laws.
Socrata has taken commercially reasonable and appropriate steps to protect and
maintain all material Owned Intellectual Property, including to preserve the
confidentiality of any material trade secrets. Socrata has not received in the
past two years any written notice of any loss of, or unauthorized access, use,
disclosure, or modification of any trade secrets and, to Socrata's Knowledge,
there has been no loss of, or unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or
modification of any trade secrets, except as would not reasonably be expected
to be material to Socrata, taken as a whole, or to the value of the Owned
Intellectual Property.

4.13 Environmental Matters. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.13, (a) Socrata
has complied with and is in compliance, in all material respects, with all
Environmental, Health, and Safety Laws, including Environmental, Health, and
Safety Laws relating to air, water, land, and the generation, storage, use,
handling, transportation, treatment, or disposal of Hazardous Substances; (b)
Socrata has obtained and complied, in all material respects, with all
necessary permits and other approvals necessary to treat, transport, store,

storage, or disposal facility, nor, to Socrata's Knowledge, has such facility
ever applied for an Authorization designating it as a treatment, storage, or
disposal facility, under any Environmental, Health, and Safety Law.

4.14 Employment.

(a) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.14(a), Socrata is not bound by or
subject to any arrangement with any labor union. No employees of Socrata are

representation in progress. There is no pending or, to Socrata's Knowledge,
threatened labor dispute involving Socrata and any group of its employees nor

of each of such persons as of the date hereof. Except as set forth on Schedule
4.14(b), (i) there are no employment agreements, including employment offer

Socrata is not liable for any arrearages of employee compensation (including
wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, or other compensation) or any Taxes or
any penalty for failure to comply with any of the foregoing, including any
state law regarding the timely payment of employee compensation (or, if any
arrears, penalty, or interest were assessed against Socrata regarding the
foregoing, it has been fully satisfied). To Socrata's Knowledge, Socrata is
not liable for any payment to any trust or other fund or to any Governmental
Authority with respect to unemployment compensation benefits, social security
benefits, or other benefits or obligations for employees (other than routine

practice).

(d) All Persons characterized and treated by Socrata as independent
contractors or consultants are properly treated as independent contractors
under all applicable Laws, and (ii) all employees of Socrata classified as

4.15 Employee Benefit Plans.

(a) Schedule 4.15(a) sets forth an accurate schedule of (i) each "employee
benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), (ii) each material bonus, deferred

appreciation right, phantom stock, supplemental pension,



executive compensation, cafeteria, dependent care, director or employee loan,
fringe benefit, sabbatical, severance (including any termination pay or
similar plan, program, policy, agreement, or arrangement) plan, vacation

each other material employee benefit plan, arrangement, agreement, program,
policy or practice, whether oral or written, formal or informal, funded or
unfunded, registered or unregistered, in the case of each of clauses (i),
(ii), and (iii), that is sponsored, maintained, or contributed to by Socrata
or any ERISA Affiliate for the benefit of any current or former employee of
Socrata or with respect to which Socrata has a material liability (each such
plan and arrangement referred to hereinafter as an "Socrata Plan"). Socrata
has no commitment, proposal, or communication to employees regarding the
creation of an additional benefit plan or any material increase in benefits
under any Socrata Plan (that is not already reflected in the terms of such
Socrata Plan). Neither Socrata nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained,
contributed to or been obligated to contribute to or has any liability with
respect to, any plan, program, fund, or arrangement that constitutes a plan
subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA or a "multi-employer
plan" as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA. Each Socrata Plan may be
terminated by Socrata, or, if applicable, by an ERISA Affiliate in accordance
with its terms and without any material liability, cost, or expense to
Socrata, other than costs and expenses that are customary in connection with
the termination or amendment, as applicable, of a comparable employee benefit
plan and benefits that are accrued under such Socrata Plan as of the date of
such amendment or termination.

(b) Each Socrata Plan listed on Schedule 4.15(a) is in compliance in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code, and any
other applicable Law. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.15(b) or as would not
reasonably be expected to result in a liability to Socrata, with respect to
each Socrata Plan, all reports and other documents required under ERISA or
other applicable Law to be filed with any Governmental Authority, including
all Forms 5500, or required to be distributed to participants or
beneficiaries, have been duly and timely filed or distributed. Except as set
forth on Schedule 4.15(b), each Socrata Plan that is intended to be
"qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (a "Qualified
Plan") is the subject of a favorable determination letter from the IRS or
utilizes a prototype or volume submitter plan document that is the subject of
a favorable opinion or advisory letter issued by the IRS to the sponsor of
such prototype or volume submitter plan, and, to Socrata's Knowledge, nothing
has occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualified status of any Qualified Plan. With respect to each Socrata Plan that
is subject to Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4980B of
the Code and similar state Law provisions, the applicable requirements thereof
have been satisfied in all material respects by Socrata and each ERISA
Affiliate. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.15(b) or as would not reasonably
be expected to result in a material liability to Socrata, all accrued
contribution obligations or premium payment of Socrata with respect to any
Socrata Plan have either been fulfilled in their entirety or are reflected in
the Financial Statements in accordance with, and to the extent required by,
GAAP.

(c) Neither Socrata nor any ERISA Affiliate owes, with respect to any Socrata
Plan, any material liability for excise tax or penalty due to the IRS. No act,
omission, or transaction has occurred that would result, directly or
indirectly, through its own liability, indemnification, or otherwise, in
imposition on Socrata of (i) material breach of fiduciary duty liability
damages under Section 409 of ERISA or (ii) any material liability under
Section 502(l) of ERISA.



(d) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.15(d), neither Socrata nor any ERISA
Affiliate maintains any Socrata Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" within
the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA that provides for continuing benefits or
coverage for any participant or any beneficiary of a participant after such
participant's termination of employment, except (i) as may be required by
applicable Law, including Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section
4980B of the Code and similar state Law provisions, (ii) benefits through the
end of the month of termination of employment, (iii) death benefits
attributable to deaths occurring at or prior to termination of employment,
(iv) disability benefits attributable to disabilities occurring at or prior to
termination of employment, and (v) conversion rights. Neither Socrata nor any
ERISA Affiliate maintains, has established, has ever participated in or been
obligated to contribute to, or has any liability to a multiple employer
welfare benefit arrangement as described in Section 3(40)(A) of ERISA. With
respect to any insurance policy providing funding for benefits under any
Socrata Plan, Socrata has no material liability in the nature of a retroactive
rate adjustment, loss sharing arrangement or other similar liability, nor
would there be any such liability if such insurance policy was terminated on
the date hereof.

(e) There are no pending, or to Socrata's Knowledge threatened Proceedings
(other than routine claims for benefits, appeals of such claims, and domestic
relations order Proceedings) asserted or instituted against the assets of any
Socrata Plan or its related trust or, to Socrata's Knowledge, against any
fiduciary of an Socrata Plan with respect to the operation of such Socrata
Plan. To Socrata's Knowledge, there are no investigations or audits of any
Socrata Plan by any Governmental Authority currently pending and there have
been no such investigations or audits that have been concluded that resulted
in any material liability to Socrata that has not been fully discharged. There
is no pending voluntary compliance, closing agreement program or other matter
under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System with respect to a
Socrata Plan.

(f) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a material
liability to Socrata, neither Socrata nor any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in
any prohibited transaction, within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code, in connection with any Socrata Plan for which
exemption was not available and that has not been fully corrected (including
the payment of any associated excise taxes, penalties and interest) in
accordance with ERISA and the Code. Except as would not reasonably be expected
to result in a material liability to Socrata, Socrata and each ERISA Affiliate
have, for purposes of each Socrata Plan, correctly classified those
individuals performing services for Socrata and each ERISA Affiliate as common
law employees, leased employees, independent contractors or agents.

(g) Socrata has made available to Tyler complete, accurate, and current copies
of each of the following:

(i) the current plan document (including amendments thereto) of each Socrata
Plan, to the extent reduced to writing, all related trust documents
(including, but not limited to, any tax-exempt trust, secular trust, VEBA, and
"rabbi trust" document), if applicable, as currently in effect, and all
material associated contracts (including insurance contracts, HMO/PPO/POS
agreements, recordkeeping contracts, trustee contracts, and third-party
administrator contracts);



(ii) a summary of the material terms of each Socrata Plan, to the extent not
previously reduced to writing;

(iii) with respect to each Socrata Plan that is an employee benefit plan (as

Section 401(a) of the Code, the most recent determination or opinion letter
concerning such Plan's qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code, as
issued by the IRS.

(h) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.15(h), the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either immediately or
upon the occurrence of any event thereafter, (i) entitle any current or former
employee, officer, director, or independent contractor of Socrata to severance
pay or any other payment, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or
increase the amount of compensation otherwise due any such individual, (iii)
result in any portion of any payment to any such individual not being
deductible by Socrata, or (iv) conflict with the provisions of any Socrata
Plan.

4.16 Insurance.

(a) All insurance policies currently owned or held by Socrata (each, an
"Insurance Policy"), are set forth on Schedule 4.16(a), including (i) insurer,
(ii) type of policy, (iii) coverage period, (iv) policy number, (v) policy
limits and deductibles, self-insured retentions, or retrospective loss limits,
and (vi) the extent, if any, to which the limits of liability or coverage have
been exhausted. The Insurance Policies are in full force and effect and all
premiums currently payable or previously due with respect to such Insurance
Policies have been paid and Socrata has no liability for any premium
adjustments, audits, or other retroactive adjustments related to any period
prior to the date of this Agreement. No written notice of cancellation or
termination has been received by Socrata with respect to any Insurance Policy.
Socrata has not received any written notice of non-coverage, reservation of
rights, or rejection of tender for any outstanding claim with respect to any
Insurance Policy.



(b) The Insurance Policies, to the Knowledge of Socrata, provide adequate
insurance coverage for Socrata and its business, assets, and properties.

(c) Schedule 4.16(c) sets forth an accurate list of all claims or losses
valued within the last one year provided by each applicable insurance company
showing all workers' compensation, property, marine, inland marine, fidelity,
aviation, liability, auto, or other insurance claims relating to any event or
occurrence that took place or was discovered at any time during the past six
policy years, including the status of any claims payment. Socrata has not
failed to give any notice or present any claim under any Insurance Policy in
due and timely fashion. Socrata has not been, and is not now, the subject of
any claim relating to damage or injury in excess of its then current Insurance
Policy liability or coverage limits or for which coverage has been denied by
its insurer. Since December 31, 2017, Socrata has not suffered any physical
damage to its assets that is not fully covered by the Insurance Policies,
other than deductibles under its Insurance Policies and other than self-
insured retentions set forth on Schedule 4.16(a).

there are no Proceedings pending or, to Socrata's Knowledge, threatened
against (a) Socrata, (b) Socrata's directors, officers, or employees in their
capacity as such, or (c) Socrata's properties, assets or business. No written
notice of any Proceeding, whether pending or threatened, has been received by
Socrata and, to Socrata's knowledge, there is no basis therefor. Except to the
extent set forth on Schedule 4.17, Socrata has conducted and is conducting its
business in compliance in all material respects with all Laws applicable to
Socrata, its assets, or the operation of its business.

timely filed. Socrata is not currently the beneficiary of any extension of
time within which to file any Tax Return other than extensions of time to file
Tax Returns obtained in the ordinary course of business. Such Tax Returns are
(or, if to be filed, will be) true, complete, and correct in all material
respects. All material Taxes due and owing by Socrata (whether or not shown on
any Tax Return) have been, or will be, timely paid. There are no Encumbrances

GAAP) upon the assets of Socrata. All required estimated Tax payments
sufficient to avoid any underpayment penalty or interest have been timely

ending on or before the Balance Sheet Date does not, in the aggregate, exceed
the amount of accruals for Taxes (excluding reserves for deferred Taxes)
reflected on the Financial Statements. The amount of Socrata's liability for

6.2 Access to Information. Socrata shall afford to Tyler, and to Tyler's
Representatives, upon Socrata's approval (which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed) of a reasonable request by
Tyler to be provided reasonable access during normal business hours during the
period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement to all

other information, and to those employees of Socrata to whom Tyler reasonably
requests access; provided, however, that any such access shall be conducted
during normal business hours under the supervision of Socrata' personnel and
in such a manner as not to interfere with the normal operations of Socrata.
During such period, Socrata shall furnish, as promptly as practicable, to
Tyler all information concerning Socrata's business, properties, and Socrata
employees as Tyler may reasonably request (it being agreed, however, that the
foregoing shall not permit any Tyler Entity or any such Representatives to
conduct any environmental testing or sampling). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Socrata shall not be required to provide access to or disclose information if

Law or any Contract to which Socrata is a party, in each case it being agreed
that Socrata and Tyler shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause such
information to be provided in a manner that does not cause such jeopardization

not in conjunction with a Third Party) solicit, encourage, or initiate any
offer or proposal from, or enter into, re-start, solicit, initiate, or
otherwise engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or seek, encourage,
or respond to, or provide or disclose any information to, or enter into any
agreement, terms, arrangement, or understanding (whether or not legally
binding) with, any Person or group of Persons other than the Tyler Entities
and its Representatives with respect to any transaction involving any
acquisition of or investment in, or any disposal (whether by way of sale,
offer, transfer, assignment or otherwise) of, a material portion of Socrata
Stock (or interest therein), or a material portion of the assets of Socrata,
except in any such case to notify any such Person or group of Persons of the
existence of this Section 6.3(a).

(b) During the Exclusivity Period, the Tyler Entities shall exclusively be in
discussions and negotiate with Socrata and shall not, and will procure that
its Representatives shall not, directly or indirectly (whether or not in
conjunction with a Third Party) solicit, encourage, or initiate any offer or
proposal from, or enter into, re-start, solicit, initiate, or otherwise engage
in any discussions or negotiations with, or seek, encourage, or respond to, or
provide or disclose any nonpublic information to, or enter into any agreement,
terms, arrangement, or understanding (whether or not legally binding) with,
any Person or group of Persons other than Socrata and its Affiliates or
Representatives concerning any transaction involving any acquisition of or
investment in, or any disposal (whether by way of sale, offer, transfer,
assignment, or otherwise) of, a material portion of the shares or equity (or
any interest therein) of any Third Party that is a Competitive Business, or a
material portion of the assets of any such Third Party (any such transaction
described in Sections 6.3(a) or 6.3(b) to be considered an "Alternative
Transaction"), except in any such case to notify any such Person or group of
Persons of the existence of this Section 6.3(b).

(c) If either Socrata, on the one hand, and the Tyler Entities, on the other
hand or any of its Representatives receives any proposal for, or inquiry
respecting, any Alternative Transaction, or any request for nonpublic
information in connection with any such Alternative Transaction, such Party
will promptly notify the other such Party, describing in reasonable detail the
identity of the Person or group of Persons making such proposal or inquiry and
the terms and conditions of such proposal or inquiry.

6.4 Stockholder Approval.

(a) Socrata shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (if not
obtained on or before the date of this Agreement), within two Business Days
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the written consent of
Stockholders holding the requisite number of shares of Socrata Stock under the
DGCL and Socrata's Certificate of Incorporation, as amended,



with respect to authorization and approval of the Merger and authorization,
approval, and adoption of this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL (the
"Stockholder Consent"). Promptly following receipt of the Stockholder Consent,
Socrata shall deliver a copy of the Stockholder Consent to Tyler.

(b) Promptly following receipt of the Stockholder Consent, Socrata shall
prepare and mail a notice to every Stockholder that did not execute the
Stockholder Consent. Such notice shall (i) be a statement to the effect that
Socrata's board of directors unanimously determined that the Merger is
advisable in accordance with the DGCL and in the best interests of the
Stockholders and unanimously approved and adopted this Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) provide the Stockholders
to whom it is sent with notice of the actions taken in the Stockholder
Consent, including the approval and adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with Section 228(e)
of the DGCL and Socrata's Bylaws, and (iii) notify such Stockholders of their
dissent and appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. Such notice
shall include therewith a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL and all such other
information as required by the DGCL and otherwise conforming, in all material
respects, to applicable Law, and shall be sufficient in form and substance to
start the 20-day period during which a Stockholder must demand appraisal of
such Stockholder's Socrata Stock as contemplated by Section 262(d)(2) of the
DGCL. All materials submitted to the Stockholders in accordance with this
Section 6.4(b) shall be subject to Tyler's advance review and reasonable
approval (which such review and approval shall not be unreasonably delayed,
conditioned or withheld).

(c) Following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and not less than
two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Socrata shall (a) submit to all
Persons entitled to vote the material facts concerning all payments and
benefits that Socrata reasonably believes, in the absence of stockholder
approval of such payments and benefits, could be "parachute payments" within
the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code ("Parachute Payments"), and
which are payable to individuals from whom Socrata receives a parachute
payment waiver agreement (a "Parachute Waiver"), as described below, and (b)
solicit the approval and consent of all such Persons with respect to the
Parachute Payments. In connection therewith, Socrata shall use reasonable
efforts to obtain and deliver to Tyler, prior to the initiation of the
foregoing stockholder vote, a Parachute Waiver from each Person whom Socrata
reasonably believes is a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of
Section 280G(c) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder) and who might otherwise receive any Parachute Payments in
connection with the Merger. In connection with the foregoing, Tyler shall
cooperate with Socrata in a timely manner to provide any information in its
possession regarding any potential Parachute Payments, and Socrata shall
provide copies of all documents prepared by Socrata and its counsel in
connection with this Section 6.4(c) to Tyler, for its review and reasonable
comment, at least two Business Days in advance of distribution of any
information with respect to such Parachute Payments to Socrata's stockholders.
Prior to the Closing Date, Socrata shall deliver to Tyler evidence that a vote
of the Socrata stockholders was solicited in accordance with the foregoing and
that either (i) the Parachute Waivers were obtained before the vote and the
requisite number of votes of the Socrata stockholders was obtained with
respect to the Parachute payments (the "280G Approval") or (ii) the Parachute
Waivers were not obtained before the vote and/or the 280G Approval was not
obtained, and, as a consequence, the Parachute Payments shall not be made or
provided.



6.5 Notification of Certain Matters. Socrata shall give notice to Tyler and
Tyler shall give notice to Socrata, as promptly as reasonably practicable,
upon becoming aware of (a) any fact, change, condition, circumstance, event,
occurrence, or non-occurrence that has caused or is reasonably likely to cause
any representation or warranty in this Agreement made by it to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect at any time after the date of this
Agreement and before the Effective Time that would cause the condition set
forth in Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.3(a), as applicable, not to be satisfied
as of the Closing Date, (b) any material failure on its part to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition, or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement, or (c) the institution of or the threat of
institution of any Proceeding related to this Agreement or the Merger;
provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 11.10, the
delivery of any notice in accordance with this Section 6.5 shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available under this Agreement to such Party
(including the right to seek indemnification in accordance with ARTICLE VII or
ARTICLE X and the rights of the Stockholders' Representative to seek
indemnification in accordance with Section 11.13), the representations or
warranties of the Parties, or the conditions to the obligations of the
Parties; provided, further, however, that the unintentional failure to give
notice under this Section 6.5 will not be deemed to be a breach of covenant
under this Section 6.5 and will constitute only a breach of the underlying
representation, warranty, condition, or agreement, as the case may be.

6.6 Restrictive Covenants Agreement. Contemporaneously with the execution of
this Agreement, as a material inducement to Tyler's execution of this
Agreement, Kevin Merritt, a Principal Stockholder, and Tyler shall have
entered into a Restrictive Covenants Agreement, to be effective upon the
Closing Date subject to consummation of the Merger, in form and substance
satisfactory to Tyler.

6.7 Consents, Approvals, Orders, and Authorizations.

(a) Each Party (other than the Stockholders' Representative) shall, as
promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) make, or cause to be made, all filings
and submissions required under any Law applicable to such party or any of its
Affiliates, and (ii) obtain or provide, or cause to be obtained, as set forth
in Schedule 6.7(a), all Authorizations from Governmental Authorities and all
consents or approvals by or notices to Third Parties that may be or become

provided, however, that for the avoidance of doubt, only such Authorizations,
consents, or approvals set forth on Schedule 6.7(a) that are expressly
identified as "Required Consents" shall be required to be obtained or
delivered on or before the Closing Date. Each Party shall reasonably cooperate
with the other Parties and their Affiliates in promptly seeking to obtain all
such consents, approvals, orders, and Authorizations. The Parties shall not
willfully take any action that will have the effect of delaying, impairing or
impeding the receipt of any required consents, approvals, orders, and
Authorizations.

(b) Socrata shall be responsible for all fees and expenses incurred with
obtaining any consents or approvals from Third Parties, or Authorizations,
giving notices, or making filings, in each case as set forth in Section 4.4(a)
(provided, however, that any such fees and expenses shall be paid by Socrata
in full prior to the Closing or accrued in full on the books and records of
Socrata prior to the Closing; and, provided further, that Socrata shall not be
obligated to pay any consideration



therefor to any Third Party from whom consent or approval is requested),
except that Tyler shall be solely responsible for the Merger Filing.

6.8 Employees.

(a) All Socrata employees who continue employment with the Surviving
Corporation or Tyler shall be entitled to participate in Tyler's standard
employee benefit plans and program, and shall be given credit for such
employee's continuous service with Socrata for purposes of determining
eligibility, vesting, and, to the extent applicable, the level of benefits
under each benefit plan, program, practice, policy, and arrangement maintained
by Tyler or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including, after Closing,
the Surviving Corporation) following the Closing and in which any Socrata
employee (or the spouse, domestic partner, or dependents of any Socrata
employee) participates or is eligible to participate (each, a "Tyler Plan").
Tyler will cause each Tyler Plan that is a welfare benefit plan, within the
meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, (i) to waive any and all eligibility waiting
periods, evidence-of-insurability requirements, actively-at-work requirements,
pre-existing condition limitations, and other exclusions and limitations with
respect to the Socrata employees and their spouses, domestic partners, and
dependents to the extent waived, satisfied, or not included under the
corresponding Socrata Plan, and (ii) to recognize for each Socrata employee
for purposes of applying annual deductible, co-payment, and out-of-pocket
maximums under such Tyler Plan any deductible, co-payment, and out-of-pocket
expenses paid by the Socrata employee and his or her spouse, domestic partner
and dependents under the corresponding Socrata Plan during the plan year of
such Socrata Plan in which occurs the later of (A) the Closing Date and (B)
the date on which the Socrata employee begins participating in such Tyler
Plan.

(b) With respect to any employees of Socrata who Tyler and Socrata shall have
mutually agreed in that certain Side Letter, dated as of the date hereof,
between Tyler and Socrata, shall not continue employment with the Surviving
Corporation or Tyler after the Closing, any severance payments in connection
therewith (the "Severance Costs") shall be accrued on the Closing Balance
Sheet and the cost thereof shall be borne equally by Socrata and Tyler through
the calculation of the Closing Working Capital. Severance Costs shall not
include Change of Control Payments.

(c) Socrata shall be responsible for the payment of any Change of Control
Payments that are payable by Socrata to any employee solely as a result of the
occurrence of the Merger; provided, however, that any such Change of Control
Payments shall be paid by Socrata in full on or before the Closing or accrued
in full on the books and records of Socrata on or before the Closing; and,
provided further, that in no event shall any of the following be considered
Change of Control Payments: (i) any payments made pursuant to any offer letter
or any Contract entered into by Socrata with any employee of Socrata at the
direction of Tyler, (ii) any change of control, termination, severance
payments, golden parachute, deal bonus or similar payments that are paid to
any employee of Socrata as the result of the termination of such employee's
employment or such independent contractor's or consultant's service with
Socrata as a result or in contemplation of the Merger on or before the Closing
Date, which shall instead be included as part of Severance Costs, (iii) any
change of control, termination, severance payments, golden parachute, deal
bonus or similar payments that are paid to any employee of Socrata after the
Closing Date, and (iv) any bonus or other similar payments to any employee of
Socrata pursuant to any agreement or arrangement adopted or entered into by
Tyler, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates after the
Effective Time.



(d) This Section 6.8 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the Parties, and nothing in this Section 6.8, express or implied,
shall confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 6.8. Nothing contained herein,
express or implied, shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement. The Parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this Section 6.8 shall not
create any right in any Socrata employee or any other Person to any continued
employment with the Surviving Corporation or Tyler or any of their respective
Affiliates or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever.

(e) Contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, as a material
inducement to Tyler's execution of this Agreement, Tyler shall have entered
into a mutually acceptable Employment Agreement, to be effective upon the
Closing Date subject to consummation of the Merger, with each of the
individuals identified on Schedule 6.8 (collectively, the "Employment
Agreements").

6.9 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the
Party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is
consummated.

6.10 Public Announcements. The Tyler Entities, on the one hand, and Socrata
prior to the Closing and the Stockholders' Representative following the
Closing, on the other hand, shall not issue any press release, make a general
communication to Socrata employees, or make any public statement, in each case
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, prior to (a)
consulting with each other Party, and giving such other the opportunity to
review and comment upon any such press release, communication, or other public
statements, and (b) obtaining such other Party's written consent (e-mail being
sufficient) to the issuance of any such press release or other public
statements; provided, however, that either Party may, after the date hereof,
(i) make such disclosures or statements as it reasonably believes to be
required by applicable Law or the rule of any national securities exchange
(including, for this purpose, The New York Stock Exchange) and (ii) in the
case of the Stockholders' Representative, following Closing, disclose
information to the Non-Series C Stockholders, the Participating
Warrantholders, and the Participating Optionholders who have a need to know
such information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, following Closing and the
public announcement of the Merger, the Stockholders' Representative shall be
permitted to publicly announce that it has been engaged to serve as the
Stockholders' Representative in connection with the Merger as long as such
announcement does not disclose any of the other terms of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated herein

6.11 Further Assurances. Subject to, and not in limitation of, Section 6.11,
each of the Parties shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement) to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all
actions necessary or desirable to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) fulfill or obtain the fulfillment
of, at the earliest practicable date, the conditions precedent to the
consummation thereof, including the execution and delivery of any documents,
certificates, instruments, or other papers that are reasonably required for
the consummation thereof.

(a) Tyler agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses,
and exculpation by Socrata now existing in favor of each Person who is now, or
has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, an officer or director of Socrata, as provided in the
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Socrata, in each case as in effect
on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other agreements in effect
on the date hereof and disclosed on Schedule 6.12, shall survive the Closing
Date and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
respective terms.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Socrata shall arrange to obtain as of the
Closing Date "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of six years from
the Closing Date with at least the same coverage and amounts, and containing
terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the directors and
officers of Socrata, as provided by each of Socrata's claims-made insurance
policies (including, without limitation, director and officer insurance) in
effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, in each case with respect to
claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred on or prior to the
Effective Time (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement). The premium amounts for such tail policies shall be fully
paid by Socrata or included as a Transaction Expense. Any such tail policies
shall include a successor endorsement that names Tyler and the Surviving
Corporation as additional insureds. During the term of such tail policies,
neither Tyler nor the Surviving Corporation shall take any action following
the Closing to cause any such tail policy to be cancelled or any provision
therein to be amended or waived; provided, that neither Tyler, the Surviving
Corporation (except to the extent of such pre-Closing accrual thereof by
Socrata), nor any Affiliate thereof shall be obligated to pay any premiums or
other amounts in respect of such tail policies.

(c) The obligations of Tyler under this Section 6.12 shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any director or officer to
whom this Section 6.12 applies without the consent of such affected director
or officer (it being expressly agreed that the directors and officers to whom
this Section 6.12 applies shall be Third-Party beneficiaries of this Section
6.12, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 6.12).

(d) In the event Tyler or any of its respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Tyler shall assume all of the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.12.

6.13 Confidentiality. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the
Confidentiality Agreement remains in full force and effect, and the Tyler
Entities, on the one hand, and Socrata, on the other hand, covenant and agree
to keep confidential, in accordance with the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, information provided to such Party or Parties or any of their
respective Representatives pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, if this Agreement is, for any
reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement and the
provisions of this Section 6.13 shall nonetheless continue in full force and
effect.

6.14 Stockholders' Access to Books and Records. In order to facilitate the
resolution of any claims made against or incurred by the Stockholders,
Participating Warrantholders, or Participating Optionholders prior to the
Effective Time, or for any other reasonable purpose, for a



period of five years after the Effective Time, Tyler shall: (a) retain the
books and records (including personnel files) of Socrata relating to periods
prior to the Effective Time in a manner reasonably consistent with the prior
practices of Socrata, and (b) upon reasonable notice, afford the Stockholders'
Representative and his Representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours to (including the right to make, at the expense of the Non-
Series C Stockholders, Participating Warrantholders, and Participating
Optionholders, photocopies of), such books and records.

6.15 Provisions Regarding Legal Representation; Attorney Client Privilege.

(a) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that Perkins Coie LLP
("Perkins") has acted as counsel to Socrata in connection with the negotiation
of this Agreement and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Tyler hereby consents and agrees to, and agrees to cause the Surviving
Corporation to consent and agree to, Perkins representing the Stockholders'
Representative and/or any of the Stockholders, Participating Warrantholders,
or Participating Optionholders (collectively, the "Seller Parties") after the
Closing, including with respect to disputes in which the interests of the
Seller Parties may be directly adverse to Tyler and its Affiliates (including
the Surviving Corporation) (collectively, the "Tyler Parties"), and even
though Perkins may have represented Socrata in a matter substantially related
to any such dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for Socrata. Tyler
further consents and agrees to, and agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation
to consent and agree to, the communication by Perkins to the Seller Parties in
connection with any such representation of any fact known to Perkins arising
by reason of Perkins's prior representation of Socrata. In connection with the
foregoing, Tyler hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert, and
agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation to irrevocably waive and not to
assert, any conflict of interest arising from or in connection with (i)
Perkins's prior representation of Socrata and (ii) Perkins's representation of
the Seller Parties prior to and after the Closing.

(b) Tyler further agrees, on behalf of itself and, after the Closing, on
behalf of the Surviving Corporation, that all communications in any form or
format whatsoever between or among any of Perkins, Socrata, any of the Seller
Parties, or any of their respective directors, officers employees, or other
representatives that relate in any way to the negotiation, documentation, and
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than
communications related to the preparation of the Disclosure Schedule) or,
beginning on the date of this Agreement, any dispute arising under this
Agreement (collectively, the "Deal Communications") shall be deemed to be
retained and owned collectively by the Seller Parties, shall be controlled by
the Stockholders' Representative on behalf of the Seller Parties and shall not
pass to or be claimed by Tyler Parties. All Deal Communications that are
attorney-client privileged (the "Privileged Deal Communications") shall remain
privileged after the Closing and the privilege and the expectation of client
confidence relating thereto shall belong solely to the Stockholders'
Representative and the Seller Parties, shall be controlled by the
Stockholders' Representative on behalf of the Seller Parties and, except as
provided below, shall not pass to or be claimed by Tyler Parties.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
the Tyler Parties, on the one hand, and a Third Party other than the Seller
Parties, on the other hand, Tyler may assert the attorney-client privilege to
prevent the disclosure of the Privileged Deal Communications to such Third
Party or waive such privilege if desired in connection with resolving such
dispute. In the event that Tyler is legally required or requested by
governmental order or



otherwise (any such request or order, a "Legal Request") to access or obtain a
copy of all or a portion of the Privileged Deal Communications, Tyler shall be
entitled to access or obtain a copy of and disclose the Privileged Deal
Communications to the extent necessary to comply with any such Legal Request.
In the event of any Legal Request, Tyler shall promptly notify the
Stockholders' Representative in writing (prior to the disclosure by Tyler of
any Privileged Communications to the extent practicable) so that the
Stockholders' Representative can seek a protective order and Tyler agrees to
use all commercially reasonable efforts (at the sole cost and expense of the
Non-Series C Stockholders, Participating Warrantholders, and Participating
Optionholders) to assist therewith.

6.16 Minute Books and Other Deliveries. Socrata shall exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Tyler each of the
following at or prior to Closing:

(b) all minute books of Socrata delivered to the location designated by Tyler
for such delivery;

(c) written resignations, effective as of the Closing Date, of each of the
directors and officers of Socrata Foundation; and

(d) a unanimous written consent of the directors of Socrata Foundation,
effective as of the Closing Date immediately prior to such resignations,
electing five individuals to serve as the directors of Socrata Foundation, as
designated by Tyler.

Parties or any Stockholder will take any position or actions inconsistent with
such treatment.

7.2 Tax Covenants.

(a) Without the prior written consent of Tyler (not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), prior to the Closing, Socrata and its
Representatives shall not make, change, or rescind any material Tax election,
amend any Tax Return or take any position on any Tax Return, take any action,

such case without the prior written consent of the Stockholders'
Representative.

sharing agreements (whether written or not) binding upon Socrata shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date. After the Closing Date, neither Socrata nor

of Socrata or relating to the business of Socrata for all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods; (ii) all income Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated,
combined, or unitary group of which Socrata (or any predecessor of Socrata) is

Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any comparable provisions of foreign,

Agreement and incurred by Socrata (except to the extent otherwise set forth in
this Agreement) with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (v) all Taxes
arising from a nondeductible expense under Section 280G of the Code or an
excise Tax to the recipient of such payments pursuant to Section 4999 of the
Code, including any claim or Proceeding by a current or former Socrata
employee or consultant arising therefrom, in each case, to the extent related
to any payments or benefits made or provided by or on behalf of Socrata on or
prior to the Closing Date, (vi) any failure or alleged failure of an Socrata
Plan to comply with, or be exempt from, Section 409A of the Code on or prior
to the Closing Date, including any Taxes arising therefrom in a Pre-Closing
Tax Period and any claim or Proceeding by a current or former Socrata employee
arising therefrom, and (vii) any breach of Section 7.2(a). In each of the
above cases, the Non-Series C Stockholders and Participating Optionholders
shall, severally and not jointly (in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Shares), reimburse Tyler for any Taxes of Socrata that are the responsibility
of the Non-Series C Stockholders, Participating Warrantholders, and the
Participating Optionholders pursuant to this Section 7.4 within 60 Business
Days after Tyler or the Surviving Corporation provides written notice to the
Stockholders' Representative of the payment of such Taxes, which notice shall
set forth the amount and type of such Taxes with reasonable specificity, and
certified evidence of payment thereof. Any applicable limitations on
indemnification set forth in Section 10.7, including without limitation the
Indemnification Limitations set forth in Section 10.7(b), shall apply to this
Section 7.4.

7.5 Tax Returns.



(a) Socrata shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by it that are due on or before
the Closing Date (taking into account any extensions), and shall timely pay
all Taxes that are due and payable on or before the Closing Date (taking into
account any extensions), and shall timely pay all Taxes that are due and
payable on or before the Closing Date and shall be indemnified as provided in
Section 7.4. Any such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
past practice (unless otherwise required by applicable Tax Law).

(b) Tyler shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all other Tax Returns required to be filed by Socrata after the Closing
Date with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, and for any Straddle Period.
Any such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with Socrata's
past practice (unless otherwise required by Law) and, if it is an income or
other material Tax Return, shall be submitted by Tyler to the Stockholders'
Representative (together with schedules, statements and, to the extent
requested by the Stockholders' Representative, supporting documentation) at
least 45 days prior to the due date (including extensions) of such Tax Return.
If the Stockholders' Representative objects to any item on any such Tax Return
that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, the Stockholders' Representative
shall, within 30 days after delivery of such Tax Return, notify Tyler in
writing that it so objects, specifying with reasonable particularity any such
item and stating with reasonable specificity the factual or legal basis for
any such objection. If a notice of objection shall be duly delivered, Tyler
and the Stockholders' Representative shall negotiate in good faith and use
their commercially reasonable best efforts to resolve such items. If Tyler and
the Stockholders' Representative are unable to reach such agreement within ten
days after receipt by Tyler of such notice, the disputed items shall be
resolved by the Accountant and any determination by the Accountant shall be
final. The Accountant shall resolve any disputed items within 20 days of
having the item referred to it pursuant to such procedures as it may require.
If the Accountant is unable to resolve any disputed items before the due date
for such Tax Return, the Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by Tyler and
then amended to reflect the Accountant's resolution. The costs, fees, and
expenses of the Accountant shall ultimately be borne by Tyler, on the one
hand, and the Non-Series C Stockholders, Participating Warrantholders, and the
Participating Optionholders, on the other hand, in the same proportion as the
aggregate amount of the disputed items that is unsuccessfully disputed (as
determined by the Accountant) by Tyler and the Non-Series C Stockholders,
Participating Warrantholders, and the Participating Optionholders, as
applicable, bears to the total amount of the disputed items submitted to the
Accountant. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, all other costs and
expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with resolving any dispute
hereunder before the Accountant shall be borne by the Party incurring such
cost and expense. The preparation and filing of any Tax Return of Socrata that
does not relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period shall be
exclusively within the control of Tyler.

7.6 Straddle Period. In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a
Taxable period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date (each such
period, a "Straddle Period"), the portion of any such Taxes that are treated
as Pre-Closing Taxes for purposes of this Agreement shall be:

(a) in the case of Taxes (i) based upon, or related to, income, receipts,
profits, wages, capital, or net worth, (ii) imposed in connection with the
sale, transfer, or assignment of



property, or (iii) required to be withheld, deemed equal to the amount which
would be payable if the Taxable year ended with the Closing Date; and

(b) in the case of other Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the
entire period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of days in the entire period.

7.7 Contests. Tyler agrees to give written notice to the Stockholders'
Representative of the receipt of any written notice by Socrata or the
Surviving Corporation, Tyler, or any of Tyler's Affiliates which involves the
assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any Proceeding, in respect of
which an indemnity may be sought by Tyler pursuant to this ARTICLE VII (a "Tax
Claim"); provided that failure to comply with this provision shall not affect
Tyler's right to indemnification hereunder. Except as provided below, Tyler
shall control the contest or resolution of any Tax Claim; provided, however,
that Tyler shall obtain the prior written consent of the Stockholders'
Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned,
or delayed) before entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to
defend such claim; and, provided further, that the Stockholders'
Representative shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such claim
and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose, the fees and expenses of
which separate counsel shall be borne solely by the Non-Series C Stockholders,
Participating Warrantholders, and Participating Optionholders. The
Stockholders' Representative shall control any Tax Claim with respect to the
federal income tax returns of Socrata or with respect to any other Tax Return
for which the Non-Series C Stockholders, Participating Warrantholders, and the
Participating Optionholders could have a liability pursuant to this ARTICLE
VII. Tyler shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any such Tax
Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose, the fees and
expenses of which separate counsel shall be borne solely by Tyler. The
Stockholders' Representative shall consult with Tyler before entering into any
settlement of such claim or ceasing to defend such claim if the settlement or
ceasing to defend such claim would result in a material increase in the Taxes
of Tyler in a Tax period beginning after the Closing Date.

7.8 Cooperation and Exchange of Information. The Stockholders' Representative,
the Surviving Corporation, and Tyler shall provide each other with such
cooperation and information as any of them reasonably may request of the
others in filing any Tax Return pursuant to this ARTICLE VII or in connection
with any audit, examination or other Proceeding in respect of Taxes of
Socrata. Such cooperation and information shall include providing powers of
attorney, copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with
accompanying schedules, related work papers, and documents relating to rulings
or other determinations by tax authorities. Each of the Stockholders'
Representative, the Surviving Corporation, and Tyler shall retain all Tax
Returns, schedules and work papers, records, and other documents in its
possession relating to Tax matters of Socrata for any Taxable period beginning
before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations of
the Taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and other documents relate,
without regard to extensions except to the extent notified by any of the other
parties in writing of such extensions for the respective Tax periods. Prior to
transferring, destroying, or discarding any Tax Returns, schedules and work
papers, records, and other documents in its possession relating to Tax matters
of Socrata for any Taxable period beginning before the Closing Date, the
Stockholders' Representative or the Surviving Corporation or Tyler (as the
case may be) shall provide the other Parties with reasonable written notice
and offer the other Parties the opportunity to take custody of such materials.
The Parties further agree, upon request, to use their reasonable best efforts
to obtain



any certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority responsible
for Taxes or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce, or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed with the transactions contemplated
under this Agreement.

7.9 Payments to Tyler. Any amounts payable to Tyler pursuant to this ARTICLE
VII shall be satisfied as an obligation of the Non-Series C Stockholders, the
Participating Warrantholders, and the Participating Optionholders, severally
and not jointly (limited by their Pro Rata Shares).

7.10 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Any indemnification payments
pursuant to this ARTICLE VII shall be treated by the Parties as an adjustment
for Tax purposes to the Total Merger Consideration, unless otherwise required
by applicable Tax Law.

7.11 FIRPTA Statement. On the Closing Date, Socrata shall deliver to Tyler a
certificate, dated as of the Closing Date, certifying to the effect that no
interest in Socrata is a U.S. real property interest for purposes of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.897-2(g)(1)(ii), in a form reasonably satisfactory to
each of the Parties. (the "FIRPTA Statement").

7.12 Survival. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
provisions of this ARTICLE VII shall survive for the full period of all
applicable statutes of limitations (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation,
or extension thereof) plus 60 days.

7.13 Overlap. To the extent that any obligation or responsibility pursuant to
ARTICLE X, including procedures relating to the control of Proceedings
relating to Taxes, may overlap with an obligation or responsibility pursuant
to this ARTICLE VII, the provisions of this ARTICLE VII shall govern;
provided, however, that any applicable limitations on indemnification set
forth in Section 10.7(c) shall continue to apply to this ARTICLE VII. The
indemnities of the Stockholders set forth in this ARTICLE VII and the
indemnities of the Stockholders set forth in ARTICLE X, to the extent relating
to Taxes, shall be applied without duplication.

(a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties of
Socrata set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct in all respects
(in the case of any representation or warranty qualified by materiality or
Material Adverse Effect) or in all material respects (in the case of any
representation or warranty not qualified by materiality or Material Adverse
Effect) as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though
made on the Closing Date (except to the extent such representations and
warranties (i) expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case as of such
earlier date or (ii) have been amended or supplemented pursuant to a
Disclosure Schedule Supplement), except where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

shall have, in all material respects, performed or complied with all
obligations required to be performed or complied with by it under this
Agreement by the time of the Closing.

Material Adverse Effect) as of the date of this Agreement and as of the
Closing Date as though made on the Closing Date (except to the extent such
representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which
case as of such earlier date), except where the failure of such
representations and



warranties to be so true and correct would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Tyler Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Performance of Obligations. The Tyler Entities shall have, in all material
respects, performed or complied with all obligations required to be performed
or complied with by them or either of them under this Agreement by the time of

Agreement.

ARTICLE IX 
TERMINATION, AMENDMENT, AND WAIVER

9.1 Termination. Subject to the provisions of this ARTICLE IX, this Agreement
may be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at
any time prior to the Effective Time:

(a) by mutual written consent of Tyler and Socrata;

(b) by either Tyler or Socrata if any Restraint having any of the effects set
forth in Section 8.1(a) shall have become final and nonappealable; provided,
however, that the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 9.1(b) shall have complied with its obligations under Section 6.5;

(c) by Tyler if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before June
1, 2018 (such date, as it may be extended by the written mutual agreement of
the Parties or as provided in this Section 9.1(c), the "Tyler Outside Date");
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 9.1(c) shall not be available to Tyler if the failure of Tyler, any
Tyler Entity to perform, in any material respect, any of its obligations under
this Agreement, has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of
the Merger to be consummated on or before such date;

(d) by Socrata if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before May
1, 2018 (such date, as it may be extended by the written mutual agreement of
the Parties or as provided in this Section 9.1(d) the "Socrata Outside Date");
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 9.1(d) shall not be available to Socrata if the failure of Socrata to
perform, in any material respect, any of its obligations under this Agreement,
has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to be
consummated on or before such date;

(e) by Tyler, if Socrata shall have breached any of its representations or
warranties or failed to perform any covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in Sections 8.2(a)



or 8.2(b) and (ii) is incapable of being cured prior to the Tyler Outside
Date; provided, however, that Tyler shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(e) if either Tyler Entity is then in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants, or
agreements hereunder;

(f) by Tyler if there has been a Material Adverse Effect;

(g) by Socrata if either Tyler Entity shall have breached any of its
representations or warranties or failed to perform any of its covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Sections 8.3(a) or
8.3(b) (including, for avoidance of doubt, any failure by Tyler to effect the
Closing in accordance with Section 2.2, other than through the exercise of its
termination rights pursuant to this Section 9.1); provided, however, that
Socrata shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 9.1(g) if both (i) Socrata is then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements hereunder and (ii) such
material breach would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
Sections 8.2(a) or 8.2(b); or

(h) by Socrata if there has been a Tyler Material Adverse Effect.

Nothing in this Section 9.1 shall limit or prevent a Party from exercising any
rights or remedies it may have under Section 11.11 in lieu of its terminating
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1.

9.2 Effect of Termination.

(a) In the event this Agreement is terminated by either Socrata or Tyler as
provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have
no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of any Stockholder,
Socrata, or any Tyler Entity, other than (a) the provisions of Section 4.23,
Section 5.8, Section 6.9, Section 6.10, Section 6.13, this Section 9.2, and
ARTICLE XI, which provisions shall survive such termination, and (b) no Party
will be released or relieved from any liability or obligation arising from the
willful breach by such party of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants, or agreements as set forth in this Agreement, in which event,
except as otherwise expressly provided herein, termination of this Agreement
shall not be deemed or construed as limiting or denying any legal or equitable
right or remedy of the non-breaching Parties to this Agreement.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by Socrata pursuant to Section 9.1(g),
Socrata shall be entitled to an amount equal to Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000) in cash as liquidated damages. Each of the Parties acknowledges
and agrees that the foregoing agreement with respect to payment of liquidated
damages to Socrata is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, that without this agreement the Tyler Entities and Socrata
would not have entered into this Agreement, and that such payment shall not
constitute a penalty but shall constitute liquidated damages to compensate
Socrata for damages that are incapable of accurate estimation. Within five
Business Days following such termination by Socrata pursuant to Section
9.1(g), Tyler shall pay to Socrata the amount of such liquidated damages by
wire transfer of immediately available funds. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Socrata's right to receive payment of liquidated
damages under this Section 9.2(b) upon termination of this Agreement by
Socrata pursuant to Section 9.1(g) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Socrata against the Tyler Entities for any and all Losses that may be suffered
based upon, resulting from, or arising out



of the termination of this Agreement by Socrata pursuant to Section 9.1(g),
and, subject to Section 9.2(a), upon such payment in accordance with this
Section 9.2(b) none of Tyler Entities shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing and
notwithstanding any facts giving rise to a termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.1(g), Socrata may elect (in Socrata's sole discretion)
not to terminate this Agreement and not to collect liquidated damages under
this Section 9.2(b), and in such case nothing herein shall be deemed or
construed as limiting or denying any legal or equitable right or remedy of
Socrata under this Agreement, including seeking specific performance in
accordance with Section 11.11, nor shall any termination of this Agreement by
Socrata pursuant to any provision of Section 9.1 other than Section 9.1(g) be
deemed or construed as limiting or denying in any way any legal or equitable
right or remedy of Socrata under this Agreement.

9.3 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

9.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parties
may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other Parties, (b) to the extent permitted by Law, waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, or (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party
to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of such rights. No provision of this Agreement requiring
any Party to use reasonable best efforts or to act in good faith in any
context shall be interpreted to require a Party, as part of such Party's duty
to use reasonable best efforts or to act in good faith in the context in
question, to waive any condition to the obligations of such Party hereunder or
to refrain from exercising any right or power such Party may have hereunder.

9.5 Procedure for Termination or Amendment. A termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.1 or an amendment of this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.3 shall, in order to be effective, be in writing delivered to the other
Parties and require, in the case of Tyler (for itself and Merger Sub) and
Socrata, action by its board of directors or a duly authorized committee of
its board of directors to the extent permitted by Law.

ARTICLE X 
INDEMNIFICATION

10.1 Indemnification by the Non-Series C Stockholders, the Participating
Warrantholders, and Participating Optionholders. Subject to the provisions of
this ARTICLE X, the Non-Series C Stockholders, the Participating
Warrantholders, and Participating Optionholders shall, severally and not
jointly, but limited to their respective Pro Rata Shares, indemnify, defend,
and hold harmless each of the Tyler Entities, and their respective officers,
directors, managers, employees, agents, representatives, and controlled
Affiliates, from and after the Effective Time from and against all Losses
incurred by any of such indemnified Persons as a result of or arising from (a)
any breach of the representations and warranties of Socrata as set forth in
ARTICLE IV, (b) any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement of
Socrata under this Agreement, (c) any claim made



by any Stockholder, a Participating Warrantholder, or a Participating
Optionholder relating to such Person's rights with respect to the Total Merger
Consideration, or the calculations and determinations set forth on the
Consideration Spreadsheet; (d) any amounts paid to the holders of Dissenting
Shares, including any interest required to be paid thereon, that are in excess
of what such holders would have received hereunder had such holders not been
holders of Dissenting Shares; or (e) any Proceeding by a Stockholder against
Socrata or the Surviving Corporation arising out of such Stockholder's
ownership of Socrata Stock on or before the Effective Time (but excluding (i)
any obligation of the Tyler Entities pursuant to this Agreement or any
agreement contemplated hereby, (ii) any employment claim accrued by Socrata
prior to the Effective Time but payable by the Surviving Corporation after the
Effective Time, and (iii) any claim arising under Section 6.12).

10.2 Indemnification by Tyler. The Tyler Entities, jointly and severally,
shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Stockholders, the Participating
Warrantholders, and Participating Optionholders and their respective officers,
directors, managers, employees, agents, representatives, controlled
Affiliates, beneficiaries and heirs, at all times from and after the Effective
Time from and against all Losses incurred by any of such indemnified Persons
as a result of or arising from (a) any breach of the representations and
warranties of the Tyler Entities set forth herein or in the Schedules or
certificates attached hereto, or (b) any breach of or nonfulfillment of any
covenant or agreement on the part of the Tyler Entities under this Agreement.

10.3 Indemnification Procedures. The party making a claim under this ARTICLE X
is referred to as the "Indemnified Party", and the party or parties against
whom such claims are asserted under this ARTICLE X is referred to as the
"Indemnifying Party". Solely for purposes of Section 10.3, Section 10.4, and
Section 10.5, (a) if the Non-Series C Stockholders, Participating
Warrantholders, and Participating Optionholders, collectively, comprise the
Indemnifying Party, any references to Indemnifying Party (except provisions
relating to an obligation to indemnify or make payments) shall be deemed to
refer to the Stockholders' Representative acting on behalf of such Indemnified
Party, and (b) if the Non-Series C Stockholders, Participating Warrantholders,
and Participating Optionholders, collectively, comprise the Indemnified Party,
any references to the Indemnified Party (except provisions relating to a right
to receive payments) shall be deemed to refer to the Stockholders'
Representative acting on behalf of such Indemnified Party. Any payment to the
Non-Series C Stockholders, Participating Warrantholders, and Participating
Optionholders as the Indemnified Party shall be distributed to the Paying
Agent for further distribution to the Non-Series C Stockholders, the
Participating Warrantholders, and the Participating Optionholders in
accordance with this Agreement.

10.4 Third Party Claims. Promptly after any Indemnified Party has received
notice of or has knowledge of any claim (or any facts giving rise to a claim)
by a Third Party of the commencement of any Proceeding by a Third Party that
the Indemnified Party believes in good faith is an indemnifiable claim under
this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall promptly give to the Indemnifying
Party obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to Sections 10.1 or 10.2
written notice of such claim or the commencement of such Proceeding. Such
notice shall state the nature and the basis of such claim and a reasonable
estimate of the amount thereof, along with all documentation and records in
such Indemnified Party's possession relating to such claim. The Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to defend and settle, at its own expense (or in the
case of the Stockholders' Representative, at the expense of the Non-Series C
Stockholders, the Participating Warrantholders, and the Participating
Optionholders) and by its own counsel, any such matter. If



the Indemnifying Party undertakes to defend or settle any such matter, it
shall promptly notify the Indemnified Party of its intention to do so, and the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel
in all commercially reasonable respects in the defense thereof and in any
settlement thereof. Such cooperation shall include, but shall not be limited
to, furnishing the Indemnifying Party with any books, records, and other
information reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party and in the
Indemnified Party's possession or control. After the Indemnifying Party has
notified the Indemnified Party of its intention to undertake to defend or
settle any such asserted liability, and for so long as the Indemnifying Party
diligently pursues such defense, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable
for any additional legal expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with any defense or settlement of such asserted liability;
provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at its
expense (or in the case of the Stockholders' Representative, at the expense of
the Non-Series C Stockholders, the Participating Warrantholders, and the
Participating Optionholders), to participate in the defense of such asserted
liability and the negotiations of the settlement thereof. If the Stockholders'
Representative has assumed the defense of a claim, Tyler will not (and will
cause its Affiliates and Representatives not to) admit any liability with
respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any such claim without the
prior written consent of the Stockholders' Representative, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld (provided that, for avoidance of doubt, the
Stockholders' Representative may reserve in any such written consent the right
to dispute the existence or amount of any Losses indemnifiable under this
Agreement). The Indemnifying Party shall not settle any such Third Party claim
without the consent of the Indemnified Party, unless the settlement thereof
imposes no liability or obligation on, and includes a complete release from
liability of, the Indemnified Party (or in the case of the Stockholders'
Representative, the Non-Series C Stockholders, the Participating
Warrantholders, and the Participating Optionholders). If the Indemnifying
Party desires to accept a final and complete settlement of any such Third
Party claim and the Indemnified Party refuses to consent to such settlement
within ten Business Days, then the Indemnifying Party's liability (or in the
case of the Stockholders' Representative, the liability of the Non-Series C
Stockholders, the Participating Warrantholders, and the Participating
Optionholders) under this Section 10.4 with respect to such Third Party claim
shall be limited to the amount so offered in settlement by said Third Party;
provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to refuse to consent to any such proposed settlement and the
Indemnifying Party's liability hereunder shall not be limited by the amount of
the proposed settlement if such settlement does not provide for the complete
release of the Indemnified Party (or in the case of the Stockholders'
Representative, the Non-Series C Stockholders, the Participating
Warrantholders, and the Participating Optionholders). If, upon receiving
notice, the Indemnifying Party does not timely undertake to defend such matter
to which the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder, the
Indemnified Party may undertake such defense through counsel of its choice, at
the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party (or in the case of the
Stockholders' Representative, the cost and expense of the Non-Series C
Stockholders, the Participating Warrantholders, and the Participating
Optionholders), and the Indemnified Party may seek indemnification for any and
all Losses in accordance with this ARTICLE X; provided that, the Indemnifying
Party may nonetheless participate (at its own expense) in the defense of such
claim and the Indemnified Party will consult with the Indemnifying Party in
respect of such defense.

10.5 Non-Third Party Claims. In the event that any Indemnified Party asserts
the existence of a claim giving rise to Losses (but excluding claims resulting
from the assertion of liability by a Third Party), such party shall give
prompt written notice to the Indemnifying Party. Such written



notice shall state that it is being given pursuant to this Section 10.5,
specify the nature and amount of the claim asserted, and the amount of the
claim deemed a valid claim (such date to be established in accordance with the
next sentence), along with all documentation and records in such Indemnified
Party's possession relating to such claim. If such Indemnifying Party, within
60 days after the receipt of such written notice from such Indemnified Party,
has not given written notice to such Indemnified Party announcing such
Indemnifying Party's intent to contest such assertion of such Indemnified
Party, such assertion shall be deemed accepted and the amount of such claim
shall be deemed a valid claim. In the event, however, that such Indemnifying
Party contests such assertion of a claim by giving such written notice to the
Indemnified Party within said period, then the parties shall act in good faith
to reach agreement regarding such claim.

10.6 Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants and Agreements.
Any claim for indemnification based on a breach of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement shall survive
the Closing as follows: (a) any claim for indemnification based on a breach of
the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreements shall, except
as set forth in clauses (b), (c), and (d) below, survive the Closing for a
period of one year from the Closing Date; (b) any claim for indemnification
based on a breach of the representations and warranties contained in Sections
4.1 (Due Organization and Qualification; Power and Authority), 4.2
(Authorization; Binding Agreement), 4.5 (Capitalization), 5.1 (Due
Organization; Power and Authority), and 5.2 (Authorization; Binding Agreement)
(collectively, the "Fundamental Representations") shall survive until the
expiration of the statute of limitations period applicable for breach of
contract claims in the State of Delaware; (c) any claim for indemnification
based on a breach of the representations and warranties contained in Section
4.18 (Taxes) (the "Tax Representations") shall survive until the expiration of
any applicable statute of limitations period plus 30 days; (d) any claim for
indemnification based on a breach of the representations and warranties
contained in Sections 4.15 (Employee Benefit Plans) shall survive for a period
of three years from the Closing Date; (e) any claim for indemnification based
on a breach of the covenants and agreements that are to be performed prior to
Closing shall not survive the Closing; and (f) any claim for indemnification
based on a breach of the covenants and agreements that are to be performed all
or in part after Closing shall survive until either the date provided herein
or, if no date is provided, the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations period (in each case, the "Survival Period"). It is the express
intent of the Parties that, if an applicable Survival Period is shorter than
the statute of limitations that would otherwise apply, then, by contract, the
applicable statute of limitations shall be reduced to the Survival Period
contemplated hereby. Any claim for indemnity under this Agreement with respect
to any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement
contained in this Agreement shall be deemed time-barred, and no such claim
shall be made after the Survival Period specified in this Section 10.6;
provided, however, that if a claim notice is delivered in good faith pursuant
to and in accordance with the requirements of ARTICLE X with respect to any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement prior to the
expiration of the applicable Survival Period as set forth in this Section
10.6, the indemnification claim under this ARTICLE X with respect to such
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement shall survive until such
indemnification claim is finally resolved pursuant to ARTICLE X.

10.7 Certain Limitations.

(a) Indemnification Deductible. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, neither the Stockholders, the Participating Warrantholders, and
Participating



Optionholders, on the one hand, nor the Tyler Entities, on the other hand,
shall be entitled to indemnification from the other under the provisions of
Section 10.1(a) or Section 10.2(a), as the case may be, unless and until, and
only to the extent that, the aggregate amount of all Losses subject to
indemnification by such other Party exceeds 1.0% of the Total Merger
Consideration (the "Deductible"); provided, however, that the Deductible shall
not be applicable to Losses resulting from (i) any breach of a Fundamental
Representation or a Tax Representation or (ii) common law fraud by or on
behalf of Socrata, on the one hand, or a Tyler Entity, on the other hand.

(b) Indemnification Cap. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, the aggregate indemnification obligation of the Non-Series C
Stockholders, the Participating Warrantholders, and Participating
Optionholders under Section 10.1(a) or the Tyler Entities under Section
10.2(a) shall be limited to an amount equal to 5.0% of the Total Merger
Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in
this Section 10.7(b) shall not apply to (i) any breach of a Fundamental
Representation or a Tax Representation or (ii) common law fraud by or on
behalf of Socrata, on the one hand, or a Tyler Entity, on the other hand.

(c) Other Limitations. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement,
except as provided in Section 11.13(b) or in the case of common law fraud by
or on behalf of a Non-Series C Stockholder, Participating Warrantholder, or
Participating Optionholder, in no event will any Non-Series C Stockholder,
Participating Warrantholder, or Participating Optionholder have any liability
for Losses under this Agreement (including for avoidance of doubt under
Sections 10.1 and 7.4) (i) in excess of the aggregate amount actually received
by such Non-Series C Stockholder (solely with respect to such Non-Series C
Stockholder's Socrata Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, or Series B
Preferred Stock), Participating Warrantholder, or Participating Optionholder
under this Agreement, or (ii) in excess of such Non-Series C Stockholder's,
Participating Warrantholder's, or Participating Optionholder's Pro Rata Share
of such Loss. No Stockholder, Participating Warrantholder, or Participating
Optionholder shall be liable for breaches of the representations, warranties
and covenants specific to any other Stockholder, Participating Warrantholder,
or Participating Optionholder.

(d) Read Out of Materiality. For purposes of determining the amount of any
Loss suffered by an Indemnified Party for purposes of Sections 10.1(a) or
10.2(a), but not for the purposes of determining whether a representation or
warranty has been in fact violated, all such representations and warranties
shall be read as if any and all exceptions, limitations, restrictions,
qualifications, and exclusions contained in such representations and
warranties based or conditioned on the terms "material," or "materially" were
deleted.

(e) Effect of Insurance Proceeds. Payments pursuant to Section 10.1 or Section
10.2 in respect of any Loss shall be limited to the amount of any liability or
damage that remains after deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds and any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment received or reasonably
expected to be received by the Indemnified Party (or the Surviving
Corporation) in respect of any such claim. The Indemnified Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to recover under insurance policies or
indemnity, contribution or other similar agreements for any Losses prior to
seeking indemnification under this Agreement.

(f) Effect of Tax Benefits. Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to
Section 10.1 or Section 10.2 in respect of any Loss shall be reduced by an
amount equal to any Tax



benefit realized or reasonably expected to be realized as a result of such
Loss by the Indemnified Party.

(g) Limitation of Liability. Except with respect to indemnified Losses
required to be paid to a Third Party as part of a Third Party claim under this
ARTICLE X, in no event shall any Indemnifying Party be liable to any
Indemnified Party for any punitive, incidental, consequential, special or
indirect damages, including loss of future revenue or income, loss of business
reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach of this
Agreement, or diminution of value or any damages based on any type of
multiple.

(h) Mitigation of Losses. Each Indemnified Party shall take, and cause its
Affiliates to take, all reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming
aware of any event or circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or
does, give rise thereto, including incurring costs only to the minimum extent
necessary to remedy the breach that gives rise to such Loss.

(i) Knowledge. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, Losses for which the Non-Series C Stockholders, the Participating
Warrantholders, or Participating Optionholders may be liable pursuant to
Section 10.1 shall exclude all Losses relating to the breach of any
representation or warranty of the Non-Series C Stockholder, the Participating
Warrantholder, the Participating Optionholder, or Socrata to the extent the
Stockholders' Representative establishes to a reasonable certainty that any
Tyler Entity had actual Knowledge as of the Closing of material information
that is materially inconsistent with the representation or warranty on which
the claim of the Tyler Entity Indemnified Party is based, and could reasonably
be expected to have an understanding of the relevance of such materially
inconsistent information to such representation and warranty, and thereby it
can reasonably be concluded that the Tyler Entity has waived the right to rely
on such representation or warranty or should be estopped from asserting such
claim as a result thereof. The Tyler Entities expressly acknowledge the Non-
Series C Stockholders', the Participating Warrantholders', and Participating
Optionholders' right to establish that the Tyler Entities have waived such
right or should otherwise be estopped from asserting such claim based on the
breach of such representation or warranty due to such actual Knowledge.

(j) No Duplication. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) if and solely to the
extent the amount of any Loss is recovered by a Tyler Entity through the
actual payment to such Tyler Entity, the same amount of such Loss may not be
recovered again by a Tyler Entity by reason of such Loss being subject to
indemnification under more than one provision of this Agreement and (ii) if
and solely to the extent that any Loss in connection with an indemnifiable
matter was reflected or reserved against in the Closing Balance Sheet or was
specifically taken into account in connection with calculations of any of the
items included within it, the same amount of such Loss may not be recovered
under this ARTICLE X. In the event that there are any facts or circumstances
that are the basis for any post-Closing adjustments pursuant to Section 3.5,
Tyler shall pursue a remedy based on such facts or circumstances as a post-
Closing adjustment pursuant to Section 3.5 based upon the Closing Balance
Sheet delivered by Tyler following Closing and shall not be permitted to
pursue remedy arising out of the same facts or circumstances as an
indemnification claim under this ARTICLE X.

behalf of the Non-Series C Stockholders, the Participating Warrantholders, and

the Non-Series C Stockholders, the Participating Warrantholders, and

other hand, shall satisfy any obligations within 15 Business Days of such
final, non-appealable adjudication by wire transfer of immediately available
funds.

10.9 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification payments
made under this ARTICLE X shall be treated by the Parties for Tax purposes as

Representative) acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy
with respect to any and all claims (other than claims arising from a Non-

Optionholder's, or a Tyler Entity's own common law fraud arising under this
Agreement) for any Losses under this Agreement or any certificate or

against the other Parties and their Affiliates arising under or based upon any
Law, except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this

Participating Warrantholder's, Participating Optionholder's, or a Tyler

11.2 Assignment. No Party may assign this Agreement or any of its rights or
obligations arising hereunder without the prior written consent of the other
Parties; provided, however, that, without the consent of Socrata, Tyler may,
without relieving Tyler from its liabilities or obligations hereunder, assign
this Agreement, and its rights and obligations hereunder, to an Affiliate of
Tyler or to an entity formed, controlled and primarily owned by Tyler.

11.3 Entire Agreement, Amendments, and Waiver. This Agreement (together with
any Exhibits, Annexes, and Schedules hereto) and all certificates, documents,
instruments, and writings that are delivered pursuant hereto contain the
entire understanding of the Parties with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby and supersede all prior agreements, arrangements, and
understandings relating to the subject matter hereof, including the Letter of
Intent, but excluding the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue to
be binding on Socrata and Tyler. This Agreement may be amended, superseded, or
canceled (a) before the Closing Date, if and only by a written instrument duly
executed by the Parties specifically stating that it amends, supersedes, or
cancels this Agreement except that an amendment made subsequent to approval of
this Agreement by the Stockholders of Socrata shall not (i) alter or change
the amount or kind of consideration to be received on conversion of Socrata

Stockholders; provided that after the approval of this Agreement by the
Stockholders, no such amendment will be made except as allowed under
Applicable Law and (b) after the Closing Date, if and only by a written
instrument duly executed by Tyler and the Stockholders' Representative
specifically stating that it amends, supersedes, or cancels this Agreement on
behalf of Tyler and the Stockholders' Representative, except that any
amendment made in accordance with this clause (b) shall not (i) alter or
change the amount or kind of consideration to be received on conversion of
Socrata Stock or (ii) alter or change any of the terms or conditions of this
Agreement if such alteration or change would materially and adversely affect
the Stockholders immediately before the Effective Time. Any of the terms of
this Agreement and any condition to a Party's obligations hereunder may be
waived only in writing by that Party specifically stating that it waives a
term or condition hereof. No waiver by a Party of any one or more conditions
or defaults by the other in performance of any of the provisions of this
Agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver of any future conditions
or defaults, whether of a like or different character, nor shall the waiver
constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.



11.4 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; and Dispute Resolution.

(a) GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER
IN CONTRACT OR TORT) THAT MAY BE BASED UPON, ARISE OUT OF, OR RELATE TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION, OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT
(INCLUDING ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATED
TO ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY MADE IN OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT
OR AS AN INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT) SHALL BE GOVERNED BY,
ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND INTERPRETED UNDER, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF
DELAWARE, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS.

(b) CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMIT TO THE
JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE AND THE FEDERAL COURTS OF
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA LOCATED IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE, AND APPROPRIATE
APPELLATE COURTS THEREFROM, OVER ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND EACH PARTY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SUCH DISPUTE OR
PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN SUCH COURTS. THE PARTIES HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH
THEY MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY DISPUTE ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY BROUGHT IN SUCH COURT OR ANY DEFENSE OF INCONVENIENT FORUM FOR THE
MAINTENANCE OF SUCH DISPUTE. EACH PARTY AGREES THAT A JUDGMENT IN ANY SUCH
DISPUTE MAY BE ENFORCED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN
ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY LAW. THIS CONSENT TO JURISDICTION IS BEING GIVEN
SOLELY FOR PURPOSES OF THIS AGREEMENT AND IS NOT INTENDED TO, AND SHALL NOT,
CONFER CONSENT TO JURISDICTION WITH RESPECT TO ANY OTHER DISPUTE IN WHICH A
PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY BECOME INVOLVED. EACH PARTY CONSENTS TO PROCESS
BEING SERVED BY ANY OTHER PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT IN ANY PROCEEDING OF THE

(c) Recovery of Costs and Attorneys' Fees. If there are any Proceedings
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, after the entry of a final written non-appealable order, if one Party
has predominantly prevailed in the dispute, it shall be entitled to recover
from the other Party all court costs, fees, and expenses relating to such
Proceeding, including reasonable attorneys' fees that are specifically
included in such court award.

11.5 Consents and Approvals. For any matter under this Agreement requiring the
consent or approval of any Party to be valid and binding on the Parties, such
consent or approval must be in writing.



11.6 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
together shall constitute but one and the same instrument. Facsimile or other
electronic transmission of any signed original document or retransmission of
any such signed transmission will be deemed the same as delivery of an
original. At the request of any Party, the Parties will confirm facsimile or
other electronic transmission by signing a duplicate original document.

11.7 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability and, unless
the effect of such invalidity or unenforceability would prevent the Parties
from realizing the major portion of the economic benefits of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby that they currently anticipate
obtaining therefrom, shall not render invalid or unenforceable the remaining
terms and provisions of this Agreement or affect the validity or
enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable.

11.8 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise provided (i) in Section
6.12 or (ii) with respect to indemnification rights in ARTICLE VII and ARTICLE
X, nothing in this Agreement shall provide any benefit to any Third Party or
entitle any Third Party to any claim, cause of action, remedy, or right of any
kind, it being the intent of the Parties that this Agreement shall not be
construed as a third-party beneficiary Contract.

11.9 Time of Essence. With regard to all dates and time periods set forth or
referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

11.10 Disclosure Schedule. The information in the Disclosure Schedule
constitutes (a) exceptions or qualifications to representations, warranties,
covenants, and obligations of Socrata as set forth in this Agreement or (b)
descriptions or lists of assets and liabilities and other items referred to in
this Agreement. Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any
representation or warranty nor the disclosure of a document or information in
the Disclosure Schedule is intended, or shall be construed or offered in any
dispute between the Parties as evidence of, the materiality of such dollar
amount, document, or information, nor does it establish any standard of
materiality upon which to judge the inclusion or omission of any similar
documents or information in that Schedule or any other Schedule. The
information contained in this Agreement and the Disclosure Schedule is
disclosed solely for the purposes of this Agreement, and no information
contained herein or therein shall be deemed to be an admission of any matter
whatsoever, including of any violation of Law or breach of any Contract. An
exception or qualification set forth in the Disclosure Schedule with respect
to a particular representation or warranty shall be deemed to be an exception
or qualification with respect to all other applicable representations and
warranties to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the face of such
disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other Disclosure
Schedule or Disclosure Schedules, whether or not such exception or
qualification is so numbered or such other representations and warranties
expressly refer to a Schedule. The Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed
as indicating that any disclosed information is required to be disclosed, and
no disclosure shall be construed as an admission that such information is
material to, or required to be disclosed by, Socrata. Capitalized terms used
in the Disclosure Schedule that are not defined therein shall have the meaning
given them in this Agreement. From time to time



prior to the Closing, Socrata shall have the right (but not the obligation) to
supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedule, with express reference therein to
the applicable Schedule(s), to reflect the existence or happening of any
matter hereafter arising or occurring which, if existing as of the date
hereof, would have been required to be set forth or described in the
Disclosure Schedule (each such amendment or supplement, a "Disclosure Schedule
Supplement"), and each such Disclosure Schedule Supplement shall be deemed to
be incorporated into and to supplement and amend the Disclosure Schedule as of
the Closing Date. In the event such event, development, or occurrence that is
the subject of the Disclosure Schedule Supplement constitutes or relates to
something that has had a Material Adverse Effect, then Tyler shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement for failure to satisfy the closing
conditions set forth in Sections 8.2(a) or 8.2(c), as applicable; provided,
however, that if Tyler has the right to, but does not elect to terminate this
Agreement within five Business Days of its receipt of such Disclosure Schedule
Supplement, then Tyler shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived any right to
terminate this Agreement with respect to such matter under the conditions set
forth in Sections 8.2(a) or 8.2(c), as applicable.

11.11 Enforcement. The Parties expressly recognize, acknowledge and agree that
immediate, extensive and irreparable damage would result, no adequate remedy
at law would exist and damages would be difficult to determine in the event
any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its
specific terms on a timely basis or is otherwise breached. It is accordingly
agreed, except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 9.2(b), that the
Parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof and
immediate injunctive relief and other equitable relief, without the necessity
of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, and the Parties
further hereby agree to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of a
bond or other undertaking in connection with the obtaining of such injunctive
or other equitable relief. Such remedies, and any and all other remedies
provided for in this Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
shall, however, be cumulative in nature and not exclusive and shall be in
addition to any other remedies whatsoever which any party may otherwise have.
Each Party acknowledges that the existence of any other remedy contemplated by
this Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 9.2(b), does
not diminish the availability of specific performance of the obligations
hereunder or any other injunctive relief. Each Party further acknowledges and
agrees that injunctive relief and/or specific performance will not cause an
undue hardship to such party.

11.12 Exclusivity of Agreement. The Parties have voluntarily agreed to define
their rights, liabilities, and obligations respecting the subject matter of
this Agreement exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and
provisions of this Agreement, and the Parties expressly disclaim that they are
owed any duties not expressly set forth in this Agreement. The sole and
exclusive remedies for any breach of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (including any representations and warranties set forth herein)
shall be those remedies available at law or in equity for breach of contract
only (as such contract remedies may be further limited or excluded pursuant to
the express terms of this Agreement); and the Parties hereby waive and release
any and all tort claims and causes of action that may be based upon, arise out
of, or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, or performance
of this Agreement (including any tort claim or cause of action based upon,
arising out of, or related to any representation or warranty made in or in
connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement).



11.13 Stockholders' Representative.

(a) By voting in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, the approval of the
principal terms of the Merger, and the consummation of the Merger or
participating in the Merger and receiving the benefits thereof, including the
right to receive the consideration payable in connection with the Merger, each
Non-Series C Stockholder, Participating Warrantholder and the Participating
Optionholder shall be deemed to have approved the designation of the
Stockholders' Representative as the representative, agent, proxy, and
attorney-in-fact for all the Non-Series C Stockholders, Participating
Warrantholders, and Participating Optionholders for all purposes under this
Agreement including the full power and authority on the Non-Series C
Stockholders', Participating Warrantholders' and Participating Optionholders'
behalf: (i) to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
including the execution and delivery of all other agreements, instruments, and
documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith, (ii) to
negotiate disputes arising under, or relating to, this Agreement, and the
other agreements, instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or executed
in connection herewith, (iii) to recover from any amounts received or to be
received by the Non-Series C Stockholders, the Participating Warrantholders,
and the Participating Optionholders pursuant to this Agreement, or otherwise
to satisfy any and all obligations or liabilities incurred by the
Stockholders' Representative in the performance of its duties hereunder, (iv)
to execute and deliver any amendment or waiver to this Agreement, and the
other agreements, instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or executed
in connection herewith (without the prior approval of the Non-Series C
Stockholders, the Participating Warrantholders, or the Participating
Optionholders), and (v) to take all other actions to be taken by or on behalf
of the Stockholders, the Participating Warrantholders, and the Participating
Optionholders in connection with this Agreement, and the other agreements,
instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection
herewith. The Non-Series C Stockholders, the Participating Warrantholders, and
the Participating Optionholders, further agree that such agency and proxy are
coupled with an interest, are therefore irrevocable without the consent of the
Stockholders' Representative and shall survive the death, incapacity,
bankruptcy, dissolution, or liquidation of any Non-Series C Stockholder,
Participating Warrantholder or Participating Optionholder. All decisions and
actions by the Stockholders' Representative shall be binding upon all of the
Non-Series C Stockholders, Participating Warrantholders, and Participating
Optionholders, and no Non-Series C Stockholder, Participating Warrantholder or
Participating Optionholder shall have the right to object, dissent, protest,
or otherwise contest the same. The Stockholders' Representative shall have no
duties or obligations hereunder except those set forth herein and such duties
and obligations shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this
Agreement.

(b) Each Non-Series C Stockholder, Participating Warrantholder and
Participating Optionholder hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Stockholders' Representative and its agents and assigns from and
against all liabilities, penalties, forfeitures, fines, claims, actions,
damages, losses, costs and expenses (including legal and other professional
fees and expenses, and litigation costs and all expense of document location,
duplication and shipment) of any kind (whether known or unknown, fixed or
contingent) ("Stockholders' Representative Expenses") arising out of or in
connection with the Stockholders' Representative's execution and performance
of this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto in each case as any such
Stockholders' Representative Expenses is suffered or incurred; provided, that
in the event that any such Stockholders' Representative Expense is finally
adjudicated to have been directly caused by



the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Stockholders'
Representative, the Stockholders' Representative will reimburse the Non-Series
C Stockholders, Participating Warrantholders, and Participating Optionholders
the amount of such indemnified Stockholders' Representative Expense to the
extent attribute to such fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not
paid directly to the Stockholders' Representative by the Non-Series C
Stockholders, Participating Warrantholders, and Participating Optionholders,
any such Stockholders' Representative Expenses may be recovered by the
Stockholders' Representative from: (1) the Stockholders' Representative
Expense Holdback and (2) the amounts in the Working Capital Holdback, at such
time as remaining amounts would be otherwise distributable to the Non-Series C
Stockholders, Participating Warrantholders, and Participating Optionholders;
provided, that while this Section 11.13(b) allows the Stockholders'
Representative to be paid from the aforementioned sources of funds, this does
not relieve the Non-Series C Stockholders, Participating Warrantholders, and
Participating Optionholders from their obligation to promptly pay such
Stockholders' Representative Expenses as they are suffered or incurred, nor
does it prevent the Stockholders' Representative from seeking any remedies
available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Stockholders'
Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf of the Non-
Series C Stockholders, Participating Warrantholders, and Participating
Optionholders or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any restrictions or limitations on liability or indemnification
obligations of the Non-Series C Stockholders, Participating Warrantholders,
and Participating Optionholders set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not
intended to be applicable to the indemnities provided to the Stockholders'
Representative under this Section 11.13(b). The foregoing indemnities will
survive the Closing, the resignation or removal of the Stockholders'
Representative or the termination of this Agreement.

(c) The Stockholders' Representative shall not have by reason of this
Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Non-Series C Stockholder,
Participating Warrantholder or Participating Optionholder. The Stockholders'
Representative shall not be liable to any Non-Series C Stockholder,
Participating Warrantholder or Participating Optionholder for any action taken
or omitted by the Stockholders' Representative or any agent employed by the
Stockholders' Representative hereunder or under any other document or
instrument contemplated hereby, or in connection therewith, except that the
Stockholders' Representative shall not be relieved of any liability directly
resulting from the Stockholder Representatives' fraud, gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The Stockholders' Representative shall not be liable to
any of the Stockholders, Participating Warrantholders, or Participating
Optionholders for any action or omission taken in good faith or pursuant to
the advice of counsel. The Stockholders' Representative shall not be required
to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of
the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement.

(d) The Stockholders' Representative Expense Holdback will be used for the
purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the Stockholders' Representative
for, any Third-Party expenses pursuant to this Agreement and any agreements
ancillary hereto. The Non-Series C Stockholders, Participating Warrantholders,
and Participating Optionholders will not receive any interest or earnings on
the Stockholders' Representative Expense Holdback and irrevocably transfer and
assign to the Stockholders' Representative any ownership right that they may
otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The Stockholders'
Representative will not be liable for any loss of principal of the
Stockholders' Representative Expense Holdback other than as a result of its
fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholders'
Representative will hold



these funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use these funds for
its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not
voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of
bankruptcy. As soon as practicable following the completion of the
Stockholders Representative's responsibilities, the Stockholders'
Representative will deliver any remaining balance of the Stockholders'
Representative Expense Holdback to the Paying Agent for further distribution
to the Non-Series C Stockholders, Participating Warrantholders, and
Participating Optionholders. For tax purposes, the Stockholders'
Representative Expense Holdback will be treated as having been received and
voluntarily set aside by the Non-Series C Stockholders, Participating
Warrantholders, and Participating Optionholders at the time of Closing.

(e) The Stockholders' Representative may resign at any time. If the
Stockholders' Representative resigns or is otherwise unable or unwilling to
serve in such capacity, then the Principal Stockholders will appoint a new
Person to serve as a replacement for such Stockholders' Representative and
will provide prompt written notice thereof to Tyler. Until such notice is
received, Tyler will be entitled to rely on the actions and statements of the
previous Stockholders' Representative and all such actions and statements
shall be binding on the Non-Series C Stockholders, Participating
Warrantholders, and Participating Optionholders.
