Section 1.7 _Consents_. __

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document, neither this Agreement nor any other Transaction
Document constitutes an agreement to sell, assign, transfer, contribute,
convey and deliver (a " _Conveyance_ ") any Transferred Asset if such
Transferred Asset (i) is not transferable in accordance with Applicable
Law, (ii) is not transferable without a requisite Consent or (iii) is
cancelable by a third-party in the event of an assignment (such Transferred
Asset that cannot be transferred to be referred to hereinafter as a "
_Nonassignable Asset_ "), unless and until, with respect to _clauses (ii)_
and _(iii)_ , such consent shall have been obtained. A preliminary list of
Nonassignable Assets, which list shall reflect the Schlumberger Parties good
faith projections of the Nonassignable Assets as of the Closing Date, and
which list shall be modified on the Closing Date as Schlumberger may, in good
faith, determine is necessary or advisable, is set forth on _Section_ __ _
1.7(a) of the Schlumberger Disclosure Letter_ and, subject to the next two
sentences, the Parties will use their respective reasonable best efforts to
obtain such Consents as soon as reasonably practicable, subject to the
limitations set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 1.7(b)_. No Schlumberger Party will
under any circumstance be required to make any payments or offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise, regardless of any provision to the
contrary in the underlying Contract, including any requirements for the
securing or posting of any bonds, letters of credit or similar instruments, or
the furnishing of any guarantees) to any third party to obtain any Consent
unless and to the extent that Liberty Parent agrees to reimburse and make
whole such Schlumberger Party for any payment or other

 



10

    

 accommodation made by such Schlumberger Party at Liberty Parents request.
Subject to the prior sentence, Liberty Parent agrees that, in the event that
any third party or Governmental Authority requests that a Schlumberger Party
make a payment or offer or grant an accommodation to obtain a third-party
Consent and Liberty Parent does not agree to reimburse or make whole such
Schlumberger Party in connection therewith, Liberty Parent shall not be
entitled to the benefits of the provision in, such Schlumberger Party will not
be obligated to take any efforts under, _Section_ __ _ 1.7(c)_ in respect of
any Transferred Asset which Conveyance is subject to such third-party
Consents. The obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 1.7(a)_ will
terminate on the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date (except for any such
Consent that is in the process of being obtained on such date, as to which
such obligations will continue).

(b) The Parties will use their reasonable best efforts promptly to obtain any
of the aforementioned Consents and to take the actions required by _Section_
__ _ 1.7(c)_, pending removal of legal or contractual impediments or receipt
of such Consents. If and when the legal or contractual impediments the
presence of which caused the deferral of transfer of any Nonassignable Asset
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.7(b)_ are removed, each of Liberty Parent,
Schlumberger US and Schlumberger Canada determine that such Consent is
immaterial or need not cause the deferral or transfer of any Nonassignable
Asset, or any such Consents the absence of which caused the deferral of
transfer of any Nonassignable Asset pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 1.7(b)_
are obtained, the transfer of the applicable Nonassignable Asset will be
effected promptly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and/or the
applicable Transaction Document(s). The obligations set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 1.7(b)_ will terminate on the one-year anniversary of the
Closing Date (except to the extent of any Conveyance for which impediments are
being removed or Consents or approvals of an applicable Governmental
Authority as are in the process of being obtained on such date, as to which
such obligations will continue).

 

(c) If the Conveyance of any Nonassignable Asset intended to be Conveyed is
not consummated prior to or at the Closing Date, whether as a result of the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 1.7(b)_ or for any other reason, then, insofar
as reasonably possible (taking into account any applicable restrictions or
considerations relating to the contemplated Tax treatment of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) and to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
the Person retaining such Nonassignable Asset, (i) will thereafter hold such
Nonassignable Asset in trust for the use and benefit and burden of the Person
entitled thereto (and at such Persons sole expense) until the consummation of
the Conveyance thereof (or as otherwise determined by Schlumberger US,
Schlumberger Canada and Liberty Parent, as applicable, in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 1.7(b)_), and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to take such
other actions as may be reasonably requested by the Person to whom such
Nonassignable Asset is to be Conveyed (at the expense of the Person
holding such Nonassignable Asset) in order to place such Person in
substantially the same position as if such Nonassignable Asset had been
Conveyed as contemplated hereby and so that all the benefits and burdens
relating to such Nonassignable Asset, including possession, use, risk of
loss, potential for gain, any Tax liabilities in respect thereof and dominion,
control and command over such Nonassignable Asset are to inure from and after
the Closing Date to the Person to whom such Nonassignable Asset is to be
Conveyed. Any Person retaining a Nonassignable Asset due to the deferral of
the Conveyance of such Nonassignable Asset will not be required, in connection
with the foregoing, to make any payments or offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise, regardless of any provision to the
contrary in the underlying Contract, including any requirements for the
securing or posting of any bonds, letters of credit or similar

 



11

    

 instruments, or the furnishing of any guarantees) to any third party, except
to the extent that the Person entitled to the Nonassignable Asset agrees to
reimburse and make whole the Person retaining the Nonassignable Asset to such
Persons reasonable satisfaction, for any payment or other accommodation made
by the Person retaining a Nonassignable Asset at the request of the Person
entitled to the Nonassignable Asset. The obligations set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 1.7(c)_ will terminate on the one-year anniversary of the
Closing Date (except of any such Conveyances as are in the process of being
consummated on such date, as to which such obligations will continue).

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the transfer of any assets under this 
_Section_ __ _ 1.7_ shall be effected without any additional consideration
payable by any Party.

(e) For U.S. and Canadian federal and applicable state, provincial and local
income Tax purposes:

(i) To the extent any Nonassignable Asset is transferred to US Buyer,
Canadian Buyer or any of their designated Subsidiaries, in each case, after
the Closing Date as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 1.7_, such
Nonassignable Asset shall be treated as having been transferred, and shall be
deemed to have been a Transferred Asset, from and after the Closing.

(ii) To the extent any Nonassignable Asset is not transferred to US Buyer,
Canadian Buyer or any of their designated Subsidiaries, in each case, as
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 1.7_, such Nonassignable Asset shall be
treated as never having been transferred to any Liberty Party, and
shall continue to be deemed a Retained Asset, from and after the Closing.

applicable) in writing of any such requirement at least five Business Days
prior to deducting or withholding any amounts, and shall cooperate with

eliminate any such deduction or withholding. To the extent such amounts are so
deducted or withheld and duly paid over to the appropriate Governmental

certificate under subsection 102(1) of the Competition Act and a request that
the Commissioner waive, under subsection 113(c) of the Competition Act, the
obligation of the parties to the Canadian Equity Sale to provide the

 



44

    

 notices required under subsection 114(1) of the Competition Act and (iii)
Liberty to obtain the Liberty Party Lender Consent, and to take or cause to be
taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement and Applicable
Law to consummate and make effective the Equity Sale and the other
transactions contemplated hereby as soon as practicable, including preparing
and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all
necessary notices, reports and other filings and to obtain as promptly as
practicable all Consents, registrations, approvals and Permits necessary or
advisable to be obtained from any third party or any Governmental Authority
in order to consummate the Equity Sale and the other transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided_ , that the Parties will not be required to take such
actions or cause to be taken such actions that would result in any condition
or requirement that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Subject to Applicable Law relating
to the exchange of information, the Liberty Parties and the Schlumberger
Parties shall consult with one another and jointly direct all matters with any
Governmental Authority consistent with its obligations hereunder; _provided_
that the Parties shall have the right to review in advance and, to the extent
practicable, each will consult with the other on and consider in good faith
the views of the other in connection with, all of the information relating to
the Liberty Parties or the Schlumberger Parties, as the case may be, and any
of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with,
written materials submitted to, or oral conversations had with, any third
party or any Governmental Authority in connection with the Equity Sale and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. In exercising the foregoing rights,
each of the Liberty Parties and the Schlumberger Parties shall act reasonably
and as promptly as practicable.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Liberty Parties and the Schlumberger
Parties shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts and
to, on a prompt basis, take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause
to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part
under this Agreement and Applicable Law to obtain the approvals requested by
the Governmental Authority, either in the Pre-Closing Restructuring, or the
Equity Sale; _provided_ , nothing in this Agreement shall require any of the
Liberty Parties or the Schlumberger Parties to agree or propose to (i) sell,
hold separate, license or otherwise dispose of any assets or conduct their
business in a specified manner, (ii) permit or agree to the sale, holding
separate, licensing or other disposition of, any assets of the Liberty Parties
or the Schlumberger Parties or (iii) limit the exercise of voting power under
equity securities of any Person, whether as a condition to obtaining
any approval from, or to avoid potential litigation or administrative action
by, a Governmental Authority or any other Person or for any other reason;
_provided_ , _further_ , _that_ neither the Liberty Parties nor the
Schlumberger Parties shall be obligated, in connection with this _Section_ __
_ 4.3(a)_, to expend money other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses,
attorneys fees and recording, filing or similar fees, unless mutually agreed
by the Parties.

(c) _Information_. The Liberty Parties and the Schlumberger Parties each
shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and
such other matters as may reasonably be necessary or advisable in connection
with any statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of the
Liberty Parties, the Schlumberger Parties or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to any third party or any Governmental Authority in connection
with the Equity Sale and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Each of
the Parties may, as it deems advisable and necessary, designate any

 



45

    

 competitively sensitive material provided to the other Party as "outside
counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and, if necessary,
to consultants acting under the direction of such counsel, and shall not be
disclosed by such outside legal counsel to employees, officers, or directors
of the recipient, unless express written permission is obtained in advance
from the source of the materials.

(d) _Status_. Subject to Applicable Law and as required by any
Governmental Authority, the Liberty Parties and the Schlumberger Parties each
shall keep the other promptly apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion of the Equity Sale and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other
communications received by the Schlumberger Parties or the Liberty Parties, as
the case may be, or any of their Subsidiaries, from any third party or any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Equity Sale and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Schlumberger US, Schlumberger Canada
and Liberty Parent shall give prompt notice to the other upon learning of any
change, fact or condition that would reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect or of any failure of any condition to any of the
Parties obligations to effect the Equity Sale and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. Neither the Liberty Parties nor the Schlumberger Parties
shall permit any of their Representatives to participate in any substantive
meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing,
investigation or other inquiry relating to the Equity Sale and the other
transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with the Schlumberger
Parties or the Liberty Parties, as the case may be, in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other Party a
reasonable opportunity to attend and participate thereat. In the case where
a Governmental Authority contacts one Party directly, that Party shall give
the other Party a reasonable opportunity to attend and participate before
beginning any substantive discussions. To the extent the second Party does not
participate in such discussions with a Governmental Authority, the first
Party will give prompt notice of the discussions to the second Party. For the
avoidance of doubt, any discussion, meeting, or communication with a
Governmental Authority regarding timing, delays or scheduling of the Equity
Sale or the consummation of other the transactions contemplated hereby, or
timing agreements, the timing of filings, or similar matters are "substantive"
under this _Section_ __ _ 4.3(a)_.

 

Section 4.5 _Liberty Parent Stockholder_ _Approval_. Liberty Parent shall take
all action necessary in accordance with Applicable Laws and the
organizational documents of Liberty Parent to duly give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Liberty
Parent Stockholder Approval, to be held as promptly as reasonably practicable
following completion of the review of the Proxy Statement by the SEC (and in
any event shall use reasonable best efforts to convene such meeting within 45
days thereof). Except as permitted by _Section_ __ _ 4.7_, the Liberty
Parent Board shall recommend that the stockholders of Liberty Parent approve
the Liberty Parent Share Issuance and the Liberty Parent Board shall solicit
from stockholders of Liberty Parent proxies in favor of such issuance, and the
Proxy Statement shall include the Liberty Board Recommendation. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing but subject to _Section_ __ _ 4.7_
and _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, Liberty Parents obligations pursuant this
_Section_ __ _ 4.5_ shall not be affected by (i) the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to Liberty Parent of any
Competing Proposal or (ii) any Change of Recommendation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Liberty
Parent (A) shall be required to adjourn or postpone the Liberty Parent
Stockholders Meeting (1) to the extent necessary to ensure that any legally
required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is

 



46

    

 provided to the Liberty Parents stockholders or (2) if, as of the time for
which the Liberty Parent Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, there are
insufficient shares of Liberty Parent Common Stock represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at
such Liberty Parent Stockholders Meeting, and (B) may adjourn or postpone the
Liberty Parent Stockholders Meeting if, as of the time for which the Liberty
Parent Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of
Liberty Parent Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
obtain the Liberty Parent Stockholder Approval; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, the Liberty Parent
Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed to a date that is
more than 15 Business Days after the date for which the meeting was previously
scheduled (it being understood that such Liberty Parent Stockholders Meeting
shall be adjourned or postponed every time the circumstances described in the
foregoing _clauses (A)(1)_ and _(A)(2)_ exist, and such Liberty Parent
Stockholders Meeting may be adjourned or postponed every time the
circumstances described in the foregoing _clause (B)_ exist); and _provided_
, _further_ , that the Liberty Parent Stockholders Meeting shall not be
adjourned or postponed to a date on or after three Business Days prior to the
Termination Date. Liberty Parent shall promptly provide the Schlumberger
Parties with all proxy tabulation reports relating to the Liberty Parent
Stockholders Meeting that have been prepared by Liberty Parent or Liberty
Parents transfer agent, proxy solicitor or other Representative, and shall
otherwise keep the Schlumberger Parties reasonably informed regarding the
status of the solicitation and any material oral or written
communications from or to Liberty Parents stockholders with respect thereto.
Unless there has been a Change of Recommendation in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 4.7_, the Parties agree to cooperate and use their reasonable best
efforts to defend against any efforts by any of the Liberty Parents
stockholders or any other Person to prevent the Liberty Parent Stockholder
Approval from being obtained. Once Liberty Parent has established a record
date for the Liberty Parent Stockholders Meeting, Liberty Parent shall not
change such record date or establish a different record date for the Liberty
Parent Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Schlumberger
US (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), unless required to do so by Applicable Law or pursuant to any
corporate action required by Liberty Parents amended and restated bylaws or
in connection with a postponement or adjournment permitted hereunder. 

Section 4.6 _Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) Liberty Parent shall as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
of this Agreement, and in any event the preliminary version thereof within 20
Business Days from the date of this Agreement, prepare and file with the SEC,
to the extent such filings are required by Applicable Law in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby, a Proxy Statement of Liberty
Parent relating to the meeting of the stockholders of Liberty Parent to be
held for the purposes of obtaining the Liberty Parent Stockholder Approval
(including any postponement, adjournment or recess thereof, the " _Liberty
Parent Stockholders Meeting_ ") therein, and any amendments or supplements
thereto necessary to complete the review of the Proxy Statement by the SEC
(the " _Proxy Statement_ "). Liberty Parent shall disseminate the Proxy
Statement to the stockholders of Liberty Parent following completion of the
review of the Proxy Statement by the SEC. The Parties shall cooperate in
preparing and filing with the SEC the Proxy Statement (or such other filings
as may be necessary under Applicable Law). Schlumberger US and Schlumberger
Canada, as applicable, shall furnish all information concerning Schlumberger
US, Schlumberger Canada, the Schlumberger US Targets, Schlumberger Canada
Target or the Business, as may be reasonably requested by Liberty Parent or
required by Applicable Law in

 



47

    

 connection with the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement and any
necessary amendments or supplements thereto (or such other filings as may be
necessary under Applicable Law). Liberty Parent shall, as promptly as
practicable after the receipt thereof, provide the Schlumberger Parties with
copies of any written comments and advise the Schlumberger Parties of any oral
comments with respect to the Proxy Statement received by Liberty Parent from
the SEC, including any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements
thereto (or such other filings as may be necessary under Applicable Laws), and
shall promptly provide the Schlumberger Parties with copies of all other
material or substantive correspondence between it and its Representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to filing the Proxy Statement or responding to any comments of the SEC
with respect thereto, Liberty Parent shall promptly provide the Schlumberger
Parties and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review such document or
response (including the proposed final version of such document or response)
and consider in good faith the comments of Schlumberger US in connection with
any such document or response. None of the Schlumberger Parties, Liberty
Parent or their respective Representatives shall agree to participate in any
material or substantive meeting or conference (including by telephone) with
the SEC, or any member of the staff thereof, in respect of the Proxy Statement
unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by the SEC, allows the other Party to participate.

 

(b) Schlumberger US, Schlumberger Canada and Liberty Parent each agrees, as to
itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be
supplied by it or its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to stockholders of
Liberty Parent and at the time of the Liberty Parent Stockholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Liberty Parent shall cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to
form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and
regulations thereunder; _ provided_, _ however_, that no representation is
made by Liberty Parent with respect to statements made therein based on
information supplied by Schlumberger US, Schlumberger Canada or its
Subsidiaries specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference
therein.

(c) If, at any time prior to the Liberty Parents Stockholders Meeting,
any information relating to Schlumberger US, Schlumberger Canada, the
Schlumberger US Targets, Schlumberger Canada Target or Liberty Parent, or any
of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by
any of the Schlumberger Parties, on the one hand, or any of the Liberty
Parties, on the other hand, that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement so that such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other Party and Liberty Parent shall promptly prepare and
file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information.

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement, Liberty Parent and its officers
and directors shall, and Liberty Parent shall cause its Subsidiaries and
their respective officers and directors to, and Liberty Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the other Representatives of Liberty Parent
and its Subsidiaries to immediately cease, and cause to be terminated,
any discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore by or on
behalf of Liberty Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives with
respect to any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Competing Proposal. Within two Business
Days of the date of this Agreement, Liberty Parent shall deliver a written
notice to each Person that has received non-public information regarding
Liberty Parent or its Subsidiaries within the six months prior to the date of
this Agreement pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with Liberty Parent for

such potential Competing Proposal previously granted to such Persons.

 

(b) From and after the date of this Agreement, Liberty Parent and its officers
and directors shall not, and Liberty Parent shall cause its Subsidiaries and
their respective officers and directors not to, and Liberty Parent shall use

Parent and its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly:

 

(i) initiate, solicit, propose, knowingly encourage, or knowingly facilitate

reasonably be expected to result in, a Competing Proposal;

(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions with any
Person with respect to or negotiations with any Person with respect to,
relating to, or in furtherance of a Competing Proposal or any inquiry,
proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing
Proposal;

(iii) furnish any non-public information regarding Liberty Parent or its
Subsidiaries, or access to the properties, assets or employees of Liberty

any Competing Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that
would reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal;

agreement providing for a Competing Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement entered into in compliance with _Section_ __ _ 4.7(e)(ii)_); or

 

(v) submit any Competing Proposal to the approval of the stockholders of
Liberty Parent;

 

 _provided_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Liberty Parent or any of its Representatives may, (A) in response to
an unsolicited inquiry or proposal, seek to clarify the terms and conditions
of such inquiry or proposal to determine whether such inquiry or proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and (B) in response to an inquiry or proposal
from a third party, inform a third party or its Representative of the
restrictions imposed by the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 4.7_ (without
conveying, requesting or attempting to gather any other information except as
otherwise specifically permitted hereunder).

 



49

    

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement, Liberty Parent shall promptly
(and in any event within the shorter of one Business Day and 48 hours
thereof) advise the Schlumberger Parties of the receipt by Liberty Parent of
any Competing Proposal made on or after the date of this Agreement or any
request for non-public information or data relating to Liberty Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries made by any Person in connection with a Competing Proposal
or any request for discussions or negotiations with Liberty Parent or
a Representative of Liberty Parent relating to a Competing Proposal, and, in
respect of each such Competing Proposal, Liberty Parent shall provide to the
Schlumberger Parties (within the shorter of one Business Day and 48 hours) (i)
a copy of any such Competing Proposal made in writing provided to Liberty
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or (to the Knowledge of Liberty) their
respective Representatives as well as copies of all written materials sent or
provided to or from Liberty Parent or any of its Subsidiaries relating to
such Competing Proposal and (ii) a written summary of any material oral
communications addressing such matters. Liberty Parent shall keep the
Schlumberger Parties reasonably informed of the status and material terms and
conditions of any such Competing Proposal and reasonably informed on a prompt
basis (and in any event within the shorter of one Business Day and 48 hours
thereof) of any material modification or proposed modification thereto,
and shall promptly (and in no event later than the shorter of one Business
Day and 48 hours after transmittal or receipt), provide the Schlumberger
Parties with copies of any material correspondence and written materials and,
with respect to material oral communications, a written summary of such
communications, between: (A) on the one hand, Liberty Parent or any of its
Representatives; and (B) on the other hand, the Person that made or submitted
such Competing Proposal or any Representative of such Person. From the date
of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing and termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Article VII_ , in connection with any Competing
Proposal, Liberty Parent shall (1) not release or permit the release of any
Person from, or amend, waive or permit the amendment or waiver of any
provision of, any "standstill," nondisclosure or similar agreement or
provision to which Liberty Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is or becomes a
party or under which any of Liberty Parent or its Subsidiaries has any rights
and (2) use its reasonable best efforts to enforce each such agreement or
provision; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding _clauses (1)_ and
_(2)_ , Liberty Parent shall be permitted to release or permit the release of
any Person from, or amend, waive or permit the amendment or waiver of any
provision of any such agreement solely to the extent necessary to permit
any Person to communicate privately with the Liberty Parent Board if the
Liberty Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with
the Liberty Parent Boards fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

(d) Except as permitted by _Section_ __ _ 4.7(e)_, Liberty Parent and its
officers and directors shall not, and Liberty Parent shall cause its
Subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors not to, and Liberty
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the other
Representatives of Liberty Parent and its Subsidiaries, not to, directly or
indirectly:

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, or publicly propose or announce
any intention to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to
the Schlumberger Parties, the Liberty Board Recommendation;

 



50

    

(ii) fail to include the Liberty Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement;

(iii) approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly propose or announce any
intention to approve, endorse or recommend, any Competing Proposal;

(iv) publicly declare advisable or publicly propose to enter into, any letter
of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement entered into in compliance with _Section_ __ _ 4.7(e)(ii)_)
relating to a Competing Proposal (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ");

 

(v) in the case of a Competing Proposal that is structured as a tender offer
or exchange offer pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act for
outstanding shares of Liberty Parent Common Stock (other than by a
Schlumberger Party or an Affiliate of a Schlumberger Party), fail to
recommend, in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9,
against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by its stockholders
on or prior to the earlier of (A) three Business Days prior to the date of the
Liberty Parent Stockholders Meeting (or promptly after commencement of such
tender offer or exchange offer if commenced on or after the third Business Day
prior to the date of the Liberty Parent Stockholders Meeting) or (B) 10
Business Days (as such term is used in Rule 14d-9 of the Exchange Act) after
commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer; or

 

(vi) if a Competing Proposal shall have been publicly announced or disclosed
(other than pursuant to the foregoing _clause (v)_ ), fail to publicly
reaffirm the Liberty Board Recommendation on or prior to the earlier of (A)
five Business Days after Liberty Parent so requests in writing or (B) three
Business Days prior to the date of the Liberty Parent Stockholders Meeting
(or promptly after commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer if
commenced on or after the third Business Day prior to the date of the Liberty
Parent Stockholders Meeting); or

 

(vii) cause or permit Liberty Parent to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement (together with any of the actions set forth in the foregoing
_clauses (i)_ , _(ii)_ , _(iii)_ , _(iv)_ , _(v)_ , and _(vi_ ), a " _Change
of Recommendation_ ").

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Liberty Parent
or the Liberty Parent Board, may:

 

(i) directly or indirectly through Liberty Parents Representatives, make such
disclosures as the Liberty Parent Board or any committee thereof determines
in good faith are necessary to comply with Rule 14e-2(a), Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or other
disclosure required to be made in the Proxy Statement by applicable U.S.
federal securities laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of Liberty
Parent, the Liberty Parent Board or any committee thereof shall, except as
expressly permitted by _Section_ __ _ 4.7(e)(iii)_ or _Section_ __ _
4.7(e)(iv)_, effect a Change of 

 



51

    

 Recommendation, including in any disclosure document or communication filed
or publicly issued or made in conjunction with the compliance with such
requirements (for the avoidance of doubt, it being agreed that the issuance
by Liberty Parent, the Liberty Parent Board or any committee thereof of a
"stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position, as
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act
shall not constitute a Change of Recommendation);

 

(ii) prior to, but not after, the receipt of the Liberty Parent Stockholder
Approval, engage in discussions and negotiations furnish non-public
information to any Person who has made a written, bona fide Competing Proposal
that has not been withdrawn and that did not result, directly or indirectly,
from a breach of  _Section_ __ _ 4.7_ if (A) prior to engaging in any such
activities, the Liberty Parent Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
Competing Proposal is, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior
Proposal and that the failure to engage in such activities would be
inconsistent with the Liberty Parent Boards fiduciary duties under Applicable
Law and (B) prior to furnishing any non-public information, Liberty Parent
receives an executed confidentiality agreement from such Person that contains
confidentiality and use terms that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable to
Liberty Parent than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, that
does not contain any provision requiring Liberty Parent or its Subsidiaries to
pay or reimburse the counterpartys expenses and that does not contain any
provision that would prevent Liberty Parent from complying with its
obligation to provide any disclosure to the Schlumberger Parties required
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.7_. Liberty Parent shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to, provide to the
Schlumberger Parties any information or access with respect to Liberty Parent
and its Subsidiaries not previously provided to the Schlumberger Parties that
it is providing to another Person pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 4.7_
before or immediately after such time as it provides such information or
access to such other Person;

 

(iii) prior to, but not after, the receipt of the Liberty Parent Stockholder
Approval, in response to a written, bona fide Competing Proposal that has not
been withdrawn and that did not result, directly or indirectly, from a breach
of this _Section_ __ _ 4.7_, the Liberty Parent Board may effect a Change of
Recommendation, if prior to taking or, as applicable, failing to take, such
action:

(A) the Liberty Parent Board determines in good faith after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that such Competing
Proposal is a Superior Proposal and that the failure to effect such a Change
of Recommendation would be inconsistent with the Liberty Parent Boards
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law (taking into account any adjustment to
the terms and conditions of the transactions proposed by the Schlumberger
Parties in response to such Competing Proposal);

 

(B) Liberty Parent shall have given prior written notice to the Schlumberger
Parties at least three Business Days prior to taking such action (1) that
Liberty Parent has received such proposal, specifying the material terms and
conditions of such proposal and (2) that Liberty Parent intends to take such
action, and the basis for such Change of Recommendation, attaching the most
current version of the proposed agreement under which such Superior Proposal
is proposed to be consummated and any other material documents and
correspondence in respect of such Superior Proposal (a " _Notice_ "); 

 



52

    

(C) during the three Business Days following such Notice (the " _Notice
Period_ "), Liberty Parent and its Representatives shall negotiate in good
faith with Schlumberger US on behalf of the Schlumberger Parties (to the
extent Schlumberger US desires to negotiate) regarding any revisions to
the terms of the transactions proposed by the Schlumberger Parties in
response to such Superior Proposal; and

(D) following the Notice Period, the Liberty Parent Board, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel (and taking into account
any legally binding (if accepted by Liberty Parent) adjustment or modification
of the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Schlumberger US on
behalf of the Schlumberger Parties), shall have determined in good faith that
the Competing Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and that failure to effect
such a Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with the Liberty Parent
Boards fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that
each time material modifications to the terms of a Competing Proposal that the
Liberty Parent Board has determined to be a Superior Proposal are made,
Liberty Parent shall be required to deliver a Notice to the Schlumberger
Parties and to again comply with the requirements of this _Section_ __ _
4.7(e)(iii)_ with respect to such revised Competing Proposal (it being
understood that the Notice Period in respect of such revised Competing
Proposal shall be the longer of (1) the remaining time of the initial Notice
Period and (2) two Business Days); and

 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to, but
not after, the receipt of the Liberty Parent Stockholder Approval, the
Liberty Parent Board may, in response to an Intervening Event, effect a Change
of Recommendation, if prior to taking such action:

 

(A) the Liberty Parent Board determines in good faith after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the Liberty Parent Boards fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law;

 

(B) Liberty Parent shall have given prior written notice (an " _IE Notice_ ")
to the Schlumberger Parties at least three Business Days prior to taking such
action that Liberty Parent has determined that an Intervening Event has
occurred or arisen (which notice must reasonably describe such Intervening
Event, including a detailed description of the events, facts and
circumstances relating to such Intervening Event and any material documents
and correspondence in respect of such Intervening Event and the reasons for
such Change of Recommendation) and that Liberty Parent intends to effect such
Change of Recommendation;

 



53

    

(C) during the three Business Days following such IE Notice (the " _IE Notice
Period_ "), Liberty Parent and its Representatives shall negotiate in good
faith with Schlumberger US on behalf of the Schlumberger Parties (to the
extent Schlumberger US desires to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the
terms of the transactions contemplated hereby proposed by the Schlumberger
Parties in response to such Intervening Event; and

(D) following the IE Notice Period, the Liberty Parent Board, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel (and taking
into account any legally binding (if accepted by Liberty Parent) adjustment or
modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by
Schlumberger US on behalf of the Schlumberger Parties), shall have determined
in good faith that such proposed changes do not obviate the need for the
Liberty Parent Board to effect such Change of Recommendation and that the
failure to make such Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with the
Liberty Parent Boards fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

 

(f) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 4.7_ is intended to restrict Liberty
Parent, in response to an unsolicited inquiry related to an actual or
potential Competing Proposal, from informing any Person of the existence of
the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 4.7_. __

 

(g) Liberty Parent shall inform all Representatives of Liberty Parent and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates of the restrictions described in this  _Section_
__ _ 4.7_. The Parties agree that any breach of any of the terms of this
_Section_ __ _ 4.7_ by any Subsidiary of Liberty Parent or by any officer,
director or employee of Liberty Parent or its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to
be a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 4.7_ by Liberty Parent and any breach of
any of the terms of _Section_ __ _ 4.7(b)_ by any Representatives of Liberty
Parent shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 4.7_ by Liberty
Parent for purposes of _Section_ __ _ 4.7(e)(ii)_, _Section_ __ _
4.7(e)(iii)_ and the definition of "Superior Proposal."

 

Section 4.8 _Non-Competition_.

 

(a) As a material inducement for US Buyer, Canadian Buyer and Liberty Parent
to enter into this Agreement, and in order to protect the confidential and
proprietary information and the goodwill that is Conveyed by Schlumberger US
and Schlumberger Canada hereunder, Schlumberger US, and Schlumberger Canada
each agree to enter into this _Section_ __ _ 4.8_. Any action by an
Affiliate of Schlumberger US or Schlumberger Canada that, if performed by
Schlumberger US or Schlumberger Canada would be prohibited by this _Section_
__ _ 4.8_, shall be deemed a breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 4.8_ by
Schlumberger US and Schlumberger Canada. From the Closing until the end of the
Restricted Period, without the prior written consent of Liberty Parent, each
of Schlumberger US and Schlumberger Canada shall not, and shall cause each of
their respective Affiliates (including Schlumberger Parent) not to, directly
or indirectly engage in any Competitive Activities within onshore United
States and Canada (the " _Restricted Area_ "), which Restricted Area (for the
avoidance of doubt) includes the geographic territory set forth on _Section_
__ _ 4.8(a) __of the Liberty Disclosure Letter_ ; _provided_ , that nothing
herein shall preclude Schlumberger US, Schlumberger Canada or their
respective Affiliates from:

 



54

    

(i) acquiring 5% or less of the outstanding securities of any Person engaged
in Competitive Activities listed on a national securities exchange;
_provided_ , that (A) such securities are held for investment purposes only
and (B) such securities are a passive investment, which for the avoidance of
doubt includes that such Schlumberger Party or any of its Affiliates does not
have the right to designate any of the members of the board of directors (or
similar governing body) of such Person or business and none of Schlumberger
Parent, Schlumberger US, Schlumberger Canada or any of their respective
Affiliates do not have any Representatives on such board (or similar governing
body);

(ii) subcontracting to use a provider of hydraulic fracturing services other
than Liberty Parent or its Subsidiaries, if so requested by a customer of
Schlumberger US, Schlumberger Canada or any of their respective Affiliates, so
long as (A) such services are part of Schlumberger USs, Schlumberger
Canadas or any such Affiliates provision of Integrated Services to such
customer and (B) either (1) such customer declines to accept Liberty Parent or
one of its Subsidiaries as a subcontractor for such hydraulic fracturing
services or (2) Liberty Parents proposal to Schlumberger US, Schlumberger
Canada or their respective Affiliates for the provision of such services is
not Financially Efficient, as reasonably determined by Schlumberger US,
Schlumberger Canada or any such Affiliate in good faith; _provided_ that,
Schlumberger US shall provide to Liberty Parent at least two Business Days
notice prior to making a final determination that any such proposal is not
Financially Efficient;

(iii) exercising its rights or complying with its obligations under this
Agreement or any other Transaction Documents; or

(iv) providing or engaging in activities, services, products or systems of a
nature provided by Schlumberger US, Schlumberger Canada or any of their
Affiliates that are solely related to the Retained Business or are otherwise
entirely distinct from the Transferred Business (including any activities,
services, products or systems related to the Retained Assets and the sale of
any raw products, including sand, that may be used in the Transferred
Business).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties understand and acknowledge that
none of Schlumberger US, Schlumberger Canada nor any of their Affiliates shall
be deemed to be in breach of this _Section_ __ _ 4.8(a)_ (x) for immaterial
and inadvertent violations of this _Section_ __ _ 4.8(a)_ by any
Schlumberger Party or its Affiliates or (y) if any Schlumberger Party or its
Affiliates is providing services related to the Retained Business and the
provision of such services inherently requires a Schlumberger Party or its
Affiliates to perform services or engage in activities that could be deemed
Competitive Activities, _provided_ that such potentially competitive services
or activities are not marketed or offered to customers, or otherwise
undertaken by any Schlumberger Party or its Affiliates, as services or
products discrete from the services provided in connection with the Retained
Business.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section_ __ _ 4.8(a)_ to the
contrary, in no event shall Schlumberger US, Schlumberger Canada or any of
their Affiliates be obligated to contract (or offer to contract) with Liberty
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for the provision of hydraulic fracturing
services as part of Schlumberger USs, Schlumberger Canadas or any such
Affiliates provision of Integrated Services to a customer.

 



55

    

(c) Schlumberger US and Schlumberger Canada may elect to terminate the
obligations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.8(a)_ by delivering written notice
of such election to Liberty Parent, if a Liberty Change of Control occurs on
or after the third anniversary of the Closing (a " _CoC  Non-Compete
Termination_"). If Schlumberger US elects to exercise its right to cause a CoC
Non-Compete Termination pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 4.8(c)_, the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 4.8_ shall automatically terminate and be
of no further force or effect as of such time as Schlumberger US delivers
written notice to Liberty Parent evidencing such election.

(d) Schlumberger US and Schlumberger Canada acknowledge and agree that the
geographic scope, scope of activity restrictions, and duration of the
covenants contained in this _Section_ __ _ 4.8_ are the result of
arms-length bargaining and are fair and reasonable in light of (i) the
nature and wide geographic scope of the Schlumberger Parties operation of
the Business, and the fact that the business and product lines acquired by US
Buyer or Canadian Buyer, as applicable, and Liberty Parent hereunder are
intended to be marketed and provided throughout the geographic area that is
subject to the restrictions in this _Section_ __ _ 4.8_; (ii) Schlumberger
USs, Schlumberger Canadas and their respective Affiliates level of control
over and contact with the Transferred Assets and Business Conveyed hereunder,
and association with such Transferred Assets and Business goodwill in all
jurisdictions in which the Schlumberger Parties and their Affiliates conduct
business; (iii) Schlumberger USs, Schlumberger Canadas and their respective
Affiliates knowledge of the confidential and proprietary information
associated with the Transferred Assets and Business Conveyed hereunder; and
(iv) the consideration that Schlumberger US, Schlumberger Canada and their
respective Affiliates are directly or indirectly receiving in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the goodwill and
confidential and proprietary information that Schlumberger US, Schlumberger
Canada and their respective Affiliates are directly or indirectly Conveying
and for which US Buyer or Canadian Buyer, as applicable, and Liberty Parent
are paying. The parties acknowledge that the restrictions set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 4.8_ are not against public policy and do not impose any
greater restraint than is necessary to protect the legitimate business
interests of US Buyer or Canadian Buyer, as applicable, and Liberty Parent,
have been specifically negotiated by sophisticated commercial parties, and
constitute a material inducement for US Buyer or Canadian Buyer, as
applicable, and Liberty Parent to enter into this Agreement and consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The covenants contained in
this _Section_ __ _ 4.8_ and each provision (and portion) hereof are
severable and distinct covenants and provisions (and portions). The invalidity
or unenforceability of any such covenant or provision (or portion) as written
shall not invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining covenants or
provisions (or portions) hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability
in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such
covenant or provision (or portion) in any other jurisdiction.

(e) It is the desire and intent of the parties that the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 4.8_ (and portions thereof) be enforced to the fullest extent
permitted under Applicable Law. Schlumberger US and Schlumberger Canada
acknowledge that this  _Section_ __ _ 4.8_ is reasonable and enforceable in
all respects; nonetheless, if any of the restrictions of this _Section_ __ _
4.8_ (or portions thereof) are found by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be unreasonable, overly broad, or otherwise unenforceable, the parties intend
that such restrictions (and portions thereof) shall not be thereby terminated
but shall be modified by such court so as to be valid and enforceable and, as
so modified, to be fully enforced. Each party further acknowledges that a
breach or threatened breach of this _Section_ __ _ 4.8_ would cause
irreparable harm to US Buyer and Liberty Parent for which

  



56

    

 they would have no adequate remedy at law, that it would be impractical and
extremely difficult to determine US Buyers, Liberty Parents, and their
Affiliates damages in the event of a breach or threatened breach, and that
US Buyer, Liberty Parent, and their respective Affiliates shall be entitled to
immediate injunctive relief and specific performance pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 8.13_ for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be the exclusive
remedies for a breach or threatened breach of this _Section_ __ _ 4.8_ but
shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law and equity,
including the recovery of damages. 

Section 4.9 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Liberty Parent shall cause the shares of
Liberty Parent Class A Common Stock to be transferred to Schlumberger US (i)
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, (ii) to the
extent applicable, in satisfaction of the Canadian Buyer Note to be approved
for listing on the NYSE at or prior to the Closing Date.

Section 4.10 _Further Assurances_.

 

(a) Except to the extent that the Parties obligations are specifically set
forth elsewhere in this _Article IV_ , upon the terms and subject to the

Schlumberger Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take
all actions necessary or appropriate to consummate the Pre-Closing
Restructuring, the Equity Sale and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
(ii) cause the fulfillment at the earliest practicable date of all of the
conditions to their respective obligations to consummate the Pre-Closing

intent of the Pre-Closing Restructuring, the Equity Sale and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(b) Neither the Liberty Parties nor the Schlumberger Parties shall be
obligated, in connection with actions taken after the Closing Date and this
_Section_ __ _ 4.10_, to expend money other than reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses, attorneys fees and recording or similar fees, unless reimbursed by
the Schlumberger Parties or the Liberty Parties, as the case may be.

(c) From the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date and subject to
any applicable legal restrictions, prior to making any material communications
to the Potential Liberty Employees pertaining to compensation or benefit
matters that are affected by the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and not in the Ordinary Course of Business, Liberty Parent, on the
one hand, and Schlumberger US and Schlumberger Canada, on the other hand, each
shall provide the other with a copy of the intended communication and such
other Party shall have a reasonable period of time (to the extent
practicable) to review and comment on the communication.

Section 4.11  _Confidentiality_.

(a) The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement dated as of October 18, 2019,
by and between Schlumberger US and US Buyer (as amended or modified, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), shall continue in full force and effect until
the Closing, at which time the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate. If
this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance

 



57

    

 with its terms. From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier
of the Closing Date and termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, each Party shall continue to provide access to the other Party and its
Representatives to the electronic data room relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby maintained by or on behalf of it to which the other Party
and its Representatives were provided access prior to the date of this
Agreement.

(b) Each of the Schlumberger Parties hereby agrees with Liberty Parent that
such Party shall not, and that such Party shall cause its Affiliates and
Representatives not to, at any time on or after the Closing Date, directly or
indirectly, without the prior written consent of Liberty Parent, disclose or
use any confidential or proprietary information involving or relating to any
of the Business (collectively, the " _Confidential Information_ "); _provided_
, _however_ , that Confidential Information will not include any information
solely related to the Retained Assets or generally available to, or known by,
the public (other than as a result of disclosure in violation hereof);
_provided_ , _further_ , that the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 4.11(b)_
will not prohibit any retention of copies of records or disclosure (i)
required by Applicable Law so long as, to the extent practicable, reasonable
prior notice is given of such disclosure and a reasonable opportunity is
afforded to contest the same or (ii) as reasonably required to enforce any
right or remedy relating to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document.
Each of the Schlumberger Parties agrees that such Party will be responsible
for any breach or violation of the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _
4.11(b)_ by any of such Partys Affiliates and Representatives.

Section 4.12 _Preservation of Records_. The Schlumberger Parties and the
Liberty Parties agree that each of them (a) shall preserve and keep the
records held by them or their Affiliates relating to the Business in
accordance with their respective document retention policies, other than
records (i) in the case of the Schlumberger Parties, that are actually
delivered to Liberty Parent in connection with the Closing, and (ii) in the
case of the Liberty Parties, a copy of which is retained by the Schlumberger
Parties and (b) shall make such records and personnel available to the other
as may reasonably be required by such party in connection with, among other
things, any insurance claims by, Legal Proceedings against or
governmental investigations of the Schlumberger Parties or the Liberty
Parties or any of their Affiliates or in order to enable the Schlumberger
Parties and the Liberty Parties to comply with their respective obligations
under this Agreement and each other agreement, document or instrument
contemplated hereby or thereby.

Section 4.13 _Publicity_. The initial press release with respect to the
execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably
agreed upon by the Parties. None of the Parties shall, and each will cause its
Representatives not to, issue any press release or public
announcement concerning this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of the other Party, which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless (a)
required by Applicable Law, (b) required by the applicable rules of any stock
exchange on which Liberty Parent or Schlumberger Parent lists securities or
(c) consistent with the final form of the joint press release announcing the
transactions contemplated hereby, the investor presentation given to
investors on the morning of announcement of this Agreement or consistent with
other prior approved disclosures, _provided_ , that, to the extent permitted
by Applicable Law, the Party intending to make such release shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts consistent with such Applicable Law to consult
with the other Parties with respect to the timing and content thereof; and _
provided_, _ however_, that no provision this Agreement shall be deemed to
restrict in any manner a Partys ability to communicate with its employees and

 



58

    

 that the Liberty Parties shall not be required by any provision of this
Agreement to consult with or obtain any approval from any Schlumberger Party
with respect to a public announcement or press release issued in connection
with the receipt and existence of a Competing Proposal and matters related
thereto or a Change of Recommendation, other than as set forth in _ Section
4.7_.

 

Section 4.14 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a)

(i) For U.S. (and applicable state and local) income Tax purposes, the
Parties intend that: (A) the US Equity Sale shall be treated as if
Schlumberger US sold the US Transferred Assets to US Buyer in exchange for the
Schlumberger US Consideration, the assumption by US Buyer of any liabilities
assumed or deemed assumed and treated as purchase consideration and any other
amounts properly treated as consideration with respect to the US Transferred
Assets for Tax purposes, all as determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_,
in a fully taxable transaction governed by Code Section 1001, and (B) the
Canadian Equity Sale shall be treated as if Schlumberger Canada sold the
Canadian Transferred Assets to Canadian Buyer in exchange for the Canadian
Buyer Note, the assumption by Canadian Buyer of any liabilities assumed or
deemed assumed and treated as purchase consideration and any other amounts
properly treated as consideration with respect to the Canadian Transferred
Assets for Tax purposes, all as determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_,
in a fully taxable transaction governed by Code Section 1001 ( _clauses (A)_
and _(B)_ above, collectively, the " _US Intended Tax Treatment_ "). Each of
the Parties shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, file all U.S.
(and applicable state and local) income Tax Returns consistent with the US
Intended Tax Treatment unless otherwise required by Applicable Law following
a final determination as defined in Section 1313 of the Code.

(ii) For Canadian income Tax purposes, the Parties agree that the transfer of
the Canadian Transferred Assets by Schlumberger Canada to Schlumberger Canada
Target will be a fully taxable transaction and, with respect to any election
made under subsection 85(1) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) by Schlumberger
Canada and Schlumberger Canada Target the Parties agree the elected amount for
each of the Canadian Transferred Assets shall be determined by Canadian Buyer
and Schlumberger Canada, acting reasonably (the " _Canadian Intended Tax
Treatment_ "). Each of the Parties shall, and shall cause its respective
Affiliates to, file all Canadian (and applicable provincial and local) income
Tax Returns consistent with the Canadian Intended Tax Treatment unless
otherwise required by Applicable Law.

(b)

 

(i) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, at the Closing or,
if due thereafter, promptly when due thereafter, all transfer Taxes, real or
personal property transfer Taxes, documentary Taxes, registration Taxes, sales
Taxes, use Taxes, excise Taxes, stamp Taxes, conveyance Taxes and any other
similar Taxes (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") applicable to, relating
to, arising out of or resulting from or imposed upon the Equity Sale or on the
Pre-Closing Restructuring shall be borne and paid 50% by Schlumberger US and
Schlumberger Canada and 50% by the Liberty Parties. The Party primarily
responsible under Applicable Law for the filing of any Tax Return in respect
of Transfer Taxes shall be responsible for the timely filing of all such Tax
Returns and payment of such Transfer Taxes, and (i) 

 



59

    

 Schlumberger US and Schlumberger Canada or (ii) the Liberty Parties, as
applicable, shall pay its share of such Transfer Taxes (as described in the
preceding sentence) to the paying Party at least three calendar days prior to
the due date (including any extensions that have been obtained) of such Tax
Returns. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the extent
permissible under Applicable Law, the amount of any such Transfer Taxes.

(ii) With respect to the transaction contemplated in _Section_ __ _ 1.3(d)_,
for Canadian Transfer Tax purposes, at the Closing Schlumberger Canada and
Schlumberger Canada Target shall each jointly make an election under (A)
Section 167 of the Excise Tax Act, if applicable, to have such transaction
take place on a GST/HST free basis or (B) Section 156 of the Excise Tax Act
to have such transaction take place for no consideration for GST/HST purposes.
Schlumberger Canada and Schlumberger Canada Target shall each jointly make
such election and any other applicable election under any equivalent or
comparable provision under any applicable Canadian federal, provincial or
local law, in each case, in form prescribed by Applicable Law. Schlumberger
Canada Target shall file any election contemplated in this  _Section_ __ _
4.14(b)(ii)_ in the manner and within the time prescribed by Applicable Law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent an
election described in this  _Section_ __ _ 4.14(b)(ii)_ would be available
with respect to a GST/HST but for a breach of this _Section_ __ _
4.14(b)(ii)_ by a Schlumberger Party, such GST/HST, including interest and
penalties, shall be borne and paid by Schlumberger Canada for and on behalf
of Schlumberger Canada Target; _provided_ that, Schlumberger Canada shall not
bear any liability for GST/HST, interest and penalties if (i) the GST/HST
elections are required to filed after Closing, and (ii) the applicable
GST/HST elections have been properly prepared in accordance with Applicable
Law and executed at Closing, and (iii) Schlumberger Canada Target does not
file such GST/HST elections in accordance with Applicable Law.

(iii) In the event that an election described in _Section_ __ _ 4.14(b)(ii)_
is not filed, and GST/HST is payable with respect to the transaction
contemplated in _Section_ __ _ 1.3(d)_ and paid in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 4.14(b)(i)_, the amount of any refunds (including any interest payments
from a Tax Authority attributable to such refund) received by a Schlumberger
Party relating or attributable to such GST/HST shall be apportioned between
Schlumberger Canada and Canadian Buyer in accordance with the manner in which
such GST/HST was paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.14(b)(i)_. Schlumberger
Canada shall, not more than thirty calendar days after receiving a refund
(including any interest payments from a Tax Authority attributable to such
refund) described in this  _Section_ __ _ 4.14(b)(iii)_, remit to Canadian
Buyer its share of such refund.

(c) Schlumberger US and Schlumberger Canada shall bear all Taxes (except
Transfer Taxes, which are addressed in _Section_ __ _ 4.14(b)_) relating to
(i) the Schlumberger US Targets and Schlumberger Canada Target, respectively,
(ii) the US Transferred Assets and Canadian Transferred Assets, respectively,
and (iii) the US Business and Canadian Business, respectively, in each case,
attributable to (A) any Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing Date and
(B) the portion of any Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing

which are addressed in _Section_ __ _ 4.14(b)_) relating to (1) the
Schlumberger US Targets and Schlumberger Canada Target, respectively, (2) the
US Transferred Assets and Canadian Transferred Assets, respectively, and (3)
the US Business and Canadian Business, respectively, in each case,
attributable to (x) any Tax period beginning after the Closing Date and (y)
the portion of any Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date.

 



60

    

(d) For purposes of determining the allocations described in  _Section_ __ _
4.14(c)_, (i) Taxes that are based upon income, sales, revenue or similar
items or imposed on a transactional basis (other than Taxes described in
_clause (ii)_ below) shall be allocated to the period in which the
transaction giving rise to such Taxes occurred based on an interim closing of
the books as of the end of the day on the Closing Date, and (ii) Taxes that
are ad valorem, property or similar Taxes imposed on a periodic
basis pertaining to a Straddle Period shall be allocated between the portion
of such Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and the
portion of such Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date based on the
number of days in the applicable Straddle Period that occur on or before the
date on which the Closing Date occurs, on the one hand, and the number of days
in such Straddle Period that occur after the date on which the Closing Date
occurs, on the other hand. For purposes of (A) the preceding sentence, any
exemption, deduction, credit or other item that is calculated on an annual
basis shall be allocated _pro rata_ per day between the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and the portion of
the Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date; and (B) _ clause_ __ _
(ii)_ of the preceding sentence, the period for such Taxes shall begin on the
date on which ownership of the applicable Transferred Assets gives rise to
liability for the particular Tax and shall end on the day before the next such
date.

(e) Except as required by Applicable Law, the Parties shall treat any
indemnification payments or any payments made to any Party in accordance with
this _Section_ __ _ 4.14_ as an adjustment to the value of the consideration
contemplated under this Agreement for U.S. federal and applicable state and
local income Tax purposes, and for any applicable Canadian federal, provincial
and local income Tax purposes.

 

(f) US Buyer and Canadian Buyer (as applicable) shall, or shall cause each
Target Company to, prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all
Tax Returns relating to the Target Companies or the Transferred Assets
required to be filed after the Closing Date for any Tax period ending on or
before the Closing Date and any Straddle Period (except, for the avoidance of
doubt, any consolidated, combined or unitary returns of Schlumberger Parent
or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates). Any such Tax Return shall be prepared
consistent with the past practices of Schlumberger US or Schlumberger Canada
(as applicable) except to the extent otherwise required by Applicable Law and
shall be filed timely with the appropriate Tax Authority. Schlumberger US or
Schlumberger Canada (as applicable) shall, not later than five calendar days
prior to the due date for payment of Taxes with respect to such Tax Return,
remit to US Buyer or Canadian Buyer (as applicable) their respective share of
Schlumberger Taxes due with respect to such Tax Return. US Buyer or Canadian
Buyer (as applicable) shall provide Schlumberger US or Schlumberger Canada
(as applicable) with a copy of any such Tax Return at least 30 calendar days
prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return (or within a
commercially reasonable period after the end of the relevant Tax period, if
such Tax Return is required to be filed fewer than 30 calendar days after the
end of the applicable Tax period) for its review and reasonable comment. US
Buyer or Canadian Buyer (as applicable) shall incorporate any reasonable
comments of Schlumberger US or Schlumberger Canada (as applicable) provided
to US Buyer or Canadian Buyer (as applicable) at least five calendar days in
advance of the due date for the filing of such Tax Return.

 



 



61

    

(g) Each Party shall provide notice to the other Parties within 10 calendar
days after receipt of a notice of any audit, litigation or other proceeding
(each a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") attributable to any Tax period ending on or
prior to the Closing Date or any Straddle Period, in each case, with respect
to a Target Company, the Transferred Assets or the Business. Schlumberger US
or Schlumberger Canada (as applicable) shall have the right, at its sole cost
and expense, to control any such Tax Proceeding relating solely to
Schlumberger Taxes; _provided_ ,  _however_ , if Schlumberger US or
Schlumberger Canada (as applicable) does not assume control of a Tax
Proceeding relating solely to Schlumberger Taxes within a reasonable period
following the receipt by Schlumberger US or Schlumberger Canada (as
applicable) of notice of such Tax Proceeding (which, in no case, shall be less
than 15 calendar days, provided that US Buyer or Canadian Buyer (as
applicable) may take any actions necessary during such time period to preserve
its rights under such Tax Proceeding), US Buyer or Canadian Buyer (as
applicable) shall have the right (at its cost and expense, subject to its
right to indemnification pursuant to _Article VI_ ) to control such Tax
Proceeding. If any Tax Proceeding relates to both Taxes that are Schlumberger
Taxes and Taxes that are not Schlumberger Taxes, US Buyer or Canadian Buyer
(as applicable) shall have the right (at its cost and expense, subject to its
right to indemnification pursuant to _Article VI_ ) to control such Tax
Proceeding. The Party controlling any Tax Proceeding pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 4.14(g)_ shall: (i) keep the other Party reasonably informed
of the progress of such Tax Proceeding, (ii) first consult in good faith with
the other Party before taking any material action with respect to the conduct
of such Tax Proceeding, (iii) permit the other Party (or its counsel) to
participate, at its sole cost and expense, in such Tax Proceeding, including
in meetings with the applicable Tax Authority, and (iv) not settle, compromise
and/or concede any portion of such Tax Proceeding without the written consent
of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. To the extent of any conflict between the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 4.14(g)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.4_, this
_Section_ __ _ 4.14(g)_ shall control.

 

(h) Unless required by Applicable Law or except as set forth below, none of US
Buyer, Canadian Buyer, the Target Companies, or any Affiliate thereof shall,
with respect to each Target Company or the Transferred Assets for any Tax
period ending on or prior to the Closing Date and the portion of any Straddle
Period ending on and including the Closing Date, file any amended Tax Return
or file any "voluntary disclosure agreement" or similar agreement with any
Tax Authority without the prior written consent of Schlumberger US or
Schlumberger Canada, as applicable (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), if such amended Tax Return or "voluntary
disclosure agreement" or similar agreement would have the effect of increasing
Schlumberger Taxes. Notwithstanding the above, US Buyer, Canadian Buyer, the
Target Companies, or any Affiliate thereof may file or cause to be filed an
amended Tax Return or "voluntary disclosure agreement" or similar agreement
without the consent of Schlumberger US or Schlumberger Canada, provided that
any additional Taxes resulting therefrom will not be deemed to constitute
Schlumberger Taxes and such filing does not otherwise create any additional
tax liability for Schlumberger US or Schlumberger Canada or their Affiliates.

 

(i) US Buyer and Canadian Buyer agree to: (i) retain all books and records
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Target Companies relating to any
Tax periods (or portions thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date until
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations and any extension
thereof for the respective Tax periods; and (ii) give Schlumberger US
and Schlumberger Canada reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if Schlumberger US or
Schlumberger Canada so requests, US Buyer or Canadian Buyer (as applicable)
shall allow Schlumberger US or Schlumberger Canada (as applicable) to take
possession of, or (if elected by Schlumberger US or Schlumberger Canada) copy,
such books and records.

 



62

    

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Parties
will cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by any other
Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns, any Tax Proceedings or
any other Tax-related claims related to the Target Companies, the Transferred
Assets, or the Business. Such cooperation will include providing records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such matters, making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explaining any materials provided pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
4.14(j)_.

(k) Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 4.14(b)(iii)_, the amount of any refunds of
Taxes (including any interest payments from a Tax Authority attributable to
such refund) of the Target Companies, or attributable to the Transferred
Assets or the Business, in each case, for any Tax period (or portion thereof)
ending on or before the Closing Date shall be for the account of Schlumberger
US or Schlumberger Canada (as applicable). The amount of any refunds of Taxes
(including any interest payments from a Tax Authority attributable to such
refund) of the Target Companies, or attributable to the Transferred Assets or
the Business, in each case, for any Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning
after the Closing Date shall be for the account of US Buyer and Canadian
Buyer. The amount of any refund of Taxes (including any interest payments from
a Tax Authority attributable to such refund) of the Target Companies, or
attributable to the Transferred Assets or the Business, in each case, for
any Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned between Schlumberger US or

Affiliates to forward, to the Party entitled to receive a refund of Tax
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.14(k)_ the amount of such

use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Schlumberger Parties and

similar items issued and outstanding in connection with the Business that
constitute Assumed Liabilities and are set forth on _Section_ __ _ 4.15 of

Support Obligations. If such release cannot be effected in accordance with

Person is commenced or, to the Knowledge of Liberty or the Knowledge of
Schlumberger, as applicable, threatened, that questions the validity or
legality of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or seeks damages
in connection therewith, including stockholder litigation (" _Transaction
Litigation_ "), Liberty Parent, Schlumberger US or Schlumberger Canada, as
applicable, shall promptly notify the other Parties of such Transaction
Litigation and shall keep the other Party reasonably informed with respect to
the status thereof. Each Party shall give the other Parties a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any Transaction

subject to such Transaction Litigation shall not offer or agree to settle any
Transaction Litigation without the prior written consent of the other Parties
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

Section 4.17 _Takeover Laws_. No Liberty Party will take any action that would

purport to apply to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 4.18 _Use of Name_.

 

(a) _Schlumberger Names_. None of Liberty Parent, the Target Companies, or
their Subsidiaries (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will include, after

_ 4.18_, no license or any other right whatsoever to use, any Marks owned by

derivations, acronyms, variations, abbreviations, insignias, designations or
combinations of the foregoing that are confusingly similar to such Marks or

_Schlumberger Marks_ "), and Liberty Parent covenants that, except as
expressly permitted in  _Section_ __ _ 4.18(b)_, it shall not, and it shall
cause the other Restricted Trademark Parties not to, adopt, use, apply to
register or register, or authorize others to adopt, use, apply to register or

_Section_ __ _ 4.18(a)_, Schlumberger US hereby grants to the Target
Companies a nonexclusive, royalty-free, revocable (solely in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 4.18(c)_), sublicensable (subject to the last sentence of

the Transitional Schlumberger Marks (i) to the extent necessary to effect a
rebranding of the Products and any related or associated services, and (ii) to
use, sell, offer for sale, market, distribute, or otherwise dispose of, the
Products and any related or associated services during the pendency of
such rebranding, in each case, (A) in a form and manner, and with standards
of quality, substantially consistent with the Businesss use of the

 Transitional Schlumberger Marks prior to the Closing, (B) in accordance with
any usage or branding guidelines provided in writing to US Buyer, Canadian
Buyer or the Target Companies by Schlumberger US, and (C) subject in all

shall have no right to use the Transitional Schlumberger Marks in any manner.
The foregoing license shall be sublicensable only to the Target Companies

_Section_ __ _ 4.18(b)_.

 

(c) _Revocation of Rights_. Schlumberger US shall have the right to terminate
the license granted in  _Section_ __ _ 4.18(b)_, effective five Business
Days after providing notice thereof (i) if any of the Restricted Trademark
Parties breaches this _Section_ __ _ 4.18_ in any manner (and such
Restricted Trademark Party does not cure such breach within five Business
Days of receiving Schlumberger USs notice thereof) or (ii) if there is a
Liberty Change of Control during the Wind-Down Term.

 

(d) _Quality Control and Standards_. From and after the Closing, during the
Wind-Down Term, Schlumberger US shall have the right to provide the Target
Companies with, and the Target Companies shall comply with, written quality
control standards that require the use of the Transitional Schlumberger Marks
by the Target Companies and any sublicensee to the degree
reasonably necessary to maintain the validity and enforceability of the
Transitional Schlumberger Marks, and to protect the goodwill associated
therewith (the " _Quality Standards_ "). Upon reasonable written request of
Schlumberger US, the Target Companies shall and shall cause each sublicensee
to promptly submit to Schlumberger US representative samples of any publicly
distributed embodiments of the Transitional Schlumberger Marks, including the
Products that bear the Transitional Schlumberger Marks (" _Licensed
Materials_ "). In the event that Schlumberger US reasonably finds that such
Licensed Materials substantially and materially deviate from any of the
Quality Standards or do not comply with any other terms and conditions of
this Agreement, Liberty Parent and the Target Companies shall, and shall cause
such sublicensee to, upon written notice from Schlumberger US, immediately
take all reasonable and necessary action to correct the deviations
or misrepresentations in, or misuse of, the respective items prior to any
further dissemination to the public, and provide Schlumberger US with
representative samples of the correction. Liberty Parent and the Target
Companies shall and shall cause each sublicensee to use the Transitional
Schlumberger Marks only in such manner as complies with the provisions of
Applicable Law relating to the Transitional Schlumberger Marks.

 



65

    

(e) _Miscellaneous_. Any and all goodwill generated by the use of, and related
solely to, the Transitional Schlumberger Marks by the Restricted Trademark
Parties shall inure solely to the benefit of Schlumberger US and its
Affiliates. The Restricted Trademark Parties shall not: during the Wind-Down
Term: (i) use the Transitional Schlumberger Marks in any manner that damages,
impairs, or tarnishes the reputation of Schlumberger US or its Affiliates or
the goodwill associated with any Transitional Schlumberger Mark; or (ii)
contest the validity of any of the Transitional Schlumberger Marks. Nothing
in this _Section_ __ _ 4.18_ shall prohibit the Restricted Trademark Parties
from (A) generally referring to Schlumberger Parent and its Affiliates for
fair use purposes or in a factual matter, (B) referring to or describing the

in an applicable legal or regulatory filing, or in a Legal Proceeding related

(a) Liberty Parent or a Subsidiary of Liberty Parent shall make offers of
employment to materially all of those Business Employees listed on  _Section_
__ _ 4.19(a) __of the Schlumberger Disclosure Letter_ (the " _Potential
Liberty_ _Employees_ ") of its choosing, and each such Potential Liberty
Employee who accepts such an offer of employment and assumes employment with
Liberty Parent or its Subsidiary shall become an employee of Liberty Parent or
a Subsidiary of Liberty Parent following either the Closing Date or the
Leasing End Date, as specified on _Section_ __ _ 4.19(a) _ _of the
Schlumberger Disclosure Letter_. Each such offer of employment, and the
commencement of employment by such individual with Liberty Parent or a
Subsidiary of Liberty Parent: (i) shall be in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the Employee Matters Agreement; and (ii) may be subject to
such individuals satisfaction of Liberty Parents or its Subsidiarys
customary pre-hire screening processes, including drug- and alcohol-screening
and background checks that would otherwise ordinarily be applicable to
similarly situated candidates for employment with Liberty Parent or its
Subsidiary. Prior to the Closing Date and Leasing End Date, as applicable,
Schlumberger US, Schlumberger Canada, or its applicable Affiliates shall make
the Potential Liberty Employees available to Liberty Parent or its Subsidiary
on at least 48 hours notice in order to facilitate the interview, screening,
and offer process contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 4.19(a)_ (provided that
such interview, screening, and offer process shall not interfere in any
significant respect with the business activities of Schlumberger US and
Schlumberger Canada or the Potential Liberty Employees). Subject to the
immediately preceding sentence, Schlumberger US and Schlumberger Canada shall
not (and Schlumberger US and Schlumberger Canada shall cause their respective
Affiliates to not) knowingly interfere with such interview, screening, or
offer process or take any action (or fail to take any action) that has the
intent or effect of discouraging any Potential Liberty Employee from accepting
an offer described in this  _Section_ __ _ 4.19(a)_. At least 30 days prior
to each of the Closing Date and Leasing End Date, Liberty will inform
Schlumberger which of the Potential Liberty Employees who were eligible to
receive employment offers from Liberty Parent or a Subsidiary of Liberty
Parent as of such date (as specified on _Section_ __ _ 4.19(a) of the
Schlumberger Disclosure Letter_) will not be receiving such offers.

 

(b) As of the date following the relevant Transferred Employees Hire Date,
until the earlier of (i) the date that is one year from such Transferred
Employees Hire Date and (ii) the date that such Transferred Employee is no
longer employed by Liberty Parent or one of its Subsidiaries, Liberty Parent
or its applicable Subsidiary shall provide or cause to be provided to such
Transferred Employee a rate of pay that includes base cash compensation, other
compensation and such other benefits, in each case as are provided to
similarly situated employees of Liberty Parent and its Subsidiaries.

 



66

    

(c) For all purposes under the Liberty Benefit Plans (other than any such plan
providing a severance benefit) in effect on the date of this Agreement (the "
_Post-Closing Plans_ "), each Transferred Employee shall be credited with his
or her years of service with Schlumberger US, Schlumberger Canada or their
applicable Affiliate before such Transferred Employees Hire Date to the same
extent and for the same purpose as such Transferred Employee was entitled,
before such date, to credit for such service under the corresponding
Schlumberger Benefit Plans, except to the extent such credit would result in
the duplication of benefits. The principles of the preceding sentence shall
also apply with respect to any Benefit Plan adopted by Liberty after the date
of this Agreement to the same extent that prior service credit under such
Benefit Plan is provided to similarly situated Liberty Employees who are not
Transferred Employees.

(d) Without limiting the generality of any other provision of this _Section_
__ _ 4.19_: (i) each Transferred Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all Post-Closing
Plans; (ii) for purposes of each Post-Closing Plan providing health or
welfare benefits, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such Post-Closing Plan shall be waived for each Transferred
Employee and his or her covered dependents (unless such exclusions
or requirements were applicable under comparable Schlumberger Benefit Plans);
and (iii) any copayments, deductible and other eligible expenses incurred by
such Transferred Employee or his or her covered dependents under a comparable
Schlumberger Benefit Plan during the plan year in which such Transferred
Employees Hire Date occurs shall be credited for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Transferred Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year of each comparable Post-Closing Plan. 

(e) Effective as of the Closing Date, Liberty Parent shall, or shall cause one
of its Subsidiaries to, have in effect one or more defined contribution plans
that include a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of
Section 401(k) of the Code (as applicable, the " _Liberty 401(k) Plan_ ").
Each Transferred Employee who is eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan
maintained by Schlumberger US or an Affiliate immediately prior to such
Transferred Employees Hire Date (a " _Schlumberger 401(k) Plan_ ") shall be
eligible to participate in the Liberty 401(k) Plan as of his or her Hire
Date. Liberty Parent shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, to the
extent permitted under the Schlumberger 401(k) Plan, cause the Liberty 401(k)
Plan to accept, within 90 days following the Closing Date or the Leasing End
Date, a "direct rollover" to the Liberty 401(k) Plan of the account balances
of each Transferred Employee (which shall be entirely in cash, but may, at the
Transferred Employees election, include promissory notes evidencing
outstanding loans) under the Schlumberger 401(k) Plan, if such direct
rollover is elected by such Transferred Employee, and Schlumberger Parent and
Schlumberger US shall cause any such rollover to include promissory notes to
the extent elected by the applicable Transferred Employee. To the extent
Schlumberger US, Schlumberger Canada, or any of their respective Affiliates
owe any Liability under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act
or any similar Applicable Law (collectively, the " _WARN Act_ ") to any
Potential Liberty Employee who does not receive an offer of employment from
Liberty Parent or a Subsidiary of Liberty Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _
4.19(a)_ (or who receives an offer of employment that does not prevent such
Potential Liberty Employee from experiencing an "employment loss" as defined
in the WARN Act) and whose employment is terminated by Schlumberger US,
Schlumberger Canada or one of their respective Affiliates (such that, as a
result of such termination, he or she is no longer employed by Schlumberger
US, Schlumberger Canada, or any of their respective Affiliates) within 60 days

 



67

    

 following the Closing Date or Leasing End Date (as specified on _Section_ __
_ 4.19(a) of the Schlumberger Disclosure Letter_ with respect to such
Potential Liberty Employee) (a " _Potential Liberty Employee WARN Liability_
"), Liberty Parent shall be responsible for and shall promptly, and in any

provided within 30 days of the applicable Potential Liberty Employee WARN
Liability being incurred), reimburse the Schlumberger Parties for 50% of such
Potential Liberty Employee WARN Liability.

 

(f) To the extent allowed under Applicable Law, Schlumberger Parent,
Schlumberger US and Schlumberger Canada shall provide to Liberty Parent or an
applicable Subsidiary of Liberty Parent all documentation, records and other
information as Liberty Parent shall reasonably request in writing that is
necessary to effect the actions contemplated in _Sections_ __ _ 4.19(a)_, 
_(b)_ , _(c)_ , _(d)_ and _(e)_ above, and all such necessary documents,
records and information shall be so provided as soon as reasonably
practicable.

 

(g) Effective as of each Transferred Employees Hire Date, Schlumberger Parent
and Schlumberger US, as applicable, shall take all necessary actions to
permit the continuation of loan repayments from and after such Hire Date
directly to the Schlumberger 401(k) Plan by such Transferred Employee if he or
she has an outstanding loan under the Schlumberger 401(k) Plan.

 

(h) Schlumberger US and its Affiliates, other than the Target Companies, shall
be solely responsible for satisfying the continuation coverage requirements
of Section 4980B of the Code for all individuals who, with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, are "MandA qualified beneficiaries"
as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9.

(i) Each Potential Liberty Employee who remains employed by Schlumberger
US, Schlumberger Canada, or one of their respective Affiliates until the
Closing Date or the Leasing End Date (as specified with respect to such
Potential Liberty Employee on _Section_ __ _ 4.19(a) __of the Schlumberger
Disclosure Letter_ ) but does not receive an offer of employment from Liberty
Parent or a Subsidiary of Liberty Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.19(a)_
and whose employment is terminated by Schlumberger US, Schlumberger Canada or
one of their respective Affiliates (such that, as a result of such
termination, he or she is no longer employed by Schlumberger US, Schlumberger
Canada, or any of their respective Affiliates) for a reason other than Cause
(as such term is defined in  _Section_ __ _ 4.19(i) __of the Schlumberger
Disclosure Letter_ ) within 30 days following the Closing Date or Leasing End
Date (as specified on _Section_ __ _ 4.19(a) __of the Schlumberger
Disclosure Letter_ with respect to such Potential Liberty Employee) is
referred to herein as a " _Severance-Eligible Potential Liberty Employee_."

severance paid by the Schlumberger Parties to each Severance-Eligible
Potential Liberty Employee in accordance with (and as specified in) _Section_
__ _ 4.19(i) __of the Schlumberger Disclosure Letter_. The Schlumberger
Parties shall provide to Liberty Parent within 60 days of each of the Closing

of the amount of the severance paid by the Schlumberger Parties as reflected
in such invoice, subject to the prior resolution of any dispute between
Liberty Parent and the Schlumberger Parties relating to such invoice.

 

(j) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 4.19_ are for the sole benefit of
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing
herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature

Agreement, (c) any of the Assumed Liabilities.

 

Section 6.3 _Limitations on Indemnity_.

 

(a) In no event shall (i) the aggregate indemnification actually paid by
Schlumberger US pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 6.1_, taken together with all
other indemnification actually paid by Schlumberger US pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 6.1_, or (ii) the aggregate indemnification actually paid by the Liberty

Indemnified Persons:

(i) unless and until, with respect to any individual Liberty Indemnified Claim
(or series of related Liberty Indemnified Claims) brought pursuant to _
Section 6.1_ relating to, arising out of or resulting from any of the Retained
Liabilities, the aggregate amount of otherwise indemnifiable Losses thereunder

Claims (or series of related Liberty Indemnified Claims) for which the
aggregate amount of otherwise indemnifiable Losses thereunder does not exceed
the De Minimis Amount, the Losses with respect to such Liberty Indemnified
Claim(s) shall not be applied towards the Deductible); and

 



74

    

(ii) unless and until the aggregate amount of otherwise indemnifiable Losses
pursuant to all Liberty Indemnified Claims brought pursuant to _ Section
6.1_ relating to, arising out of or resulting from any of the Retained
Liabilities exceeds a deductible (not a threshold) of $5,000,000 (the "
_Deductible_ "), and then Schlumberger US and Schlumberger Canada shall only
be jointly and severally liable for the amount by which the total of such
Losses exceeds such Deductible.

 

(c) For purposes of determining the failure of any representations or
warranties to be true and correct, the breach of any covenants or agreements,
and calculating Losses hereunder, any materiality or Material Adverse Effect
qualifications in the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
shall be disregarded.

 

(d) Payments by Schlumberger US or Liberty Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _
6.1_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ in respect of any Loss shall be limited to the
amount of any liability or damage that remains after deducting therefrom any
insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment
received or reasonably expected to be received by the Schlumberger
Indemnified Persons or the Liberty Parent Indemnified Persons, as applicable,
in respect of any such claim.

(e) The Liberty Parties, as applicable, shall take, and cause their
respective Subsidiaries to take, all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate
any Loss upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance that would be
reasonably expected to, or does, give rise thereto, including using
commercially reasonable efforts to incur costs only to the minimum extent
necessary to remedy the breach that gives rise to such Loss; _provided_ , that
nothing herein shall require any Schlumberger Indemnified Person or Liberty
Parent Indemnified Person to file any claim under any insurance policy or
initiate any Action or Legal Proceeding and any reasonable cost incurred by a
Liberty Party or its Subsidiaries to mitigate any such Loss will be deemed
a Loss. Liberty Parent and, US Buyer and Canadian Buyer each acknowledges
that it has had the opportunity to conduct due diligence and investigation
with respect to Schlumberger US, Schlumberger Canada, the Transferred Assets,
the Business and the Target Companies, however, no information or knowledge
of any Party, nor the results of any due diligence or investigation by any
Party, shall affect, waive, modify, limit, or diminish a breach of
representation, warranty or covenant under this Agreement.

Section 6.4 _Method of Asserting Claims_.

 

(a) All claims for indemnification by any Liberty Parent Indemnified Person or
Schlumberger Indemnified Person (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall be
asserted and resolved as set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_.

(b) A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party
Claim may be asserted by notice to the Party from whom indemnification is
sought; _ provided_, _ however_, that failure to so notify the Party from
whom indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") shall not
preclude the Indemnified Party from any indemnification which it may claim in
accordance with this _Article VI_.

 



75

    

(c) If an Indemnified Party has knowledge that a Third Party Claim has been
instituted or asserted and in respect of which indemnification may be sought
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, the Indemnified
Party shall promptly notify in writing the Indemnifying Party of the
assertion of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have 15
days (or sooner, if the nature of the Third Party Claim so requires) from the
personal delivery or mailing of such notice (the " _Indemnification Notice_
__ _ Period_") to notify the Indemnified Party whether or not it desires to
defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , that
in order to exercise such right the Indemnifying Party must acknowledge in
writing to the Indemnified Party its unqualified obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Party as provided hereunder. In the event that the Indemnifying
Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the Indemnification Notice Period
that, with respect to a Third Party Claim, it desires to defend the
Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
have the right to defend the Indemnified Party at the Indemnifying Partys
sole cost and expense and with counsel (plus local counsel if appropriate)
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; _ provided_, that the
Indemnifying Party must conduct its defense of the Third Party Claim actively
and diligently thereafter in order to preserve its rights in this regard. No
Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party, compromise or consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement agreement with respect to any action or proceeding in respect of
which indemnification is sought under _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ or _Section_ __ _
6.2_ (whether or not the Indemnified Party is an actual or potential party
thereto), unless such compromise, consent or settlement involves only the
payment of money damages for which the Indemnifying Party will indemnify the
Indemnified Party hereunder and the claimant (or claimants) and such Party
provide to such other Party an unqualified release from all liability in
respect of the Third Party Claim. If the right to assume and control the
defense is exercised, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
participate in, but not control, such defense at its own expense and
the Indemnifying Partys indemnity obligations shall be deemed not to include
attorneys fees and litigation expenses incurred in such participation by the
Indemnified Party after the assumption of the defense by the Indemnifying
Party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Indemnified Parties collectively shall be entitled to employ one
firm or separate counsel (plus local counsel if appropriate) to represent the
Indemnified Parties if, in the opinion of counsel to each Indemnified Party
seeking to employ such separate counsel, a conflict of interest between such
Indemnified Party or Parties and the Indemnifying Party exists in respect of
such claim and, in each such event, the fees, costs and expenses of one such
firm or separate counsel (plus one local counsel per jurisdiction if
appropriate) shall be paid in full by the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party elects not to defend the Indemnified Party against
any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against by it
hereunder, has not elected to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim within
the Indemnification Notice Period or contests its obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Party for such Losses under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party
may defend, negotiate and settle the claim for the account and cost of the
Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , that the Indemnified Party will not settle
the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the Indemnified
Party defends any Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall
reimburse the Indemnified Party for the reasonable expenses of defending such
Third Party Claim upon submission of periodic bills. The Indemnified Party
shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and, subject to obtaining proper
assurances of confidentiality and privilege, shall make available to
the Indemnifying Party all pertinent information under the control of the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party makes any payment on any Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such
payment, to all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party to any insurance
benefits or other claims of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third
Party Claim.

 



76

    

(d) After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the
time in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been
consummated, or the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall have
arrived at a mutually binding agreement, in each case with respect to a Third
Party Claim hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall forward to the Indemnifying
Party notice of any sums due and owing by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to
this Agreement with respect to such matter and the Indemnifying Party shall
pay all of such remaining sums so due and owing to the Indemnified Party by
wire transfer of immediately available funds within five Business Days after
the date of such notice or otherwise in accordance with this _ Article VI_.

Section 6.5 _Exclusive Remedy; Survival_.

 

(a) Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.6_ and for injunctive relief to
the extent available pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.13_, from and after the
Closing, the indemnity provided in this _Article VI_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of each of the Liberty Parent Indemnified Persons and the
Schlumberger Indemnified Persons with respect to any and all Actions for
Losses sustained or incurred relating to, arising out of or resulting from
this Agreement, including the allocation of Assumed Liabilities and Retained
Liabilities, except in the case of any claim based on fraud or a Willful and
Material Breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation contained in this
Agreement.

(b) All representations and warranties of the Parties contained in this
Agreement and all claims with respect thereto shall terminate at the Closing
or upon the earlier Termination Date pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_, as
the case may be, except that the Fundamental Representations and all claims
with respect thereto shall survive forever. It is the intention of the Parties
that the Termination Date set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_ supersede
a statute of limitation applicable to such representations and warranties or
claim with respect thereof other than in the case of fraud. No Indemnified
Party shall be required to show reliance on any representation, warranty,
certificate or other agreement in order for such Indemnified Party to be
entitled to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement hereunder.

(c) The covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in this Agreement
and all claims with respect thereto shall terminate at the Closing or upon the
earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, as the
case may be, except for those covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement that by their terms are to be performed in whole or in part after
the Closing (or survive termination of this Agreement, as applicable, pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_), each of which shall remain in full force and
effect until fully performed; _provided_ , _however_ , that any obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to any Losses as
to which an Indemnified Party shall have given notice (stating the reasonable
basis of the claim for indemnification) to the Indemnifying Party in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ before such time.

of directors, any director designated by Riverstone pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 2.1(a)_ (each, a " _Riverstone Director_ ") will be designated to the class
as mutually agreed upon by Riverstone and the Company, and any
director designated by the Schlumberger Parties pursuant to _Section_ __ _

_provided that_ , in all cases, the number of directors in each class shall be

death, disability, resignation or removal of a Schlumberger Director, will be

immediately following the filling of such vacancy, will not exceed the total
number of persons Riverstone or the Schlumberger Parties, as applicable, is
entitled to designate pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_ on the date of such
replacement designation. The Company, the Schlumberger Parties and Riverstone
will take all Necessary Action to cause such replacement designee to become a

(f) In the event that a Riverstone Director is then on the Board and
Riverstone is no longer entitled to designate one or more directors pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_, to the extent requested by the Governance
Committee, Riverstone shall promptly cause the Riverstone Director to resign
from service on the Board (and all committees thereof on which the Riverstone

Deadline_ "), _further provided_ , that the Effectiveness Deadline shall be
extended to 60 days after the filing deadline if the Registration Statement

ensure that such Registration Statement is available or, if not available,

Registrable Securities have ceased to be Registrable Securities. When
effective, a Registration Statement filed pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
2(a)(i)_ (including the documents incorporated therein by reference) will
comply as to form in all material respects with all applicable requirements of
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (in
the case of any Prospectus contained in such Registration Statement, in the
light of the circumstances under which such statement is made) other than any

141

    

(b) _Demand Registration._

 

(i) Any Sponsoring Holder shall have the option and right, exercisable by
delivering a written notice to the Company (a " _Demand Notice_ "), to
require the Company to, pursuant to the terms of and subject to the
limitations contained in this Agreement, prepare and file with the Commission
a Registration Statement registering the offering and sale of the number
and type of Registrable Securities on the terms and conditions specified in
the Demand Notice, which may include sales on a delayed or continuous basis
pursuant to Rule 415 pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement (a "
_Demand Registration_ "). The Demand Notice must set forth the number of
Registrable Securities that the Initiating Holder intends to include in such
Demand Registration and the intended methods of disposition thereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall the
Company be required to effectuate a Demand Registration unless the dollar
amount of the Registrable Securities of the Initiating Holder to be included
therein is reasonably likely to result in gross sale proceeds of at least $25
million based on the VWAP (the " _Minimum Amount_ ") as of the date of the
Demand Notice.

 

(ii) Within five Business Days (or if the Registration Statement will be a
Shelf Registration Statement, within two Business Days) after the receipt of
the Demand Notice, the Company shall give written notice of such Demand Notice
to all Holders and, within 30 days after receipt of the Demand Notice (except
if the Company is not then eligible to register for resale the
Registrable Securities on Form S-3, in which case, within 90 days thereof),
shall, subject to the limitations of this _Section_ __ _ 2(b)_, file a
Registration Statement in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Demand Notice, which Registration Statement shall cover all of the Registrable
Securities that the Holders shall in writing request to be included in the
Demand Registration (such request to be given to the Company within
three Business Days (or if the Registration Statement will be a Shelf
Registration Statement, within one Business Day) after receipt of notice of
the Demand Notice given by the Company pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2(a)(iii)_). The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause such
Registration Statement to become and remain effective under the Securities Act
until the earlier of (A) 180 days (or two years if a Shelf Registration
Statement is requested) after the Effective Date or (B) the date on which all
Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement have been sold
(the " _Effectiveness Period_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that such period
shall be extended for a period of time equal to the period the Holders
refrain from selling any securities included in such Registration Statement at
the request of an underwriter of the Company or the Company pursuant to this
Agreement.

 

(iii) Subject to the other limitations contained in this Agreement, the
Company is not obligated hereunder to effect (A) a Demand Registration within
90 days after the closing of any Underwritten Offering, (B) more than a total
of one Demand Registration for which any transferee of Laurel in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 10(e)_ is the Initiating Holder, (C) more than a total
of one Demand Registration for which any transferee of SH Ventures in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10(e)_ is the Initiating Holder, and (D) a
subsequent Demand Registration pursuant to a Demand Notice if a Registration
Statement covering all of the Registrable Securities held by the Initiating
Holder shall have become and remains effective under the Securities Act and is
sufficient to permit offers and sales of the number and type of Registrable
Securities on the terms and conditions specified in the Demand Notice in
accordance with the intended timing and method or methods of distribution
thereof specified in the Demand Notice. Subject to the foregoing sentence,
following the date of this Agreement, Riverstone and, upon the expiration of
the Lockup Period, the Schlumberger Parties (or, in each case, any transferee
thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10(e)_) shall each be permitted to
be the Initiating Holder for an unlimited number of Demand

 



142

    

 Registrations (including any demands for registration of the offer and sale
of Registrable Securities on Form S-3 (so long as the Company is eligible
to use Form S-3)). No Demand Registration shall be deemed to have occurred
for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 2(a)(iv)_ if the Registration Statement
relating thereto does not become effective or is not maintained effective for
its entire Effectiveness Period, in which case the Initiating Holder shall be
entitled to an additional Demand Registration in lieu thereof. Further, a
Demand Registration shall not constitute a Demand Registration of the
Initiating Holder for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 2(a)(iv)_ if, as a
result of _Section_ __ _ 2(a)(vii)(A)_, there is included in the Demand
Registration less than the lesser of (i) Registrable Securities of the
Initiating Holder having a VWAP measured on the effective date of the related
Registration Statement of $25 million and (ii) two-thirds of the number of
Registrable Securities the Initiating Holder set forth in the applicable
Demand Notice.

(iv) A Holder may withdraw all or any portion of its Registrable
Securities included in a Demand Registration from such Demand Registration at
any time prior to the effectiveness of the applicable Registration Statement.
Upon receipt of a notice from the Initiating Holder that the Initiating Holder
is withdrawing an amount of its Registrable Securities from the Demand
Registration such that the remaining amount of Registrable Securities of the
Initiating Holder to be included in the Demand Registration is reasonably
likely to result in gross sale proceeds below the Minimum Amount, the Company
shall cease all efforts to secure effectiveness of the applicable Registration
Statement. Such registration nonetheless shall be deemed a Demand Registration
with respect to the Initiating Holder for purposes of  _Section_ __ _
2(a)(iv)_ unless (A) the Initiating Holder shall have paid or reimbursed the
Company for its pro rata share of all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
fees and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the withdrawn
registration of such Registrable Securities (based on the number of
securities the Initiating Holder sought to register, as compared to the total
number of securities included in such Demand Registration) or (B) the
withdrawal is made following the occurrence of a Material Adverse Change or
pursuant to the Companys request for suspension pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3(o)_.

(v) The Company may include in any such Demand Registration other Company
Securities for sale for its own account or for the account of any other
Person, subject to _Section_ __ _ 2(a)(vii)_ and _Section_ __ _ 2(c)(iii)_.

 

(vi) In the case of a Demand Registration not being underwritten, if the
Initiating Holder advises the Company that in its reasonable opinion the
aggregate number of securities requested to be included exceeds the number
that can be included without being likely to have a significant adverse effect
on the price, timing or distribution of the securities offered or the market
for the securities offered, the Company shall include in such Demand
Registration only that number of securities that in the reasonable opinion of
the Initiating Holder will not have such adverse effect, with such number to
be allocated as follows: (A) first, pro-rata among all Holders (including the
Initiating Holder) that have requested to participate in such Demand
Registration based on the relative number of Registrable Securities then held
by each such Holder; (B) second, if there remains availability for additional
securities to be included in such Demand Registration, the Company; and (C)
third, if there remains availability for additional securities to be included
in such Demand Registration, any other holders entitled to participate in
such Demand Registration, if applicable, based on the relative number of
securities such holder is entitled to include in such Demand Registration.

 



143

    

(vii) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to qualify for
registration on Form S-3. To the extent an Automatic Shelf Registration
Statement has been filed, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to remain a WKSI and not become an ineligible issuer (as defined in
Rule 405 under the Securities Act) during the period during which such
Automatic Shelf Registration Statement is required to remain effective. If the
Automatic Shelf Registration Statement has been outstanding for at least three
years, at the end of the third year the Company shall refile a new Automatic
Shelf Registration Statement covering the Registrable Securities that remain
unsold. If at any time when the Company is required to re-evaluate its
WKSI status, the Company determines that it is not a WKSI, the Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to refile the Shelf Registration Statement
on Form S-3 and, if such form is not available, Form S-1 and keep such
registration statement effective during the period during which such
registration statement is required to be kept effective. Subject to the
limitations contained in this Agreement, the Company shall effect any Demand
Registration on such appropriate registration form of the Commission (A) as
shall be selected by the Company and (B) as shall permit the disposition of
the Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method or methods
of disposition specified in the Demand Notice; _provided_ , that if the
Company becomes, and is at the time of its receipt of a Demand Notice, a WKSI,
the Demand Registration for any offering and selling of
Registrable Securities shall be effected pursuant to an Automatic Shelf
Registration Statement, which shall be on Form S-3 or any equivalent or
successor form under the Securities Act (if available to the Company). If
at any time a Registration Statement on Form S-3 is effective and a Holder
provides written notice to the Company that it intends to effect an offering
of all or part of the Registrable Securities included on such Registration
Statement, the Company will amend or supplement such Registration Statement as
may be necessary in order to enable such offering to take place.

 

(viii) Without limiting _Section_ __ _ 3_, in connection with any Demand
Registration pursuant to and in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2(b)_,
the Company shall (A) promptly prepare and file or cause to be prepared and
filed (1) such additional forms, amendments, supplements, prospectuses,
certificates, letters, opinions and other documents, as may be necessary or
advisable to register or qualify the securities subject to such Demand
Registration, including under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the
Holders shall reasonably request; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such
qualification shall be required in any jurisdiction where, as a result
thereof, the Company would become subject to general service of process or to
taxation or qualification to do business in such jurisdiction solely as a
result of registration and (2) such forms, amendments, supplements,
prospectuses, certificates, letters, opinions and other documents as may be
necessary to apply for listing or to list the Registrable Securities subject
to such Demand Registration on the Trading Market and (B) do any and all
other acts and things that may be reasonably necessary or appropriate or
reasonably requested by the Holders to enable the Holders to consummate a
public sale of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended
timing and method or methods of distribution thereof.

(ix) In the event a Holder Transfers Registrable Securities included on a
Registration Statement and such Registrable Securities remain Registrable
Securities following such Transfer, at the request of such Holder, the Company
shall amend or supplement such Registration Statement as may be necessary in
order to enable such transferee to offer and sell such Registrable Securities
pursuant to such Registration Statement; _provided,_ that in no event shall
the Company be required to file a post-effective amendment to
the Registration Statement unless

 



144

    

 (A) such Registration Statement includes only Registrable Securities held by
the Holder, Affiliates of the Holder or transferees of the Holder or (B) the
Company has received written consent therefor from each Person for whom
Registrable Securities have been registered on (but not yet sold under) such
Registration Statement, other than the Holder, Affiliates of the Holder or
transferees of the Holder.

 

(c) Requested Underwritten Offering. Any Sponsoring Holder then able to
effectuate a Demand Registration pursuant to the terms of Section 2(b) (or
who has previously effectuated a Demand Registration pursuant to Section 2(b)
but has not engaged in an Underwritten Offering in respect of such Demand
Registration) shall have the option and right, exercisable by delivering
written notice to the Company of its intention to distribute Registrable
Securities by means of an Underwritten Offering (an " _Underwritten Offering
Notice_ "), to require the Company, pursuant to the terms of and subject to
the limitations of this Agreement, to effectuate a distribution of any or all
of its Registrable Securities by means of an Underwritten Offering pursuant to
a new Demand Registration or pursuant to an effective Registration
Statement covering such Registrable Securities (a " _Requested Underwritten
Offering_ "); _provided_ , that the dollar amount of the Registrable
Securities of such Initiating Holder requested to be included in such
Requested Underwritten Offering is reasonably likely to result in gross sale
proceeds at least equal to the Minimum Amount as of the date of such
Underwritten Offering Notice. The Underwritten Offering Notice must set forth
the number of Registrable Securities that the Initiating Holder intends to
include in such Requested Underwritten Offering. The managing underwriter or
managing underwriters of a Requested Underwritten Offering shall be designated
by the Company; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such designated managing
underwriter or managing underwriters shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Initiating Holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company is not obligated
to effect a Requested Underwritten Offering within 90 days after the closing
of an Underwritten Offering. Any Requested Underwritten Offering (other than
the first Requested Underwritten Offering made in respect of a prior Demand
Registration) shall constitute a Demand Registration of the Initiating Holder
for purposes of Section 2(a)(iv) (it being understood that if requested
concurrently with a Demand Registration then, together, such Demand
Registration and Requested Underwritten Offering shall count as one
Demand Registration); _provided_ , _however_ , that a Requested Underwritten
Offering shall not constitute a Demand Registration of the Initiating Holder
for purposes of Section 2(a)(iv) if, as a result of Section 2(c)(iii)(A),
the Requested Underwritten Offering include less than the lesser of (i)
Registrable Securities of the Initiating Holder having a VWAP measured on the
effective date of the related Registration Statement of $10 million and (ii)
two-thirds of the number of Registrable Securities the Initiating Holder set
forth in the applicable Underwritten Offering Notice.

 

(d) _Piggyback Registration and Piggyback Underwritten Offering._

 

(i) If the Company shall at any time propose to file a registration statement
under the Securities Act with respect to an offering of Common Stock (other
than a registration statement on Form S-4, Form S-8 or any successor forms
thereto or filed solely in connection with an exchange offer or any
employee benefit or dividend reinvestment plan and other than a Demand
Registration), whether or not for its own account, then the Company shall
promptly notify all Holders of such proposal reasonably in advance of (and in
any event at least five Business Days, except if the registration statement
will be a Shelf Registration Statement, at least two Business Days, before)
the anticipated filing date (the " _Piggyback Registration_

 



145

    

  _Notice_ "). The Piggyback Registration Notice shall offer Holders the
opportunity to include for registration in such registration statement the
number of Registrable Securities as they may request in writing (a "
_Piggyback Registration_ "). The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to include in each such Piggyback Registration such Registrable
Securities for which the Company has received written requests for inclusion
therein (" _Piggyback Registration Request_ ") within three Business Days or,
if the Piggyback Registration will be on a Shelf Registration Statement,
within one Business Day, after sending the Piggyback Registration Notice. For
the avoidance of doubt, the failure to receive such notice within the
aforementioned timeframes shall result in a waiver of such Holders
participation right. Each Holder shall be permitted to withdraw all or part
of such Holders Registrable Securities from a Piggyback Registration by
giving written notice to the Company of its request to withdraw; _provided_ ,
that (A) such request must be made in writing prior to the effectiveness
of such registration statement and (B) such withdrawal shall be irrevocable
and, after making such withdrawal, a Holder shall no longer have any right to
include Registrable Securities in the Piggyback Registration as to which such
withdrawal was made. Any withdrawing Holder shall continue to have the right
to include any Registrable Securities in any subsequent registration statement
or registration statements as may be filed by the Company with respect to
offerings of Common Stock, all upon the terms and conditions set forth
herein.

(ii) If the Company shall at any time propose to conduct an Underwritten
Offering (including a Requested Underwritten Offering), whether or not for
its own account, then the Company shall promptly notify all Holders of such
proposal reasonably in advance of (and in any event at least five Business
Days, except if the Underwritten Offering will be made pursuant to a Shelf
Registration Statement, at least two Business Days, before) the commencement
of the offering, which notice shall set forth the principal terms and
conditions of the issuance, including the proposed offering price or range of
offering prices (if known), the anticipated filing date of the related
registration statement (if applicable) and the number of shares of Common
Stock that are proposed to be registered (the " _Underwritten
Offering Piggyback Notice_ "). The Underwritten Offering Piggyback Notice
shall offer Holders the opportunity to include in such Underwritten Offering
(and any related registration, if applicable) the number of Registrable
Securities as they may request in writing (an " _Underwritten Piggyback
Offering_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that the Company
proposes to effectuate the subject Underwritten Offering pursuant to an
effective Shelf Registration Statement other than an Automatic Shelf
Registration Statement, only Registrable Securities of Holders which are
subject to an effective Shelf Registration Statement may be included in such
Underwritten Piggyback Offering. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to include in each such Underwritten Piggyback Offering
such Registrable Securities for which the Company has received written
requests for inclusion therein within three Business Days or, if
such Underwritten Piggyback Offering will be made pursuant to a Shelf
Registration Statement, within one Business Day after sending the Underwritten
Offering Piggyback Notice. Each Holder shall be permitted to withdraw all or
part of such Holders Registrable Securities from an Underwritten Piggyback
Offering at any time prior to the effectiveness of the applicable registration
statement, and such Holder shall continue to have the right to include any
Registrable Securities in any subsequent Underwritten Offerings, all upon the
terms and conditions set forth herein.

 



146

    

(iii) If the managing underwriter or managing underwriters of an Underwritten
Offering advise the Company and the Holders that in their reasonable opinion
that the inclusion of all of the Holders Registrable Securities requested for
inclusion in the subject Underwritten Offering (and any related registration,
if applicable) (and any other Common Stock proposed to be included in such
offering) exceeds the number that can be included without being likely to have
a significant adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the
securities offered or the market for the securities offered, the Company
shall include in such Underwritten Offering (and any related registration, if
applicable) only that number of shares of Common Stock proposed to be included
in such Underwritten Offering (and any related registration, if applicable)
that, in the reasonable opinion of the managing underwriter or managing
underwriters, will not have such adverse effect, with such number to be
allocated as follows: (A) in the case of a Requested Underwritten
Offering, (1) first, pro-rata among all Holders (including the Initiating
Holder) that have requested to include Registrable Securities in such
Underwritten Offering based on the relative number of Registrable Securities
then held by each such Holder, (2) second, if there remains availability for
additional shares of Common Stock to be included in such Underwritten
Offering, the Company, and (3) third, if there remains availability
for additional shares of Common Stock to be included in such Underwritten
Offering, any other holders entitled to participate in such Underwritten
Offering, if applicable, based on the relative number of shares of Common
Stock then held by each such holder; and (B) in the case of any other
Underwritten Offerings, (x) first, to the Company, (y) second, if there
remains availability for additional shares of Common Stock to be included in
such Underwritten Offering, pro-rata among all Holders desiring to include
Registrable Securities in such Underwritten Offering based on the relative
number of Registrable Securities then held by each such Holder, and (z) third,
if there remains availability for additional shares of Common Stock to be
included in such registration, pro-rata among any other holders entitled to
participate in such Underwritten Offering, if applicable, based on the
relative number of shares of Common Stock then held by each such holder. If
any Holder disapproves of the terms of any such Underwritten Offering, such
Holder may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the Company and
the managing underwriter(s) delivered on or prior to the time of the pricing
of such offering. Any Registrable Securities withdrawn from such underwriting
shall be excluded and withdrawn from the registration.

 

(iv) The Company shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any
registration initiated by it under this  _Section_ __ _ 2(d)_ at any time in
its sole discretion whether or not any Holder has elected to include
Registrable Securities in such Registration Statement. The Registration
Expenses of such withdrawn registration shall be borne by the Company in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7_ hereof.

3\. _Registration and Underwritten Offering Procedures_. The procedures to be
followed by the Company and each Holder electing to sell Registrable
Securities in a Registration Statement pursuant to this Agreement, and the
respective rights and obligations of the Company and such Holders, with
respect to the preparation, filing and effectiveness of such Registration
Statement and the effectuation of any Underwritten Offering, are as follows:

 

(a) In connection with a Demand Registration, the Company will, at least three
Business Days prior to the anticipated filing of the Registration Statement
and any related Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (other than,
after effectiveness of the Registration Statement, any filing made under the
Exchange Act that is incorporated by reference into the
Registration Statement), (i) furnish to such Holders copies of all such
documents prior to filing and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to
address in each such document when so filed with the Commission such comments
as such Holders reasonably shall propose prior to the filing thereof.

 



147

    

(b) In connection with a Piggyback Registration, Underwritten Piggyback
Offering or a Requested Underwritten Offering, the Company will, at least
three Business Days (or in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement or an
offering that will be made pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement, at
least one Business Day) prior to the anticipated filing of any initial
Registration Statement that identifies the Holders and any related Prospectus
or any amendment or supplement thereto (other than amendments and supplements
that do not materially alter the previous disclosure or do nothing more than
name Holders and provide information with respect thereto), as applicable,
furnish to such Holders copies of any such Registration Statement or related
Prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto that identify the Holders and
any related Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (other than
amendments and supplements that do not materially alter the previous
disclosure or do nothing more than name Holders and provide information with
respect thereto). The Company will also use commercially reasonable efforts
to address in each such document when so filed with the Commission such
comments as such Holders reasonably shall propose prior to the filing thereof.

 

(c) The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, (i) prepare and file with the Commission such
amendments (including post-effective amendments, and supplements to each
Registration Statement and the Prospectus used in connection therewith) as may
be necessary under applicable law to keep such Registration
Statement continuously effective with respect to the disposition of all
Registrable Securities covered thereby for its Effectiveness Period and,
subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement, prepare and file with
the Commission such additional Registration Statements in order to register
for resale under the Securities Act all of the Registrable Securities held by
the Holders, (ii) cause the related Prospectus to be amended or supplemented
by any required prospectus supplement, and as so supplemented or amended to
be filed pursuant to Rule 424, and (iii) respond to any comments received from
the Commission with respect to each Registration Statement or any amendment
thereto and, as promptly as reasonably practicable, provide such Holders true
and complete copies of all correspondence from and to the Commission relating
to such Registration Statement that pertains to such Holders as selling
stockholders but not any comments that would result in the disclosure to such
Holders of material and non-public information concerning the Company.

(d) The Company will comply in all material respects with the provisions of
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act with respect to the Registration
Statements and the disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by each
Registration Statement.

 

(e) The Company will notify such Holders who are included in a Registration
Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable: (i)(A) when a Prospectus or
any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment to a Registration
Statement in which such Holder is included has been filed; (B) when the
Commission notifies the Company whether there will be a "review" of
the applicable Registration Statement and whenever the Commission comments in
writing on such Registration Statement (in which case the Company shall
provide true and complete copies thereof and all written responses thereto to
each of such Holders that pertain to such Holders as selling stockholders);
and (C) with respect to each applicable Registration

 



148

    

 Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto, when the same has been
declared effective; (ii) of any request by the Commission or any other federal
or state governmental authority for amendments or supplements to such
Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional information that
pertains to such Holders as sellers of Registrable Securities; (iii) of the
issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of
such Registration Statement covering any or all of the Registrable Securities
or the initiation of any Proceedings for that purpose; (iv) of the receipt by
the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of
the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the Registrable
Securities for sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation or threatening of
any Proceeding for such purpose; and (v) of the occurrence of any event or
passage of time that makes any statement made in such Registration Statement
or Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated
therein by reference untrue in any material respect or that requires any
revisions to such Registration Statement, Prospectus or other documents so
that, in the case of such Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as the
case may be, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no notice by the
Company shall be required pursuant to this clause (v) in the event that the
Company either promptly files a prospectus supplement to update the Prospectus
or a Current Report on Form 8-K or other appropriate Exchange Act report that
is incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement, which, in
either case, contains the requisite information that results in such
Registration Statement no longer containing any untrue statement of material
fact or omitting to state a material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

(f) The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid the
issuance of or, if issued, obtain the withdrawal of (i) any order suspending
the effectiveness of a Registration Statement, or (ii) any suspension of the
qualification (or exemption from qualification) of any of the Registrable
Securities for sale in any jurisdiction, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, or if any such order or suspension is made effective during any
Blackout Period or Suspension Period, as promptly as reasonably practicable
after such Blackout Period or Suspension Period is over.

(g) During the Effectiveness Period, the Company will furnish to each such
Holder, without charge, at least one conformed copy of each Registration
Statement and each amendment thereto and all exhibits to the extent requested
by such Holder (including those incorporated by reference) promptly after the
filing of such documents with the Commission; _provided_ , that the Company
will not have any obligation to provide any document pursuant to this clause
(g) that is available on the Commissions EDGAR system.

 

(h) The Company will promptly deliver to each Holder, without charge, as many
copies of each Prospectus or Prospectuses (including each form of prospectus)
authorized by the Company for use and each amendment or supplement thereto as
such Holder may reasonably request during the Effectiveness Period. Subject to
the terms of this Agreement, including Section 10(b), the Company consents to
the use of such Prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto by each of
the selling Holders in connection with the offering and sale of the
Registrable Securities covered by such Prospectus and any amendment or
supplement thereto.

 



149

    

(i) The Company will cooperate with such Holders to facilitate the timely
preparation and delivery of certificates representing Registrable Securities
to be delivered to a transferee pursuant to a Registration Statement, which
certificates shall be free of all restrictive legends indicating that the
Registrable Securities are unregistered or unqualified for resale under the
Securities Act, Exchange Act or other applicable securities laws, and to
enable such Registrable Securities to be in such denominations and registered
in such names as any such Holder may request in writing. In connection
therewith, if required by the Companys transfer agent, the Company will
promptly, after the Effective Date of the Registration Statement, cause an
opinion of counsel as to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement to
be delivered to and maintained with its transfer agent, together with any
other authorizations, certificates and directions required by the transfer
agent which authorize and direct the transfer agent to issue such Registrable
Securities without any such legend upon sale by the Holder of such
Registrable Securities under the Registration Statement.

(j) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section 3(e)(v), as
promptly as reasonably practicable, the Company will prepare a supplement or
amendment, including a post-effective amendment, if required by applicable
law, to the affected Registration Statement or a supplement to the related
Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein
by reference, and file any other required document so that, as thereafter
delivered, no Registration Statement nor any Prospectus will contain
an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 

(k) With respect to Underwritten Offerings, (i) the right of any Holder to
include such Holders Registrable Securities in an Underwritten Offering
shall be conditioned upon such Holders participation in such underwriting and
the inclusion of such Holders Registrable Securities in the underwriting to
the extent provided herein, (ii) each Holder participating in such
Underwritten Offering agrees to enter into an underwriting agreement in
customary form and sell such Holders Registrable Securities on the basis
provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Persons entitled to
select the managing underwriter or managing underwriters hereunder and (iii)
each Holder participating in such Underwritten Offering agrees to complete and
execute all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting
agreements and other documents customarily and reasonably required under the
terms of such underwriting arrangements. The Company hereby agrees with each
Holder that, in connection with any Underwritten Offering in accordance with
the terms hereof, it will negotiate in good faith and execute all
indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required
under the terms of such underwriting arrangements, including using all
commercially reasonable efforts to procure customary legal opinions, auditor
"comfort" letters and reports of the independent petroleum engineers of the
Company relating to the oil and gas reserves of the Company included in the
Registration Statement if the Company has had its reserves prepared, audited
or reviewed by an independent petroleum engineer.

(l) For a reasonable period prior to the filing of any Registration
Statement and throughout the Effectiveness Period, the Company will make
available, upon reasonable notice at the Companys principal place of business
or such other reasonable place, for inspection during normal business hours by
a representative or representatives of the selling Holders, the managing
underwriter or managing underwriters and any attorneys or accountants retained
by such selling

 



150

    

 Holders or underwriters, all such financial and other information and books
and records of the Company, and cause the officers, employees, counsel and
independent certified public accountants of the Company to respond to such
inquiries, as shall be reasonably necessary (and in the case of counsel, not
violate an attorney-client privilege in such counsels reasonable belief) to
conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of Section 11 of the
Securities Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that any information that is not
generally publicly available at the time of delivery of such information shall
be kept confidential by such Persons unless disclosure of such information is
required by court or administrative order or, in the opinion of counsel to
such Person, law, in which case, such Person shall be required to give the
Company written notice of the proposed disclosure prior to such disclosure
and, if requested by the Company, assist the Company in seeking to prevent or
limit the proposed disclosure.

(m) In connection with any Requested Underwritten Offering, the Company will
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause appropriate officers and
employees to be available, on a customary basis and upon reasonable notice, to
meet with prospective investors in presentations, meetings and road shows.

(n) Each Holder agrees to furnish to the Company any other information
regarding the Holder and the distribution of such securities as the Company
reasonably determines is required to be included in any Registration Statement
or any Prospectus or prospectus supplement relating to an Underwritten
Offering.

 

(o) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall
not be required to file a Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto)
or effect a Requested Underwritten Offering (or, if the Company has filed a
Shelf Registration Statement and has included Registrable Securities therein,
the Company shall be entitled to suspend the offer and sale of Registrable
Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement) for a period of up to 60
days if (i) the Board determines that a postponement is in the best interest
of the Company and its stockholders generally due to a pending transaction
involving the Company (including a pending securities offering by the
Company), (ii) the Board determines such registration would render the Company
unable to comply with applicable securities laws or (iii) the Board determines
such registration would require disclosure of material information that the
Company has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential (any
such period, a "Blackout Period"); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall any Blackout Period together with any Suspension Period exceed an
aggregate of 120 days in any 12-month period.

(p) In connection with an Underwritten Offering, the Company shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to provide to each Holder named as a selling
securityholder in any Registration Statement a copy of any auditor "comfort"
letters, customary legal opinions or reports of the independent petroleum
engineers of the Company relating to the oil and gas reserves of the Company,
in each case that have been provided to the managing underwriter or managing
underwriters in connection with the Underwritten Offering, not later than the
Business Day prior to the effective date of such Registration Statement.



 



151

    

4\. _Standstill_. At any time that the Company is engaged in an
Underwritten Offering of its securities (on its own behalf, on behalf of
selling Holders or both), no Holder participating in such Underwritten
Offering will Transfer any Registrable Securities on any securities exchange
or in the over-the-counter or any other public trading market for whatever
period of time the Company (upon the recommendation of its underwriters)
requests by written notice to the Holder; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(excluding the Companys initial public offering) such request shall not be
for a period extending longer than 90 days after the later of (a) the
effective date of the registration statement relating to such Underwritten
Offering, and (b) the date of the underwriting agreement relating to such
Underwritten Offering, and this _Section_ __ _ 4_ shall not limit any
Holders right to include Registrable Securities in any such Underwritten
Offering pursuant to any demand or piggyback registration rights, as
applicable, that any Holder may have pursuant to this Agreement.

 

5\. _Merger Lockup Period_. Consistent with the provisions of the Transaction
Agreement, notwithstanding anything in his Agreement to the contrary, the
Schlumberger Parties shall not be entitled to the registration rights and
other rights conferred by this Agreement until following the expiration of the
Lockup Period.

 

6\. _No Inconsistent Agreements; Additional Rights_. The Company shall not
hereafter enter into, and is not currently a party to, any agreement with
respect to its securities that is inconsistent in any material respect with
the rights granted to the Holders by this Agreement.

 

7\. _Registration Expenses_. All Registration Expenses incident to the
Parties performance of or compliance with their respective obligations under
this Agreement or otherwise in connection with any Demand Registration,
Requested Underwritten Offering, Piggyback Registration or Underwritten
Piggyback Offering (in each case, excluding any Selling Expenses) shall
be borne by the Company, whether or not any Registrable Securities are sold
pursuant to a Registration Statement. " _Registration Expenses_ " shall
include, without limitation, (a) all registration and filing fees
(including fees and expenses (i) with respect to filings required to be made
with the Trading Market and (ii) in compliance with applicable state
securities or "Blue Sky" laws), (b) printing expenses (including expenses of
printing certificates for Company Securities and of printing Prospectuses if
the printing of Prospectuses is reasonably requested by a Holder of
Registrable Securities included in the Registration Statement), (c) messenger,
telephone and delivery expenses, (d) fees and disbursements of counsel,
auditors, accountants and independent petroleum engineers for the Company, (e)
Securities Act liability insurance, if the Company so desires such insurance,
(f) fees and expenses of all other Persons retained by the Company in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (g) fees and disbursements of one counsel for the Sponsoring
Holders whose Registrable Securities are included in a Registration
Statement, which counsel shall be selected by the holders of a majority of the
Registrable Securities held by the Sponsoring Holders included in such
Registration Statement, and (h) all expenses relating to marketing the sale
of the Registrable Securities, including expenses related to conducting a
"road show." In addition, the Company shall be responsible for all of its
expenses incurred in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including expenses payable to third parties
and including all salaries and expenses of their officers and employees
performing legal or accounting duties), the expense of any annual audit and
the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the listing of the

152

    

8\. _Indemnification_.

 

(a) The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each Holder, its Affiliates
and each of their respective direct and indirect partners (including partners
of partners and stockholders and members of partners), members, stockholders,
officers, directors, employees and any agent thereof (collectively, "Holder
Indemnified Persons"), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or
several, costs (including, without limitation, reasonable costs of preparation
and reasonable attorneys fees of a single counsel representing all Holder
Indemnified Persons or, if the representation of all Holder Indemnified
Persons by the same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable standards
of professional conduct, then as many counsel as may be needed under such
standards of professional conduct to represent all Holder Indemnified
Persons) and expenses, judgments, taxes, fines, penalties, diminution in
value, interest, settlements or other amounts of any kind or nature whatsoever
(including all amounts paid in investigation, defense or settlement of the
foregoing and consequential damages) arising from any and all claims, demands,
actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, in which any Holder Indemnified Person may be involved, or is
threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, under the Securities Act
or otherwise (collectively, "Losses"), as incurred, arising out of or relating
to any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any
Registration Statement under which any Registrable Securities were registered,
in any preliminary prospectus (if the Company authorized the use of such
preliminary prospectus prior to the Effective Date), or in any summary or
final prospectus or free writing prospectus (if such free writing prospectus
was authorized for use by the Company) or in any amendment or supplement
thereto (if used during the period the Company is required to keep the
Registration Statement current), or arising out of, based upon or resulting
from the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be liable to
any Holder Indemnified Person to the extent that any such claim arises out of,
is based upon or results from an untrue or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission made in such Registration Statement, such
preliminary, summary or final prospectus or free writing prospectus or such
amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder
Indemnified Person or any underwriter specifically for use in the preparation
thereof. The Company shall notify the Holders promptly of the institution,
threat or assertion of any Proceeding of which the Company is aware in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This
indemnity shall be in addition to any liability the Company may otherwise have
and shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation
made by or on behalf of such Holder Indemnified Person or any indemnified
party and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such Holder.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Section 8 shall
survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement indefinitely.

(b) In connection with any Registration Statement in which a
Holder participates, such Holder shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify
and hold harmless the Company, its Affiliates and each of their respective
officers, directors and any agent thereof, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, from and against any and all Losses as incurred, arising out
of or relating to any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in any such Registration Statement, in any preliminary prospectus
(if used prior to the Effective Date 

 



153

    

 of such Registration Statement), or in any summary or final prospectus or
free writing prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto (if used
during the period the Company is required to keep the Registration Statement
current), or arising out of, based upon or resulting from the omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, but only to the extent
that the same are made in reliance and in conformity with information relating
to the Holder furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder for use
therein. This indemnity shall be in addition to any liability such Holder may
otherwise have and shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or any indemnified party. In
no event shall the liability of any selling Holder hereunder be greater in
amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such Holder from the
sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification
obligation

 

(c) Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall (i) give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which
it seeks indemnification and (ii) unless in such indemnified partys
reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and
indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim or there may
be reasonable defenses available to the indemnified party that are different
from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, permit such
indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such defense is assumed, the
indemnifying party shall not be subject to any liability for any settlement
made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent will not
be unreasonably withheld). Failure to give prompt written notice to an
indemnifying party pursuant to this clause (c) shall not release the
indemnifying party from its obligations hereunder.

 

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is held by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with
respect to any Losses referred to herein, the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall to the extent permitted
by applicable law contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
indemnified party as a result of such Losses (i) in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the
Holders, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not
permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the
relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and of the
indemnified party, on the other, in connection with the untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact
that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the
indemnified party shall be determined by a court of law by reference to, among
other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied
by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct
or prevent such statement or omission; _provided_ , that in no event shall any
contribution by a Holder hereunder exceed the net proceeds from the offering
received by such Holder.

9\. _Facilitation of Sales Pursuant to Rule 144_. To the extent it shall
be required to do so under the Exchange Act, the Company shall timely file
the reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act or the
Securities Act (including the reports under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the
Exchange Act referred to in subparagraph (c)(1) of Rule 144), and shall take
such further action as any Holder may reasonably request, all to the extent
required from time to time to enable the Holders to sell Registrable
Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the
limitations of the exemption provided by Rule 144. Upon the request of any
Holder in connection with a sale of such Holders Registrable Securities
pursuant to Rule 144, the Company shall deliver to such Holder a
written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements.

10\. _Miscellaneous_.

 

(a) Remedies. In the event of actual or potential breach by the Company of any
of its obligations under this Agreement, each Holder, in addition to being
entitled to exercise all rights granted by law and under this Agreement,
including recovery of damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its
rights under this Agreement. The Company agrees that monetary damages would
not provide adequate compensation for any losses incurred by reason of a
breach by it of any of the provisions of this Agreement and further agrees
that, in the event of any action for specific performance in respect of such
breach, it shall waive the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.

(b) Discontinued Disposition. Each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of a
notice from the Company of the occurrence of any event of the kind described
in clauses (ii) through (v) of Section 3(e), such Holder will forthwith
discontinue disposition of such Registrable Securities under the Registration
Statement until such Holders receipt of the copies of the supplemental
Prospectus or amended Registration Statement as contemplated by Section 3(j)
or until it is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the
applicable Prospectus may be resumed, and, in either case, has received
copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated or
deemed to be incorporated by reference in such Prospectus or Registration
Statement (a "Suspension Period"). The Company may provide appropriate stop
orders to enforce the provisions of this Section 10(b).

(c) Amendments and Waivers. No provision of this Agreement may be waived or
amended except in a written instrument signed by the Company and Holders that
hold a majority of the Registrable Securities as of the date of such waiver or
amendment; _provided_ , that any waiver or amendment that would have a
disproportionate adverse effect on a Holder relative to the other Holders
shall require the consent of such Holder. The Company shall provide prior
notice to all Holders of any proposed waiver or amendment. No waiver of any
default with respect to any provision, condition or requirement of this
Agreement shall be deemed to be a continuing waiver in the future or a waiver
of any subsequent default or a waiver of any other provision, condition or
requirement hereof, nor shall any delay or omission of any Party to exercise
any right hereunder in any manner impair the exercise of any such right.

(d) Notices. Any and all notices or other communications or deliveries
required or permitted to be provided hereunder shall be in writing and shall
be deemed given and effective on the earliest of (i) the date of transmission,
if such notice or communication is delivered via electronic mail as specified
in this Section 10(d) prior to 5:00 p.m. in the time zone of the receiving
party on any Business Day, (ii) the Business Day after the date of
transmission, if such notice or communication is delivered via electronic
mail as specified in this Agreement later than 5:00 p.m. in the time zone of
the receiving party on any date, (iii) the Business Day following the date of

 mailing, if sent by nationally recognized overnight courier service or (iv)
upon actual receipt by the Party to whom such notice is required to be given.
The address for such notices and communications shall be as follows:

  If to any Person who is then the registered Holder: |  | To the
address of such Holder as indicated on the signature page of this Agreement
or, if different, as it appears in the applicable register for the Registrable
Securities or as may be designated in writing by such Holder in accordance
with this Section 10(d). 
 

(e) _Successors and Assigns._ This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors,
administrators, successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns.
Except as provided in this Section 10(e), this Agreement, and any rights or
obligations hereunder, may not be assigned without the prior written consent
of the Company and the Holders. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to
the contrary, the rights of a Holder pursuant to this Agreement with respect
to all or any portion of its Registrable Securities may be assigned without
such consent (but only with all related obligations) with respect to such
Registrable Securities (and any Registrable Securities issued as a dividend or
other distribution with respect to, in exchange for or in replacement of
such Registrable Securities) by such Holder to a transferee of such
Registrable Securities; _provided_ (i) the Company is, within a reasonable
time after such Transfer, furnished with written notice of the name and
address of such transferee or assignee and the Registrable Securities with
respect to which such registration rights are being assigned and (ii) such
transferee or assignee agrees in writing to be bound by and subject to the
terms set forth in this Agreement. The Company may not assign its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Holders.

(f) _No Third Party Beneficiaries. _ Nothing in this Agreement, whether
express or implied, shall be construed to give any Person, other than the
parties hereto or their respective successors and permitted assigns, any legal
or equitable right, remedy, claim or benefit under or in respect of this
Agreement.

 



156

    

(g) _Execution and Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an
original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
Agreement. In the event that any signature is delivered by electronic mail,
such signature shall create a valid binding obligation of the Party executing
(or on whose behalf such signature is executed) the same with the same force
and effect as if such signature delivered by electronic mail were the original
thereof.

 

(h) _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. This
Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
internal laws of the State of Delaware. Each of the Parties irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware and the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and
the appellate courts therefrom for the purpose of any suit, action,
proceeding or judgment relating to or arising out of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Service of process in connection with any
such suit, action or proceeding may be served on each Party anywhere in the
world by the same methods as are specified for the giving of notices under
this Agreement. Each of the Parties irrevocably waives any objection to the
laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such courts
and irrevocably waives any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. EACH OF
THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO REQUEST A TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY LITIGATION WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT AND REPRESENTS THAT COUNSEL HAS
BEEN CONSULTED SPECIFICALLY AS TO THIS WAIVER.

(i) _Cumulative Remedies._ The remedies provided herein are cumulative and
not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

(j) _Severability._ If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal,
void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions set forth herein shall remain in full force and effect and shall
in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and the Parties shall use
their reasonable efforts to find and employ an alternative means to achieve
the same or substantially the same result as that contemplated by such term,
provision, covenant or restriction. It is hereby stipulated and declared to be
the intention of the Parties that they would have executed the remaining
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement without
including any of such that may be hereafter declared invalid, illegal, void or
unenforceable.

(k) _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among
the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior
contracts or agreements with respect to the subject matter hereof and the
matters addressed or governed hereby, whether oral or written.

(l) _Termination._ Except for Section 8, this Agreement shall terminate as to
any Holder, when all Registrable Securities held by such Holder no longer
constitute Registrable Securities.
