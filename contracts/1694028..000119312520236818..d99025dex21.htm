provide adequate compensation for any losses incurred by reason of a breach by it of any of the provisions of this Agreement and further agrees that, in the event of any action for specific performance in respect of such breach, it shall waive the
defense that a remedy at law would be adequate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(b) Discontinued Disposition. Each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of a notice from the

Holder&#146;s receipt of the copies of the supplemental Prospectus or amended Registration Statement as contemplated by Section&nbsp;3(j) or until it is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the applicable Prospectus may be resumed, and,
in either case, has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in such Prospectus or Registration Statement (a &#147;<B>Suspension Period</B>&#148;). The Company may
provide appropriate stop orders to enforce the provisions of this Section&nbsp;10(b). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(c) Amendments and Waivers. No provision of this

would have a disproportionate adverse effect on a Holder relative to the other Holders shall require the consent of such Holder. The Company shall provide prior notice to all Holders of any proposed waiver or amendment. No waiver of any default with
respect to any provision, condition or requirement of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a continuing waiver in the future or a waiver of any subsequent default or a waiver of any other provision, condition or requirement hereof, nor shall any
delay or omission of any Party to exercise any right hereunder in any manner impair the exercise of any such right. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:9%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(d) Notices. Any and
