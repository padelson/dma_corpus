This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of August 26,
2012, is by and among Hertz Global Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), HDTMS, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company").

  


 

  

W I T N E S S E T H:

  


 

  

WHEREAS, Merger Sub has agreed to commence a cash tender offer (as it may be
amended from time to time, the "Offer") to acquire all of the outstanding
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (including,
except as the context otherwise requires, the associated Company Rights (as
defined below), the "Company Common Stock") for $87.50 per share (such amount,
or any higher amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer, being the "Offer
Price"), net to the seller in cash, without interest, and, following
completion of the Offer, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the
"Merger"), with the Company surviving that Merger, and each share of Company
Common Stock that is not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer (other
than such shares held in treasury of the Company or owned by Merger Sub,
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent or the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and other than Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration (as defined below), in each case
upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement;

  


 

  

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have (i) determined that it is in the best interests of their
respective companies and their stockholders to enter into this Agreement and
consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby (collectively, the "Transactions") and (ii) approved and declared
advisable this Agreement and the Transactions; and

(i) If any portion of the Offer Price is to be paid to a person other than the
person in whose name the tendered shares of Company Common Stock are
registered, the amount of any stock transfer or other similar Taxes (whether

payable on account of such issuance or transfer to such other person shall be
deducted from the Offer Price for the exchange of such shares of Company
Common Stock in the Offer, unless evidence satisfactory to Merger Sub of the

Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or
officers should be discovered by any of the parties hereto which should be set
forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Schedule 14D-9, so that such
document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto, and
the Company shall promptly file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information and, to the extent required by Law,

or supplements to the Schedule 14D-9 or for additional information and shall
supply Parent and Merger Sub with copies of all correspondence (including a
written summary of any oral communications) between the Company or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the
other hand, with respect to the Schedule 14D-9. The Company shall respond

listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of all record
holders of shares of Company Common Stock and lists of securities positions of
shares of Company Common Stock held in stock depositories, in each case
accurate and complete as of the most recent practicable date, and shall
provide to Parent such additional information (including updated lists of
record holders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such
other assistance as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the
Offer. Subject to the requirements of applicable Laws, and except for such
steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to consummate the Transactions, Parent and Merger Sub
shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels,
listings and files in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, shall use
such information only in connection with the Transactions and, if this
Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request, deliver, and shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives to
deliver, to the Company (or destroy) all copies and any extracts or summaries
from such information then in their possession or control. In addition, in
connection with the Offer, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub to disseminate the
Offer Documents to holders of shares of Company Common Stock held in or
subject to any Company Benefit Plan and to permit such holders of shares of
the Company Common Stock to tender such shares in the Offer.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary but subject to
Section 8.04, following the time directors designated by Merger Sub are
elected or appointed to the Board of Directors of the Company in accordance
with this Section 1.03 and prior to the Effective Time, the affirmative vote
of a majority of the directors then in office not so elected or appointed by

counsel to the Company) and other advisors at the expense of the Company as
determined by the Continuing Directors and will have the authority to
institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce performance of this
Agreement or any of the Company's rights hereunder. The Company will indemnify

SECTION 1.04. Top-Up Option. (a) The Company hereby grants to Parent and
Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the "Top-Up Option"), subject to the terms
and conditions hereof, to purchase from the Company that number of shares of
Company Common Stock (the "Top-Up Shares") equal to the lowest number of
shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries (including Merger
Sub) at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, shall constitute one share
of Company Common Stock more than 90% of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding, at an exercise price per Top-Up Share equal to the
Offer Price; provided that, the Merger Sub may, and at the request of the
Company, Merger Sub shall (and at the request of the Company, Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to) exercise the Top-Up Option, only if (i) the exercise of
the Top-Up Option and the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Shares shall not
be prohibited by any Law or Restraint, (ii) the Top-Up Option is exercisable
for not more than the number of shares of Company Common Stock in excess of
the shares of Company Common Stock authorized but unissued (and not reserved
for issuance) at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, and (iii) Merger
Sub irrevocably commits upon exercise of the Top-Up Option to promptly effect
a short-form merger pursuant to Section 1.05 hereof following such exercise.

  


 

  

(b) The Top-Up Option shall only be exercisable once, in whole and not in
part, promptly after the acceptance for payment by Merger Sub of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer representing at least such number
of shares of Company Common Stock as shall satisfy the Minimum Tender
Condition; provided that, the Top-Up Option shall terminate upon the earlier
of (i) the termination of this Agreement and (ii) the Effective Time.

  


 

  

(c) To exercise the Top-Up Option, Parent or Merger Sub shall so notify the
Company in writing and shall set forth in such notice (i) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries (including Merger
Sub) immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, (ii) the manner
in which it intends to pay the applicable purchase price, (iii) the place and
time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares (the "Top-Up
Closing") and (iv) an irrevocable commitment by Merger Sub to promptly effect
a short-form merger pursuant to Section 1.05 hereof following the Top-Up
Closing. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such
notice, notify Parent and Merger Sub in writing of the number of shares of
Company Common Stock then outstanding and, based on the information specified
in the notice of Parent or Merger Sub, the number of Top-Up Shares. At the
Top-Up Closing, (A) Parent or Merger Sub shall pay to the Company the
aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Shares, at the election of
Parent and Merger Sub, (x) in cash or (y) by paying in cash an amount equal to
not less than the aggregate par value of such Top-Up Shares and delivery of a
promissory note for the balance of such aggregate price, which promissory note
shall (1) be due on the first anniversary of the Top-Up Closing, (2) bear
simple interest of five percent per annum, payable quarterly, (3) have full
recourse to Parent, (4) be able to be prepaid at any time, in whole or in
part, without premium or penalty and (5) provide that the unpaid principal and
accrued interest thereunder shall immediately become due and payable (x) in
the event that Merger Sub fails to make any payment of interest as provided
therein and such failure continues for a period of 30 days or (y) upon the
occurrence of customary bankruptcy or insolvency events with respect to Merger
Sub and (B) the Company shall cause to be issued and delivered to Merger Sub a
certificate representing the Top-Up Shares. The Board of Directors of the
Company has determined that such consideration for the Top-Up Shares is
adequate in accordance with the DGCL and has otherwise taken all steps
necessary such that upon their issuance and delivery in accordance with this
Section 1.04(c), the Top-Up Shares shall be validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable.

(d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Shares will not be
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Securities Act"), and will be issued
in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a
public offering. Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby represents and warrants
to the Company that each of Parent and Merger Sub is, and will be upon the
purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an "accredited investor," as such term is
defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Parent and
Merger Sub agree that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired
upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Parent or
Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale
in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the
Securities Act).

  


 

  

(e) Any dilutive impact on the value of the shares of Company Common Stock as
a result of the issuance of the Top-Up Shares and the consideration for the
Top-Up Shares will not be taken into account in any determination of the fair
value of any Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL") as contemplated by Section 2.03.

  


 

  

SECTION 1.05. Short-Form Merger. If, after the consummation of the Offer and
any subsequent offering period and the exercise, if any, of the Top-Up Option,
the shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent and its
Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) represent at least 90% of the then
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
and the Company shall, execute and deliver such documents and instruments and
take such other actions as Parent or Merger Sub may request in order to cause
the Merger to be completed as promptly as reasonably practicable as provided
in Section 253 of the DGCL.

  


 

  

SECTION 1.06. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, at
the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company.
Following the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving entity in the
Merger (the "Surviving Entity") and shall succeed to and assume all the rights
and obligations of the Company and Merger Sub in accordance with the DGCL.

Inc.", (ii) that the provisions of the certificate of incorporation of Merger
Sub relating to the incorporator of Merger Sub shall be omitted and (iii) as

Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock

  


 

  

SECTION 2.01. Effect on Capital Stock. (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or any holder of any of the following securities:

  


 

  

(i) subject to Section 2.01(c), each share of Company Common Stock that is
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Dissenting Shares and shares to be canceled in accordance with Section
2.01(a)(ii)) shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price net
to the seller in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"), subject
to any withholding of Tax pursuant to Section 2.02(b) or Section 2.02(g);

  


 

  

(ii) each share of Company Common Stock that immediately prior to the
Effective Time is owned by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company (as treasury stock
or otherwise) or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be canceled
without any consideration being exchanged therefor; and

  


 

  

(iii) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Entity.

  


 

  

(b) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article II shall no longer
be outstanding, and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, a "Certificate") or
book-entry share (each, a "Book-Entry Share") previously representing any such
shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall have been converted
pursuant to this Section 2.01.

  


 

  

(c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been increased,
decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares
or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other
similar change in capitalization, the Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately and proportionately adjusted to reflect such reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock
split or other similar change in capitalization.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.02. Exchange of Certificates. (a) Exchange Agent. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, on
behalf of Merger Sub, with a bank or trust company designated by Parent with
the Company's prior consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed (the "Exchange Agent"), in trust for the benefit of the holders of
Company Common Stock for exchange in accordance with this Article II through
the Exchange Agent, immediately available funds sufficient to pay, and Parent
shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay, the aggregate Merger
Consideration (such aggregate Merger Consideration, being hereinafter referred
to as the "Exchange Fund").

(b) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
and in any event within five business days thereafter, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of shares of Company Common
Stock whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(i): (i) a letter
of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which shall have such
other provisions as Parent and the Company may agree) and (ii) instructions
for use in surrendering the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for cash comprising the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Book-Entry Share or a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed, and/or such other documents as may be
reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Book-Entry Share
or Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check for
the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
the provisions of this Article II, and the Book-Entry Share or Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, a check for the proper amount of cash
comprising the Merger Consideration shall be issued to a person other than the
person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if, upon
presentation to the Exchange Agent, such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer. In such case, the amount
of any stock transfer or other similar Taxes (whether imposed on the
registered holder(s), or such other person, or otherwise) payable on account
of such issuance or transfer to such other person shall be deducted from the
amount otherwise payable pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence,
unless evidence satisfactory to the Exchange Agent of the payment of such
Taxes, or exemption therefrom, is submitted. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this Section 2.02(b), each Book-Entry Share and Certificate shall be deemed
at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
upon such surrender the Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid or will
accrue for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock on the
Merger Consideration payable to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to
this Article II.

  


 

  

(c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All cash paid upon
the surrender for exchange of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates in accordance
with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Book-Entry Shares or Certificates, and at the
close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Entity
of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.02(d), if, at
any time after the Effective Time, Book-Entry Shares or Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock on the date that
is twelve months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon
demand. Any holders of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent
with respect to the Merger Consideration. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any
person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common
Stock five years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately
prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claim or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  


 

  

(e) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis;
provided, that (i) no such investment gains or losses thereon shall affect the
amounts payable to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
this Agreement, (ii) following any losses in the Exchange Fund, Parent shall
promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent to the extent such
losses result in the amount of cash in the Exchange Fund being less than the
amounts that remain payable to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
under this Agreement and (iii) such investments shall be in (A) short-term
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America with maturities
of no more than 30 days, (B) in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
or better by Moody's Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Financial
Services LLC, respectively or (C) short-term certificates of deposit with
maturities of no more than thirty days or overnight bank repurchase
agreements, in each case, of commercial banks with capital exceeding $5
billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are
then publicly available). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose, except as provided in this Agreement.

  


 

  

(f) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably requested
by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable and
customary amount as Parent may reasonably request as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent
with respect to such Certificate, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(g) Withholding. The Exchange Agent, Parent, the Company and the Surviving
Entity shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Incentive Awards, or any person to whom any
payment is required to be made pursuant to Section 2.04 hereof, such amounts
as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Exchange Agent, Parent, the Company or the Surviving Entity, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of shares of the Company Common Stock or Company Incentive
Awards, or to those persons who are entitled to any such payments, in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.03. Dissenters' Rights. Notwithstanding any other provision
contained in this Agreement, no shares of Company Common Stock that are issued
and outstanding as of the Effective Time and that are held by a stockholder
who has properly exercised such stockholder's appraisal rights in respect of
such shares (any such shares being referred to herein as "Dissenting Shares")
under Section 262 of the DGCL shall be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01 and instead shall be entitled
to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL (unless and until
such stockholder shall have failed to timely perfect, or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost, such stockholder's right to dissent from the
Merger under the DGCL) and to receive such consideration as may be determined
to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to
the requirements of the DGCL. The Company shall (i) give Parent prompt notice
of any notice or demand for appraisal or payment for shares of Company Common
Stock or any withdrawals of such demands received by the Company and (ii) give
Parent the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demands and not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer
to settle or otherwise negotiate any such demands.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.04. Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards. (a) As of the
Acceptance Time, by virtue of the consummation of the Offer and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof, each option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock granted to employees or directors of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries under any Company Benefit Plan that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, whether vested or unvested
(collectively, the "Company Options") shall be cancelled and converted into
the right of the holder thereof to receive from the Parent, and Parent shall
pay or cause to be paid to each such holder of Company Options, at the
Acceptance Time, a lump sum cash payment equal to an amount in cash equal to
the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Option immediately prior to the Acceptance Time and (ii) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share
of Company Common Stock of such Company Option immediately prior to the
Acceptance Time, provided that if any holder of a Company Option notifies the
Company, in writing, at least 10 business days prior to the Acceptance Time of
his or her irrevocable election to have such Company Options assumed by Parent
as of the Acceptance Time, each such Company Option held by such person shall
be converted into an option (an "Adjusted Option") to purchase, on the same
terms and conditions as applied to each such Company Option immediately prior
to the Acceptance Time, the number of whole shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Parent (the "Parent Common Stock") that is equal to the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time multiplied by the Incentive Award
Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share), at an exercise price
per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal
to the exercise price of each such share of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Option immediately prior to the Acceptance Time divided by the
Incentive Award Exchange Ratio. For purposes of this Agreement, the "Incentive
Award Exchange Ratio" shall be the quotient of (x) divided by (y), where (x)
is the per share closing price of the Company Common Stock at the Acceptance
Time (or, if such date is not a trading day, the trading day immediately
preceding the Acceptance Time) on the NYSE and (y) is the per share closing
price of Parent Common Stock at the Acceptance Time (or, if such date is not a
trading day, the trading day immediately preceding the Acceptance Time) on the
NYSE.

(b) As of the Acceptance Time, each grant of performance or performance unit
share awards outstanding as of the Acceptance Time (each, a "Performance Share
Award") shall, by virtue of the consummation of the Offer and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, immediately accelerate and vest, and
the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive in lieu of such Performance
Share Award from Parent and Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the holder
thereof, at the Acceptance Time, a lump sum cash payment equal to (x) the
Merger Consideration multiplied by (y) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock that would be deliverable to the holder under such Performance Share
Award if the applicable management objectives were met or exceeded.

  


 

  

(c) As of the Acceptance Time, each restricted stock unit of Company Common
Stock granted to any employee or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under a Company Benefit Plan, including for the avoidance of
doubt, each deferred stock unit granted to non-employee directors or to
executives pursuant to individual deferral arrangements, whether or not assets
have been set aside in any trust to provide for the settlement of such unit,
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time other than the
Performance Share Awards (collectively, the "Company Restricted Stock Units,"
and together with the Company Options and the Performance Share Awards, each,
a "Company Incentive Award") shall, by virtue of the consummation of the Offer
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, immediately
accelerate and vest, be cancelled and converted into the right of the holder
thereof to receive from Parent, and Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to
each such holder of Company Restricted Stock Units at the Acceptance Time, a
lump sum cash payment equal to (x) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (y)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock to which such holder's Company
Restricted Stock Units pertain.

Company's Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation Plan, 2009 Deferred
Compensation Plan Amended and Restated Retirement Plan and any individual
deferral agreements with employees and directors (collectively, the "Deferred
Compensation Plans") will be paid out in cash to participants therein or
employees or directors entitled thereunder, by Parent, or Parent's designee,
at the Acceptance Time.

  


 

  

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall each take all
such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause any disposition of
shares of Company Common Stock or any Company Incentive Awards (including
derivative securities with respect to such Company Incentive Awards), and any
acquisition of Parent Common Stock or any derivative securities in respect of
such Company Incentive Awards in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, including any such actions specified in
the No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden,

any cautionary language set forth in any risk factor section or forward-
looking statements contained therein) or (ii) as disclosed in the disclosure
schedule (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") delivered by the Company to
Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (which Company Disclosure

necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure
requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more
representations or warranties contained in this Article III, or to one or more
of the Company's covenants contained herein, provided, however, that
disclosure in any section of such schedule shall apply only to the indicated
Section of this Agreement except to the extent that it is reasonably apparent
on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is relevant to another
Section of this Agreement, provided, further, that notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the mere inclusion of an item in such schedule
as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an
admission that such item represents a material exception or material fact,
event or circumstance or that such item has had or would be reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company), the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

extent such concepts are recognized in the applicable jurisdiction) under the
Laws of its jurisdiction of organization. Each has the requisite power and
authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do
business and is in good standing (to the extent such concepts are recognized
in the applicable jurisdiction), in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
the business now conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. True, complete and correct copies of (i) the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company (the "Company Certificate") and the Fifth Amended

SECTION 3.03. Authority; No Violation. (a) The Company has all requisite power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger), subject
only to the requirement, to the extent required by applicable Law, that this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement be adopted and approved by the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Company Stockholder

prior to the date hereof, as of the date of the last such amendment or
superseding filing, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or

(d) The Company has designed a system of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and such system is effective at the reasonable assurance level. The Company
(i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) designed to
ensure that material information relating to the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries is made known to the Company's management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and such controls and
procedures are effective, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to the Company's outside auditors and the
audit committee of the Company's Board of Directors (and made summaries of
such disclosures available to Parent): (x) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (y) any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.
Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has substantially addressed any such
deficiency, material weakness or fraud. As of the date hereof, there is no
reason to believe that the Company's outside auditors, chief executive officer
and chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and
attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when
required.

  


 

  

(e) Each of the principal executive officer and the principal financial
officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer and each
former principal financial officer of the Company, as applicable) has made all
certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations
of the SEC promulgated thereunder (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") with respect to
the Company SEC Reports, and the statements contained in such certifications
were true and correct on the date such certifications were made. For purposes
of this Section 3.05(e) "principal executive officer" and "principal financial
officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any outstanding
"extensions of credit" or has arranged any outstanding "extensions of credit"
to directors or executive officers in violation of Section 402 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  


 

  

(f) Since January 1, 2010, (i) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any of their respective directors,
officers, employees, auditors, accountants or Representatives has received or
otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices
and (ii) no attorney representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether or not employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has
reported evidence of a material violation of securities Laws, breach of
fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof or to the chief executive
officer or general counsel of the Company in accordance with Section 307 of

SECTION 5.02. No Solicitation by the Company. (a) Subject to Section 5.02(h):
From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective
Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 8.01, and except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, the
Company shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to and shall not
authorize or permit its and their respective directors, officers, employees,
investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other
advisors, agents or representatives (collectively "Representatives") to,
directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or
knowingly encourage the submission or making of any Company Competing
Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
knowingly furnish to any person any material nonpublic information in
furtherance of (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, information furnished
to a current or prospective commercial counterparty (including any customer or
supplier) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the sole purpose of
furthering an existing or prospective commercial arrangement with such person
and, in any event, not in contemplation of any Company Competing Proposal),
any Company Competing Proposal or (iii) enter into any agreement regarding a
Company Competing Proposal. The Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
and its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions or negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with
respect to any Company Competing Proposal and promptly request the prompt
return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished,
and the Company shall take all reasonably necessary actions to secure its
rights and ensure the performance of any such person's obligations under any
applicable confidentiality agreement to return or destroy such information.
The Company shall take all actions necessary to enforce its rights under the
provisions of any "standstill" agreement between the Company and any person
(other than Parent), and shall not grant any waiver of, or agree to any
amendment or modification to, any such agreement, to permit such person to
submit a Company Competing Proposal. The Company shall ensure that its
Representatives are aware of the provisions of this Section 5.02, and any
violation of the restrictions contained in this Section 5.02 by its Board of
Directors (including any committee thereof) or its Representatives shall be
deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.02 by the Company.

  


 

  

(b) Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in Section 5.02(a), at any time
prior to the Acceptance Time, if after the date hereof the Company receives an
unsolicited Company Competing Proposal that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel) constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to result in, a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that the failure to take the actions described in clauses (i) and
(ii) below would be inconsistent with the Board of Directors' fiduciary duties
under Delaware Law, and such Company Competing Proposal has not resulted from
the Company breaching its obligations under this Section 5.02, the Company may
(i) furnish nonpublic information to the person making such Company Competing
Proposal, if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information, the
Company receives from such person an executed confidentiality agreement on
terms no more favorable to such person than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations
with such person (and its Representatives) making such Company Competing
Proposal with respect to such Company Competing Proposal; provided that the
Company shall give written notice to Parent after any such determination by
the Company's Board of Directors and before taking any of the actions
described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii). The Company shall promptly
notify Parent (within no more than 48 hours) of the communication or receipt
of any Company Competing Proposal, any request for information that could
reasonably be expected to be related to a Company Competing Proposal, or any
request for discussions or negotiations that could reasonably be expected to
be related to a Company Competing Proposal, indicating, in connection with
such notice, the identity of the person making such Company Competing Proposal
or request and the material terms and conditions thereof. The Company shall
keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis (within no more than 48
hours) of any material developments in the status and terms of any such
Company Competing Proposal or request (including whether such Company
Competing Proposal or request has been withdrawn or rejected and any material
change to the terms thereof) and shall concurrently provide Parent with copies
of any material written information or materials that it provides to the
person making the request therefor that have not been previously provided to
Parent.

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 8.01 and except as otherwise provided for in the
immediately following sentence and Section 5.02(d), neither the Board of
Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify
or modify or publicly propose to withdraw, qualify or modify, in any manner,
the Company Recommendation (a "Company Change of Recommendation"); (ii)
approve or recommend or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Company
Competing Proposal; or (iii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve or recommend, or execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement
in principle, acquisition or other agreement relating to any Company Competing
Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement permitted by Section 5.02(b)
or Section 5.02(h)). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any
time prior to the Acceptance Time and other than in connection with a Company
Competing Proposal (which is addressed in Section 5.02(d)), the Board of
Directors of the Company may make a Company Change of Recommendation if the
Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith after
consultation with the Company's financial advisors and outside legal counsel
that the failure of the Board of Directors of the Company to withdraw, qualify
or modify the Company Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their fiduciary duties to the
Company's stockholders under applicable Law; provided, that the Company has
provided Parent two business days' prior written notice advising Parent that
it intends to take such action and specifying, in reasonable detail, the
reasons for such action.

  


 

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if prior to the
Acceptance Time, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good
faith, after consultation with the Company's financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that a Company Competing Proposal made after the date hereof
that has not resulted from a breach of the Company's obligations under this
Section 5.02 constitutes a Superior Proposal, then the Board of Directors of
the Company shall provide written notice to Parent at least two business days
in advance of making or effecting a Company Change of Recommendation (a
"Notice of Superior Proposal"). A Notice of Superior Proposal shall advise
Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company has received a Superior
Proposal and shall include any information and materials required to be
delivered under Section 5.02(b) that have not yet been provided to Parent
(including the most recent version of any written agreement relating to the
transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal or, if no such agreement
exists, a written summary of the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal). If Parent, within two business days following its receipt
of a Notice of Superior Proposal (the "Notice Period"), makes an offer that,
as determined in good faith by the Company's Board of Directors, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, results in
the applicable Company Competing Proposal no longer being a Superior Proposal,
then the Company shall not make a Company Change of Recommendation with
respect to such Company Competing Proposal and shall have no right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f) as a result of such
Company Competing Proposal. If Parent shall not have made such an offer within
the Notice Period, then the Board of Directors of the Company may make a
Company Change of Recommendation with respect to the Superior Proposal to
which such Notice Period applied and/or may terminate this Agreement to accept
such Superior Proposal pursuant to Section 8.01(f). During the Notice Period,
the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives, including, without
limitation, its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, to negotiate in
good faith with Parent and its Representatives (to the extent Parent desires
to negotiate) with respect to any offer from Parent. Any (i) material
revisions to the terms of a Superior Proposal or (ii) material revisions to a
Company Competing Proposal that the Company's Board of Directors had
determined no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal, shall constitute a new
Company Competing Proposal and shall require the Company to deliver to Parent
a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new Notice Period shall commence
thereafter. Except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section
5.02(d), the Company shall have no right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.01(f).

Board of Directors of the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the
Company's stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent applicable to a Company
Competing Proposal, or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the
Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with any applicable Law; provided, that the Board of Directors of
the Company may not effect a Company Change of Recommendation, unless
permitted to do so by Section 5.02(c) and Section 5.02(d). The Company shall
not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Company Competing Proposal or
Superior Proposal prior to the termination of this Agreement.

similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose
assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 15% of the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (ii) the direct
or indirect acquisition of assets or businesses representing 15% or more of
the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether
pursuant to an acquisition of securities, assets or otherwise; or (iii) the
acquisition of 15% or more of any class of the issued and outstanding equity
or voting securities of the Company.

  


 

  

(g) As used in this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean a bona fide
written Company Competing Proposal (provided, that for purposes of the
definition of Superior Proposal, references to "15%" shall be deemed to be
references to "50%"), which the Board of Directors of the Company determines
in good faith, after consultation with the Company's financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, taking into account all the terms of the Company
Competing Proposal (including, without limitation, the legal, financial and
regulatory aspects of such proposal, the identity of the person making such
proposal and the conditions for completion of such proposal) (i) is more
favorable, from a financial point of view, to the Company's stockholders than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (taking into account any
revised proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement pursuant to
and in accordance with Section 5.02(d)) and the failure of the Board of
Directors of the Company to approve or recommend such Company Competing
Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
(ii) the financing of which is fully committed or reasonably likely to be
obtained and (iii) is reasonably expected to be consummated on a timely basis.

  


 

  

(h) Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in Section 5.02(a), from and
after the date of this Agreement until 11:59 p.m., New York time, on September
25, 2012, the Company and its Representatives may, directly or indirectly (i)
solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage the submission
or making of any Company Competing Proposal and (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any material
nonpublic information in furtherance of any Company Competing Proposal, if,
and only if, prior to so furnishing such information, the Company receives
from such person an executed confidentiality agreement on terms no more
favorable to such person than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement; provided that the Company shall promptly (within no more than 24
hours) provide to Parent any material nonpublic information concerning the
Company or its Subsidiaries, as provided to any such person and that was not
previously provided to Parent. No later than 12:00 noon, New York time, on the
business day after September 26, 2012 (the "No-Shop Start Date"), the Company
shall notify Parent in writing of the identity of each Person that submitted a
Company Competing Proposal prior to the No-Shop Start Date. Notwithstanding
the commencement of the obligations of the Company under Section 5.2(a) on the
No-Shop Start Date, the parties agree that the Company may continue to engage
in the activities described in clause (i) and/or (ii) of this Section 5.2(h)
with respect to each Excluded Party on and after the No-Shop Start Date until
the Acceptance Time, including with respect to any amended or revised proposal
submitted by such Excluded Party on or after the No-Shop Start Date.

(i) As used in this Agreement, the term "Excluded Party" shall mean any
Person, group of Persons or group that includes any Person (so long as such
Person, together with all other members of such group, if any, who were
members of such group or another group that included such Person immediately
prior to the No-Shop Start Date, represent at least 50% of the equity
financing of such group at all times following the No-Shop Start Date and
prior to the termination of this Agreement) from whom the Company or any of
its Representatives has received, after the execution of this Agreement and
prior to the No-Shop Start Date, a Company Competing Proposal that the Board
of Directors of the Company determines, in good faith, prior to or as of the
No-Shop Start Date and after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result
in a Superior Proposal.

SECTION 6.01. Preparation of the Information Statement or Proxy Statement;
Stockholder Meetings. (a) If the Company Stockholder Approval is required by
applicable Law, the Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the Acceptance Time, in accordance with applicable Laws, the Company
Certificate and the Company Bylaws, (i)(A) if Parent notifies the Company that
Parent and Merger Sub shall effect the Company Stockholder Approval by
executing and delivering to the Company an action by written consent
representing a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Parent Stockholder Consent"), prepare and file with the SEC an information
statement relating to such Parent Stockholder Consent (such information
statement, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Information
Statement") or (B) otherwise, prepare and file with the SEC proxy materials
that shall constitute the proxy statement relating to the matters to be
submitted to the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders
Meeting (such proxy statement, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the
"Proxy Statement") and (ii) in each such case, use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Information Statement or the Proxy Statement, as applicable, to
be mailed to its stockholders. If Parent elects to effect the Company
Stockholder Approval by executing an action by written consent, Parent and its
Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) shall promptly execute and deliver to the
Company the Parent Stockholder Consent with respect to all of the shares of
Company Common Stock then owned of record by each of them or with respect to
which any of them have, directly or indirectly, sole voting power. Each of the
Company and Parent will cooperate with each other and respond promptly to any
comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC on the Information Statement or
the Proxy Statement, as applicable. No filing of, or amendment or supplement
to, the Information Statement or the Proxy Statement, as applicable, will be
made by the Company, without providing Parent and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon and giving due consideration to such
comments. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating
to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or
officers, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set
forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Information Statement or the
Proxy Statement, as applicable, so that such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto, and the Company shall promptly file
with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information and, to the extent required by Law, shall disseminate such
amendment or supplement to the stockholders of the Company. The parties shall
notify each other promptly of the receipt of any comments, whether written or
oral, from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or
the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Information
Statement or the Proxy Statement, as applicable, or for additional information
and shall supply each other with copies of all correspondence (including a
written summary of any oral communications) between it or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the
other hand, with respect to the Information Statement or the Proxy Statement,
as applicable.

(b) If the Company Stockholder Approval is required by applicable Law, the
Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Acceptance
Time, take all actions necessary to, as applicable in accordance with clause
(a) above, (i) consummate the actions approved in the Parent Stockholder
Consent or (ii) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders (the "Company Stockholders Meeting"), in each case in accordance
with applicable Laws, the Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws. In
connection with any Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall (A) unless
there has been a Company Change of Recommendation in accordance with Section
5.02(c) and Section 5.02(d), use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval and (B) otherwise comply with all legal
requirements applicable to such meeting. The Company shall include in the
Information Statement or the Proxy Statement, as applicable, the Company
Recommendation, unless there has been a Company Change of Recommendation in
accordance with Section 5.02(c) and Section 5.02(d). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement has been terminated
pursuant to Section 8.01, the Company shall consummate the actions approved in
the Parent Stockholder Consent or submit the Merger and this Agreement for the
approval of its stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting, as
applicable, whether or not a Company Change of Recommendation shall have
occurred or a Company Competing Proposal shall have been publicly announced or
otherwise made known to the Company, its Board of Directors, its
Representatives or its stockholders.

SECTION 6.02. Access to Information; Confidentiality. (a) Subject to
applicable Laws, the Company shall afford to Parent and its Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours during the period from the date
hereof until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the date, if any,
on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01 to all of its
and its Subsidiaries' properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and
records and, during such period, the Company shall furnish to Parent promptly
all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the
other party may reasonably request. Subject to applicable Laws, Parent shall
afford to the Company and its Representatives reasonable access to its
executive officers during normal business hours during the period from the
date hereof until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the date, if
any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01. Each
party shall hold, and shall cause its Representatives to hold, all information
received from the other party, directly or indirectly, in confidence in
accordance with the confidentiality agreement, dated as of August 2, 2012,
between Parent and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the
"Confidentiality Agreement"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party
shall be obligated to provide any such access or information to the extent
that doing so (x) may cause a waiver of an attorney-client privilege or loss
of attorney work product protection, (y) would violate a confidentiality
obligation to any person or (z) would violate any Law applicable to it, its
Subsidiaries or its business. The disclosing party shall be entitled to have
its Representatives present at all times during any inspection pursuant to
this Section 6.02. No access or information provided pursuant to this Section
6.02 will affect any of the representations or warranties of the parties
contained in this Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.02 to the contrary, no party
nor any of its Representatives shall (i) contact or have any discussions with
any of the other party's employees below the level of Executive Vice President
(or, if no such position exists with respect to any particular area of such
other party's organization, its equivalent), unless in each case an employee
of such other party at or above the level of Executive Vice President has (A)
made such employee available or (B) given written consent to discuss with such
employee (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), (ii) subject to Section 6.03(f)(ii), contact or have any discussions
with any of the vendors, licensees, franchisees, landlords or sublandlords
(including any airport authority) or tenants or subtenants of any party or its
Subsidiaries, without prior written consent of the relevant party, not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, (iii) damage any property or
any portion thereof or (iv) perform any onsite procedure or investigation
(including any onsite environmental investigation or study) that involves
physical disturbance or damage to any property or any portions thereof.

  


 

  

(c) No access or information provided pursuant to this Section 6.02 or
information provided or received by any party hereto pursuant to this
Agreement will affect any of the representations or warranties of the parties
hereto contained in this Agreement or the conditions hereunder to the
obligations of the parties hereto.

SECTION 6.03. Reasonable Best Efforts; HSR Filings; Other Actions. (a) Subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Company and Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with each
other in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective, in the most expeditious manner reasonably practicable, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, each of the Company and Parent shall (i) use their
respective reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions set forth in
Article VII and Annex I to be satisfied on a timely basis so as to permit the
consummation and effectiveness of the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably
practicable; (ii) use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, clearances, consents and approvals
from Governmental Authorities (including the HSR Approval) and the making of
all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by any Governmental Authority, as promptly as reasonably
practicable; (iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable following the receipt
thereof, respond to (or properly reduce the scope of) any formal or informal
request for additional information or documentary material received by the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates from any Governmental
Authority whether received prior to or after the date of this Agreement; and
(iv) consult and cooperate with each other and consider in good faith the
views of each other in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions or proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of the Company or Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates in connection with proceedings before any Governmental Authority
with respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. Each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other to the
extent necessary to assist each other in the preparation of its filing or
submission under any such Antitrust Law and, if requested, to promptly amend
or furnish additional information thereunder. Each of the Company and Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to (x) furnish to each other all
information required for any filing or submission under any Antitrust Law and
(y) keep each other reasonably informed with respect to the status of each
action or nonaction, waiver, consent or approval sought from a Governmental
Authority, in each case, in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Company and Parent shall, in
connection with the Offer, the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby, with respect to actions taken on or after the date of this Agreement,
without limitation: (1) promptly notify the other of, and if in writing,
furnish the other with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications,
advise the other of) any communications from or with any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby, (2) permit the other to review and discuss in advance,
and consider in good faith the view of the other in connection with, any
proposed written or oral communication with any Governmental Authority, (3)
not participate in any substantive meeting or have any substantive
communication with any Governmental Authority unless it has given the other
party a reasonable opportunity to consult with it in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other the
opportunity to attend and participate therein, (4) furnish the other party's
outside legal counsel with copies of all filings and communications between it
and any such Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby; provided that such material may be redacted
as necessary (I) to comply with contractual arrangements, (II) to address good
faith legal privilege or confidentiality concerns and (III) to comply with
applicable Law and (5) furnish the other party's outside legal counsel with
such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other party's
outside legal counsel may reasonably request in connection with its
preparation of necessary submissions of information to any such Governmental
Authority. Each party shall consult with the other party and consider in good
faith the views of the other party prior to entering into any agreement,
arrangement, undertaking or understanding (oral or written) with any
Governmental Authority relating to any Antitrust Law with respect to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby; provided, that subject
to its undertakings in Section 6.03(c), the final determination as to the
appropriate course of action shall be made by Parent. In connection with and
without limiting the first sentence of this Section 6.03, each of the Company,
Parent and the respective Boards of Directors of the Company and Parent shall
(x) take all action reasonably necessary to ensure that no Takeover Law is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (y) if any Takeover Law
becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take all action reasonably
necessary to ensure that the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as reasonably
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) In furtherance, and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the
Company and Parent agrees to cooperate with each other and use its reasonable
best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by the
FTC, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, state
antitrust enforcement authorities or competition authorities of any other
nation or other jurisdiction or any other Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction with respect to the Transactions provided for in this Agreement
under Antitrust Laws and to permit the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated in the most expeditious
manner reasonably practicable. If any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging the Transactions provided for in this
Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Laws or that would otherwise prevent,
materially impede or delay the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company and Parent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate and take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with
each other in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to as promptly
as reasonably practicable vigorously contest and resist any such action or
proceeding, including any appeal, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that restrains, enjoins,
prohibits, prevents, or restricts or would otherwise materially impede or
delay the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, to permit the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated in the most expeditious
manner reasonably practicable.

(c) For purposes of Section 6.03(a) and (b), Parent's "reasonable best
efforts" shall include an obligation of Parent and its Subsidiaries to take
any and all actions required of Parent and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Proposed Consent Agreement (each, a "Consent Agreement Action"); provided that
each Consent Agreement Action shall be conditioned upon the consummation of
the Merger. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, "reasonable
best efforts" shall not require Parent or its Subsidiaries to (i) sell,
license, franchise, divest or otherwise dispose of, or hold separate and agree
to sell or otherwise dispose of, any assets, categories of assets, business
locations, business lines or businesses of the Company or Parent or their
respective Subsidiaries; (ii) terminate any existing relationships,
contractual rights or obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective
Subsidiaries; (iii) terminate any venture or other arrangement; (iv) create
any new relationships, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or
Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or (v) effectuate any other change or
restructuring of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; other
than, in each case, (A) such actions required of Parent and its Subsidiaries
by the Proposed Consent Agreement and (B) other such actions which,
individually or in the aggregate, are of a de minimis nature.

  


 

  

(d) Neither the Company nor Parent shall, nor shall they permit their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire any
business, person or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire
any assets, if, upon advice of such party's outside legal counsel, the
entering into of a definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of
such acquisition, (i) would reasonably be expected to delay or to increase the
likelihood of not obtaining the applicable action, nonaction, waiver,
clearance, consent or approval under the HSR Act or applicable requirements of
the Competition Act (Canada) (including the regulations thereunder, as each
may be amended from time to time, the "Competition Act") in connection with
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby prior to the Outside
Date or (ii) would reasonably be expected to require any action, nonaction,
waiver, clearance, consent or approval of any other Governmental Authority
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

  


 

  

(e) If any Consent Agreement Action agreed to by Parent requires action by or
with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or
assets, and such action would constitute a breach of this Agreement, by
agreeing to such Consent Agreement Action, Parent thereby consents to the
taking of such action by the Company or its Subsidiaries; provided that, upon
request of the Company, Parent shall confirm such consent in writing within
three business days of such request; provided, further, that at the discretion
of the Company, any such action may be conditioned upon consummation of the
Offer.

(f) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts (i)
to take, or cause to be taken, all reasonable actions and to do, or cause to
be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the
consents listed on Section 6.03(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and
(ii) to the extent requested by the other party, to cooperate with and assist
such party in (x) communicating or negotiating with the franchisees of the
parties in connection with the Transactions and (y) any litigation or
threatened litigation involving franchisees of the parties in connection with
the Transactions, and in each case each of Parent and the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in such efforts.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.04. Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance. (a)
Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and indemnification
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any
matters arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers
or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or its Subsidiaries (the
"Indemnified Parties") as provided in the Company Certificate, the Company
Bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates) or in any agreement (a "Company Indemnity
Agreement"), each as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall survive
the Offer and the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms. The Company has made available to Parent true and
complete copies of all Company Indemnity Agreements. Parent and the Company
shall, from and after the Acceptance Time, and, if after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Entity shall (and Parent shall cause the Company or the
Surviving Entity, as applicable, to) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and
advance expenses to Indemnified Parties with respect to all acts or omissions
by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the Effective Time,
to the fullest extent provided by: (i) the Company Certificate, the Company
Bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates) as in effect on the date of this Agreement; and
(ii) any Company Indemnity Agreement between any such Indemnified Party on the
one hand and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the other hand.

  


 

  

(b) Without limiting the provisions of Section 6.04(a), from and after the
Effective Time, Parent will: (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each Indemnified Party from and
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, penalties, liabilities and amounts
paid in settlement (including, in each case, any interest or assessments
thereon) in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to
the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of
or pertains to: (A) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in
such Indemnified Party's capacity as a director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time; or (B) the
Merger, this Agreement and any transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) pay
(within 30 days following any request for advancement) the expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) of any Indemnified Party incurred in connection
with any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation upon receipt of
an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay such amount
if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Party is not
entitled to be indemnified, in each case, if such Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses as of the date of this
Agreement pursuant to the Company's or any of its Subsidiary's certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other similar governing documents or any applicable
Company Indemnity Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified
Parties as a group may retain only one law firm to represent them with respect
to each such matter unless there is, under applicable standards of
professional conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between the
positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties.

(c) Parent will provide, or cause the Surviving Entity to provide, for a
period of not less than six years after the Effective Time, the Indemnified
Parties who are insured under the Company's directors' and officers' insurance
and indemnification policy with an insurance and indemnification policy (from
either (i) the Company's existing insurance carrier or (ii) an insurance
carrier that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company) that provides coverage
for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the "DandO Insurance")
that is no less favorable than the existing policy of the Company; provided,
that Parent and the Surviving Entity shall not be required to pay an annual
premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the annual premium paid as
of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance; provided, further, that
if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage at any time exceed such
amount, Parent or the Surviving Entity shall be obligated to obtain a policy
(from either (i) the Company's existing insurance carrier or (ii) an insurance
carrier that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company) with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may and at Parent's
request shall, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a "tail" directors' and
officers' insurance and indemnification policy, provided that payment for each
year of insurance coverage provided by such "tail" directors' and officers'
insurance policy shall not exceed 300% of the annual premium paid as of the
date hereof by the Company. Any such "tail" directors' and officers' insurance
and indemnification policy will satisfy Parent's obligation under this Section
6.04(c) to provide DandO Insurance.

  


 

  

(d) The Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 6.04 applies shall be third
party beneficiaries of this Section 6.04. The provisions of this Section 6.04
are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnified Party and his or her
successors, heirs and representatives.

  


 

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Section 6.04 shall
survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and shall be binding,
jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving
Entity and its Subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified
Parties and their successors, heirs or representatives. In the event that
Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective successors or assigns
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any
person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
such other person or the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Entity as the case may be shall succeed to its obligations set forth in this
Section 6.04.

SECTION 6.05. Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement,
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether
or not any of the Transactions are consummated.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.06. Public Announcements. Parent and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the
Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable
Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with
any national securities exchange, it being understood that the final form and
content of any such release or announcement shall be at the final discretion
of the disclosing party. The parties agree that the initial press release to
be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.07. Stockholder Litigation. Each party shall promptly notify the
other party of any stockholder litigation against it and/or its directors
relating to this Agreement, the Merger and/or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and shall keep the other party reasonably informed regarding
any such stockholder litigation. Each party shall give the other party the
opportunity to consult with it regarding the defense or settlement of any such
stockholder litigation and shall give due consideration to the other party's
advice with respect to such stockholder litigation. The Company shall not
settle any such litigation without the prior consent of Parent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  


 

  

SECTION 6.08. Employee Matters. (a) For the period immediately following the
Acceptance Time through December 31, 2013, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Entity to, (i) provide to each individual actively employed by the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries as of the Acceptance Time who continues as
an employee of the Surviving Entity (excluding any employee covered under the
terms of a collective bargaining agreement) (collectively, the "Covered
Employees") with at least the same level of base salary or base wages and on
substantially the same terms and conditions as provided to such Covered
Employee immediately prior to the Acceptance Time and (ii) except as set forth
in Section 6.08(a) of Company Disclosure Schedule, provide each Covered
Employee with employee benefits and annual bonus opportunities that in the
aggregate are substantially similar to the employee benefits (excluding any
equity-based plans or change in control severance, retention or other benefits
with respect to a transaction occurring after the Closing Date (it being
understood that nothing in this Section 6.08(a) is intended to address or
affect whether any such change in control severance, retention or other
benefits may be payable pursuant to any existing commitment or obligation that
continues in effect after the Closing)) and annual target bonus opportunities
provided to such Covered Employee under the Company Benefit Plans as in effect
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing contained in this Section 6.08(a) shall (i) prevent the amendment or
termination of any Company Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms, or
interfere with the right or obligation of Parent or the Surviving Entity to
make such changes as are necessary to conform with applicable Law or (ii)
limit the right of Parent or the Surviving Entity to terminate the employment
of any employee at any time.

(b) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate, and to the extent
that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate or commences to
participate in an employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or the Surviving
Entity, Parent shall cause such employee benefit plan to (i) recognize the
service of such Covered Employee with the Company or its Subsidiaries for
purposes of eligibility, vesting, level of benefits and benefit accrual (other
than benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan) under such employee
benefit plan to the same extent such service was recognized immediately prior
to the Acceptance Time under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such
Covered Employee was a participant immediately prior to the Acceptance Time
or, if there is no such comparable benefit plan, to the same extent such
service was recognized under the Company 401(k) plan immediately prior to the
Acceptance Time, provided that (A) recognition of such service shall not be
required to the extent that the service of employees other than Covered
Employees is not so recognized under such employee benefit plans and (B) such
recognition of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefits payable to
the Covered Employee with respect to the same period of service, and (ii) with
respect to any health, dental or vision plan of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than Company and its Subsidiaries) in which any Covered
Employee commences to participate, in the plan year that includes the year in
which such Covered Employee commences to participate, (x) cause any pre-
existing condition limitations under such Parent or Subsidiary plan to be
waived with respect to such Covered Employee to the extent such limitation
would have been waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan in which
such Covered Employee participated immediately prior to such commencement of
participation, and (y) recognize any medical or other health expenses incurred
by such Covered Employee in the year that includes the year in which such
Covered Employee commences to participate for purposes of any applicable
deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such
health, dental or vision plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including
the Surviving Entity).

  


 

  

(c) From and after the Acceptance Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Entity to, honor, in accordance with the terms thereof as in effect
as of the date hereof each employment agreement and change in control
agreement listed on Section 6.08(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the
"Executive Agreements"), the 2012 DTG Retention Plan and the Adjusted Options.
Following the Acceptance Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Entity to, pay and provide to any Covered Employee not covered by an Executive
Agreement whose employment is terminated without cause or due to a reduction
in force (including due to the closing or reduction in operations at the Tulsa
Facilities, as defined below) during the period from the Acceptance Time
through December 31, 2013, severance payments and benefits in an amount equal
to the severance payments and benefits that would be provided under the
Company's general severance guidelines as customarily interpreted and applied
by the Company prior to the Acceptance Time and outlined on Section 6.08(c) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule.

Exchange Act any Arrangements that have been, or after the date of this
Agreement will be, entered into by the Company or any of the Company's

(including by not effecting any reduction in force, layoffs or any employee
termination other than termination for cause) for a minimum of four months.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Covered Employee (excluding those
employees covered by Executive Agreements) who provides services primarily at
the Tulsa Facility is terminated without cause, due to a reduction in force,
or due to the closing or reduction in operation at the Tulsa Facility, in the
first four months following the Acceptance Time, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Entity to, pay or provide to such Covered Employee the severance
payments and benefits described on Section 6.08(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and a payment in an amount equal to the base salary or base wages
such Covered Employee would have been paid from his or her termination date
through the four month anniversary of the Acceptance Time, to be paid in a
lump sum on such termination date. For purposes of determining the severance
benefits described in Section 6.08(c) to be paid to such Covered Employee,
Parent or the Surviving Entity shall credit such Covered Employee with service
through the four month anniversary of the Acceptance Time.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.10. Notification of Certain Matters. Each party shall give prompt
notice to the other party of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any change,

the Company, result in the existence of any of the conditions set forth in
Annex I; provided, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
6.10 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder;
provided, further, that the failure to deliver any notice pursuant to this
Section 6.10 shall not result in a failure of a condition to the Offer or the
Merger.

that have been relinquished to, and sold by, VEXCO, LLC, including, but not
limited to, obtaining, prior to the Closing, at Parent's sole expense, any

credit facility) with respect to, any letters of credit in accordance with
instructions as may be provided in such payoff letters and, unless otherwise
requested by Parent, permanently terminate the Company Credit Agreement and
all related agreements.

other than the provisions of Section 1.01(g), Section 6.05, Section 8.02, this
Section 8.03, Article IX, and the third sentence of Section 6.02(a), which
provisions shall survive such termination; provided that nothing herein
(including the payment of any amounts under Section 8.02) shall relieve any
party from any liability for any willful and material breach hereof prior to
such termination; provided further, that nothing herein shall relieve Parent
from any liability for any breach of Section 6.03 prior to such termination.

SECTION 8.04. Amendment. Subject to Section 1.03(b), this Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto at any time before or after receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval, to the extent required by applicable Law;

Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

SECTION 9.04. Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement,
including the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule, and
the Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement; (b) are not intended to confer upon any person
other than the parties any rights, benefits or remedies, other than (i) the
rights to indemnification and insurance pursuant to Section 6.04 hereof (of
which the persons entitled to indemnification are the intended beneficiaries),
(ii) the rights of the Company's stockholders and holders of Company Incentive
Awards to pursue claims for damages and other relief, including equitable
relief, for Parent's or Merger Sub's willful and material breach of this
Agreement; provided, however, that the rights granted pursuant to this clause
(ii) shall only be enforceable by the Company on behalf of such stockholders
and holders of Company Incentive Awards in the Company's sole and absolute
discretion (and not directly by any such stockholder or holder), it being
understood and agreed that any and all interests in such claims shall attach
to such shares of Company Common Stock and Company Incentive Awards (and any
shares of Company Common Stock issued upon exercise or conversion of such
Company Incentive Awards), as applicable, and subsequently trade and transfer
therewith and, consequently, any damages, settlements or other amounts
recovered or received by the Company with respect to such claims (net of
expenses incurred by the Company in connection therewith) may, in the
Company's sole and absolute discretion, be (x) distributed, in whole or in
part, by the Company to the holders of Company Common Stock and/or holders of
Company Incentive Awards as of any date determined by the Company or (y)
retained by the Company for the use and benefit of the Company in any manner
the Company deems fit; provided, further, however, that under no circumstances
shall any such rights of holders of Company Common Stock or Company Incentive
Awards be enforceable by such stockholders, holders or by any other person
acting for or on their behalf other than the Company; and (iii) after the
Effective Time, the rights of the Company's stockholders to receive the Merger
Consideration and of the holders of Company Incentive Awards to receive the
benefits of Article II hereof.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.05. Governing Law. This Agreement and any dispute arising out of,
relating to or in connection with this Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of Law provision or rule (whether of
the State of Delaware or of any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.06. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties and any attempt to make any such assignment
without such consent shall be null and void, except that Merger Sub may assign
any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to
any direct, wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall
relieve Merger Sub of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

SECTION 9.07. Enforcement of the Agreement; Consent to Jurisdiction. The

of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions

the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in the chancery courts of
the State of Delaware or in any Federal court located in the State of
Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree
not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees that in
addition to any other legally permissible means of service, service of any
process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective
addresses set forth in Section 9.02 shall be effective service of process for
any proceeding arising out of, relating to or in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.08. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE COMPANY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING
OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT OR THE COMPANY IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.09. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

Conditions to the Offer

  


 

  

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Offer and in
addition to (and not in limitation of) Merger Sub's right to extend and amend
the Offer pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall not
be required to (and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger Sub to)
accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the
SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act, pay for any shares of
Company Common Stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer if any one or more of the following conditions shall not have been
satisfied:

  


 

  

(a) Minimum Tender Condition. Company stockholders shall have validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer a number of
shares of Company Common Stock which, together with the shares of Company
Common Stock then owned by Parent and its subsidiaries (including Merger Sub),
represents at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock on a fully diluted basis (the "Minimum Tender Condition").

  


 

  

(b) HSR Approval Condition. The HSR Approval shall have been obtained and
shall remain in full force and effect (the "HSR Approval Condition").

  


 

  

(c) Other Regulatory Conditions. The Commissioner of the Vermont Department of
Banking, Insurance Securities and Health Care Administration shall have
confirmed that the approval granted in connection with the 2010 Merger
Agreement remains effective and applicable to the Offer and the Merger.

  


 

  

(d) Other Conditions. None of the following events shall have occurred and be
continuing at any time after the date of this Agreement and immediately before
the expiration of the Offer:

  


 

  

(i) A Restraint shall be in effect restraining, enjoining, prohibiting or
otherwise making illegal the consummation of the Transactions.

  


 

  

(ii) The representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the first
sentence of Section 3.01 and in Section 3.03, Section 3.06(a), Section 3.21
and Section 3.23 of this Agreement shall fail to be true and correct in all
respects and the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
Section 3.02(a), (b) and (c) and Section 3.22 of this Agreement shall fail to
be true and correct in all material respects, in each case as of the date of
this Agreement and as of such time as though made at and as of such time
(except that representations and warranties that by their terms speak as of a
specific date or time need only be true and correct as of such date or time).
The other representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this
Agreement shall fail to be true and correct in all respects as of the date of
this Agreement and as of such time as though made at and as such time (except
that representations and warranties that by their terms speak as of a specific
date or time need only be true and correct as of such date or time), except
where the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and
correct (without giving effect to any "materiality" or "Material Adverse
Effect" or similar qualifier set forth therein) has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

(iii) The Company shall not have performed or complied in all material
respects with all agreements and covenants to be performed by it under this
Agreement at or prior to such time.

Parent and Merger Sub a certificate executed on behalf of the Company by the
chief executive officer or the chief financial officer of the Company
certifying that the conditions set forth in paragraphs (d)(ii) and (d)(iii) of
this Annex I are satisfied as of such time and date.

  


 

  

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub
and, other than the Minimum Tender Condition, may be waived by Parent and
Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole
discretion, in each case subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and to the extent permitted by applicable Law. The failure by Parent, Merger
Sub or any other affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise any of the
foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of
any such right with respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not be
deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each
such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time
and from time to time.

  


 

  

The capitalized terms used in this Annex I shall have the meanings set forth
in the agreement to which it is annexed.
