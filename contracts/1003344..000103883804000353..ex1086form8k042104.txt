other matters, all on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

         NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, Sellers
and Buyer, all intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

                      SECTION 1. ACQUISITION OF SECURITIES

         1.1 Redemption by ES Corp and Northwest of Common Stock. Immediately
prior to the Closing: (a) ES Corp shall redeem such number of shares of ES Corp
Common Stock as is equal to the total number of outstanding shares of ES Corp

<PAGE>

Common Stock multiplied by the quotient (the "Quotient") of the cash held by ES
Corp divided by the Equity Value of the Eldorado Interest held by ES Corp
(provided that the Quotient shall not exceed .99), by distributing all of its
cash to ES Acquisition; and


         1.2 (b) Northwest shall redeem such number of shares of Northwest
Common Stock as is equal to the total number of outstanding shares of ES Corp
Common Stock multiplied by the quotient (the "Quotient") of the cash held by ES
Corp divided by the Equity Value of the Eldorado Interest held by ES Corp
(provided that the Quotient shall not exceed .99), by distributing all of its
cash to ES Acquisition.

         1.3 Purchase and Sale of Securities. Subject to the terms and
conditions of, and on the basis of and in reliance upon the covenants,
agreements and representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement, at
the Closing, Buyer shall, directly or indirectly, acquire all of the equity
interests in Eldorado and ES Acquisition (collectively, the "Securities")
through the sale, assignment, transfer and conveyance to Buyer of the Securities
as follows:

                  (a) ES Holdings shall sell, transfer and deliver to Buyer
955,815 Units of ES Acquisition, constituting approximately 95.6% of the
aggregate number of outstanding limited liability company interests in ES
Acquisition ("ESA Units") as of the date hereof and all of such interests in ES
Acquisition directly owned by it;

         (b) Grimmer shall sell, transfer and deliver to Buyer 44,185 ESA Units,
constituting approximately 4.4% of the ESA Units and all such interests in ES
Acquisition owned by him;

         (c) StoneCraft shall sell, transfer and deliver to Buyer 23,623 Units
of Eldorado constituting approximately 23.6% of the aggregate number of
outstanding limited liability company interests in Eldorado (the "Eldorado

         (d) each other Seller who becomes a member of Eldorado after the date
hereof and becomes a party hereto pursuant to Section 13.13 shall sell, transfer
and deliver to Buyer all of the Units owned by such Seller.


                     SECTION 2. PURCHASE PRICE AND PAYMENT.

         2.1 Consideration. Subject to adjustment as provided for in Section
2.3, the aggregate consideration for the Securities to be purchased by Buyer
shall be equal to Two Hundred One Million Dollars ($201,000,000), plus the tax
benefits to ES Corp and Northwest of the net consideration to holders of options
to purchase Securities, costs of unwinding the Company's interest rate swap
(provided for in the ISDA Master Agreement between Fleet National Bank and
Eldorado, dated October 22, 2001), management transaction bonuses to be paid by
the Company, and unamortized financing and management fees, all as calculated as
of the Closing Date in accordance with Schedule 2.1 attached hereto (the
"Purchase Price"). The Purchase Price shall be equal to the sum of the equity
value of all of the Securities to be sold pursuant to this Agreement (the
"Equity Value") and the aggregate amount of principal, interest, fees and other
amounts owed as of the Closing Date, net of any cash held by Eldorado and the

<PAGE>

Subsidiaries, under each of (a) the Credit Agreement among ES Acquisition,
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, CIBC Inc., National City Bank, Fleet
National Bank, Credit Agricole Indosuez, The Provident Bank, General Electric
Capital Corporation and Firstrust Savings Bank, as amended (the "Credit
Agreement" ) and (b) the outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes issued to
National City Capital Corporation, Great Lakes Capital Investments III, LLC,
Argosy Investment Partners, L.P., Credit Agricole Indosuez and Indosuez CMII,
Inc. on February 20, 2001 (the "Notes" ). The Purchase Price shall be paid by
Buyer as follows: (i) Buyer shall pay an amount equal to the Equity Value to
Sellers at Closing by wire transfer of immediately available federal funds
pursuant to instructions previously given by Sellers to Buyer for that purpose.
The sum paid to each Seller shall be determined by multiplying the Equity Value
by the percentage of ownership of each Seller set forth beside his, her or its
name on Schedule 2.1 hereto and (ii) Buyer shall make available, or cause to be
made available, funds for Eldorado to repay at Closing all of the indebtedness
owing under the Credit Agreement and the Notes (the indebtedness owing under the
Notes shall include the amount necessary for Eldorado to repurchase the
Warrants, as defined in the Notes.

         2.2 Allocation of Consideration. The Purchase Price shall be allocated
among Sellers and paid as provided in Schedule 2.1. For federal income tax
purposes, the fair market value of each item of tangible personal property owned
by the Eldorado Entities as of the Closing Date and, accordingly, the amount of
Purchase Price that is allocable to such property, shall be allocated at fair
market value. Upon request of the Sellers, the Sellers shall be provided with a
copy of all appraisals of the value of such items.

         2.3 Working Capital Adjustment.

                  (a) At least two days prior to the Closing Date, Eldorado
shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Buyer a working capital statement
(the "Working Capital Statement"), setting forth the calculation of the amount,
if any, by which the Estimated Working Capital (as defined below) will be
greater or less than the Target Working Capital as of the Closing Date.

                  (b) At the Closing, the amount of the Purchase Price shall be
increased (or decreased) by the amount by which the Estimated Working Capital is
greater than (or less than) the Target Working Capital.

                  (c) Within 30 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare
and deliver to Sellers a statement setting forth the Final Working Capital and
the Working Capital Adjustment, if any (the "Final Working Capital Statement").
The working capital adjustment shall be equal to the difference between the
Final Working Capital and the Estimated Working Capital (the "Working Capital
Adjustment"). If the Final Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Working
Capital, Buyer shall owe the Working Capital Adjustment to the Sellers, together
with interest thereon from the Closing Date at a rate of 9% per annum. If the
Estimated Working Capital exceeds the Final Working Capital, the Sellers shall
owe the Working Capital Adjustment to Buyer, together with interest thereon from
the Closing Date at a rate of 9% per annum. If the Sellers do not object to the
amount of the Working Capital Adjustment within 30 days of receipt of the Final

<PAGE>

Working Capital Statement, Sellers shall pay to Buyer, or Buyer shall pay to the
Sellers, as the case may be, no later than the fifth business day after such
thirty-day period, an amount in cash equal to the Working Capital Adjustment, if
any.

                  (d) If Sellers object to the Final Working Capital Statement
and the calculation of the Working Capital Adjustment, if any, Sellers shall
notify Buyer within 30 days following receipt thereof, setting forth the basis
for its objection and its proposal for any adjustments to the Working Capital
Adjustment calculation. Buyer and the Sellers shall negotiate in good faith to
reach agreement as to any such proposed adjustment or that no such adjustment is
necessary within 30 days following receipt of notice of the Sellers' objection.
If agreement is reached in writing within such period as to all proposed further
adjustments, or Buyer and the Sellers agree that no adjustments are necessary,
the parties shall make such adjustments, if any, and the Working Capital
Adjustment shall be based thereon. If Buyer and the Sellers are unable to reach
agreement within such thirty-day period, then a "Big-4" accounting firm as
agreed upon by Buyer and the Sellers (the "Third Party Accounting Firm") shall
be engaged to review the proposed Working Capital Adjustment, and, to the extent
necessary, the Final Working Capital Statement, and shall make a determination
as to the resolution of any adjustments necessary to cause the Working Capital
Adjustment, if any, to have been properly prepared in accordance with this
Agreement. All such determinations shall relate only to such matters as are in
dispute and shall represent either agreement with the position taken by Buyer or
the Sellers or a compromise between such positions. The determination of the
Third Party Accounting Firm shall be delivered in writing as soon as practicable
following selection of the Third Party Accounting Firm; shall state the amount
due by either party as a result and shall be final, conclusive and binding upon
Buyer and the Sellers, absent fraud or clear error. Thereafter, not later than
ten days following the determination by the Third Party Accounting Firm, the
Working Capital Adjustment, if any, as determined by the Third Party Accounting
Firm, shall be paid in accordance with Section 2.3(c) hereof. Buyer and the
Sellers, pro rata, shall bear equally the costs of the Third Party Accounting
Firm.

                  (e) As used herein:

                           (i) "Final Working Capital" means the final
determination of the Net Working Capital (as defined below) as of the Closing
Date (immediately prior to, and without giving effect to, the transactions
contemplated hereby) determined in accordance with Section 2.3. Final Working
Capital as reflected in the Final Working Capital Statement shall be presented
in U.S. dollars and should not include any purchase accounting adjustments
required under Financial Accounting Standards Board, Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations, or any accounting entries
to adjust for transaction bonuses or stock option exercises, cancellations and
rollovers (including related tax benefits), that result from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

                           (ii) For purposes hereof, the "Estimated Working
Capital" shall mean Sellers' estimate of the Net Working Capital as of the
Closing Date.

                           (iii) For purposes hereof, the "Net Working Capital"
shall mean (x) the current assets of the Eldorado Entities (excluding cash) less
(y) the current liabilities (excluding the current portion due under the Credit
Agreement and the Notes of the Eldorado Entities as of the applicable period)
calculated consistently with the methodologies, general ledger account

<PAGE>

groupings, and classifications included in the calculation of Target Working
Capital on Exhibit 2.3 hereto; provided, that (A) no reserve shall be included,
and no write off shall be taken, with respect to the collectibility of $719,191
in accounts receivable as described in Schedule 4.23, (B) absent the occurrence
of any event subsequent to February 29, 2004 that would cause Eldorado's
reserves, including without limitation accounts receivable, inventory and
warranty, not to be in compliance with GAAP (in which case such reserve shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect such event), the dollar amounts of each such
reserve shall be the same as the relevant reserve included in the calculation of
Target Working Capital, and (C) except to the extent necessitated by material
changes in raw material or transfer costs, finished goods inventory shall be
valued at the same cost per square foot or unit as was used in calculating
Target Working Capital.

                           (iv) For purposes hereof, "Target Working Capital"
shall mean $14,259,400.

                  (f) Any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.3 to
Sellers shall be allocated among the Sellers in the same proportions as set
forth on Schedule 2.1 and paid as provided therein.

construction contracts, leases, statutory obligations, surety, appeal or

restrictions, if any, as do not detract in any material respect from the value
of the Real Properties subject thereto and do not materially interfere with the

Entities as presently conducted (collectively, the "Permitted Encumbrances").

                  (c) All of the buildings and structures located on the Owned
Real Properties or the premises owned or leased by each of the Eldorado Entities
are suitable for the purposes used and, subject to ordinary wear and tear, are

building or structure, or any appurtenance thereto or equipment therein, or the
operation or maintenance thereof, violates any restrictive covenant or any Law
(including without limitation any such Laws relating to health, safety,
subdivision and zoning), which violation materially interferes with the use of
such building, structure or appurtenance, encroaches in any material respect on
any property owned by others, or which, to the Knowledge of Eldorado could
reasonably be expected to result in any Order against any of the Eldorado

pending, or to the Knowledge of Eldorado, threatened with respect to any of the
Real Properties.

Eldorado or any Subsidiary are in the possession or under the control of
Eldorado and are in good condition and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted,
are suitable for the purposes for which they are being used, and are of a
condition, nature and quantity sufficient for the conduct of the Business prior

income tax purposes.

of the most recent fiscal month end, exceed by any material amount the reserve
for Liability for Income Tax or any other Tax set forth on the face of the most
recent balance sheet included in the Financial Statements, as adjusted, in each
case, for operations and transactions in the ordinary course of business through

otherwise nondeductible.

                  (n) There is currently no limitation on the utilization of any

         4.16 Employee Benefit Plans.

                  (a) Schedule 4.16 contains a complete list of all "employee
benefit plans," whether written or unwritten, as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA ("Plans"), sponsored, maintained or contributed to, or required to be
sponsored, maintained or contributed to, by Eldorado or any of the Subsidiaries,
currently or at any time within the past three years for the benefit of any
current or former employee, consultant or director of Eldorado or any of the
Subsidiaries under which Eldorado or any of the Subsidiaries has any present or
future obligation or liability. All Plans have been administered in substantial
compliance with their terms and the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code
and/or other applicable Law. With respect to each Plan required to be listed on
Schedule 4.16, (i) each Plan which is intended to be qualified within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and is, as most recently
amended, the subject of a favorable determination letter from the IRS as to its
qualification and nothing has occurred, whether by action or failure to act,
that could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification; (ii)
all contributions required under the terms of the Plans or under applicable law
have been made within the time required by law and the terms of the Plans; (iii)
there have been no "prohibited transactions" (as described in Section 4975 of
the Code or in Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA) with respect to any
Plan; and (iv) there are no inquiries, proceedings, claims or suits pending or
threatened by any Governmental Authority or by any participant or beneficiary

<PAGE>

against any of the Plans, the assets of any of the trusts under such Plans or
the Plan sponsor or the Plan administrator, or against any fiduciary of any of
such Plans with respect to the design or operation of the Plans, other than
routine claims for benefits.

                  (b) Neither Eldorado, any of the Subsidiaries, nor any entity
required to be aggregated therewith, under Section 414 of the Code ("ERISA
Affiliate") sponsors or contributes (or is obligated to sponsor or contribute)
to (i) a "multiemployer plan" as such term is defined in ERISA Section 3(37); or
(ii) an "employee pension benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA,
that is subject to ss.412 of the Code or ss.302 of Title I of ERISA. During the
three-year period ending on the Closing Date, neither Eldorado nor any of the
Subsidiaries, nor any ERISA Affiliate, has contributed or been obligated to
contribute to either of such plans, referenced in (i) and (ii) above.

                  (c) There are no unsatisfied liabilities to participants, the
IRS, the United States Department of Labor ("DOL"), the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation ("PBGC") or to any other person or entity which have been incurred
as a result of the termination of any Plan ever maintained by Eldorado or any of
the Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate, and neither Eldorado nor any of the
Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate sponsors, maintains, contributes to or is
required to contribute to any Plan which is subject to the minimum funding
requirements of Part 3 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or subject to Section
412 of the Code. To the Knowledge of Eldorado and the Subsidiaries, there is no
pending litigation or action relating to any Plan or other benefit arrangement,
and there are no facts or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to
give rise to any such litigation or action. To the Knowledge of Eldorado and the
Subsidiaries, no investigation, audit or other administrative proceeding by the
DOL, the PBGC, the IRS or any other Governmental Authorities are pending or in
progress. All material contributions due under each Plan or benefit arrangement
have been paid or accrued on the books of Eldorado and the Subsidiaries in
accordance with DOL Regulation 2510.3-102(b).

                  (d) All reports and information required to be filed with the
DOL, IRS and PBGC or any other Governmental Authority or furnished to plan
participants and their beneficiaries with respect to each Plan required to be
listed on Schedule 4.16 have been so filed and/or furnished and all annual
reports (including Form 5500 series) of such Plans were certified without
qualification by each Plan's accountants and no material change has occurred
with respect to matters covered by the most recent Form 5500 since the date
thereof. Current accurate and complete copies of all Plans (and, if applicable,
related trust agreements or other funding instruments), and all amendments
thereto and related summary plan descriptions and, for the three most recent
years, Forms 5500 and attached schedules and audited financial statements have
been made available to the Buyer. All discrimination test results for plans
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, flexible benefit plans under Code
ss.125, or self-insured plans under Section 105(h) of the Code have been made
available to the Buyer.

                  (e) The consummation of the transactions contemplated herein
will not, either alone or in combination with another event, (i) entitle any
employee or any current or former employee, officer, director, consultant or
agent of Eldorado or any of the Subsidiaries to severance pay, unemployment
compensation or any other payment, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting of, or increase the amount of, compensation or benefits due to any such
individual.

<PAGE>

                  (f) There has been no violation of the "continuation coverage
requirement" of "group health plans" as set forth in section 4980B of the Code
and Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA (sometimes referred to as "COBRA")
with respect to any Plan maintained by Eldorado or any of the Subsidiaries or
any ERISA Affiliate to which such continuation coverage requirements apply.
There has been no violation of the health insurance obligations imposed by
section 9801 of the Code and Part 7 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA with
respect to any Plan to which such insurance obligations apply. Neither Eldorado,
any of the Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate has contributed to a
nonconforming group health plan (as defined in Section 5000(c) of the Code) and
no ERISA Affiliate of Eldorado or any of the Subsidiaries has incurred a tax
under Section 5000(a) of the Code which is or is reasonably expected to become a
liability of Eldorado or an ERISA Affiliate.

                  (g) Other than such continuation of benefit coverage under
group health plans as is required by applicable law, the cost of which is fully
paid by the former employee or his or her dependent, neither Eldorado nor any
Subsidiary maintains retiree life or retiree health plans providing for
continuing coverage for any employee or any beneficiary of an employee after the
employee's termination of employment.

                  (h) The Sellers have furnished or made available to the Buyer
copies of each material, written severance or other similar contract,
arrangement or policy and each material, written plan, agreement, policy or
arrangement providing for insurance coverage (including any self-insured
arrangements), vacation benefits, disability benefits, early retirement
benefits, death benefits, hospitalization benefits, retirement benefits,
deferred compensation, profit-sharing, bonuses, stock options, stock purchase,
phantom stock, stock appreciation or other forms of compensation or
post-retirement benefits that (i) is not a Plan, (ii) is entered into,
maintained or contributed to, as the case may be, by Eldorado or any of the
Subsidiaries, and (iii) covers any employee, former employee, director,
consultant or independent contractor of Eldorado or any of the Subsidiaries.

                  (i) Neither Eldorado nor any of the Subsidiaries have engaged
in a transaction described in Section 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA. No circumstances
exist pursuant to which Eldorado or any of the Subsidiaries could reasonably be
expected to incur any material liability for any Tax imposed under ss.ss.4971
through 4980B of the Code or any liability under ss.ss.502(i) or (1) of ERISA.

                  (j) Neither Eldorado nor any of the Subsidiaries have, since
February 20, 2001, terminated, suspended, discontinued contributions to or
withdrawn from any Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, including (without
limitation) any multiemployer plan, as defined in ss.3(37) of ERISA.

                  (k) Schedule 4.16 sets forth a description of the vacation
carry-over policy of Eldorado and each of the Subsidiaries and lists any and all
liabilities, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from or related to such policy.

         4.17 Compliance with Laws and Instruments. Each of Eldorado and each
Subsidiary is and at all times during the last three years has been, in
compliance with and has not received any notice of any violation or delinquency,
with respect to, any Laws, applicable to the Business, except for such

<PAGE>

violations or delinquencies that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the ownership or use of Eldorado's and
the Subsidiaries' assets nor the conduct of the Business conflicts with rights
of any other Person or violates, or with or without the giving of notice or the
passage of time, or both, will violate, conflict with or result in a breach,
default, right to accelerate or loss of rights under, or result in the creation
of any Lien or Encumbrance pursuant to, any term or provision of the formation
documents of Eldorado or any Subsidiary as presently in effect, or any Contract,
permit, license, consent, approval, instrument, Law, statute, rule or regulation
or any Order, judgment, award or decree to which Eldorado or any Subsidiary is a
party or by which Eldorado or any Subsidiary or the Business may be bound or
affected, except any as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         4.18 Environmental Compliance.

                  (a) Eldorado and each Subsidiary have complied with, and are
in compliance with and have not received any written notice of any violation or
delinquency with respect to, any Law or any agreement with, or any license or
permit from, any Governmental Authority to which the operation of the Business
or any of its assets or personnel is subject and which relates to human health
or the environment including, without limitation, any Environmental Laws, except
where such non-compliance would not be reasonably expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Neither Eldorado, any Subsidiary, nor to Eldorado's Knowledge,
any of the Properties, nor to Eldorado's Knowledge, any formerly owned or leased
properties has been made subject to any allegation, claim, judgment, decree,
Order, arbitration award, deed restriction, permit condition, licensing
restriction or any other restriction of the operation of the Business by any
Governmental Authority relating to Environmental Laws. To Eldorado's Knowledge,
there are no circumstances or conditions existing that may prevent or interfere
with such compliance in the future. Either Eldorado or a Subsidiary has obtained
all approvals, consents, permits, licenses and other authorizations required
under Environmental Laws for the use, ownership, operation and/or occupation of
the Real Properties and for the conduct of the Business, except for such
approvals the absence of which would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b) There is no Environmental Claim pending, or to the
Knowledge of Eldorado, no claim threatened against Eldorado, any Subsidiary or
the Real Properties or any real property formerly owned or leased by Eldorado.
To the Knowledge of Eldorado there are no past or present actions, activities,
circumstances, conditions, events or incidents, including, without limitation,
the release, emission, discharge, presence or disposal of any Hazardous
Materials into the environment that could form the basis of any Environmental
Claim relating to the Business or against Eldorado or any Subsidiary or the Real
Properties or any property formerly owned or leased by either Eldorado or any
Subsidiary.

                  (c) Schedule 4.18(c) hereto lists all environmental
assessments or agreements that, to the Knowledge of Eldorado, exist or were
prepared for or at the request of Eldorado and are in its possession or control
relating to any of the Real Properties or any facilities or Real Properties or
formerly owned or leased real property (or any real property geologically or
hydrologically adjoining any of such properties), of Eldorado and the
Subsidiaries.

<PAGE>

                  (d) Except as in compliance with all Environmental Laws and to
the Knowledge of Eldorado, there are no Hazardous Materials present on or in the
environment at any of the Real Properties or, at any geologically or
hydrologically adjoining property, including any Hazardous Materials contained
in barrels, above or underground storage tanks, landfills, land deposits, dumps,
equipment (whether moveable or fixed) or other containers, either temporary or
permanent, and deposited or located in land, water, sumps, or any other part of
the Real Properties or such adjoining property, or incorporated into any
structure therein or thereon, except where such non-compliance would not be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither Eldorado nor any
of the Subsidiaries nor any other Person for whose conduct it or they may be
held responsible to the Knowledge of Eldorado or any of the Subsidiaries, or any
other Person, has permitted or conducted, or is aware of, any Hazardous Activity
conducted with respect to or on the Real Properties or any other properties or
assets (whether real, personal, or mixed) in which the Sellers and/or the
Eldorado Entities has or had an interest.

                  (e) Except as in compliance with all Environmental Laws or
where such non-compliance would not be reasonably expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect and as set forth in the documents listed on Schedule 4.18, to the
Knowledge of Eldorado, there are no (i) underground storage tanks, active or
abandoned, (ii) polychlorinated biphenyl containing equipment, or (iii) asbestos
containing material, at or under any Owned Real Property, or at or under any
Leased Real Property.

         4.19 Transactions With Affiliates. Schedule 4.19 hereto sets forth, for
each Person who is an Affiliate, every agreement, undertaking, understanding or
compensation arrangement of any Affiliate with Eldorado and/or any Subsidiary
(other than normal employment arrangements) and any interest of any Affiliate in
any property, real, personal or mixed, tangible or intangible, used in or
pertaining to the Business (other than ownership of membership interests of
Eldorado).

         4.20 Product and Service Warranties. A copy of each standard warranty
of Eldorado and each Subsidiary is set forth on Schedule 4.20. Neither Eldorado
nor any Subsidiary has expanded its warranty obligation to any customer beyond
that which is set forth in the standard warranties. To the Knowledge of
Eldorado, there are no design or manufacturing defects with respect to any
products sold by Eldorado or any Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date that
reasonably could result, in connection with normal use, in product liability.
There are no material outstanding claims (including, without limitation, claims
for product liability, defects or breaches of product or service warranties) in
connection with the manufacture, production, sale, distribution or use of any
products or services sold by Eldorado or any Subsidiary (individually a
"Warranty Claim" and collectively, "Warranty Claims") except for any Warranty
Claims, individually or in the aggregate, which would not have a Material
Adverse Effect. Neither Eldorado nor any Subsidiary has received notice of any
facts or circumstances that reasonably would be expected to be the basis for any
material Warranty Claim on or after the date hereof. To the Knowledge of
Eldorado, no fact or circumstance exists that would support any personal injury
claim arising from or relating to any product manufactured Eldorado or any
Subsidiary prior to or on the Closing Date. For purposes of the preceding
sentence, "manufactured" shall mean that the product constitutes or constituted
finished goods inventory.

<PAGE>

         4.21 Insurance.

                  (a) Eldorado and the Subsidiaries maintain insurance under
various insurance policies, as set forth on Schedule 4.21(a) hereto, which
policies, to Eldorado's Knowledge, are valid and enforceable in accordance with
their terms and all premiums due thereunder have been paid when due and neither
Eldorado nor any of the Subsidiaries have received any written notice of
cancellation or termination in respect of any such policy. At no time was there
a period in which Eldorado or the Subsidiaries lacked such insurance coverage,
except as such failure to maintain coverage is not reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect. There are no outstanding claims under such policies
except such claims, individually or in the aggregate, which would not have a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b) Neither Eldorado nor any Subsidiary has received (i) any
notice of cancellation of any policy or binder of insurance required to be
identified in Schedule 4.21(a) or refusal of coverage thereunder; (ii) any
notice that any issuer of such policy or binder has filed for protection under
applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws or is otherwise in the process of
liquidating or has been liquidated; or (iii) any other indication that any such
policy or binder may no longer be in full force or effect or that the issuer of
any such policy or binder may be unwilling or unable to perform its obligations
thereunder. Neither Eldorado nor any Subsidiary has, within the last three
years, been refused any insurance nor has their coverage been limited.

                  (c) Schedule 4.21(c) contains a list of all claims made under
any insurance policies covering Eldorado or any of the Subsidiaries since
January 1, 2002. Neither the Sellers, Eldorado nor any of the Subsidiaries have
received written notice that any insurer under any policy referred to in this
Section is denying liability with respect to a claim thereunder or defending any
claim under a reservation of rights clause.

         4.22 Inventory. All inventory of Eldorado and the Subsidiaries used in
the Business as set forth in the Financial Statements consists of, and all
inventory as of the Closing Date will consist of, raw materials, work-in-process
and finished goods of a quality and quantity usable or salable in the ordinary
course of the Business. The value at which inventories were reflected in the
Financial Statements was calculated using the first in, first out (FIFO)
inventory valuation principle, subject to provisions for or omissions of
obsolete inventory, all in accordance with GAAP, applied on a basis consistent
with that of the preceding fiscal year.

         4.23 Accounts Receivable. All accounts receivable of the Business as
set forth in the Financial Statements are, and all accounts receivable which
have arisen or arise between the date of the 2003 Financial Statements and the
Closing Date: (i) are and will be, genuine, valid, binding and subsisting,
having arisen or arising out of bona fide sales and deliveries of products or
the performance of services in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice; (ii) to the Knowledge of Eldorado, all accounts receivable of the
Business set forth in the Financial Statements in the aggregate are collectible
in the ordinary course of business, subject to no defenses, counterclaims or
set-offs (other than in the ordinary course); (iii) do not represent obligations
for goods sold on consignment, on approval or on a sale-or-return basis or
subject to any other repurchase or return arrangements; and (iv) are subject to
allowances for bad debts and accruals as reflected in the Financial Statements.

<PAGE>

Such allowances and accruals are reasonable, adequate and appropriate based on
Eldorado's prior experience and are in accordance with GAAP, applied on a basis
consistent with that of the preceding fiscal year.

         4.24 Brokers. No Person acting on behalf of any Seller or any of its
Affiliates or under the authority of any of the foregoing is or will be entitled
to any brokers' or finders' fee or any other commission or similar fee, directly
or indirectly, from any of such parties in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement other than Citigroup Global Markets
Inc., and any commission or similar fee to which Citigroup Global Markets Inc.
may be entitled is an obligation of the Sellers, and not of any of the Eldorado
Entities.

         4.25 Substantial Customers and Suppliers. Schedule 4.25 lists the ten
largest customers of the Eldorado Entities on the basis of revenues for goods
sold or services provided for the twelve month period ending December 31, 2003.
Schedule 4.25 lists the ten largest suppliers of the Eldorado Entities on the
basis of cost of goods or services purchased during the twelve month period
ending December 31, 2003. Except as disclosed in Schedule 4.25, to the Knowledge

agreements of the Sellers and/or the Eldorado Entities contained in this
Agreement. All such representations, warranties, covenants and agreements will
survive the Closing for the periods specified in this Agreement.

         5.1 Incorporation, Good Standing and Authority. Buyer is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Utah, and has all requisite corporate power and authority to conduct
its business as presently conducted and to own and lease the properties and
assets used in connection therewith. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and any other agreement, instrument or other document necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein and thereby are within the corporate power of
Buyer and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
part of Buyer. This Agreement and any other agreement, instrument or other
document necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated herein constitute
the legal, valid and binding obligations of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in
accordance with its and their terms, except that the enforcement thereof may be
limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
conveyance or similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors'
rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforceability is considered in a Proceeding at law or in equity).

         5.2 Validity of Contemplated Transactions. Neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and any other agreement, instrument or other document
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated herein by Buyer nor the
consummation by Buyer of the transactions provided for herein or therein will
conflict with, violate, or result in a breach of or default under any Contract
to which Buyer is a party or by which it is bound or any law, permit, license,
order, judgment or decree applicable to Buyer or any provision of the charter or
bylaws of Buyer.

         5.3 Litigation. There is no pending action or Proceeding that has been
commenced against Buyer that may have the effect of preventing, delaying, or
making illegal the transactions contemplated herein.

         5.4 Sufficient Funds. To the knowledge of Buyer, no event has occurred
and no circumstances currently exist that would be likely to cause the Buyer to
be unable to arrange and complete the Financing, as defined in Section 6.10. If
the Financing occurs, Buyer will have available to it as of the Closing Date
sufficient funds to, upon the Closing, pay the aggregate Purchase Price set
forth in Section 2 hereof and to satisfy any and all obligations of the Buyer
due and owing as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

         5.5 Investment Representations.

                  (a) Buyer is acquiring the Securities for its own account for
purposes of investment and not for the account of any other Person, not for
resale to any other Person, and not with a view to or in connection with a sale
or distribution of the Securities. Buyer has no present or contemplated
agreement, undertaking, arrangement, obligation, indebtedness or commitment for
the disposition of the Securities by Buyer.

<PAGE>

                  (b) Buyer understands that (i) the Securities have not been
registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any state or other
jurisdiction, (ii) the Securities may not be sold, transferred, or otherwise
disposed of without registration under the Securities Act and under any
applicable state or other jurisdiction's respective securities laws, or an
exemption therefrom, and that without an effective registration statement
covering the Securities or an available exemption from registration under the
aforementioned securities laws (including, without limitation, the Securities
Act), the Securities must be held indefinitely and (iii) Sellers do not have any
obligation to register the Securities.

                  (c) Buyer has been furnished access to the business records of
the Eldorado Entities and such additional information and documents as Buyer has
requested and has been afforded an opportunity to ask questions of and receive
answers from representatives of the Eldorado Entities concerning the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein, the
purchase of the Securities, the Business, the operations, market potential,
capitalization, financial condition, assets, properties and prospects of the
Eldorado Entities, and all other matters deemed relevant by Buyer. Buyer has
sufficient knowledge and experience in finance and business that it is capable
of evaluating the risks and merits of its investment in the Securities and Buyer
is able financially to bear the risks thereof.

         5.6 Brokers. No Person acting on behalf of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates or under the authority of any of the foregoing is or will be entitled
to any brokers' or finders' fee or any other commission or similar fee, directly
or indirectly, from any of such parties in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement other than J.P. Morgan and any
commission or similar fee to which J.P. Morgan may be entitled to is an
obligation of Buyer.

         5.7 No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Section 5, Buyer makes no
representations or warranties, and Buyer hereby disclaims any other
representations or warranties (express or implied), whether made by Buyer or by
any of its officers, directors, employees or agents, if any, with respect to any
matter.

foregoing, or enter into any Contract to do any of the foregoing.

         6.5 Access. From the date of this Agreement until this Agreement is

respective officers, directors, attorneys, accountants and representatives, upon
reasonable notice, shall be permitted to examine the property, books and records
and titles of Eldorado and the Subsidiaries, and to have access to employees,
employee files and records and the real properties, provided that such access is
coordinated through Mike Lewis, Tom Webster or Sellers' counsel, and such
officers, directors, attorneys, accountants and representatives shall be
afforded reasonable access to such property, books, records and titles upon
reasonable prior notice, except where such access is prohibited by Law. Within 5
business days from the date of execution of this Agreement, the Buyer, through
either Mike Lewis or Tom Webster, shall arrange a meeting between its quality
assurance/quality control ("QA/QC") representatives and Charles Schneider and
Artemio Sandoval for the purpose of reviewing proprietary information of the
Business such as QC manuals, production manuals, mix-designs, mold design and
production files and manuals, ICBO files, ICC files, etc. (the "Proprietary
Information"). At such meeting, the Seller's representatives shall freely

<PAGE>

discuss the Proprietary Information with the Buyer's QA/QC representatives and
the Buyer's QA/QC representatives, shall not be allowed to make copies of any
documents or notes regarding the meeting or the matters discussed at the
meeting.

         6.6 Consents. Prior and subsequent to the Closing, Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (and cooperate with the Buyer in
obtaining) all consents, permits, Authorizations, approvals of, and exemptions
by, any Governmental Authority or third party necessary for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as set forth on Schedule 6.6.

         6.7 HSR. Each of the parties undertakes and agrees to file (and such
filing shall request early termination) as soon as practicable, and in any event
within two business days after the date of this Agreement, a Notification and
Report Form under the HSR Act with the United States Federal Trade Commission
(the "FTC") and the United States Department of Justice, Antitrust Division (the
"Antitrust Division"), and to make any other competition filing or notifications
required by any other Governmental Authority as promptly as practicable. If
either of the parties have made such filing prior to the date hereof, then such
party shall, within one business day after the date of this Agreement amend such
filing to request early termination. Each of the parties shall (i) respond as
promptly as practicable to any formal or informal inquiries received from the
FTC or the Antitrust Division for additional information or documentary
materials, and to all inquiries and requests received from any State Attorney
General or other Governmental Authority in connection with antitrust or
competition matters, and (ii) take all commercially reasonable steps to seek
early termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or any
similar laws and to obtain all required approvals, and (iii) refrain from
entering into any agreement with the FTC or the Antitrust Division or any
Governmental Authority not to consummate or delay consummation of or to give
notice of consummation other than as required by law, of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Each
of the parties or its counsel shall promptly notify the other party or its
counsel of any written or oral communication to that party or counsel from the
FTC, the Antitrust Division, any State Attorney General or any other
Governmental Authority and shall permit the other party or its counsel to review
in advance any proposed written communication to any of the foregoing.

         6.8 Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Prior to the Closing, each party
hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to occur the
transactions contemplated hereby and to cause all conditions to the performance
of the parties hereto that are within its control to be satisfied. No party
shall take any action to cause any such covenant, agreement, transaction or
condition not to occur, be satisfied or be performed, as the case may be.

         6.9 Publicity. Any party hereto may announce or otherwise disclose the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, so long as, with respect to any
advertisement or press release naming the other party, Buyer or such Seller is
given at least two business days to review such advertisement or press release
for accuracy.

         6.10 Financing. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
arrange and complete the financing (the "Financing"), in a form and manner
reasonably acceptable to the Buyer, necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement. Buyer will keep the Sellers reasonably informed

<PAGE>

with respect to the status of its efforts to arrange and complete the Financing,
including, without limitation, with respect to the occurrence of any event which
Buyer believes may have a materially adverse effect on the ability of Buyer to
arrange and complete the Financing; provided that Buyer shall not be obligated
to accept terms not reasonably satisfactory to it. The Sellers shall cooperate
with Buyer to arrange and complete the Financing. Prior to the distribution of
any offering memorandum by Buyer with respect to any Financing, Buyer shall
submit to Sellers those portions of the offering memorandum which relate to
Sellers, the Eldorado Entities or the Business for Sellers' approval and such
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

         6.11 Exclusivity. The Sellers shall not (and the Sellers shall not
allow any of the Eldorado Entities or any of their directors, officers,
employees, agents, affiliates or representatives, including investment bankers,
financial advisors, attorneys and accountants to (collectively,
"Representatives")) directly or indirectly, take any of the following actions:
(i) solicit, initiate, facilitate or knowingly encourage, or furnish information
with respect to any of the Eldorado Entities or the Business in connection with,
any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person with respect to any merger,
consolidation or other business combination or acquisition (other than the
transaction contemplated in this Agreement) involving any of the Eldorado
Entities or the acquisition of all or a substantial portion of the assets of, or
any securities of, any of the Eldorado Entities or any tender offer or exchange
offer (an "Acquisition Transaction"); (ii) negotiate, discuss, explore or
otherwise communicate or cooperate in any way with any third party with respect
to any Acquisition Transaction; (iii) enter into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding with respect to an Acquisition Transaction or requiring any of the
Sellers and/or any of the Eldorado Entities to abandon, terminate or refrain
from consummating the transactions contemplated in this Agreement; or (iv) make
or authorize any statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of any
Acquisition Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers shall have
the right to advise any person with whom they are engaged in discussions or
negotiations relating to a potential Acquisition Transaction that the Sellers
have entered into exclusive negotiations regarding the sale of the Securities,
provided that they shall not disclose the proposed Purchase Price or the
identity of Buyer. The Sellers shall, and shall cause their Representatives to,
notify Buyer promptly after (and in any event no later than 24 hours) receipt of
any written inquiry, offer or proposal with respect to an Acquisition
Transaction, including information as to the identity of the party or offeror
making such inquiry, offer or proposal.

         6.12 Debt; Warrants. At the Closing and subject to obtaining the
Financing, the Buyer shall provide, or cause to be provided, funds necessary for
Eldorado to repay all amounts, including principal and interest, outstanding
under the Credit Agreement and the Notes. In connection with such repayment,
Eldorado, at the Closing, shall (i) cause the lenders under each of the Credit
Agreement and the Notes to release Eldorado, the Subsidiaries and each of their
respective Affiliates (and any other Person bound by the Credit Agreement and/or
the Notes) from any and all obligations under such agreements, (ii) cause such
lenders to file all documents and filings in or with all local, state and
federal jurisdictions or authorities releasing any and all liens any lenders may
have on the tangible or intangible assets or properties of Eldorado or any of
the Eldorado Entities and (iii) cause such lenders to return the Warrants,

<PAGE>

marked "Cancelled," to Eldorado. All such releases, filings and documentation
shall be in the form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer and shall be
hereafter referred to collectively as the "the Releases."

         6.13 Non-Solicitation.

                  (a) Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, for a
period of two years from the Closing Date, none of the Sellers nor their
Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly, or through an Affiliate, (i) cause or
seek to cause any individual who was an employee of any of the Eldorado Entities
at any time, to terminate his or her employment with any of the Eldorado
Entities, or (ii) interfere in any other way with the employment, or other
relationship, of any employee of any of the Eldorado Entities; provided,
however, that Michael Lewis may serve on the board of directors of one or more
of the portfolio companies of Graham Partners, Inc. and its affiliates, provided
further that this restriction shall not apply to any general or public
solicitation by any of the Sellers or a third party or if any employee initiates
discussions with any of the Sellers on his or her behalf.

                  (b) The Sellers agree that the Buyer's remedies at law for any
breach or threat of breach by it of any of the provisions of this Section 6.13
will be inadequate, and that, in addition to any other remedy to which the Buyer
may be entitled at law or in equity, the Buyer shall be entitled to a temporary
or permanent injunction or injunctions or temporary restraining orders or orders
to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Section 6.13 and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in each case without the need to
post any security or bond. Nothing herein contained shall be construed as
prohibiting the Buyer from pursuing, in addition, any other remedies available
to it for such breach or threatened breach. A waiver by the Buyer of any breach
of any provision hereof shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of a
breach of any other provisions of this Agreement or of any subsequent breach
thereof. The Buyer may for itself and any of the Eldorado Entities assign all of
the rights under this Section 6.13 to any successor to the business of the
Eldorado Entities, including all remedies for breach of this Section 6.13.

                  (c) The parties consider the restrictions contained in this
Section 6.13 hereof to be reasonable for the purpose of preserving the goodwill,
proprietary rights and going concern value of the Eldorado Entities, but if a
final judicial determination is made by a court having jurisdiction that the
time or territory or any other restriction contained in this Section 6.13 is an
unenforceable restriction on the Sellers' activities, the provisions of this
Section 6.13 shall not be rendered void but shall be deemed amended to apply as
to such maximum time and territory and to such other extent as such court may
judicially determine or indicate to be reasonable. Alternatively, if the court
referred to above finds that any restriction contained in this Section 6.13 or
any remedy provided herein is unenforceable, and such restriction or remedy
cannot be amended so as to make it enforceable, such finding shall not affect
the enforceability of any of the other restrictions contained therein or the
availability of any other remedy. The provisions of this Section 6.13 shall in
no respect limit or otherwise affect the Sellers' obligations under other
agreements with any of the Eldorado Entities.

         6.14 Employment Agreements. From the date hereof until the Closing, the
Buyer shall negotiate, in good faith, the terms of employment agreement(s) with
Mike Lewis and such other executives of Eldorado that it deems appropriate. Such

<PAGE>

employment agreement(s) shall address responsibilities, compensation, and other
benefits, provided, however, that Buyer entering into such agreement(s) shall
not be a condition to Closing hereunder.

         6.15 Tax Returns. The Sellers shall file short-period tax returns for
ES Acquisition and Eldorado. The Sellers shall prepare or cause to be prepared
and timely filed all necessary federal and state income tax returns for ES
Acquisition and Eldorado for the period beginning on January 1, 2004 and ending
on Closing Date ("Short Period Returns"). The Short Period Returns filed for
Eldorado will properly include the following deductions (i) write-off of costs
associated with hedging transaction provided for in the ISDA (International Swap
Dealers Association, Inc.) Master Agreement between Fleet National Bank and
Eldorado, dated October 22, 2001 that will be unwound at closing, said costs to
be in the amount of approximately $759,000 (ii) write off of capitalized
management fees and financing costs in the amount of approximately $1,843,000;
(iii) net option proceeds in the amount of approximately $3,814,000, which will
be characterized and reported as compensation expenses for federal and state
income tax purposes; and (iv) management bonuses in an amount up to $2,900,000,
which will be characterized and reported as compensation expenses for federal
and state income tax purposes. Eldorado will recognize no income or gain as a
result of the deductions described in this Section 6.15. All items of income,
gain, loss, deduction, and credit will be allocated among the members of
Eldorado on the Short Period Returns in accordance with the limited liability
company agreement of Eldorado as currently in effect - 23.6% StoneCraft, 36.8%
ES Acquisition, 22.2% ES Corp, and 17.4% Northwest. The Sellers and the Buyer
shall "true up" the amount of the deductions set forth in items (i) through (iv)
of this Section (the "Deductions") at Closing by applying the actual amount of
the deductions to the formula set forth in Schedule 2.1 (the "Revised
Calculation"). If the Revised Calculation results in the Tax Benefit from
Expenses total being more or less than $1,476,000 (the "Revised Tax Benefit")
the parties shall adjust the amount of the tax benefit to be paid to Sellers as
set forth in Section 2.1. By way of example, if the Revised Tax Benefit is less
than $1,476,000, the tax benefit to be paid by the Buyer shall be reduced on a
dollar for dollar basis, likewise if the Revised Tax Benefit is more than
$1,476,000, the tax benefit to be paid by the Buyer shall be increased on a
dollar for dollar basis.

         6.16 Other Actions; Notification. Subject to compliance with Law, the
Sellers shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable
each will consult with Buyer on, all information relating to the Business, the
Sellers and the Eldorado Entities that Buyer proposes to include in any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Financing of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement (the "Transactions"), which may include, but not
be limited to a Rule 144A offering memorandum that includes the financial
information set forth in the Financial Statements, as well as pro forma
financial information with respect to the Eldorado Entities, and one or more
related Current Reports on Form 8-K to be filed by Buyer. In exercising the
foregoing right, Sellers shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Sellers shall, upon reasonable request by
Buyer, furnish Buyer with all information concerning itself, the Eldorado
Entities, their directors, officers and stockholders, the Business and such
other matters as may be necessary in connection with any statement, filing,
notice or application made by or on behalf of the Buyer to any third party
and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the Financing. Sellers

thereof. Upon Buyer's written request, the Sellers shall, or shall cause the
Eldorado Entities to, at any time prior to Closing confirm, to their Knowledge,
the existence or absence of any facts identified by Buyer that would make it
necessary or advisable to supplement or amend any materials containing

which financial statements have been reviewed by such accountants, (b) deliver
to Buyer's underwriters, placement agent or lenders, as the case may be, a
Comfort Letter addressed to such entities covering any financial information of
the Eldorado Entities used in connection with Buyer's efforts to arrange and
complete the Financing, and (c) grant any consents required under the Securities
Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended, in
connection with the filing by Buyer of reports or financial statements of the

Commission.

         6.18 KMPG SEC Audit. The Sellers shall cause the Eldorado Entities to

Buyer audited financial statements (income statements, balance sheet, statements
of shareholder equity and cash flow statements) audited by KPMG LLP in
compliance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, for the periods ending December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003 (the

the Sellers and/or the Eldorado Entities compliance with this section shall be
shared equally between the Sellers and the Buyer.

                  (a) by Buyer or Sellers if the Closing has not occurred by

the part of the party acting to terminate this Agreement;

                  (b) by mutual written consent of Buyer and Sellers;

                  (c) by Buyer, if any representation or warranty of Sellers
made in or pursuant to this Agreement is untrue or incorrect in any material
respect, Sellers materially breach the covenants or other terms of this
Agreement, or any one or more of the conditions precedent to Closing contained
in Section 7 are not satisfied, provided that any such breach has not been (i)
waived by Buyer or (ii) cured by Sellers within 30 days after written notice
thereof to Sellers from Buyer;

                  (d) by Sellers, if any representation or warranty of Buyer

or circumstance that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Business;

                  (f) by either Buyer or the Sellers if any court or

decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently enjoining, restraining or

<PAGE>

otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and such
Order, decree or ruling or other action shall have become final and
nonappealable; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section shall not be available to any party who has not used
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Order, decree or ruling to be
lifted;

                  (g) by Sellers if Sellers shall have received notice from

adverse effect on the ability of Buyer to arrange and complete the Financing.

         10.2 Procedure for Termination. A party terminating this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.1 shall give written notice thereof to each other party

                          SECTION 11. INDEMNIFICATION.

         11.1 Indemnity.

                  (a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 11,
each Seller severally, but not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer
and its officers, directors, employees, stockholders, representatives, agents,
successors and assigns, from and against any Loss or Losses sustained or
required to be paid by Buyer resulting from (i) any misrepresentation or breach
of any representation or warranty made by such Seller in this Agreement and any
other agreement, instrument or other document necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein, including the Schedules, or (ii) any breach of
or failure to perform any covenant, agreement or obligation of such Seller
contained in this Agreement and any other agreement, instrument or other
document necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated herein.

                  (b) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 11,
Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and their respective officers,
directors, employees, stockholders, members, representatives, agents, successors
and assigns from and against any Loss or Losses sustained or required to be paid
resulting from (i) any misrepresentation or breach of any representation or
warranty made by Buyer in this Agreement and any other agreement, instrument or
other document necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated herein,
(ii) any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation of Buyer contained in
this Agreement and any other agreement, instrument or other document necessary
to consummate the transactions contemplated herein, or (iii) any efforts by the
Buyer to arrange and complete the Financing or any filing by or on behalf of the
Buyer in connection therewith, including any omission or alleged omission to
state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, except, with respect to this subsection

<PAGE>

(iii), to the extent that any such untrue statement or omission was made in
reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to Buyer by
any Seller specifically for use therein, and such information was, to the
Knowledge of Eldorado, untrue at the time it was provided.

                  (c) (i) In the event that any indemnified party is entitled to
indemnification with respect to any Loss or potential Loss arising from any
Proceeding, judicial or administrative, instituted by any third party (any such
third-party Proceeding being referred to as a "Third-Party Claim"), the
indemnified party shall give the indemnifying party prompt notice thereof. Any
failure or delay on the part of the indemnified party to give such notice shall
not affect whether an indemnifying party is liable for reimbursement except and
to the extent that the indemnifying party is prejudiced thereby. The
indemnifying party shall be entitled to control, contest and defend such
Third-Party Claim. Notice of the intention so to contest and defend shall be
given by the indemnifying party to the indemnified party within 20 business days
after the indemnified party's notice of such Third-Party Claim (but, in all
events, at least ten business days prior to the date that an answer to such
Third-Party Claim is due to be filed). Such contest and defense shall be
conducted by counsel chosen by the indemnifying party. So long as the
indemnifying party is conducting the defense of the Third-Party Claim in
accordance with this Section 11.1(c)(i), the indemnified party shall be
entitled, at its own cost and expense (which expense shall not constitute a Loss
unless counsel for the indemnified party advises in writing that there is a
conflict of interest, and only to the extent that such expenses are reasonable),
to participate in, but not control, such contest and defense and to be
represented by attorneys of its or their own choosing reasonably acceptable to
the indemnifying party, provided that the indemnified party will cooperate with
the indemnifying party in the conduct of such defense. Neither the indemnified
party nor the indemnifying party may concede, settle or compromise any
Third-Party Claim without the consent of the other party, which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except that the indemnifying party may
settle a Third-Party Claim if the indemnifying party obtains a full release of
all underlying claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a settlement offer
solely for money damages is made by the applicable third party claimant, and the
indemnifying party notifies the indemnified party in writing of the indemnifying
party's willingness to accept the settlement offer and pay the amount called for
by such offer, and the indemnified party declines to accept such offer, the
indemnified party may continue to contest such Third-Party Claim, free of
participation by the indemnifying party, and the amount of any ultimate
liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim that the indemnifying party has
an obligation to pay hereunder shall be limited to the lesser of (x) the amount
of the settlement offer that the indemnified party declined to accept or (y) the
aggregate Losses of the indemnified party with respect to such Third-Party
Claim.

                           (ii) In the event any indemnified party has a claim
against any indemnifying party that does not involve a Third-Party Claim, the
indemnified party shall deliver a written notice describing such claim in
reasonable detail to the indemnifying party within 30 days after the discovery
of the basis for such claim.

                           (iii) Any liability resulting from an indemnification
claim made pursuant to this Section 11 against the Sellers for the breach of any
representation or warranty made in this Agreement by the Sellers solely
regarding StoneCraft shall be the responsibility of StoneCraft, any liability
resulting from an indemnification claim made pursuant to this Section 11 against
the Sellers for the breach of any representation or warranty made in this
Agreement by the Sellers solely regarding ES Holdings shall be the

<PAGE>

responsibility of ES Holdings, any liability resulting from an indemnification
claim made pursuant to this Section 11 against the Sellers for breach of any
representation or warranty made in this Agreement by the Sellers solely
regarding Grimmer shall be the responsibility of Grimmer and any liability
resulting from an indemnification claim made pursuant to this Section 11 against
the Sellers for breach of any representation or warranty made in this Agreement
by the Sellers solely regarding ES Acquisition, ES Corp and/or Northwest shall
be the responsibility of ES Holdings and Grimmer.

                  (d) In connection with any indemnification claim by Buyer
under this Agreement, Sellers, collectively shall not be liable in an aggregate
amount which, if added to all other amounts paid as indemnification payments by
the Sellers, would exceed an amount equal to Twenty Million Dollars
($20,000,000) (the "Cap"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall not be
required to indemnify Buyer for any Losses arising under this Section 11 unless
(i) each individual Loss is at least Seventy-Five Thousand dollars ($75,000)
(the "Threshhold") and (ii) until the aggregate amount of all Losses for which
Buyer is otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 11.1
exceeds an amount equal to One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($1,500,000) (the "Basket"). In the event that, at any time, the Buyer's
aggregate Losses for which Buyer is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Section 11.1 exceed the Basket, then the Sellers shall be liable only for Losses
in excess of the Basket; provided however that if the aggregate Losses for which
Buyer is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 11.1 exceed the
Basket the Threshold shall thereafter be reduced to zero dollars ($0) for each
individual Loss. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
Seller shall be liable for its pro rata portion of the indemnification payment
(up to its pro rata portion of the Cap, to the extent applicable), each based on
the percentage of the Purchase Price proceeds received by such Seller set forth
on Schedule 2.1, and in no event in excess of the amount of such proceeds
received by such Seller. Buyer shall not be required to indemnify any Seller for
any Losses arising under Section 11.1(b)(i) or (ii) unless (x) each individual
Loss realized by the Sellers is at least Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000)
("Sellers' Threshold") and (y) until the aggregate amount of all claims for
which the Sellers are otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section
11.1(b)(i) or (ii) exceeds in the aggregate an amount equal to One Million Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000) (the "Sellers' Basket") whereafter Buyer
shall be liable only for Losses in excess thereof; provided however that if the
aggregate Losses for which Sellers are entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Section 11.1(b)(i) or (ii) exceed the Sellers' Basket the Sellers' Threshold
shall thereafter be reduced to zero dollars ($0) for each individual Loss.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, while Buyer may make an
indemnification claim against Sellers under this Section 11 at any time
permitted pursuant to Section 11.2, Buyer shall exhaust any remedies available
to it under any insurance or other contract providing for insurance coverage or
indemnification with respect to such claims, prior to seeking recovery against
Sellers under this Section 11.

                  (e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Loss
otherwise indemnifiable hereunder shall be reduced by any amount actually
recoverable in connection therewith under insurance or the indemnified party
shall, upon receiving full payment for such Loss from the indemnifying party,
assign to the indemnifying party the right to pursue recovery under such
insurance.

                  (f) If an indemnifying party makes any payment under Section
11 in respect of any Losses, such indemnifying party shall be subrogated, to the
extent of such payment, to the rights of the indemnified party against any third

<PAGE>

party (other than the indemnified party's insurers) with respect to such Losses;
provided, however, that such indemnifying party shall not have any rights of
subrogation with respect to any other party hereto or any of their respective
Affiliates or their Affiliates' respective officers, directors, agents or
employees. To the extent the indemnifying party does not have rights of
subrogation against any party as a result of the proviso to the proceeding
sentence, the indemnified party will take commercially reasonable steps to
collect from such third party in respect of such Losses, and will turn over to
the indemnifying party any amounts it receives from such third party in respect
of such Losses (less any and all reasonable costs and expenses associated with
such collection), to the extent of the payment actually made by the indemnifying
party in respect of such Losses.

         11.2 Duration. The obligations set forth in Section 11.1 shall be
unconditional and absolute and remain in effect until a date that is 18 months
from the Closing Date; provided, however, that such obligations shall remain in
effect with respect to the representations and warranties of Sellers set forth
in Sections 4.9 (Taxes) and 4.16 (Employee Benefit Plans) until a date that is
three years from the Closing Date; provided, further, that such obligations
shall continue beyond such periods with respect to any claims made against any
indemnifying party during such periods that are not resolved at the conclusion
of such periods.

         11.3 Exclusive Remedy. Buyer and Sellers acknowledge and agree that,
from and after the Closing, the foregoing indemnification provisions in this
Section 11 shall be the exclusive remedy of Buyer and Sellers with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that nothing set forth
herein shall be deemed to limit any party's rights or remedies in the event that

         13.6 Assignment and Benefit.

                  (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties and their respective permitted successors and permitted
assigns. Neither this Agreement, nor any of the rights hereunder or thereunder,
may be assigned by any party, nor may any party delegate any obligations
hereunder or thereunder, without the written consent of the other party hereto
or thereto; provided, however, that Buyer may assign this Agreement to one or
more of its directly or indirectly owned subsidiaries and such assignment shall
not release Buyer or Sellers from any of their covenants or obligations under
this Agreement. Any non-permitted assignment or attempted assignment shall be
void.

                  (b) This Agreement shall not be construed as giving any
Person, other than the parties hereto and their permitted successors, heirs and
assigns, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of
this Agreement or any of the provisions herein contained, this Agreement and all
provisions and conditions hereof being intended to be, and being, for the sole
and exclusive benefit of such parties, and permitted successors, heirs and
assigns and for the benefit of no other Person or entity.

         13.7 Amendment, Modification and Waiver. The parties may amend or
modify this Agreement in any respect. Any such amendment or modification shall
be in writing. The waiver by a party of any breach of any provision of this
Agreement shall not constitute or operate as a waiver of any other breach of
such provision or of any other provision hereof, nor shall any failure to
enforce any provision hereof operate as a waiver of such provision or of any
other provision hereof.

         13.8 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction. This Agreement is made
pursuant to, and shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (and United States federal Law, to the extent
applicable), irrespective of the principal place of business, residence or
domicile of the parties hereto, and without giving effect to otherwise
applicable principles of conflicts of law. Any legal action, suit or Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement may be instituted in any federal
court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania or in any state court in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and each party waives any objection which such
party may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such action,
suit or Proceeding, and irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any such
court. Any and all service of process and any other notice in any such action,
suit or Proceeding shall be effective against any party if given as provided
herein. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to affect the right of any
party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law or to commence legal

<PAGE>

proceedings or otherwise proceed against any other party in any jurisdiction
other than Pennsylvania. Nothing contained herein or in any Transaction Document
shall prevent or delay Buyer from seeking, in any court of competent
jurisdiction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in the event of
any breach or intended breach by Sellers of any of their obligations hereunder.

         13.9 Section Headings and Defined Terms. The section headings contained
herein are for reference purposes only and shall not in any way affect the
meaning and interpretation of this Agreement. Except as otherwise indicated, all
agreements defined herein refer to the same as from time to time amended or
supplemented or the terms thereof waived or modified in accordance herewith and
therewith.

         13.10 Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
particular provision, or part of any provision, of this Agreement shall not
affect the other provisions or parts hereof, and this Agreement shall be
construed in all respects as if such invalid or unenforceable provisions or
parts were omitted.

         13.11 Counterparts. This Agreement and the other documents required to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original (including facsimile
signatures); and any Person may become a party hereto by executing a counterpart
hereof, but all of such counterparts together shall be deemed to be one and the
same instrument. It shall not be necessary in making proof of this Agreement or
any counterpart hereof to produce or account for any of the other counterparts.
The parties hereto may deliver this Agreement and the other documents required
to consummate the transactions contemplated herein by telecopier
machine/facsimile, provided that the original signature pages are promptly
delivered to each party to this Agreement, and each party shall be permitted to
rely upon the signatures so transmitted to the same extent and effect as if they
were original signatures.

         13.12 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Schedules,
the Confidentiality Agreement dated December 12, 2003, by and between Eldorado
and Buyer and the agreements, exhibits, schedules and certificates referred to
herein or delivered pursuant hereto, constitute the entire agreement between the
parties hereto with respect to the purchase and sale of the Securities and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings. The submission of a draft of
this Agreement or portions or summaries thereof does not constitute an offer to
purchase or sell the Securities, it being understood and agreed that neither
Buyer nor Sellers shall be legally obligated with respect to such a purchase or
sale or to any other terms or conditions set forth in such draft or portion or
summary unless and until this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
all parties.

         13.13 Additional Parties. Any Person who becomes a Member of Eldorado
subsequent to the date of this Agreement by virtue of exercising an option or a
warrant to purchase Eldorado Units may become a party to this Agreement by
signing the signature page hereto. Such Person shall be deemed to be a Seller,
with all rights and obligations as such, as of the date such Person executes a
signature page hereto.

         13.14 Retention of Counsel. In any dispute or proceeding arising under
or in connection with this Agreement, including, without limitation, Sections
2.3 and 11.1 hereof, Sellers shall have the right, at their election, to retain
the firm of Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP and Ervin, Cohen & Jessup LLP to
represent them in such matter and Buyer, for itself and the Eldorado Entities
and for its and the Eldorado Entities' successors and assigns, hereby

<PAGE>

irrevocably waives and consents to any such representation in any such matter
and the communication by such counsel to Sellers in connection with any such
representation of any fact known to such counsel arising by reason of such
counsel's prior representation of Sellers or the Eldorado Entities. Buyer, for
itself and the Eldorado Entities, and its and the Eldorado Entities' successors
and assigns, hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all communications
between Sellers and their counsel, including, without limitation, Drinker Biddle
& Reath LLP and Ervin, Cohen & Jessup LLP, made in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and closing under, or any dispute
or proceeding arising under or in connection with this Agreement which,
immediately prior to the Closing, would be deemed to be privileged
communications of the Sellers and their counsel and would not be subject to
disclosure to the Buyer in connection with any process relating to a dispute
arising under or in connection with this Agreement or otherwise, shall continue
after the Closing to be communications between Sellers and such counsel and
neither Buyer nor any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through Buyer,
shall seek to obtain the same by any process on the grounds that the privilege
attaching to such communications belongs to the Eldorado Entities and not the
Sellers. Other than as explicitly set forth in this Section 13.14, the parties
acknowledge that any attorney-client privilege attaching as a result of legal
counsel representing the Eldorado Entities prior to the Closing shall survive
the Closing and continue to be a privilege of the Eldorado Entities, and not the
Sellers, after the Closing.

<PAGE>

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties hereto has duly executed this
Agreement, under seal, all as of the date first above written.
