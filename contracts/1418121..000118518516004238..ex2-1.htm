RECITALS

  

  

WHEREAS, each of (i) the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company
Board"), based on the unanimous recommendation of a special transaction
committee thereof consisting solely of independent directors of the Company
(the "Company Special Committee"), and (ii) the Board of Directors of Parent
(the "Parent Board"), as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, has determined
that it is advisable and in the best interest of the Company and its
shareholders and Parent and its shareholders, respectively, to consummate the
transactions described herein, pursuant to which the Company will merge with
and into Merger Sub (the "Merger"), and Merger Sub will be the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") in such Merger and the issued and
outstanding capital stock of the Company will be converted into the right to
receive the merger consideration provided herein.

  

  

WHEREAS, as an inducement to the Company to enter this Agreement, concurrent
with the execution of this Agreement, Glade M. Knight ("Mr. Knight") has
entered into a voting agreement with the Company, attached hereto as Exhibit A

subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable
Law) of such conditions), or at such other place, time and date as shall be
agreed in writing by the Company and Parent; provided, however, that Parent

to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of such
conditions) have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law)

ARTICLE II

  

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK

  

OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

  

  

Section 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock.

  

  

(a) By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
of any outstanding capital stock of the Company:

  

  

(i) Merger. At the Effective Time, (a) each issued and outstanding common
share, no par value, of the Company (including any fractional shares) (the
"Company Common Shares") together with the related Series A Preferred Share,
no par value, of the Company (including any fractional shares) (the "Company
Series A Shares," and together with the Company Common Shares, the "Company
Units") (other than the Dissenting Shares or any Company Shares to be
cancelled pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iii)) shall be converted into the right
to receive (x) 0.522 (the "Unit Exchange Ratio") Parent Common Shares (the
"Unit Stock Consideration") and (y) $1.00 in cash (the "Per Unit Cash
Consideration"), and (b) each issued and outstanding Series B Convertible
Preferred Share, no par value, of the Company (the "Company Series B Shares"
and together with the Company Units, the "Company Shares") shall be converted
into the right to receive (x) a number of Parent Common Shares equal to (1)
12.11423 multiplied by (2) the Unit Exchange Ratio (the "Series B Stock
Consideration", and together with the Unit Stock Consideration, the "Stock
Consideration") and (y) an amount equal to 12.11423 multiplied by $1.00 in
cash (the "Series B Cash Consideration", and together with the Per Unit Cash
Consideration, the "Cash Consideration"). For purposes of this Agreement,
"Merger Consideration" shall mean the aggregate of the Stock Consideration and
the Cash Consideration.

  

  

(ii) Fractional Shares. No fractional Parent Common Shares shall be issued
with respect to the Merger. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of Company Shares converted pursuant to the Merger who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent Common
Share shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash, without interest, in an amount
equal to such fractional part of a Parent Common Share multiplied by the VWAP
of Parent Common Shares (the "Fractional Share Consideration"). For purposes
of this Agreement "VWAP of Parent Common Shares" shall mean the volume
weighted average price of Parent Common Shares for the ten (10) day trading
period ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date,
as reported by Bloomberg.

  

  

(iii) Cancellation of Shares. Each Company Share (including any fractional
Company Share), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
that is owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-3-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iv) All Company Shares converted pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i), when so
converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (including the Fractional Share
Consideration) and any dividends or other distributions to which holders may
be entitled in accordance with Section 2.2(e), without interest.

  

  

(b) Surviving Corporation. By virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, each common share, no par value, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
outstanding as a duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
common share, no par value, of the Surviving Corporation to the Merger, so
that thereafter Parent will be the sole and exclusive owner of the outstanding
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(c) Stock Options. The Company shall take all requisite action so that at the
Effective Time, each outstanding option issued by the Company pursuant to any
of the Company Stock Incentive Plans (a "Company Stock Option") whether or not
exercisable at the Effective Time, will be assumed by Parent by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof. Subject to,
and in accordance with, the terms of the applicable Company Stock Incentive
Plan including any applicable award agreement evidencing such Company Stock
Option, from and after the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option so
assumed by Parent under this Agreement will otherwise continue to have, and be
subject to, the same terms and conditions (including vesting schedule) as were
applicable to the corresponding Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time as set forth in the applicable Company Stock Incentive Plan
(including any applicable award agreement, evidencing such Company Stock
Option) immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that, from and after
the Effective Time, (A) each Company Stock Option, when exercisable, will be
exercisable for that number of whole Parent Common Shares equal to the product
of the number of Company Common Shares that were subject to such Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Equity
Exchange Factor, rounded down to the nearest whole number of Parent Common
Shares and (B) the per share exercise price for the Parent Common Shares
issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Stock Option will be equal to
the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price of each Company Common
Share subject to such assumed Company Stock Option by the Equity Exchange
Factor, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the conversion of the Company Stock Options into options to purchase Parent
Common Shares is intended to conform with and shall be made in accordance with
the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D).

  

  

(d) Certain Adjustments.

  

  

(i) If, before the Effective Time (and as permitted by ARTICLE IV), the
outstanding Company Shares shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or a different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split,
reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event
shall have occurred, then the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately and
proportionately adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Shares the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-4-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) If, before the Effective Time (and as permitted by ARTICLE IV), the
outstanding Parent Common Shares shall have been changed into a different
number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or any
similar event shall have occurred, then the Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately and proportionately adjusted to provide to the holders of
Company Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such event.

  

  

Section 2.2 Exchange Procedures.

  

  

(a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank
or trust company, which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act
as paying agent and exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the exchange of
the issued and outstanding Company Shares for the Merger Consideration.

  

  

(b) Exchange Fund. At or before the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or
cause Merger Sub to deposit, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of Parent
Common Shares in book-entry form issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i) equal
to the aggregate Stock Consideration (excluding any Fractional Share
Consideration), and (ii) cash in immediately available funds in an amount
sufficient to pay the Cash Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration,
and any dividends or distributions to which holders of Company Shares may be
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) (such evidence of book-entry Parent Common
Shares and cash amounts, the "Exchange Fund"), in each case for the benefit of
the holders of Company Shares. Promptly after the Closing Date in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Section 2.2(c), Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the
Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of the Merger Consideration, including
payment of the Fractional Share Consideration, and any dividends or
distributions to which holders of Company Shares may be entitled pursuant to
Section 2.2(e), out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement.
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly
provided for in this Agreement.

  

  

(c) Exchange Procedures.

  

  

(i) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and in no event later
than two Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record of outstanding Company Shares that were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i): (A) a
letter of transmittal ("Letter of Transmittal"), in customary form and with
such other provisions as reasonably agreed upon by the Company and Parent
prior to the Effective Time, which shall specify, among other things, that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Shares
represented by certificate ("Certificates") or Company Shares registered in
the transfer books of the Company in book-entry ("Book-Entry Shares") shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or transfer of any Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent; and
(B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or the
transfer of Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-5-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) Upon (A) surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or transfer of any Book-Entry Share to the Exchange Agent, together
with a properly completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal or (B)
receipt of an "agent's message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence,
if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case
of transfer of a Book-Entry Share, and such other documents as may reasonably
be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each Company Share formerly represented by such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE II plus any
Fractional Share Consideration that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.1(a)(ii) and any amounts that such
holder has the right to receive in respect of dividends or distributions to
which holders of Company Shares may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e), by
mail or by wire transfer after the Exchange Agent's receipt of such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or "agent's message" or
other evidence, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) so
surrendered or the Book-Entry Share so transferred, as applicable, shall be
forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with
such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to
effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with customary exchange
practices. Until surrendered or transferred as contemplated by this Section
2.2, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, at any time after
the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive, upon such
surrender, the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this ARTICLE II. No
interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration or the
Fractional Share Consideration payable upon the surrender of the Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares and any dividends or distributions to which such holder
may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e).

  

  

(iii) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, it shall be a condition of
payment that any Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or transferred in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.2 shall be properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the
Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer Taxes and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
Book-Entry Share transferred, or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not
applicable.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-6-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
any interest and income received with respect thereto and any Fractional Share
Consideration and any applicable dividends or other distributions with respect
to Parent Common Shares) that remains undistributed to the former holders of
Company Shares for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any former holders of Company Shares
prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE II
shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (and only
as general creditors thereof) for payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration, subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and other
similar Laws.

  

  

(e) No Further Ownership Rights in Capital Stock of the Company. The Merger
Consideration (including the Fractional Share Consideration) issued upon
exchange of the Company Shares in accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE II
shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Company Shares, subject, however, to the obligation of the
Surviving Corporation to pay, without interest and not more than 60 days
following the Effective Time, any dividends or make any other distributions
with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or
made by the Company on the Company Shares in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at
the Effective Time and have not been paid prior to such exchange, and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Company of the Company Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

  

  

(f) No Liability. None of the Company, Merger Sub, Parent or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

  

  

(g) Withholding Rights. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Shares
such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as
the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company
Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

  

  

Section 2.3 Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, holders of Company Shares who have properly exercised, perfected
and not subsequently withdrawn or lost their appraisal rights with respect
thereto in accordance with Article 15 of the VSCA (the "Dissenting Shares")
shall not have any of such Dissenting Shares converted into the right to
receive, or become exchangeable for, the Merger Consideration. The holders of
such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to obtain payment of the fair value
of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Article 15 of
the VSCA unless and until such holders fail to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost their dissenters' rights under Article 15 of the
VSCA. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, each of such holder's
Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if it had been converted into
the right to receive, and become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the
Merger Consideration, as provided in Section 2.1(a)(i) hereof. Parent shall be
responsible for all payments to be made under Article 15 of the VSCA in
respect of Dissenting Shares.

Time, any of the parties hereto reasonably believes or is advised that any
further instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary
or desirable to consummate the Merger or to carry out the purposes and intent
of this Agreement at or after the Effective Time, then the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation and their respective officers and
directors shall execute and deliver all such proper instruments, deeds,
assignments or assurances and do all other things reasonably necessary or
desirable to consummate the Merger and to carry out the purposes and intent of
this Agreement.

Commonwealth of Virginia and has the requisite corporate power and authority
to operate its assets and properties and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted. The Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business and
is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business
or the ownership, operations or leasing of its properties makes such
qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good
standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

  

  

(b) Company Subsidiaries. Schedule 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter
sets forth each Subsidiary of the Company and its respective jurisdiction of
formation, each owner and the respective amount of such owner's equity
interest in such Subsidiary, and a list of each jurisdiction in which such
Subsidiary is qualified or licensed to do business and each assumed name under
which such Subsidiary conducts business in any jurisdiction. All the
outstanding shares of capital stock of each Subsidiary of the Company that is
a corporation have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid and
nonassessable and are owned by the Company, by another Subsidiary of the
Company or by the Company and another Subsidiary of the Company, free and
clear of all pledges, claims, liens, charges, encumbrances and security
interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, "Liens"), other than
Permitted Liens, and other than Permitted Liens, free of any preemptive rights
or any other limitation or restriction (including any limitation or
restriction on the right to vote, sell, transfer, register or otherwise
dispose of the shares), and all equity interests in each Subsidiary of the
Company that is a partnership, limited liability company or business trust are

the Company. Each Subsidiary of the Company that is a corporation is duly
incorporated and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and authority to carry on
its business as now being conducted, and each Subsidiary of the Company that
is a partnership, limited liability company or business trust is duly
organized and validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization and has the requisite power and authority to
carry on its business as now being conducted. Each Subsidiary of the Company
is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership, operation
or leasing of its properties makes such qualification, licensing or good
standing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be
so qualified, licensed or in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except for interests in the
Subsidiaries of the Company and investments in short-term investment
securities, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company owns
directly or indirectly any capital stock or other interest (equity or debt) in
any other Person.

(ii) the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, and
(iii) the number of shares of capital stock of the Company reserved for
issuance upon exercise of the outstanding Company Stock Options under the
Company Stock Incentive Plans. All outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Company are, and all shares of capital stock reserved for issuance by the
Company will be upon issuance in accordance with the terms specified in the
instruments or agreements pursuant to which they are issuable, duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. None of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are subject to or were

right. Schedule 3.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter is a true and complete
list, as of the date hereof, of all outstanding Company Stock Options under
the Company Stock Incentive Plans, the number of shares of capital stock
subject to each such option, the exercise price, date of grant and the names
and of holders thereof. Each such option was granted in compliance in all

Series B Shares. All dividends or distributions on securities of the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company that have been declared or authorized prior

the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or any of their respective
officers or directors is a party concerning the voting, sale, transfer or
registration of any capital stock or other equity securities of the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company.

  

  

(d) Authority; Noncontravention; Consents.

  

  

(i) (A) The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to enter
into this Agreement and, subject to receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval, to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by

and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company and, except for the filing of the Articles of Merger with the State
Corporation Commission of the Commonwealth of Virginia, no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate such transactions, subject to receipt of the
Company Shareholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and constitutes valid and binding obligations of the
Company, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar Laws relating
to creditors' rights and general principles of equity, whether considered in a
proceeding at law or in equity.

(B) The Company Special Committee, at a meeting duly called and held, has by
unanimous vote of all its members recommended that the Company Board approve
and adopt this Agreement, the Plan of Merger and the Ancillary Agreements to
which the Company is a party and determined that the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, are advisable and in the best interests of, the
shareholders of the Company. The Company Board, based on the unanimous
recommendation of the Company Special Committee, has (i) determined that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are advisable, and in the best
interests of the Company and the shareholders of the Company, and (ii)
approved and adopted this Agreement, the Plan of Merger and the Ancillary
Agreements to which the Company is a party and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, including the Merger, and directed that this Agreement and
the Plan of Merger be submitted to a vote by the Company's shareholders. The
Company Board has not subsequently rescinded or modified, in any way, its
determinations and approvals discussed above.

  

  

(ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance by it
with the provisions of this Agreement will not, conflict with, or result in
any violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or require any consent, approval or notice under, or
give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
material obligation or loss of a material benefit under, or result in the
creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company under, or result in the triggering of any
payments pursuant to, (A) the Company Organizational Documents, (B) any loan

agreement, license agreement, Permit or other agreement or instrument
applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or their respective
properties or assets, (C) subject to the governmental filings and other
matters referred to in Section 3.1(d)(iii), any Laws applicable to the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company, or their respective properties or assets,
other than, in the case of clause (B) or (C), any such conflicts, violations,
defaults, rights or Liens that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
(1) have a Company Material Adverse Effect or (2) reasonably be expected to
otherwise prevent the Company from performing its obligations under this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(iii) No material consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, any federal, state or local
government or any court, administrative or regulatory agency or commission,
governmental arbitrator or other governmental authority, instrumentality or
agency, domestic or foreign (a "Governmental Entity"), is required by or with
respect to the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company or the consummation by
it of any of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for (A) the filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") of (1) the preliminary
and definitive Joint Proxy Statement relating to the Company Shareholder

Merger with the State Corporation Commission of the Commonwealth of Virginia,

approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings (1)
as are set forth on Schedule 3.1(d)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Letter or
(2) which, if not obtained or made, would not reasonably be expected to

other transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise prevent the Company from
performing its obligations under this Agreement in any material respect.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-11-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) SEC Documents; Financial Statements.

  

  

(i) The Company has filed with the SEC all reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents required to be filed by the Company since
January 1, 2014 (as amended through the date hereof, the "Company SEC
Documents"). All of the Company SEC Documents (other than preliminary
material), as of their respective filing dates, were prepared in all material
respects in accordance with, and complied in all material respects with, all
applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Documents.
None of the Company SEC Documents, at the time of filing, contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except
to the extent such statements have been modified or superseded by Company SEC
Documents later filed by the Company. The Company does not have any
outstanding and unresolved comments from the SEC with respect to any of the
Company SEC Documents. No Subsidiary of the Company is subject to the periodic
reporting requirements of the Exchange Act or is otherwise required to file
any forms, reports, schedules, statements or other documents with the SEC, any
foreign Governmental Entity that performs a similar function to that of the
SEC or any securities exchange or quotation service. The Company has made
available to Parent copies of all material correspondence between the SEC, on
the one hand, and the Company and any of the Subsidiaries of the Company, on
the other hand, since January 1, 2014 through the date of this Agreement. At
all applicable times, the Company has complied in all material respects with
the applicable certification requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
and rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as amended from time to time
(the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-12-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited consolidated
interim financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries included or
incorporated by reference in the Company SEC Documents (including, in each
case, any notes thereto) complied, as of their respective dates of filing with
the SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto
(including, without limitation, Regulation S-X), were prepared in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") (except, in the
case of unaudited interim financial statements, as permitted by Forms 10-Q or
8-K of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods and at the
dates involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly
present the consolidated financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole as of the dates thereof and consolidated results
of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case
of unaudited interim financial statements, to the absence of notes and normal
year-end adjustments). The books of account and other financial records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries are accurately reflected in all material respects
in the financial statements included in the Company SEC Documents. The Company
has no Subsidiary which is not consolidated for accounting purposes.

  

  

(iii) There are no material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data. The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act) designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company,
including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer. The Company has evaluated
the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Company SEC Documents
that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto, its
conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by such report or amendment based on such
evaluation. To the Company's Knowledge, such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in timely alerting the Company's principal executive
officer and principal financial officer to information required to be included
in the Company's periodic reports required under the Exchange Act. Since the
enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of
the Company has made any prohibited loans to any director or executive officer
of the Company (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act).

  

  

(iv) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand), or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act), where the
result, purpose or effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries in the Company's or its Subsidiaries' published financial
statements or any of the Company SEC Documents.

(f) Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as disclosed in the Company
SEC Documents, since December 31, 2015 (the "Financial Statement Date") and
through the date of this Agreement, (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries have
conducted their respective businesses only in the ordinary course consistent
with past practices and there has not been a Company Material Adverse Effect,
nor has there been any occurrence or circumstance that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had, or would with the passage of time reasonably be expected
to result in, a Company Material Adverse Effect, and (ii) none of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries have taken any action that, if taken after the date
hereof, would be in violation of Section 4.1.

  

  

(g) Litigation. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened material Legal Action or material investigation pending by a
Governmental Entity against or affecting (i) the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company or any asset of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or
(ii) any director, officer or employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company or other Person for whom the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
may be liable, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of
any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company. Other than pursuant to the Company Organizational
Documents, no Contract between the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company,
on the one hand, and any current or former director, officer, employee or
shareholder (or equivalent interest holder) of the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company, on the other hand, exists that provides for indemnification.

  

  

(h) Taxes.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-14-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) The Company and each Subsidiary of the Company have timely filed all
material Tax Returns and reports required to be filed by it (after giving
effect to any filing extension properly granted by a Governmental Entity
having authority to do so). All such Tax Returns are true, correct and
complete in all material respects. Neither the Company nor any other Person on
behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company has requested any
extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return, which material
Tax Return has not yet been filed. The Company and each Subsidiary of the
Company have paid (or the Company has paid on their behalf), within the time
and manner prescribed by Law, all material Taxes shown as due and payable on
such Tax Returns. The most recent financial statements contained in the
Company SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement
reflect an adequate reserve or accrued liabilities or expenses for all Taxes
due and payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries as a group for all taxable
periods and portions thereof through the date of such financial statements,
except for failures to reflect adequate reserves that would not in the
aggregate be material. The Company and its Subsidiaries (as a group) have
established on their books and records (which may, but are not required to, be
reflected only on the books and records of the Company) reserves or accrued
liabilities or expenses that are adequate for the payment of all material
Taxes for which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is liable but
which are not yet due and payable. The Company has incurred no material
liability for any Taxes under Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code or
Treasury Regulation Sections 1.337(d)-5, 1.337(d)-6 or 1.337(d)-7, including,
without limitation, any Tax arising from a prohibited transaction described in
Section 857(b)(6) of the Code and the excise tax on redetermined rents,
redetermined deductions, redetermined TRS service income, and excess interest
under Section 857(b)(7) of the Code; and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred any material liability for Taxes other than in the
ordinary course of business and other than transfer or similar Taxes arising
in connection with the sale of property. No event has occurred, and no
condition or circumstances exists, which presents a material risk that any
material Tax described in the preceding sentences will be imposed on the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company. No material deficiencies for Taxes
have been asserted or assessed in writing by a Governmental Entity against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no requests for waivers of the time to
assess any such Taxes have been granted and remain in effect or are pending.
No material written claim is pending or proposed by any Governmental Entity in
any jurisdiction where the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company do not
file Tax Returns that the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is or may
be subject to taxation by such jurisdiction. Copies of all material Tax
Returns with respect to taxable years commencing on or after the taxable year
ending December 31, 2010 have been delivered to or made available to
Representatives of Parent. For purposes of this Agreement, "Taxes" shall mean
all taxes, charges, fees, levies and other assessments, including income,
gross receipts, excise, property, sales, withholding (including dividend
withholding and withholding required pursuant to Sections 1445 and 1446 of the
Code), social security, occupation, use, service, license, payroll, franchise,
transfer and recording taxes, windfall or other profits, capital stock,
employment, worker's compensation, unemployment or compensation, estimated,
excise, ad valorem, stamp, value added, capital gains, duty or custom taxes,
fees, charges or assessments, imposed by the U.S. or any Governmental Entity,
whether computed on a separate, consolidated, unitary, combined or any other
basis, and similar charges of any kind, however denominated (together with any
and all interest, penalties, additions to tax and other additional amounts
imposed with respect thereto) imposed by any Governmental Entity and "Tax
Return" shall mean any return, declaration, report, election, estimate, claim
for refund, or information return or statement relating to Taxes, including
any schedule or attachment thereto, and including any amendment thereof.

  

  

(ii) The Company (A) for all of its taxable years beginning with the Company's
taxable year ending December 31, 2011 through the most recent December 31, has
been subject to taxation as a real estate investment trust under the Code
within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code ("REIT") and has satisfied the
requirements to qualify as a REIT for such years, (B) has operated, and
intends to continue to operate, in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT upon
closing of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (C) has not taken or
omitted to take any action which could reasonably be expected to result in a
challenge by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") to its status as a REIT,
and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no such challenge is pending or
threatened in writing. Each Subsidiary of the Company that files Tax Returns
as a partnership (or as a disregarded entity), for U.S. federal income tax
purposes has, since inception, been classified for federal income tax purposes
as a partnership (or as a disregarded entity) and not as a corporation or as
an association taxable as a corporation, or a "publicly traded partnership"
within the meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code that is treated as a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7704(a) of the
Code. Each Subsidiary of the Company that is a corporation has been, since its
formation, classified as a qualified REIT subsidiary under Section 856(i) of
the Code ("Qualified REIT Subsidiary"), a taxable REIT subsidiary under
Section 856(l) of the Code ("Taxable REIT Subsidiary") or a REIT.

(iii) (A) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company is a party to
any material pending action or proceeding, including any audit or contest, by
any Governmental Entity with regard to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company; (B) no material written claim for assessment or
collection of Taxes has been asserted against the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company; (C) there are no audits pending with or proposed in writing by
any taxing authority with respect to any material Taxes or Tax Returns of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company; (D) neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary of the Company has requested, received or is subject to a private
letter ruling or similar written ruling or determination of a taxing authority
or has entered into any written agreement with a taxing authority with respect
to any Taxes; and (E) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company
has applied for or entered into any "closing agreement" as described in
Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law).

  

  

(iv) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company holds any asset the
disposition of which, if occurring in a fully taxable transaction immediately
following the Closing, would be subject to (or to rules similar to) Section
337(d) or 1374 of the Code or the regulations thereunder (assuming for this
purpose that the "recognition period," as defined in Section 1374, is in all
cases 5 years) or to the "prohibited transactions" Tax under Section
857(b)(6), nor has it disposed of any such asset during its current taxable
year.

  

  

(v) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company (A) is or has been
at any time a member of an affiliated consolidated, combined or unitary group
(other than a group the common parent of which is the Company or a directly or
indirectly wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company) and (B) has any liability
for the Taxes of any other person other than the Company and such Subsidiaries
of the Company under Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision
of state, local or foreign Law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or
otherwise.

otherwise has the right to use all Intellectual Property as currently used in

(a) as disclosed in the Parent Disclosure Letter, with numbering corresponding
to the numbering of this Section 3.2 (it being acknowledged and agreed that
disclosure of any item in any Section or subsection of the Parent Disclosure
Letter with respect to any Section or subsection of this Section 3.2 shall be
deemed disclosed with respect to any other Section or subsection of this
Section 3.2 to the extent the applicability of such disclosure is reasonably
apparent (it being understood that to be so reasonably apparent it is not
required that the other Sections be cross-referenced); provided that nothing
in the Parent Disclosure Letter is intended to broaden the scope of any
representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub made herein and no
reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in the Parent
Disclosure Letter shall be construed as an admission or indication that (1)
such item or other matter is material, (2) such item or other matter is
required to be referred to in the Parent Disclosure Letter or (3) any breach
or violation of applicable Laws or any contract, agreement, arrangement or
understanding to which Parent, Merger Sub or any of the Subsidiaries of Parent
is a party exists or has actually occurred), or (b) as disclosed in the Parent
SEC Documents publicly available, filed with, or furnished to, as applicable,
the SEC on or after January 1, 2014 and prior to the date of this Agreement
(excluding any risk factor disclosures contained in such documents under the
heading "Risk Factors" and any disclosure of risks or other matters included
in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or other statements that are

representation or warranty set forth in this Section 3.2), Parent and Merger
Sub represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

  

  

(a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power; Subsidiaries.

  

  

(i) Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia
and has the requisite corporate power and authority to operate its assets and
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership, operations or leasing of its properties makes such qualification,
licensing or good standing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where
the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(ii) All the outstanding shares of capital stock of each Parent Subsidiary
that is a corporation have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully
paid and nonassessable and are owned by Parent, by another Parent Subsidiary
or by Parent and another Parent Subsidiary, free and clear of all Liens, other
than Permitted Liens, and other than Permitted Liens, free of any preemptive
rights or any other limitation or restriction (including any limitation or
restriction on the right to vote, sell, transfer, register or otherwise
dispose of the shares), and all equity interests in each Parent Subsidiary
that is a partnership, limited liability company or business trust are owned
by Parent, by another Parent Subsidiary, or by Parent and another Parent
Subsidiary, free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens, and other
than Permitted Liens, free of any preemptive rights or any other limitation or
restriction (including any limitation or restriction on the right to vote,
sell, transfer, register or otherwise dispose of the equity interests). There
are no outstanding options, warrants or other rights to acquire ownership
interests of or from any Parent Subsidiary. Each Parent Subsidiary that is a
corporation is duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and
authority to carry on its business as now being conducted, and each Parent
Subsidiary that is a partnership, limited liability company or business trust
is duly organized and validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
its jurisdiction of organization and has the requisite power and authority to
carry on its business as now being conducted. Each Parent Subsidiary is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership, operation
or leasing of its properties makes such qualification, licensing or good
standing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be
so qualified, licensed or in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Except for interests in the
Parent Subsidiaries and investments in short-term investment securities,
neither the Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary owns directly or indirectly any
capital stock or other interest (equity or debt) in any other Person.

(i) The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of 800,000,000 common
shares, no par value ("Parent Common Shares"), and 30,000,000 preferred

174,665,236 Parent Common Shares were issued and outstanding, (B) no Parent
Preferred Shares were issued and outstanding, (C) 860,154 Parent Common Shares

reserved for issuance under the Parent 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan. All
outstanding Parent Common Shares are, and all Parent Common Shares reserved
for issuance will be, upon issuance in accordance with the terms specified in
the instruments or agreements pursuant to which they are issuable, duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. None of the
outstanding Parent Common Shares are subject to or were issued in violation
of, and none of the Parent Common Shares reserved for issuance will be, upon

Parent Stock Option was granted in compliance in all material respects with
all applicable Laws and all of the terms and conditions of the Parent Stock
Incentive Plans pursuant to which it was issued. On the date of this
Agreement, except as set forth above in this Section 3.2(c)(i), no shares of
capital stock or other voting securities of Parent were issued, reserved for
issuance or outstanding. All outstanding shares of capital stock of Parent are
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject
to preemptive rights. Except (A) for the Parent Common Shares and the Parent
Stock Options, and (B) as otherwise permitted under Section 4.2, there are no
outstanding securities, options, stock appreciation rights, warrants, calls,
rights, commitments, agreements, arrangements or undertakings of any kind to
which Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent is a party or by which such entity is
bound, obligating Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent to issue, deliver or
sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital
stock, voting securities or other ownership interests of Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent or obligating Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent to
issue, grant, extend or enter into any such security, option, warrant, call,
right, commitment, agreement, arrangement or undertaking. There are no
outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other Indebtedness of Parent having
the right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having
the right to vote) on any matter on which holders of Parent Common Shares may
vote. There are no outstanding agreements to which Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent or any of their respective officers or directors is a party concerning
the voting, sale, transfer or registration of any capital stock or other
equity securities of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent. All dividends or
distributions on securities of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent that have
been declared or authorized prior to the date of this Agreement have been paid
in full (except to the extent such dividends or distributions have been
publicly announced and are not yet due and payable).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-30-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) The Parent Common Shares to be issued in exchange for the Company Shares
in the Merger, when issued in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, with no
personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof and subject to no
preemptive rights.

  

  

(c) Authority; Noncontravention; Consents.

  

  

(i) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the requisite corporate power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and, subject to receipt of the Parent
Shareholder Approval, to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Parent and Merger Sub and, except for the
filing of the Articles of Merger with the State Corporation Commission of the
Commonwealth of Virginia, no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent
or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate such
transactions, subject to receipt of the Parent Shareholder Approval. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger
Sub and constitutes valid and binding obligations of each of Parent and Merger
Sub, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar Laws relating
to creditors' rights and general principles of equity, whether considered in a
proceeding at law or in equity.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-31-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do
not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
compliance by it with the provisions of this Agreement will not, conflict
with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or require any consent, approval or
notice under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any material obligation or loss of a material benefit under,
or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent under, or result in the triggering of any
payments pursuant to, (A) the Parent Organizational Documents, (B) any loan or
credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, franchise agreement,
license agreement, Permit or other agreement or instrument applicable to
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent or their respective properties or assets,
(C) subject to the governmental filings and other matters referred to in
Section 3.2(c)(iii), any Laws applicable to Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent, or their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of
clause (B) or (C), any such conflicts, violations, defaults, rights or Liens
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

  

  

(iii) No material consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity, is required
by or with respect to Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent in connection with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or the
consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, except for (A) the filings with the SEC of (1) the Form S-4 relating
to the issuance of the Merger Consideration, (2) the preliminary and
definitive Joint Proxy Statement relating to the Parent Shareholder Meeting
for the Parent Shareholder Approval, and (3) such reports under the Exchange
Act as may be required in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) as may be required
under the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), (C)
the filing of Articles of Merger with the State Corporation Commission of the
Commonwealth of Virginia, (D) such filings with Governmental Entities to
satisfy the applicable requirements of the laws of states in which Parent and
any Subsidiary of Parent are qualified or licensed to do business, as set
forth on Schedule 3.2(c)(iii) of the Parent Disclosure Letter and (E) such
other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations
and filings (1) as are set forth on Schedule 3.2(c)(iii) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter or (2) which, if not obtained or made, would not reasonably
be expected to prevent or delay in any material respect the consummation of
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise prevent
Parent from performing its obligations under this Agreement in any material
respect.

  

  

(d) SEC Documents; Financial Statements.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-32-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) Parent has filed with the SEC all reports, schedules, forms, statements
and other documents required to be filed by Parent since January 1, 2014 (as
amended through the date hereof, the "Parent SEC Documents"). All of the
Parent SEC Documents (other than preliminary material), as of their respective
filing dates, were prepared in all material respects in accordance with, and
complied in all material respects with, all applicable requirements of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC Documents.
None of the Parent SEC Documents, at the time of filing, contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except
to the extent such statements have been modified or superseded by later filed
Parent SEC Documents. Parent does not have any outstanding and unresolved
comments from the SEC with respect to any of the Parent SEC Documents. No
Subsidiary of Parent is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the
Exchange Act or is otherwise required to file any forms, reports, schedules
statements or other documents with the SEC, any foreign Governmental Entity
that performs a similar function to that of the SEC or any securities exchange
or quotation service. Parent has made available to the Company copies of all
material correspondence between the SEC, on the one hand, and Parent and any
of the Subsidiaries of the Parent, on the other hand, since January 1, 2014
through the date of this Agreement. At all applicable times, Parent has
complied in all material respects with the applicable certification
requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  

  

(ii) The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited consolidated
interim financial statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries included or
incorporated by reference in the Parent SEC Documents (including, in each
case, any notes thereto) complied, as of their respective dates of filing with
the SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto
(including, without limitation, Regulation S-X), were prepared in accordance
with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, as
permitted by Forms 10-Q or 8-K of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis
during the periods and at the dates involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto) and fairly present the consolidated financial condition of
Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole as of the dates thereof and
consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended
(subject, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, to the
absence of notes and normal year-end adjustments). The books of account and
other financial records of Parent and its Subsidiaries are accurately
reflected in all material respects in the financial statements included in the
Parent SEC Documents. Parent has no Subsidiary which is not consolidated for
accounting purposes.

  

  

(iii) There are no material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect Parent's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
data. Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) designed
to ensure that material information relating to Parent, including its
consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to its principal executive officer
and principal financial officer. Parent has evaluated the effectiveness of its
disclosure controls and procedures and, to the extent required by applicable
Law, presented in any applicable Parent SEC Documents that is a report on Form
10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto, its conclusions about the
effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
period covered by such report or amendment based on such evaluation. To the
Knowledge of Parent, such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
timely alerting Parent's principal executive officer and principal financial
officer to information required to be included in Parent's periodic reports
required under the Exchange Act. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has made any prohibited loans to any
director or executive officer of Parent (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the
Exchange Act).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-33-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iv) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person,
on the other hand), or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in
Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act), where the result,
purpose or effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in Parent's or its Subsidiaries' published financial statements
or any of the Parent SEC Documents.

  

  

(e) Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as disclosed in the Parent
SEC Documents, since the Financial Statement Date and through the date of this
Agreement, (i) Parent and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective
businesses only in the ordinary course consistent with past practices and
there has not been a Parent Material Adverse Effect, nor has there been any
occurrence or circumstance that, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or
would with the passage of time reasonably be expected to result in, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, and (ii) none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
have taken any action that, if taken after the date hereof, would be in
violation of Section 4.2.

  

  

(f) Litigation. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened
material Legal Action or material investigation pending by a Governmental
Entity against or affecting (i) Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent or any
asset of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent or (ii) any director, officer or
employee of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent or other Person for whom Parent
or any Subsidiary of Parent may be liable, nor is there any judgment, decree,
injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding
against Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent. Other than pursuant to the Parent
Organizational Documents, no Contract between Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent, on the one hand, and any current or former director, officer, employee
or shareholder (or equivalent interest holder) of Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent, on the other hand, exists that provides for indemnification.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-34-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(g) Taxes.

  

  

(i) Parent and each Subsidiary of Parent have timely filed all material Tax
Returns and reports required to be filed by it (after giving effect to any
filing extension properly granted by a Governmental Entity having authority to
do so). All such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in all material
respects. Neither Parent nor any other Person on behalf of Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent has requested any extension of time within which to file
any material Tax Return, which material Tax Return has not yet been filed.
Parent and each Subsidiary of Parent have paid (or Parent has paid on their
behalf), within the time and manner prescribed by Law, all material Taxes
shown as due and payable on such Tax Returns. The most recent financial
statements contained in the Parent SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to
the date of this Agreement reflect an adequate reserve or accrued liabilities
or expenses for all Taxes due and payable by Parent and the Subsidiaries of
Parent as a group for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the
date of such financial statements, except for failures to reflect adequate
reserves that would not in the aggregate be material. Parent and its
Subsidiaries (as a group) have established on their books and records (which
may, but are not required to, be reflected only on the books and records of
Parent) reserves or accrued liabilities or expenses that are adequate for the
payment of all material Taxes for which Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent is
liable but which are not yet due and payable. Parent has incurred no material
liability for any Taxes under Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code or
Treasury Regulation Sections 1.337(d)-5, 1.337(d)-6 or 1.337(d)-7, including,
without limitation, any Tax arising from a prohibited transaction described in
Section 857(b)(6) of the Code and the excise tax on redetermined rents,
redetermined deductions, redetermined TRS service income, and excess interest
under Section 857(b)(7) of the Code; and neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred any material liability for Taxes other than in the
ordinary course of business and other than transfer or similar Taxes arising
in connection with the sale of property. No event has occurred, and no
condition or circumstances exists, which presents a material risk that any
material Tax described in the preceding sentences will be imposed on Parent or
any Subsidiary of Parent. No material deficiencies for Taxes have been
asserted or assessed in writing by a Governmental Entity against Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, and no requests for waivers of the time to assess any
such Taxes have been granted and remain in effect or are pending. No material
written claim is pending or proposed by any Governmental Entity in any
jurisdiction where Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent do not file Tax Returns
that Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent is or may be subject to taxation by
such jurisdiction.

  

  

(ii) Parent (A) for all of its taxable years beginning upon the first taxable
year ending December 31, 2008 through the most recent December 31, has been
subject to taxation as a REIT under the Code within the meaning of Section 856
of the Code and has satisfied the requirements to qualify as a REIT for such
years, (B) has operated, and intends to continue to operate, in such a manner
as to qualify as a REIT upon closing of the transactions contemplated hereby,
and (C) has not taken or omitted to take any action which could reasonably be
expected to result in a challenge by the IRS to its status as a REIT, and, to
Parent's Knowledge, no such challenge is pending or threatened in writing.
Each Subsidiary of Parent that files Tax Returns as a partnership (or as a
disregarded entity), for U.S. federal income tax purposes has, since
inception, been classified for federal income tax purposes as a partnership
(or as a disregarded entity) and not as a corporation or as an association
taxable as a corporation, or a "publicly traded partnership" within the
meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code that is treated as a corporation for
U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7704(a) of the Code. Each
Subsidiary of Parent that is a corporation has been, since its formation,
classified as a Qualified REIT Subsidiary, a Taxable REIT Subsidiary or a
REIT.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-35-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iii) (A) Neither Parent nor any Subsidiary of Parent is a party to any
material pending action or proceeding, including any audit or contest, by any
Governmental Entity with regard to Taxes or Tax Returns of Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent; (B) no material claim for assessment or collection of
Taxes has been asserted against Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent; (C) there
are no audits pending with or proposed in writing by any taxing authority with
respect to any material Taxes or Tax Returns of Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent; (D) neither Parent nor any Subsidiary of Parent has requested,
received or is subject to a private letter ruling or similar written ruling or
determination of a taxing authority or has entered into any written agreement
with a taxing authority with respect to any Taxes; and (E) neither Parent nor
any Subsidiary of Parent has applied for or entered into any "closing
agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or
similar provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law).

  

  

(iv) Neither Parent nor any Subsidiary of Parent holds any asset the
disposition of which, if occurring in a fully taxable transaction immediately
following the Closing, would be subject to (or to rules similar to) Section
337(d) or 1374 of the Code or the regulations thereunder (assuming for this
purpose that the "recognition period," as defined in Section 1374, is in all
cases 5 years) or to the "prohibited transactions" Tax under Section
857(b)(6), nor has it disposed of any such asset during its current taxable
year.

  

  

(v) Neither Parent nor any Subsidiary of Parent (A) is or has been at any time
a member of an affiliated consolidated, combined or unitary group (other than
a group the common parent of which is Parent or a directly or indirectly

shall cause its respective Subsidiaries not to, take any action that would
reasonably be expected to result in any of the representations and warranties
of such party set forth in this Agreement becoming untrue such that the
conditions to the Merger set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.3(a), as the
case may be, would not be satisfied by the Outside Date.

  

  

Section 4.4 Control of Other Party's Business

indirectly, the right to control the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or

prior to the Effective Time. Nothing contained in this Agreement will give the
Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or direct the business or operations of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
Parent and the Company will exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its respective
operations and the operations of its respective Subsidiaries. Nothing in this
Agreement, including any of the actions, rights or restrictions set forth
herein, will be interpreted in such a way as to place any of Parent or the
Company in violation of any applicable Law.

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

  

  

Section 5.1 Preparation of the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy
Statement; Shareholder Meetings.

  

  

(a) The Company and Parent shall cooperate and use commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly prepare, for inclusion in the Form S-4, a proxy statement
with respect to each of the Company Shareholder Meeting and the Parent
Shareholder Meeting in connection with the Merger (the "Joint Proxy
Statement") as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement.
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file with the
SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (the "Form S-4") under the Securities
Act with respect to the Parent Common Shares issuable in the Merger, in which
the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall
furnish all information concerning such party and its Affiliates to the other
(including, in the case of the Company, the Company Special Committee), and
provide such other assistance as may reasonably be requested by Parent or the
Company (including the Company Special Committee) in connection with the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy
Statement. The respective parties will cause the Joint Proxy Statement and the
Form S-4 to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. The Company and Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under
the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable and to keep the Form
S-4 effective as long as necessary to the consummate the transactions
contemplated herein. Parent shall take all action required to be taken under
any applicable state securities or "Blue Sky" laws in connection with the
issuance of the Parent Common Shares or the assumption of the Company Stock
Options in the Merger and in connection with the reservation for issuance of
Parent Common Shares that will be subject to Company Stock Options as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action, and the Company shall
furnish all information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action. Except for annual,
quarterly and current reports filed or furnished with the SEC under the
Exchange Act, which may be incorporated by reference therein (but subject to
Section 5.6), no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 and no
response to SEC comments thereon shall be made by Parent without the Company's
prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) and without providing the Company the opportunity to review and
comment thereon, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good
faith consideration to any comments thereon made by the Company and its
counsel. Parent will advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective or any supplement
or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of
the qualification of the Parent Common Shares issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any oral or written
request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or
comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional
information, and will promptly provide the others with copies of any written
communication from the SEC or any state securities commission. Each of the
Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Joint
Proxy Statement or the Form S-4. If at any time prior to the Effective Time
any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective
affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent or any
Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to (i) the
Form S-4 so that it would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement so that it would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the
Company. All filings by each of Parent and the Company with the SEC in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including all mailings
to the shareholders of each of Parent and the Company in connection with the
Merger and transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall be subject to
the reasonable prior review and comment by each of Parent and the Company
(including the Company Special Committee).

Organizational Documents, establish a record date, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (including any adjournments or
postponements thereof, the "Company Shareholder Meeting") for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval. As promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act,
the Company will cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to its
shareholders and hold the Company Shareholder Meeting. Except to the extent
that the Company Board (based on the recommendation of the Company Special
Committee) shall have withdrawn, qualified or modified its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger in compliance with Section
5.4(d), Section 5.4(e) and Section 5.4(g), the Company Board shall recommend
to holders of the Company Shares that they approve the Merger, the Plan of
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall
include such recommendations in the Joint Proxy Statement (the "Company
Recommendation"). Subject to Section 5.4(d), Section 5.4(e) and Section
5.4(g), the Company will use reasonable best efforts to solicit or cause to be
solicited from the shareholders of the Company proxies in favor of the
approval of the Merger, the Plan of Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and will take all other action necessary or
advisable to secure the vote or consent of the shareholders of the Company
required by applicable Law to obtain such approvals. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 5.1(b), if, on the date for which the
Company Shareholder Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of Company Shares to obtain the Company
Shareholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, the Company shall
have the right to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments
(but in no event beyond the date that is two Business Days prior to the
Outside Date) of the Company Shareholder Meeting solely for the purpose of and
for the times reasonably necessary to solicit additional proxies in favor of
the Merger, the Plan of Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval.

postponements thereof, the "Parent Shareholder Meeting") for the purpose of
obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approval. As promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act,
Parent will cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to its shareholders
and hold the Parent Shareholder Meeting. Except to the extent the Parent Board
shall have withdrawn, qualified or modified its approval or recommendation of
the issuance of the Parent Common Shares to be issued in the Merger in
compliance with Section 5.5(b), the Parent Board shall recommend to holders of
the Parent Common Shares that they approve the issuance of the Parent Common
Shares to be issued in the Merger and shall include such recommendations in
the Joint Proxy Statement (the "Parent Recommendation"). Subject to Section
5.5(b), Parent will use reasonable best efforts to solicit or cause to be
solicited from the shareholders of Parent proxies in favor of the approval of
the issuance of the Parent Common Shares to be issued in the Merger and will
take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of
the shareholders of Parent required by applicable Law to obtain such
approvals. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.1(c),
if, on the date for which the Parent Shareholder Meeting is scheduled, Parent
has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of Parent Common
Shares to obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is
present, Parent shall have the right to make one or more successive
postponements or adjournments (but in no event beyond the date that is two
Business Days prior to the Outside Date) of the Parent Shareholder Meeting
solely for the purpose of and for the times reasonably necessary to solicit
additional proxies in favor of the issuance of the Parent Common Shares to be
issued in the Merger to obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval.

approval for the listing of such Parent Common Shares, subject only to
official notice of issuance; and

  

  

(ii) cooperate with each other in obtaining a written opinion of its
respective legal counsel, Hogan Lovells US LLP, in the case of Parent, and
McGuireWoods LLP, in the case of the Company ("Tax Counsel"), substantially in
the forms attached hereto as Exhibit E (each such opinion, a "Tax Opinion"),
dated as of the Effective Time, to the effect that, on the basis of facts,
representations and assumptions set forth in such opinion, the Merger will be
treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with each Tax
Counsel and shall deliver to each Tax Counsel for purposes of each Tax Opinion
customary representations and covenants, including those contained in
certificates of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and others.

Representatives and Affiliates.

Company Recommendation. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Go Shop
Bidder" shall mean any Person (including its controlled Affiliates and
Representatives) that submits a proposal or offer regarding an Acquisition
Proposal not later than the Go Shop Period End Time that has not been
withdrawn and that the Company Special Committee determines prior to the Go
Shop Period End Time (or in the case of any Acquisition Proposal received less
than two (2) Business Days before the date of the Go Shop Period End Time, not
later than two (2) Business Days after the Go Shop Period End Time), has
resulted in, or would be reasonably expected to result in, a Superior
Proposal. No later than one (1) Business Day after the Go Shop Period End
Time, the Company shall notify Parent in writing of the identity of each Go
Shop Bidder and provide to Parent (x) a copy of any related Acquisition
Proposal made in writing and any other written material terms or proposals
provided (including, to the extent not included therein, a copy of the
acquisition agreement and any related transaction documents and financing
commitments, if any) to the Company or any Company Subsidiary and (y) a
written summary of the material terms of any related Acquisition Proposal not
made in writing (including any material terms proposed orally or
supplementally).

(b) Except as permitted by, and subject to, Section 5.4(d), Section 5.4(e) and
Section 5.4(g), and except with respect to a Go Shop Bidder, from and after
the Go Shop Period End Time, the Company shall not, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries not to, and shall not authorize or permit any of its
Representatives to, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or facilitate
any inquiries or the making of any proposal, offer or other action that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any Person, or furnish to any Person other
than Parent any non-public information, in furtherance of such inquiries or to
obtain an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) release any Person from or fail to
enforce any standstill agreement or similar obligation to the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries of the Company, (iv) withdraw, modify or amend the Company
Recommendation in any manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub or fail to make
the Company Recommendation or fail to include the Company Recommendation in
the Joint Proxy Statement, (v) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition
Proposal (any event described in clause (iv) or this clause (v), whether taken
by the Company Board or a committee thereof, a "Company Change in
Recommendation"), (vi) enter into any agreement in principle, arrangement,
understanding, contract or agreement (whether binding or not) contemplating or
otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or (vii) take any action to
exempt any Person from any Takeover Statute or similar restrictive provision
of the Company Organizational Documents. For the avoidance of doubt, after the
Go Shop Period End Time until the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval,
the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives may
continue to take any of the actions described in Section 5.4(a) with respect
to any proposals or offers regarding any Acquisition Proposal submitted by a
Go Shop Bidder on or before the Go Shop Period End Time or with respect to any
amended or modified proposal or offer with respect to any such Acquisition
Proposal submitted by a Go Shop Bidder after the Go Shop Period End Time if
the Company Special Committee has determined in good faith following
consultation with its legal and financial advisors that such Acquisition
Proposal (as may be amended or modified) is or is reasonably expected to lead
to a Superior Proposal; provided that a Go Shop Bidder shall cease to be a Go
Shop Bidder if the negotiations between the Company and such Go Shop Bidder
with respect to the Acquisition Proposal that resulted in such Go Shop Bidder
becoming a Go Shop Bidder shall have been terminated. The Company agrees that
in the event any Representative of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company takes any action that, if taken by the Company, would constitute a
material violation of this Section 5.4(b), then the Company shall be deemed to
be in violation of this Section 5.4(b) for all purposes of this Agreement.

(c) Except as permitted by, and subject to, Section 5.4(b), Section 5.4(d),
Section 5.4(e) and Section 5.4(g), after the Go Shop Period End Time, the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives to, immediately cease any discussions, negotiations or
communications with any Person (other than Go Shop Bidders and Parent) with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal and
immediately terminate all physical and electronic data room access previously
granted to any such Person (other than Go Shop Bidders and Parent).

  

  

(d) If, from and after the Go Shop Period End Time and prior to receipt of the
Company Shareholder Approval, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
which has not been initiated, solicited, encouraged or facilitated in
violation of Section 5.4(b), and which the Company Special Committee has
determined in good faith following consultation with its legal and financial
advisors is or is reasonably expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, the
Company and its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives
thereafter may take the following actions (but only if and to the extent that
the Company Special Committee determines in good faith following consultation
with its legal advisors that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law:
(i) furnish, make available or provide access to non-public information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person who made such
Acquisition Proposal and such Person's Representatives (provided that the
Company (A) has previously furnished, made available or provided access to
such non-public information to Parent and (B) furnishes, makes available or
provides access to such non-public information pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement), (ii) participate in negotiations regarding such
Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) disclose to the shareholders of the Company
any information required to be disclosed under applicable Law; provided,
however, that in the case of this clause (iii) such disclosure shall be deemed
to be a Company Change in Recommendation if not accompanied by an express
public re-affirmation of the Company Recommendation. From and after the Go
Shop Period End Time, in the event the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective Representatives receives from a Person (including a Go
Shop Bidder) or group of related Persons (x) an Acquisition Proposal or an
amended or modified proposal or offer with respect to any such Acquisition
Proposal, (y) any request for information relating to the Company or its
Subsidiaries from a Person who informs the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that it is considering making or has made an Acquisition Proposal or (z) any
inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition
Proposal, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of (but in no event more
than 48 hours following) such receipt. Such notification shall include, to the
extent then known, the identity of the parties and a copy of such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry or request or, if not made in writing, a written description
of the material terms thereof. The Company shall keep Parent apprised on a
current basis of (and in any event no later than 24 hours after) any material
developments, discussions and negotiations concerning, any such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry or request, including by furnishing copies of any
documentation and written correspondence that supplements or amends any such
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, but subject to the preceding three sentences,
nothing herein shall prohibit the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives from contacting in writing any Person submitting an
Acquisition Proposal (that was not the result of a violation of this Section
5.4) solely to clarify the terms of the Acquisition Proposal for the sole
purpose of the Company Board (or the Company Special Committee) informing
itself about such Acquisition Proposal. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, after the date of this Agreement, enter into any
confidentiality agreement that would prohibit it from providing such
information to Parent.

(e) At any time prior to receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, the
Company Board may, if the Company Board determines in good faith after
consultation with its legal advisor (and based on the recommendation of the
Company Special Committee) that the failure to do so would reasonably be
likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the
Company under applicable Law, (i) upon receipt by the Company of an
Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal (whether or not from
a Go Shop Bidder), make a Company Change in Recommendation (and the Company
may so terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(c)(ii) of this
Agreement and enter into an agreement relating to, or for the implementation
of, such Superior Proposal); or (ii) otherwise make a Company Change in
Recommendation in response to a Company Intervening Event; provided that

  

  

(A) in the case of a Company Change in Recommendation under clause (i) of this
Section 5.4(e), (1) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from the
Company's breach of its obligations under this Section 5.4, and (2) the
Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its legal
and financial advisors (and based on the recommendation of the Company Special
Committee), that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal
and, after consultation with its legal advisor, that the failure of the
Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(c)(ii) or
make a Company Change in Recommendation, as the case may be, would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company
under applicable Law, taking into account all adjustments to the terms of this
Agreement that may be offered by Parent pursuant to Section 5.4(e)(D);

  

  

(B) in the case of a Company Change in Recommendation under clause (ii) of
this Section 5.4(e), the Company Board has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its legal advisor (and based on the recommendation of the
Company Special Committee), that failure of the Company to make a Company
Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law, taking into account all
adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be offered by Parent
pursuant to Section 5.4(e)(D);

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-58-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(C) the Company has notified Parent in writing that the Company Board intends
to make a Company Change in Recommendation or enter into an agreement related
to the Superior Proposal, attaching the most current version of such agreement
(including any amendments, supplements or modifications) to such notice (a
"Company Change Notice"); and

  

  

(D) during the five (5) Business Day period following Parent's receipt of a
Company Change Notice, the Company shall have offered to negotiate with (and,
if accepted, negotiated in good faith with), and shall have caused its
respective financial and legal advisors to offer to negotiate with (and, if
accepted, negotiate in good faith with), Parent in making adjustments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement such that (1) in circumstances
involving or relating to an Acquisition Proposal, the Superior Proposal ceases
to be a Superior Proposal; provided that any amendment, supplement or
modification to any Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed a new Acquisition
Proposal and the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(c) or make a Company Change in Recommendation pursuant to clause (i) of
this Section 5.4(e) unless the Company has complied with the requirements of
this Section 5.4(e) with respect to each such new Acquisition Proposal
including sending a Company Change Notice with respect to each such new
Acquisition Proposal (except that the new negotiation period under this
Section 5.4(e)(D) shall be three (3) Business Days instead of five (5)
Business Days), and (2) in circumstances not involving an Acquisition
Proposal, as may be proposed by Parent.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding any Company Change in Recommendation, unless such Company
Change in Recommendation is with respect to a Superior Proposal and the
Company terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(c)(ii) of
this Agreement, the Company shall cause the approval of the Merger, the Plan
of Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby to be submitted to a
vote of the Company's shareholders at the Company Shareholder Meeting.

  

  

(g) Nothing in this Section 5.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prevent
the Company Board or the Company, directly or indirectly, from (i) taking and
disclosing to the shareholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, making any required disclosure to the shareholders of
the Company under applicable Law, including Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or (ii) making any disclosure
to the shareholders of the Company if the Company Board determines in good
faith after consultation with its legal advisors (and based on the
recommendation of the Company Special Committee) that the failure to do so
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the
Company under applicable Law; provided, however, that to the extent any such
disclosure addresses the approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by the Company Board with respect to this Agreement or an
Acquisition Proposal, such disclosure shall be deemed to be a Company Change
in Recommendation if not accompanied by an express public re-affirmation of
the Company Recommendation.

Section 5.5 Parent Change in Recommendation.

  

  

(a) Except as permitted by, and subject to, Section 5.5(b), from and after the
date of this Agreement, Parent shall not withdraw, modify or amend the Parent
Recommendation in any manner adverse to the Company or fail to make the Parent
Recommendation or fail to include the Parent Recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement (such event, whether taken by the Parent Board or a committee
thereof, a "Parent Change in Recommendation").

  

  

(b) At any time prior to receipt of the Parent Shareholder Approval, the
Parent Board may, if the Parent Board determines in good faith after
consultation with its legal and financial advisors that the failure to do so
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of Parent
under applicable Law, make a Parent Change in Recommendation in response to a
Parent Intervening Event; provided that

  

  

(i) the Parent Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
legal and financial advisors, that failure of Parent to make a Parent Change
in Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
shareholders of Parent under applicable Law, taking into account all
adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be offered by the Company
pursuant to Section 5.5(b)(iii);

  

  

(ii) Parent has notified the Company in writing that the Parent Board intends
to make a Parent Change in Recommendation (a "Parent Change Notice"); and

  

  

(iii) during the five (5) Business Day period following the Company's receipt
of a Parent Change Notice, Parent shall have offered to negotiate with (and,
if accepted, negotiated in good faith with), and shall have caused its
respective financial and legal advisors to offer to negotiate with (and, if
accepted, negotiate in good faith with), the Company in making adjustments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement as may be proposed by the Company.

  

  

Section 5.6 Public Announcements. Except (a) with respect to any Company
Change in Recommendation or Parent Change in Recommendation made in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and (b) with respect to disclosures that are
consistent with prior disclosures made in compliance with this Section 5.6,
each of the Company and Parent will consult with the other party (including,
in the case of the Company, the Company Special Committee) before issuing, and
provide executive officers of the other party and, in the case of the Company,
the Company Special Committee, the opportunity to review and comment upon, any
press release or other public statements with respect to the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby, and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except
as may be required by applicable Law, court process or stock exchange rules or
regulations. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued
with respect to the execution of this Agreement will be in the form agreed to
by the parties hereto and approved by the Company Special Committee.

Section 5.7 Transfer Taxes. Each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate in
(a) the preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains,
sales, use, transfer, value added stock transfer and stamp taxes, any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees, any similar taxes and any
related interests, penalties and additions to tax (together, "Transfer Taxes")
which become payable in connection with the Merger and (b) attempting to
minimize the amount of Transfer Taxes. From and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid, without deduction or
withholding from the Merger Consideration, all Transfer Taxes.

(a) Termination of Advisory and Related Party Contracts. On or prior to the

liability to such party, each of the contracts listed on Exhibit C attached
hereto pursuant to a termination agreement entered into on the date hereof, a
copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit D (the "Termination Agreement").

the termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time, the Company shall
continue the suspension of its Unit Redemption Program.

  

  

Section 5.9 Indemnification of Directors, Officers, Employees or Agents of the
Company.

  

  

(a) Indemnification Rights. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
indemnify the present and former directors, officers, employees or agents of
the Company and its Subsidiaries who at any time prior to the Effective Time
were entitled to indemnification under the articles of incorporation or by-
laws of the Company or employment agreements between the Company and its
officers existing on the date hereof to the same extent as such directors,
officers, employees or agents are entitled to indemnification under such
articles of incorporation or by-laws or existing employment agreements in
respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including, without limitation, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement).

  

  

(b) Liability Coverage. The Surviving Corporation shall obtain and maintain
for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time "run-off" or
"tail" director and officer liability coverage for the benefit of the
directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries without reduction
of existing coverage under, and having terms not less favorable to the insured
persons, than the director and officer liability insurance coverage presently
maintained by the Company.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-61-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Articles of Incorporation and By-laws. The articles of incorporation and
by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of present and former directors, officers, employees or agents of
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the
articles of incorporation and by-laws of the Company.

  

  

(d) Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Section 5.9 are intended to
be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each indemnified party,
his or her heirs and his or her personal representatives and shall be binding
on all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation. Parent
agrees to pay all costs and expenses (including fees and expenses of counsel)
that may be incurred by any indemnified party or his or her heirs or his or
her personal representatives in successfully enforcing the indemnity or other
obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.9. The
provisions of this Section 5.9 shall survive the Merger and are in addition to
any other rights to which an indemnified party may be entitled. In the event
that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its business, properties
or assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
a proper provision should be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or
assigns, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.9, which obligations are expressly intended to be for the
irrevocable benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each indemnified party
covered hereby.

  

  

Section 5.10 Litigation. Each of the Company and Parent shall give the other
party the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
shareholder litigation against such party and/or its directors relating to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such
settlement shall be agreed to without the prior written consent of the other
party (with the prior approval of the Company Special Committee in the case of
the Company), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. For purposes of this paragraph, "participate" means that the non-
litigating party will be kept apprised of proposed strategy and other
significant decisions with respect to the litigation by the litigating party,
consistent with the common interest of the Company and Parent in these matters
and the applicable privileges and protections provided therein, and the non-
litigating party may offer comments or suggestions with respect to the
litigation, but will not be afforded any decision making power or other
authority over the litigation except for the settlement consent set forth
above.

  

  

Section 5.11 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the
parties shall take all such steps as may be required to cause (a) any
dispositions of Company Shares (including derivative securities with respect
to Company Shares) resulting from the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, by each individual who will be subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and (b) any acquisitions of Parent
Common Shares (including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common
Shares) resulting from the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, by each individual who may become subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Parent to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.12 Dividends. In the event that a dividend or distribution with
respect to the Company Shares permitted under the terms of this Agreement has
(i) a record date prior to the Effective Time and (ii) has not been paid as of
the Effective Time, the holders of Company Shares shall be entitled to receive
such distribution from the Company immediately prior to the time such shares
are exchanged pursuant to ARTICLE II of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 5.13 FIRPTA Certificate. On the Closing Date, prior to the Merger, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a duly executed certificate, dated as of the
Closing Date, that the Company has been a "domestically controlled qualified
investment entity" within the meaning of Section 897(h)(4)(B) of the Code
during the period during which the Company was in existence, and therefore the
Company Shares are not "United States real property interests" by reason of
the exception provided in Section 897(h)(2) of the Code.

-68-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 7.2 Notice of Termination. A terminating party shall provide written
notice of termination to the other parties specifying with reasonable
particularity the basis of such termination. If more than one provision in

in Section 7.1 for any such termination.

  

  

Section 7.3 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 7.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of any party hereto (or any
Representatives thereof), except that the provisions of Section 5.2(b), this
Section 7.3, Section 7.4 and ARTICLE VIII and the definitions of all defined
terms appearing in such section shall survive any such termination; provided,
however, that, subject to Section 8.10, nothing herein shall relieve any party
hereto from liability for fraud or any willful and material breach of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement prior to such termination, in which case the non-breaching party
shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or in equity.

  

  

Section 7.4 Fees and Expenses.

  

  

(a) Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement (including this Section
7.4), on Schedule 7.4 of the Company Disclosure Letter, or on Schedule 7.4 of
the Parent Disclosure Letter, all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense, whether or not the Merger
is consummated.

  

  

(b) The Company agrees that if this Agreement shall be terminated:

  

  

(i) by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) or Section 7.1(d)(iii);

  

  

(ii) by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii); or

giving rise to such termination (in the case of a termination pursuant to
Section 7.1(d)(i)), (A) (x) in the case of a termination pursuant to Section
7.1(b)(iii), an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not conditional) or an
intention to make an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not conditional) shall
have been made to the Company Board, the Company Special Committee or directly
to the Company's shareholders which proposal (I) has been publicly announced
or otherwise disclosed the Company's shareholders and not publicly withdrawn
prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting, or (y) in the case of a termination
pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i), an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not
conditional) or an intention to make an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not
conditional) shall have been made to the Company Board or the Company Special
Committee or directly to the Company's shareholders or is otherwise publicly

shall be substituted for "20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal);

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-69-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

then, in each such case, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee
or, solely with respect to a termination by the Company pursuant to Section
7.1(c)(ii) or by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) or Section 7.1(d)(iii),

as applicable, payable pursuant to Section 7.4(b)(i); (y) concurrently with,
and as a condition to the effectiveness of, termination, in the case of a
Termination Fee or Go Shop Termination Fee, as applicable, payable pursuant to
Section 7.4(b)(ii); and (z) at the time of consummation of any transaction
contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal, in the case of a Termination Fee
payable pursuant to Section 7.4(b)(iii).

  

  

(c) The Company agrees that if this Agreement shall be terminated by the
Company pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) or by Parent pursuant to Section
7.1(d)(ii) or Section 7.1(d)(iii), in each case in connection with the Company
entering into or recommending a Superior Proposal with a Go Shop Bidder on or
before the date that is fifteen (15) days following the Go Shop Period End

pay, within three (3) Business Days of the Termination Date, to Parent the
Parent Expenses in immediately available funds to an account directed by
Parent.

  

  

(d) Parent agrees that if this Agreement shall be terminated by the Company
pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(iii), then Parent shall pay, within three (3)
Business Days of the Termination Date, to the Company the Termination Fee in
immediately available funds to an account directed by the Company.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, except in the
case of fraud or willful and material breach as expressly set forth in Section
7.3 and subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.10, in the event
that the Termination Fee becomes payable, then such payment shall be Parent's
and its Affiliates' sole and exclusive remedy as liquidated damages for any
and all losses or damages of any nature against the Company and its
Subsidiaries and each of their respective Representatives in respect of this
Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith, and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including for any loss or damage suffered as
a result of the termination of this Agreement, the failure of the Merger to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder (whether
intentionally, unintentionally, or otherwise) or otherwise.

(i) "Go Shop Termination Fee" means an amount equal to Five Million Dollars
($5,000,000).

  

  

(ii) "Parent Expenses" means all reasonable, actual and documented out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred prior to the termination of this Agreement
by or on behalf of Parent (or its Affiliates) in connection with the entering

hereunder, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, investment
banking firms, financial advisors, accountants, and consultants, up to an
aggregate maximum amount of Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000).

  

  

(iii) "Termination Fee" means an amount equal to Twenty-Five Million Dollars
($25,000,000).

  

  

(g) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 7.4 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that without these agreements, the other parties would not
enter into this Agreement. In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the
Go Shop Termination Fee, the Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses or Parent
shall fail to pay the Termination Fee, as the case may be, when due, the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall reimburse Parent or the Company,
as the case may be, for all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or
accrued by Parent or the Company, as the case may be (including reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and
enforcement of this Section 7.4. Further, if the Company or Parent, as the
case may be, fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.4,
and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, for the payment set forth in this Section 7.4, the
Company shall pay to Parent, or Parent shall pay to the Company, as the case
may be, its reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable
and documented attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on such amount at the prime rate as reported in The Wall Street
Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the
date of payment. If payable, none of the Go Shop Termination Fee, the
Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses shall be payable more than once
pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

Section 7.5 Escrow of Termination Fee.

  

  

(a) In the event that the Company or Parent, as the case may be (the "Paying
Party"), is obligated to pay the Termination Fee or the Go Shop Termination
Fee, as the case may be, to the other (the "Fee Recipient"), the Paying Party
shall pay to the Fee Recipient from the Termination Fee or the Go Shop
Termination Fee, as the case may be, deposited into escrow in accordance with
the next sentence, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Termination Fee or
the Go Shop Termination Fee, as the case may be, and (ii) the sum of (1) the
maximum amount that can be paid to the Fee Recipient without causing the Fee
Recipient to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income
described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)(H) or 856(c)(3)(A)(I) of the Code
("Qualifying Income"), as determined by the Fee Recipient's independent
certified public accountants, plus (2) in the event the Fee Recipient receives
either (A) a letter from the its counsel indicating that the Fee Recipient has
received a ruling from the IRS described in Section 7.5(b) or (B) an opinion
from the Fee Recipient's outside counsel as described in Section 7.5(b), an
amount equal to the Termination Fee or the Go Shop Termination Fee, as the
case may be, less the amount payable under clause (1) above. To secure the
Paying Party's obligation to pay these amounts, it shall deposit into escrow
an amount in cash equal to the Termination Fee or the Go Shop Termination Fee,
as the case may be, with an escrow agent selected by the Fee Recipient and on
such terms (subject to Section 7.5(b)) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the
Fee Recipient and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow by the
Paying Party pursuant to this Section 7.5(a) shall be made at the time the
Paying Party is obligated to pay the Fee Recipient such amount pursuant to
Section 7.4 by wire transfer.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-71-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Termination Fee or the Go Shop
Termination Fee, as the case may be, in escrow or any portion thereof shall
not be released to the Fee Recipient unless the escrow agent receives any one
or combination of the following: (i) a letter from the Fee Recipient's
independent certified public accountants indicating the maximum amount that
can be paid by the escrow agent to it without causing it to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the
payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income or a subsequent
letter from the Fee Recipient's accountants revising that amount, in which
case the escrow agent shall release such amount to the Fee Recipient, or (ii)
a letter from the Fee Recipient's counsel indicating that the Fee Recipient
received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by it of the
Termination Fee or the Go Shop Termination Fee, as the case may be, would
either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income
within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (or
alternatively, the Fee Recipient's outside counsel has rendered a legal
opinion to the effect that the receipt by the Fee Recipient of the Termination
Fee or the Go Shop Termination Fee, as the case may be, would constitute
Qualifying Income, would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or would not otherwise disqualify the
Fee Recipient as a REIT), in which case the escrow agent shall release the
remainder of the Termination Fee or the Go Shop Termination Fee, as the case
may be, to the Fee Recipient. The parties hereto agree to amend this Section
7.5 at the request of the Fee Recipient in order to (x) maximize the portion
of the Termination Fee or the Go Shop Termination Fee, as the case may be,
that may be distributed to the Fee Recipient hereunder without causing the Fee
Recipient to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code, (y) improve the Fee Recipient's chances of securing a favorable
ruling described in this Section 7.5(b) or (z) assist the Fee Recipient in
obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside counsel as described in
this Section 7.5(b). The escrow agreement shall also provide that any portion
of the Termination Fee or the Go Shop Termination Fee, as the case may be,
remaining in escrow on the date that is five (5) years after the date the
Termination Fee or the Go Shop Termination Fee, as the case may be, was
deposited into escrow shall be released by the escrow agent to the Fee
Recipient. Any costs and expenses of the escrow agent shall be borne solely by
the Fee Recipient.

  

  

Section 7.6 Amendment; Actions. This Agreement may be amended in writing by
the Company (following the approval of such action by the Company Special
Committees) and Parent at any time before or after the Company Shareholder
Approval is obtained and prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that,
after the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, no such amendment,
modification or supplement shall change (i) the amount or kind of
consideration to be delivered to the Company's shareholders, (ii) the articles
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation except for changes permitted by
Section 13.1-706 of the VSCA or (iii) any of the other terms or conditions of
this Agreement that would adversely affect the shareholders of the Company in
any material respect. From and after the date hereof, the Company Board shall
act solely with the prior approval of the Company Special Committee with
respect to any actions of the Company to be taken with respect to this
Agreement, including any amendment, modification, or waiver of this Agreement.

Section 7.7 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
Company (following approval of such action by the Company Special Committee),
on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of any other party to
this Agreement, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other parties contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject to the proviso of Section
7.6, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other
parties contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of those rights, and no single or partial exercise of
any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or
privilege.

  

  

ARTICLE VIII

its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time.

Section 8.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

  

  

Section 8.5 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement and
the other agreements entered into in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (a) constitute the entire agreement and supersedes all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and (b)
except for the provisions of ARTICLE II and Section 5.9, are not intended to
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies.

  

  

Section 8.6 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflict
of laws thereof.

  

  

Section 8.7 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or delegated,

preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit

Section 8.8 Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that, prior to any termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 7.1, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions

and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the U.S. located in the
Commonwealth of Virginia or in any Virginia state court, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement
is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor
to object to a remedy of specific performance on the basis that a remedy of

Exhibit A

  

  

VOTING AGREEMENT

  

 

 


 

  

This VOTING AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of April 13, 2016, is
entered into by and among Apple REIT Ten, Inc., a Virginia corporation (the
"Company"), Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc., a Virginia corporation ("Parent,"
and collectively with the Company, the "Apple REITs" or individually, an
"Apple REIT"), and Glade M. Knight (the "Company Securityholder").

  

  

WHEREAS, the Apple REITs and 34 Consolidated, Inc., a Virginia corporation and
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), are entering into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 13, 2016 (as it may be amended
or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to
which the Company will merge with and into Merger Sub (the "Merger"), with
Merger Sub continuing as the Surviving Corporation in the Merger (all
capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings set
forth in the Merger Agreement);

  

  

WHEREAS, as the date hereof, the Company Securityholder is the beneficial and
record owner of, and has the sole or shared right to vote and dispose of, all
the issued and outstanding Series B Convertible Preferred Shares, no par
value, of the Company (the "Series B Convertible Shares") and 8,042,857 Parent
Common Shares, no par value, as more particularly described on Schedule 1
hereto; and

  

  

WHEREAS, as a condition to its willingness to enter into the Merger Agreement,
each of the Apple REITs has required that the Company Securityholder agree,
and the Company Securityholder is willing to agree, to the matters set forth
herein.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree, intending to be legally bound hereby,
as follows:

  

  

SECTION 1. Disposition of Series B Shares

  

  

During the period from the date hereof through the earlier of (i) the date on
which the Merger is consummated or (ii) the date on which the Merger Agreement
is terminated according to its terms (such period hereinafter referred to as
the "Term"), the Company Securityholder shall not, directly or indirectly, (a)
sell, sell short, transfer (including by gift), pledge, encumber, assign or
otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract, option or other agreement or
understanding with respect to the sale, transfer, pledge, encumbrance,
assignment or other disposition of, any Series B Convertible Shares or any
other Company Shares or Parent Common Shares that the Company Securityholder
may beneficially own during the Term (collectively, with the Series B
Convertible Shares, the "Subject Shares"), (b) grant any proxies or powers of
attorney for any Subject Shares with respect to any matters described in
paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 2 hereof (other than a proxy directing the
holder thereof to vote the Subject Shares in a manner required by paragraphs
(a) and (b) of Section 2 hereof), (c) deposit any Subject Shares into a voting
trust or enter into a voting agreement or other arrangement with respect to
any Subject Shares with respect to any of the matters described in paragraphs
(a) and (b) of Section 2 hereof, or tender any Subject Shares in a transaction
other than a transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or (d) take any
action which is intended to have the effect of preventing or disabling the
Company Securityholder from performing his obligations under this Agreement;
provided, however, that nothing herein shall prevent (i) the sale, transfer,
pledge, encumbrance, assignment or other disposition of any of such Subject
Shares, provided that the purchaser, transferee, pledgee or assignee thereof
agrees in writing with the Apple REITs, prior to such sale, transfer, pledge,
encumbrance, assignment or other disposition, to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement or (ii) the assignment of certain benefits by the Company
Securityholder pursuant to agreements entered into before the date hereof with
respect to Series B Convertible Shares as to which the Company Securityholder
is not the sole beneficial owner.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

1  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 2. Voting

  

  

During the Term, the Company Securityholder shall:

  

  

(a) be present, in person or represented by proxy, at each meeting (whether
annual or special and whether or not an adjourned or postponed meeting) of the
shareholders of either Apple REIT, however called, so that all of such Company
Securityholder's Subject Shares may be counted for purposes of determining the
presence of a quorum at each such Apple REIT shareholders' meeting; and

  

  

(b) cast or cause to be cast all votes attributable to the Subject Shares at
any annual or special meeting of shareholders of either Apple REIT, including
any adjournments or postponements thereof, or in connection with any written
consent or other vote of the shareholders of an Apple REIT, in favor of (i)
with respect to a shareholders' meeting of the Company, approval and adoption
of the Merger Agreement (including any amendments or modifications of the
terms of the Merger Agreement approved by the boards of directors of the
Company, upon the recommendation of the Company Special Committee, that would
not materially adversely affect the Company Securityholder in his capacity as
beneficial owner of the Subject Shares), the related Plan of Merger, approval
of the Merger, each of the other actions contemplated in the Merger Agreement
and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and any
actions required in furtherance thereof, (ii) with respect to a shareholders'
meeting of Parent, approval of the issuance of the Parent Common Shares to be
issued in the Merger, (iii) approval and adoption of any proposal to adjourn
or postpone such Apple REIT shareholders' meeting to a later date if there are
not sufficient votes for the foregoing matters to be approved at each such
meeting on the date on which the Apple REIT shareholders' meetings are held
and (iv) at each such meeting, and at any adjournment or postponement thereof,
vote against: (A) any action or agreement that would reasonably be expected to
frustrate the purposes of, impede, hinder, interfere with, or prevent or delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and
(B) any Acquisition Proposal (other than the Merger) and any action required
in furtherance thereof.

  

  

(c) The Company Securityholder will retain the right to vote his Subject
Shares, in his sole discretion, on all matters other than those described in
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 2, and the Company Securityholder may
grant proxies and enter into voting agreements or voting trusts for his
Subject Shares in respect of such other matters, in each case so long as such
other arrangements do not interfere with or prevent the Company Securityholder
from complying with his obligations under this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) The Company Securityholder constitutes and appoints each Apple REIT, from
and after the date hereof until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 16 (at which point such
constitution and appointment shall automatically be revoked), as such Company
Securityholder's attorney, agent and proxy (each such constitution and
appointment, an "Irrevocable Proxy"), with full power of substitution, to vote
and otherwise act with respect to all of the Subject Shares of such Apple REIT
at any annual, special or other meeting of the shareholders of such Apple
REIT, and at any adjournment or adjournments or postponement thereof, and in
any action by written consent of the shareholders of such Apple REIT, on the
matters and in the manner specified in Section 2(b); provided, however, that
the foregoing shall only be effective if the Company Securityholder fails to
be counted as present and to vote all of the Subject Shares of each such Apple
REIT in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 2. EACH SUCH
PROXY AND POWER OF ATTORNEY IS IRREVOCABLE AND COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST AND,
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, SHALL BE VALID AND BINDING ON
ANY PERSON TO WHOM THE COMPANY SECURITYHOLDER MAY TRANSFER ANY OF HIS SUBJECT
SHARES IN BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT. The Company Securityholder hereby revokes
all other proxies and powers of attorney with respect to any or all of the
Subject Shares that may have heretofore been appointed or granted with respect
to the matters covered by Section 2(b), and no subsequent proxy or power of
attorney shall be given (and if given, shall not be effective) by the Company
Securityholder with respect thereto on the matters covered by Section 2(b).
All authority herein conferred or agreed to be conferred by the Company
Securityholder shall survive the death or incapacity of the Company
Securityholder and any obligation of the Company Securityholder under this
Agreement shall be binding upon the heirs, personal representatives,
successors and assigns of the Company Securityholder. It is agreed that no
Apple REIT will use the Irrevocable Proxy granted by the Company
Securityholder unless the Company Securityholder fails to comply with Section
2(a) or (b) and that, to the extent an Apple REIT uses any such Irrevocable
Proxy, it will only vote the Subject Shares subject to such Irrevocable Proxy
with respect to the matters specified in, and in accordance with the
provisions of, Section 2(b).

  

  

SECTION 3. Waiver of Appraisal Rights

  

  

The Company Securityholder hereby waives any rights of appraisal or rights to
dissent from the Merger, and agrees to prevent the execution of any rights of
appraisal and dissenters' rights relating to the Merger that the Company
Securityholder may have directly or indirectly by virtue of the ownership of
the Subject Shares.

  


 

  

SECTION 4. Additional Shares

  

  

Without limiting any provisions of the Merger Agreement, in the event of any
stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, reclassification, combination
or exchange of shares of capital stock of either Apple REIT on, of or
affecting any Subject Shares, then the terms of this Agreement shall apply to
the shares of capital stock or other such securities of such Apple REIT held
by the Company Securityholder immediately following the effectiveness of such
event.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 5. Representations and Warranties of the Company Securityholder

  

  

The Company Securityholder represents and warrants to the Apple REITs as
follows:

  

  

(a) The Company Securityholder has the legal capacity, power, authority and
right (contractual or otherwise) to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
perform his obligations hereunder.

  

  

(b) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company
Securityholder and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company
Securityholder enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws relating to
creditors' rights and general principles of equity.

  

  

(c) The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the
consummation of the transactions herein contemplated will not, conflict with
or violate any law, regulation, court order, judgment or decree applicable to
the Company Securityholder or the Subject Shares, or conflict with or result
in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or
lapse of time or both would become a default) or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration under any contract or agreement to
which the Company Securityholder is a party or by which the Company
Securityholder is bound or affected or under which the Subject Shares are
bound by or are otherwise subject to, which conflict, violation, breach or
default would materially and adversely affect the Company Securityholder's
ability to perform any of his obligations under this Agreement.

  

  

(d) Subject to any required filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the "1934 Act"), the Company Securityholder is not required to
give any notice or make any report or other filing with any governmental or
regulatory authority in connection with the execution or delivery of this
Agreement or the performance of the Company Securityholder's obligations
hereunder and no waiver, consent, approval or authorization of any
governmental or regulatory authority or any other person or entity is required
to be obtained by the Company Securityholder for the performance of the
Company Securityholder's obligations hereunder, other than where the failure
to make such filings, give such notices or obtain such waivers, consents,
approvals or authorizations would not materially and adversely affect the
Company Securityholder's ability to perform his obligations under this
Agreement.

  

  

(e) The Series B Convertible Shares, Company Units and Parent Common Shares
set forth opposite the name of the Company Securityholder on Schedule 1 hereto
are, as of the date hereof, the only Subject Shares owned beneficially or of
record by the Company Securityholder or over which the Company Securityholder
exercises voting control. The Company Securityholder is the sole record and
beneficial owner of the Subject Shares as set forth on Schedule 1 hereto.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 6. Further Assurances

  

  

During the Term, the Company Securityholder shall make such filings as may be
required under the 1934 Act and, upon the request of either Apple REIT,
execute and deliver such documents and take such actions as such Apple REIT
may reasonably deem necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 7. Descriptive Headings

  

  

The descriptive headings herein are inserted for convenience only and are not
intended to be part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 8. Counterparts

  

  

This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which when so executed
and delivered shall be an original, but all of such counterparts shall
together constitute one and the same instrument.

  

  

SECTION 9. Entire Agreement; Assignment

  

  

This Agreement (i) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter hereof and (ii) shall not be assigned by
the Company Securityholder, by operation of law or otherwise. The Company
Securityholder agrees that this Agreement and the obligations of the Company
Securityholder hereunder shall attach to any Subject Shares and shall be
binding upon any Person to which legal or beneficial ownership of such Subject
Shares shall pass, whether by operation of law or otherwise, including in
breach of this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 10. Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial

  

  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia without regard to the principles of
conflicts of laws thereof.

  

  

(b) The Company Securityholder hereby submits and consents to non-exclusive
personal jurisdiction in any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in a federal court located
in the Commonwealth of Virginia or in a Virginia state court. Any process,
summons, notice or document delivered by mail to the address set forth on
Schedule 1 hereto shall be effective service of process for any action, suit
or proceeding in any Virginia state court or any federal court located in the
Commonwealth of Virginia with respect to any matters to which the Company
Securityholder has submitted to jurisdiction in this Section 10. The Company
Securityholder irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the
laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any Virginia state court
or any federal court located in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any
such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum. THE COMPANY SECURITYHOLDER
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING WITH
RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 11. Specific Performance

  

  

The parties hereto agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at law would
exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and that the parties hereto
shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to
any other remedy at law or equity.

  

  

SECTION 12. Parties in Interest

  

  

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each
party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to or shall confer upon any other Person or Persons any rights, benefits or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 13. Amendment; Waivers

  

  

This Agreement shall not be amended, altered or modified except by an
instrument in writing duly executed by each of the parties hereto; provided
that no such written agreement shall be binding on an Apple REIT unless
approved by the Company Special Committee or the Parent Board, as applicable.
No delay or failure on the part of any party hereto in exercising any right,
power or privilege under this Agreement shall impair any such right, power or
privilege or be construed as a waiver of any default or any acquiescence
thereto. No single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege
shall preclude the further exercise of such right, power or privilege, or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. No waiver shall be valid
against any party hereto, unless made in writing and signed by the party
against whom enforcement of such waiver is sought, and then only to the extent
expressly specified therein.

  

  

SECTION 14. Severability

  

  

Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent
of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or
unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or
affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement
is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be
only so broad as is enforceable.

  


 

  

SECTION 15. Capacity of Company Securityholder

  

  

The Company Securityholder has executed this Agreement solely in his capacity
as a securityholder of each Apple REIT and not in his capacity as an officer,
director, employee or manager of either Apple REIT. Without limiting the
foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall limit or affect any actions taken
by the Company Securityholder in his capacity as an officer, director or
employee of either Apple REIT in connection with the exercise of either Apple
REIT's rights under the Merger Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 16. Termination

  

  

This Agreement shall terminate immediately upon the expiration of the Term.
None of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in this
Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement; provided, however,
that nothing contained herein shall release the Company Securityholder from
any liability arising from any willful and material breach of any of his
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in this Agreement.

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK

  

OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

  

  

Section 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock.

  

  

(a) The Merger. By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder of any outstanding capital stock of the Company:

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

1  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(i) At the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding common share, no par
value, of the Company (including any fractional shares) (the "Common Shares")
together with the related Series A Preferred Share, no par value, of the
Company (including any fractional shares) (the "Series A Shares," and together
with the Common Shares, the "Units") (other than the Merger Dissenting Shares
(as defined in Section 2.3) or any Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section
2.1(a)(iii)) shall be converted into the right to receive 0.522 (the "Unit
Exchange Ratio") Parent Common Shares (the "Unit Stock Consideration") and
$1.00 in cash (the "Per Unit Cash Consideration"), and (b) each issued and
outstanding Series B Convertible Preferred Share, no par value, of the Company
(the "Series B Shares") shall be converted into the right to receive (x) a
number of Parent Common Shares equal to (1) 12.11423 multiplied by (2) the
Unit Exchange Ratio (the "Series B Stock Consideration," and together with the
Unit Stock Consideration, the "Stock Consideration") and (y) an amount equal
to 12.11423 multiplied by $1.00 in cash (the "Series B Cash Consideration,"
and together with the Per Unit Cash Consideration, the "Cash Consideration").
The aggregate of the Stock Consideration and the Cash Consideration shall
collectively be referred to herein as the "Merger Consideration."

  

  

(ii) No fractional Parent Common Shares shall be issued. Each holder of Shares
who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent
Common Share shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash, without interest, in an
amount equal to such fractional part of a Parent Common Share multiplied by
the VWAP of Parent Common Shares (the "Fractional Share Consideration").

  


 

  

(iii) Each Share (including any fractional Share), issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by Parent, Acquisition
Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  

  

(iv) All Shares converted pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i), when so converted,
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate (as defined below) or a Book-
Entry Share shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration (including any Fractional Share
Consideration) and any dividends or other distributions to which holders may
be entitled in accordance with Section 2.2(e), without interest.

  

  

(b) Surviving Corporation. By virtue of the Merger, and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, each common share, no par value, of
Acquisition Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall remain outstanding as a duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable common share, no par value, of the Surviving Corporation, so
that thereafter Parent will be the sole and exclusive owner of the outstanding
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(c) Stock Options. The Company shall take all requisite action so that at the
Effective Time, each outstanding option issued by the Company pursuant to any
of its stock incentive plans (a "Stock Option") whether or not exercisable at
the Effective Time, shall be assumed by Parent by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof. Subject to, and in
accordance with, the terms of the applicable stock incentive plan including
any applicable award agreement evidencing such Stock Option, from and after
the Effective Time, each Stock Option so assumed by Parent under this Plan of
Merger will otherwise continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions (including vesting schedule) as were applicable to the
corresponding Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time as set
forth in the applicable stock incentive plan (including any applicable award
agreement, evidencing such Stock Option) immediately prior the Effective Time,
except that, from and after the Effective Time, (A) each Stock Option, when
exercisable, will be exercisable for that number of whole Parent Common Shares
equal to the product of the number of Common Shares that were subject to such
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Equity
Exchange Factor, rounded down to the nearest whole number of Parent Common
Shares and (B) the per share exercise price for the Parent Common Shares
issuable upon exercise of such assumed Stock Option will be equal to the
quotient determined by dividing the exercise price of each Common Share
subject to such assumed Stock Option by the Equity Exchange Factor, rounded up
to the nearest whole cent.

(d) Certain Adjustments. If, before the Effective Time (and as permitted by
ARTICLE IV of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 13, 2016,
among the Company, Acquisition Sub and Parent (the "Merger Agreement")), the
outstanding Shares and/or the outstanding Parent Common Shares shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by
reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of
shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then the Merger
Consideration shall be appropriately and proportionately adjusted to provide
to the holders of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Plan
of Merger prior to such event.

  

  

Section 2.2 Exchange Procedures.

  

  

(a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank
or trust company, which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act
as paying agent and exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the exchange of
the issued and outstanding Shares for the Merger Consideration.

  

  

(b) Exchange Fund. At or before the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or
cause Acquisition Sub to deposit, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of
Parent Common Shares in book-entry form issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i)
equal to the aggregate Stock Consideration (excluding any Fractional Share
Consideration), and (ii) cash in immediately available funds in an amount
sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration, the Fractional Share
Consideration, and any dividends or distributions to which holders of Shares
may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) (such evidence of book-entry Parent
Common Shares and cash amounts, the "Exchange Fund"), in each case for the
benefit of the holders of Shares. Promptly after the date that the Merger
becomes effective, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section
2.2(c), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the
Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of the
Merger Consideration, including payment of the Fractional Share Consideration,
and any dividends or distributions to which holders of Shares may be entitled
pursuant to Section 2.2(e), out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this
Plan of Merger. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is
not expressly provided for in this Plan of Merger.

  

  

(c) Exchange Procedures.

  


 

  

(i) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and in no event later
than two Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record of outstanding Shares that were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i): (A) a letter
of transmittal ("Letter of Transmittal"), in customary form and with such
other provisions as reasonably agreed upon by the Company and Parent prior to
the Effective Time, which shall specify, among other things, that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Shares represented by
certificates ("Certificates") or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
transfer of any Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent; and (B) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or the transfer of
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

  


 

  

(ii) Upon (A) surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or transfer of any Book-Entry Share to the Exchange Agent, together
with a properly completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal or (B)
receipt of an "agent's message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence,
if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case
of transfer of a Book-Entry Share, and such other documents as may reasonably
be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE 2 plus any Fractional
Share Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of Section 2.1(a)(ii) and any amounts that such holder has the
right to receive in respect of dividends or distributions to which holders of
Shares may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e), by mail or by wire transfer
after the Exchange Agent's receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof) or "agent's message" or other evidence, and the Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) so surrendered or the Book-Entry Share
so transferred, as applicable, shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange
Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
and Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with customary exchange practices. Until surrendered or
transferred as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate and Book-
Entry Share shall be deemed, at any time after the Effective Time, to
represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this ARTICLE 2. No interest shall be paid or
accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on
the Merger Consideration or the Fractional Share Consideration payable upon
the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and any dividends or
distributions to which such holder may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iii) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered
in the transfer records of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment
that any Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or transferred in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.2 shall be properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the
Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer Taxes and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
Book-Entry Share transferred, or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not
applicable.

  


 

  

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
any interest and income received with respect thereto and any Fractional Share
Consideration and any applicable dividends or other distributions with respect
to Parent Common Shares) that remains undistributed to the former holders of
Shares for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any former holders of Shares prior to the Merger who
have not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE 2 shall thereafter look only
to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (and only as general creditors
thereof) for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration, subject to
applicable abandoned property, escheat and other similar Laws.

  


 

  

(e) No Further Ownership Rights in Capital Stock of the Company. The Merger
Consideration (including the Fractional Share Consideration) issued upon
exchange of the Shares in accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE 2 shall be
deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the Shares, subject, however, to the obligation of the Surviving Corporation
to pay, without interest and not more than 60 days following the Effective
Time, any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior
to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Company on
the Shares in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement or prior to
the date of the Merger Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time
and have not been paid prior to such exchange, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the
Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(f) No Liability. None of Parent, the Company, Acquisition Sub or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

  

  

(g) Withholding Rights. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Plan of Merger to any holder of Shares such
amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be, is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Plan of
Merger as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

  

  

Section 2.3 Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan of Merger
to the contrary, holders of Shares who have properly exercised, perfected and
not subsequently withdrawn or lost their appraisal rights with respect thereto
in accordance with Article 15 of the VSCA (the "Merger Dissenting Shares")
shall not have any of such Merger Dissenting Shares converted into the right
to receive, or become exchangeable for, the Merger Consideration. The holders
of such Merger Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to obtain payment of the
fair value of such Merger Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions
of Article 15 of the VSCA unless and until such holders fail to perfect or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their dissenters\' rights under
Article 15 of the VSCA. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, each of such
holder\'s Merger Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if it had
been converted into the right to receive, and become exchangeable for, at the
Effective Time, the Merger Consideration, as provided in Section 2.1(a)(i)
hereof. Parent shall be responsible for all payments to be made under Article
15 of the VSCA in respect of Merger Dissenting Shares.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 2.4 Further Assurances. If, at any time before or after the Effective
Time, any of the parties to the Merger Agreement reasonably believes or is
advised that any further instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances are
reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate the Merger or to carry out the
purposes and intent of this Plan of Merger at or after the Effective Time,
then the Company, Parent, Acquisition Sub and/or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, and their respective officers and directors shall execute and
deliver all such proper instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances and do
all other things reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate the Merger
and to carry out the purposes and intent of this Plan of Merger.

Opinion

  

  

Based upon and subject to the assumptions and qualifications set forth herein
we are of the opinion that the Merger, when effective, will qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  


 

  

In addition to the assumptions set forth above, this opinion is subject to the
exceptions, limitations, and qualifications set forth below:

  


 

  

    

1.

  |  

The opinion set forth in this letter is based on relevant current provisions
of the Code, the Treasury Regulations thereunder (including proposed and
temporary Treasury Regulations), and interpretations of the foregoing as
expressed in court decisions, applicable legislative history, and the
administrative rulings and practices of the IRS, including its practices and
policies in issuing private letter rulings, which are not binding on the IRS
except with respect to a taxpayer that receives such a ruling, all as of the
date hereof. These provisions and interpretations are subject to change by the
IRS, Congress, and the courts (as applicable), which change may or may not be
retroactive in effect and which might result in material modifications of our
opinion. Our opinion does not foreclose the possibility of a contrary
determination by the IRS or a court of competent jurisdiction, nor of a
contrary position taken by the IRS or the Treasury Department in regulations
or rulings issued in the future. In this regard, an opinion of counsel with
respect to an issue represents counsel\'s best professional judgment with
respect to the outcome on the merits with respect to such issue, if such issue
were to be litigated, but an opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts
and is not a guarantee that the IRS will not assert a contrary position with
respect to such issue or that a court will not sustain such a position
asserted by the IRS. Neither the Parent nor the Company has requested or will
request a ruling from the IRS as to any of the U.S. federal income tax
consequences addressed in this opinion. Furthermore, no assurance can be given
that future legislative, judicial, or administrative changes, including on a
retroactive basis, would not adversely affect the accuracy of the opinion
expressed herein.

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

2.

  |  

This letter addresses only the specific tax opinion set forth above. Our
opinion does not address any other U.S. federal, state, local, or non-U.S. tax
consequences that will or may result from the Merger or any other transaction
(including any transaction undertaken in connection with the Merger or
contemplated by the Merger Agreement).

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

    

3.

  |  

Our opinion set forth herein is based upon, among other things, the
description of the contemplated transactions (including the Merger) as set
forth in the Merger Agreement. No opinion is expressed as to any transaction
other than those set forth in the Merger Agreement, or to any transaction
whatsoever, including the Merger, unless all the transactions described in the
Merger Agreement (or otherwise contemplated in connection with the Merger)
have been consummated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement
(and also without amendment, waiver, or breach of any provision thereof), and
also unless all of the representations, warranties, statements, and
assumptions upon which we have relied are true, complete, and accurate at all
times. In the event that the actual facts relating to any aspect of the
relevant transactions (including the Merger) differ from the terms of the
Merger Agreement (without amendment, waiver, or breach of any material
provision thereof), or if any one of the representations, warranties,
statements, or assumptions upon which we have relied to issue this opinion is
incorrect, our opinion might be adversely affected and may not be relied upon.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  

  

We are acting as tax counsel to Apple REIT Ten, Inc., a Virginia corporation
(the "Company"), in connection with the merger of the Company with and into 34
Consolidated, Inc. ("Merger Sub"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apple
Hospitality REIT, Inc., a Virginia corporation ("Parent") pursuant to that
certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated April 13, 2016 (the "Merger
Agreement"), by and among the Company, Parent and Merger Sub (the "Merger").
This opinion letter is being delivered pursuant to section 6.2(f) of the
Merger Agreement. Capitalized terms used and not defined herein shall have the
meanings assigned to them in the Merger Agreement.

  

  

The opinions set forth in this letter are based on relevant current provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the Treasury
Regulations thereunder (including proposed and temporary Treasury
Regulations), and interpretations of the foregoing as expressed in court
decisions, applicable legislative history, and the administrative rulings and
practices of the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), including its practices
and policies in issuing private letter rulings, which are not binding on the
IRS except with respect to a taxpayer that receives such a ruling, all as of
the date hereof. These provisions and interpretations are subject to change by
the IRS, Congress and the courts (as applicable), which may or may not be
retroactive in effect and which might result in material modifications of our
opinions. Our opinions do not foreclose the possibility of a contrary
determination by the IRS or a court of competent jurisdiction, or of a
contrary position taken by the IRS or the Treasury Department in regulations
or rulings issued in the future. In this regard, an opinion of counsel with
respect to an issue represents counsel's best professional judgment with
respect to the outcome on the merits with respect to such issue, if such issue
were to be litigated, but an opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts,
and is not a guarantee that the IRS will not assert a contrary position with
respect to such issue or that a court will not sustain such a position
asserted by the IRS.

  

  

In rendering our opinions, we have examined originals or copies of: (i) the
Merger Agreement, (ii) certain organizational documents of the Company and its
subsidiaries, (iii) the written representations with regard to the Company
contained in a certificate to us dated as of the date hereof (the "Officer's
Certificate"), and (iv) such statutes and regulations and other agreements and
documents as we have considered necessary or appropriate as a basis for the
opinions expressed below, in each case, which we have, with your consent,
relied upon (without any independent investigation or review thereof) (the
documents described in clauses (i) through (iv), collectively, the "Reviewed
Documents").

In our examination and for purposes of our opinions, we have assumed with your
consent the following:

  

  

    

1.

  |  

that (A) all of the representations and statements as to factual matters set
forth in the Reviewed Documents (including, without limitation, the Officer's
Certificate) are true, correct, and complete in all material respects as of
the date hereof, (B) any representation or statement in the Reviewed Documents
(including, without limitation, the Officer's Certificate) made as a belief or
made "to the knowledge of" or similarly qualified is true, correct and
complete in all material respects as of the date hereof, without such
qualification, (C) each agreement described in the Reviewed Documents is valid
and binding in accordance with its terms, and (D) each of the obligations of
the Company and its subsidiaries, as described in the Reviewed Documents
(including, without limitation, the Officer's Certificate), has been or will
be performed or satisfied in accordance with its terms;

  

   
---|--- 
  

2.

  |  

that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the Merger Agreement
(including satisfaction of all pre-closing covenants and conditions to the
obligations of the parties without amendment, waiver, or breach thereof);

  

   
  

3.

  |  

that the genuineness of all signatures, the proper execution of all documents,
the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity
to originals of documents submitted to us as copies, and the authenticity of
the originals from which any copies were made;

  

   
  

4.

  |  

that any documents as to which we have reviewed only a form were or will be
duly executed without material changes from the form reviewed by us;

  

   
  

5.

  |  

that the execution and delivery by each party to a document and the
performance by such party of its obligations thereunder have been authorized
by all necessary measures and do not violate or result in a breach of or
default under such party's articles of incorporation or bylaws or other
organizational documents or the laws of such party's jurisdiction of
organization;

  

   
  

6.

  |  

that each agreement represents the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the subject matter thereof;

  

   
  

7.

  |  

that the parties to each agreement have complied, and will comply, with all of
their respective covenants, agreements, and undertakings contained therein;
and

  

   
  

8.

  |  

that from and after the date of this letter, the Company will comply with its
representation contained in the Officer's Certificate that the Company will
utilize all appropriate "savings provisions" (including the provisions of
Sections 856(c)(6), 856(c)(7), and 856(g) of the Code, and the provision
included in Section 856(c)(4) of the Code (flush language) allowing for the
disposal of assets within 30 days after the close of a calendar quarter, and
all available deficiency dividend procedures) available to the Company under
the Code in order to correct any violations of the applicable REIT
qualification requirements of Sections 856 and 857 of the Code, to the full
extent the remedies under such provisions are available.

Any material variation or difference in the facts from those set forth in the
documents that we have reviewed and upon which we have relied (including, in
particular, the Officer's Certificate) may adversely affect the conclusions
stated herein.

  


 

  

Although we have discussed the Officer's Certificate with the signatory
thereto, for purposes of rendering our opinions, with your permission, we have
not made an independent investigation, audit or verification of any fact set
forth in the Reviewed Documents (including, without limitation, any statement
or representation in the Officer's Certificate) or any assumption upon which
we have relied. We expressly disclaim any intent, undertaking, or obligation
to make any such investigation or verification. We consequently have relied
upon the representations and statements of the Company as described in the
Reviewed Documents (including, without limitation, the Officer's Certificate),
and assumed that the information presented in such documents or otherwise
furnished to us is accurate and complete in all material respects.

  

  

Based upon and subject to the assumptions and qualifications set forth herein,
including, without limitation, the discussion in the next two paragraphs
below, we are of the opinion that:

  

  

    

1.

  |  

the Company has been organized and operated in conformity with the
requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code for each
of its taxable years beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2011,
through its taxable year ended December 31, 2015, and

  

   
---|--- 
  

2.

  |  

the Company's current organization and current and proposed method of
operation (as described in the Company's Officer's Certificate) will enable it
to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the
Code from January 1, 2016, through the Effective Time of the Merger.

   
 

  

  

The Company's qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code will depend
upon the ability of the Company to meet on an ongoing basis (through actual
quarterly and annual operating results, distribution levels, diversity of
share ownership and otherwise) the various qualification tests imposed under
the Code, and upon the Company utilizing any and all appropriate "savings
provisions" (including the provisions of Sections 856(c)(6), 856(c)(7), and
856(g) of the Code and the provision included in Section 856(c)(4) of the Code
(flush language) allowing for the disposal of assets within 30 days after the
close of a calendar quarter, and all available deficiency dividend procedures)
available to the Company under the Code to correct violations of specified
REIT qualification requirements of Sections 856 and 857 of the Code. Our
opinions set forth above do not foreclose the possibility that the Company may
have to utilize one or more of these "savings provisions" in the future, which
could require the Company to pay an excise or penalty tax (which could be
significant in amount) in order to maintain its REIT qualification. We have
not undertaken to review the Company's compliance with these requirements on a
continuing basis. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual
results of the Company's operations, the sources of its income, the nature of
its assets, the level of its distributions to shareholders and the diversity
of its share ownership for any given taxable year will satisfy the
requirements under the Code for qualification and taxation as a REIT.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  

  

We have acted as tax counsel to Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc., a Virginia
corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the transactions contemplated
by the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of [•],
2016, by and among the Company, Apple REIT Ten, Inc., a Virginia Corporation
("Apple Ten"), and 34 Consolidated, Inc., a Virginia corporation and wholly-
owned subsidiary of the Company. This opinion letter is being delivered to you
pursuant to Section 6.3(e) of the Merger Agreement. Capitalized terms used
herein which are defined in the Merger Agreement shall have the meanings set
forth in the Merger Agreement, unless otherwise defined herein.

  

  

Bases for Opinions

  

  

The opinions set forth in this letter are based on relevant current provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the Treasury
Regulations thereunder (including proposed and temporary Treasury
Regulations), and interpretations of the foregoing as expressed in court
decisions, applicable legislative history, and the administrative rulings and
practices of the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), including its practices
and policies in issuing private letter rulings, which are not binding on the
IRS except with respect to a taxpayer that receives such a ruling, all as of
the date hereof. These provisions and interpretations are subject to change by
the IRS, Congress and the courts (as applicable), which may or may not be
retroactive in effect and which might result in material modifications of our
opinions. Our opinions do not foreclose the possibility of a contrary
determination by the IRS or a court of competent jurisdiction, or of a
contrary position taken by the IRS or the Treasury Department in regulations
or rulings issued in the future. In this regard, an opinion of counsel with
respect to an issue represents counsel's best professional judgment with
respect to the outcome on the merits with respect to such issue, if such issue
were to be litigated, but an opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts,
and is not a guarantee that the IRS will not assert a contrary position with
respect to such issue or that a court will not sustain such a position
asserted by the IRS.

In rendering the following opinions, we have examined such statutes,
regulations, records, agreements, certificates and other documents as we have
considered necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions, including,
but not limited to (including all exhibits and schedules thereto) which we
have, with your consent, relied upon (without any independent investigation or
review thereof):

The opinions set forth in this letter are premised on, among other things, the
written representations with regard to the Company, Apple Seven and Apple
Eight contained in the certificate to us dated as of the date hereof (the
"Officer's Certificate"). Although we have discussed the Officer's Certificate
with the respective signatory thereto, for purposes of rendering our opinions,
we have not made an independent investigation or audit of the facts set forth

the Reviewed Documents and the Officer's Certificate, and assumed that the
information presented in such documents or otherwise furnished to us is
accurate and complete in all material respects, including, without limitation,
the representations of the Company to the effect that if it is determined that
certain distributions to shareholders would fail to qualify for the dividends
paid deduction for one or more taxable years with the result that any of the
Company, Apple Seven or Apple Eight would not have satisfied its distribution
requirement with respect to any such taxable year, the Company will pay a
deficiency dividend to its shareholders of record pursuant to the deficiency
dividend provisions of Section 860 of the Code in the amount necessary to
permit each of the Company, Apple Seven and Apple Eight to satisfy the
distribution requirements of Section 857 of the Code for each such taxable
year.

  

  

In this regard, we have assumed with your consent the following:

Opinions

  

  

Based upon and subject to the assumptions and qualifications set forth herein,
including, without limitation, the discussion in the next two paragraphs
below, we are of the opinion that the Company has been organized and operated
in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT
under the Code for each of its taxable years beginning with its taxable year
ended December 31, 2012, and the Company's current organization and current
and proposed method of operation (as described in the Officer's Certificate)
will enable it to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a
REIT under the Code for its taxable year ending December 31, 2016, and future
taxable years.

  


 

  

The Company's qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code will depend
upon the ability of the Company to meet on an ongoing basis (through actual
quarterly and annual operating results, distribution levels, diversity of
share ownership and otherwise) the various qualification tests imposed under
the Code, and upon the Company utilizing any and all appropriate "savings
provisions" (including the provisions of Sections 856(c)(6), 856(c)(7), and
856(g) of the Code and the provision included in Section 856(c)(4) of the Code
(flush language) allowing for the disposal of assets within 30 days after the
close of a calendar quarter, and all available deficiency dividend procedures)
available to the Company under the Code to correct violations of specified
REIT qualification requirements of Sections 856 and 857 of the Code. Our
opinions set forth above do not foreclose the possibility that the Company may
have to utilize one or more of these "savings provisions" in the future, which
could require the Company to pay an excise or penalty tax (which could be
significant in amount) in order to maintain its REIT qualification. We have
not undertaken to review the Company's compliance with these requirements on a
continuing basis. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual
results of the Company's operations, the sources of its income, the nature of
its assets, the level of its distributions to shareholders and the diversity
of its share ownership for any given taxable year will satisfy the
requirements under the Code for qualification and taxation as a REIT.
