of Incorporation of Newco, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation.   2.2 By-Laws. The By-Laws of Newco, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the By-Laws of the
Surviving Corporation.   2.3 Directors. The directors of Newco at the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the initial
directors of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly
elected or appointed and qualified or until their    2   earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporation\'s
Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws.   2.4 Officers. The officers of
the Company at the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time,

CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OR CANCELLATION OF  SHARES IN THE MERGER   3.1
Share Consideration for the Merger; Conversion or Cancellation of Shares in
the Merger. (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Newco, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the holders of any outstanding shares of common stock, each
share having no par value, of the Company, together with the associated right
to purchase one common share purchase right (a "Right"), issued pursuant to
the Rights Agreement, dated as of March 22, 2000, by and between the Company
and Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A., as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agreement"),
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (together with
the associated Rights, the "Shares") (other than Dissenting Shares (as
defined below) and Shares owned by Parent, Newco or any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (collectively, "Parent Companies") or any
of the Company\'s direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries or held in the
treasury of the Company) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Newco, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled
and extinguished and converted into the right to receive from Parent,
pursuant to Section 3.2, $36.07 per Share in cash (the "Merger
Consideration"), payable to the holder thereof, without interest thereon,
less any required withholding of taxes, upon the surrender of the certificate
formerly representing such Share.   (b) At the Effective Time, each Share
issued and outstanding and owned by any of the Parent Companies or any of
the Company\'s direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries or held in
the Company\'s treasury immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to be outstanding, be cancelled and retired without payment of
any consideration therefor and cease to exist.   (c) At the Effective Time,
each share of common stock of Newco issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.   
3    3.2 Payment for Shares in the Merger. The manner of making payment
for Shares in the Merger shall be as follows:   (a) At the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with a bank or trust company
selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Paying
Agent") for the benefit of the holders of Shares, the funds necessary to make
the payments contemplated by Section 3.1 (the "Payment Fund"). The Paying
Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger
Consideration out of the Payment Fund. The Payment Fund shall not be used for
any other purpose.   (b) The Paying Agent shall invest the Payment Fund
as directed by Parent or Newco in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the
United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
or better by Moody\'s Investor Services or Standard and Poor\'s
Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers\' acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $200 million, in each case with maturities not exceeding seven
days. Parent shall cause the Payment Fund to be promptly replenished to the
extent of any losses incurred as a result of the aforementioned investments.
All earnings thereon shall inure to the benefit of Parent. If for any
reason (including losses) the Payment Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts
to which holders of Shares shall be entitled under Section 3.1 and
this Section 3.2, Parent shall in any event be liable for payment thereof.
The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose except as expressly
provided in this Agreement.   (c) As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record
(other than holders of certificates representing Dissenting Shares and for
Shares referred to in Section 3.1(b)) of a certificate or certificates
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares
(the "Certificates") (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates for payment therefor. Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal duly executed and any other required documents, the holder
of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive for each of the
Shares represented by such Certificates the Merger Consideration, without
any interest thereon, less any required withholding of taxes, and
the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until
so surrendered, such Certificates shall represent solely the right to
receive the    4   Merger Consideration with respect to each of the
Shares represented thereby. If payment is to be made to a person other than
the person in whose name a Certificate so surrendered is registered, it shall
be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
person requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than
the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to
the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. On and after the Effective Time, until surrendered
in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.2(c), each
Certificate (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) shall
represent for all purposes only the right to receive, for each Share
represented thereby, the Merger Consideration.   (d) Any portion of the
Payment Fund made available to the Paying Agent which remains unclaimed by
the former shareholders of the Company for one year after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand of Parent, and any former
shareholders of the Company shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment
of their claim for the Merger Consideration for the Shares.   (e) Neither
the Paying Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be liable to any
shareholder of the Company or holder of any Option (as defined below) for any
Shares, any Options, the Merger Consideration or cash delivered to a public
official pursuant to and in accordance with any abandoned property, escheat
or similar law.   (f) The Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any shareholder of the Company or Option holder such
amounts as the Company reasonably and in good faith determines are required
to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
the Code (as defined below), or any provision of state, local or foreign
tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Paying Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the shareholder or Option holder in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent.   3.3
Dissenting Shares. (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held
by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing and who has demanded payment for such shares in accordance with
Sections 180.1301 to    5   180.1331 of the WBCL, if such Sections
provide for dissenters\' rights for such Shares in the Merger ("Dissenting
Shares"), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 3.1, unless and until such holder fails
to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his or her right to dissent and
demand payment under the WBCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder
fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his or her right to demand payment,
then such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, if any, to which such holder is entitled, without interest or
dividends thereon, and such Shares shall no longer be Dissenting Shares. The
Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for payment of Shares and, prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.   (b) From time
to time at or after the Effective Time, Parent shall take all lawful action
necessary to make the appropriate cash payments, if any, to holders of
Dissenting Shares. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into
appropriate commercial arrangements to ensure effectuation of the immediately
preceding sentence.   3.4 No Further Rights or Transfers; Cancellation of
Treasury Shares. Except for the surrender of the certificate(s) representing
the Shares in exchange for the right to receive the Merger Consideration
with respect to each Share or the perfection of dissenters\' rights with
respect to the Dissenting Shares, at and after the Effective Time, the holder
of Shares shall cease to have any rights as a shareholder of the Company,
and no transfer of Shares shall thereafter be made on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation. Each Share held in the Company\'s
treasury immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Merger, be canceled and retired and cease to exist without any conversion
thereof pursuant to Section 3.1(b).   3.5 Stock Options. At the Effective
Time, each option ("Option") which has been granted under the Company\'s 2000
Stock Incentive Plan or any predecessor plans thereto (the "Option Plan") and
is outstanding at the Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable,
either at the option of the holders thereof:   (a) will be exchanged for,
and the holder of each such Option will be entitled to receive upon surrender
of the Option for cancellation, a lump sum    6   cash payment equal to
the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
per share exercise price of each such Option; times (ii) the number of Shares
covered by such Option; or   (b) shall become and represent an option to
purchase such number of Common Shares ("Parent Shares"), par value $1.00 per
share of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") (a "Substitute Option") determined
by multiplying the number of Shares subject to such Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
Merger Consideration and the denominator of which is the Effective Time
Market Price of the Parent Shares, at an exercise price per Parent
Share (increased to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price per
Share subject to such Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Merger Consideration and
the denominator of which is the Effective Time Market Price of the
Parent Shares. All other terms and conditions applicable to the Options
shall remain unchanged with respect to the Substitute Options, including that
the Substitute Options shall be vested and exercisable at any time after
the Effective Time. No fractional Parent Shares will be issued upon
the exercise of a Substitute Option. In lieu of such issuance, the
Parent Shares issuable pursuant to the terms of each Substitute Option shall
be rounded to the closest whole Parent Share. After the Effective Time,
except as otherwise provided in this Section 3.5, each Substitute Option
shall be exercisable upon the same terms and conditions as were applicable to
the Option Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, after giving effect
to the resolutions and other actions described in this Section 3.5(b).
Not later than ten days following the Effective Time, Parent shall file
a registration statement on Form S-8 or otherwise include in an
existing registration statement with respect to the Parent Shares to be
issued upon exercise of the Substitute Options and shall use its best efforts
to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long
as the Substitute Options shall remain outstanding. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company shall adopt such
resolutions or shall take such other actions as may be required, with respect
to the Options subject to this Section 3.5(b), to specifically approve
the transactions contemplated by this Section 3.5.  The Company shall use
reasonable efforts to obtain the election of the holders of Options prior to
the Effective Time.   3.6 Certain Company and Parent Actions. Prior to the
Effective Time, (i) the Company shall take all such steps as may be required
to cause any dispositions of Shares (including derivative securities with
respect to Shares) resulting from the transactions contemplated by Article
III of this Agreement by each individual who is    7   subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company and (ii) Parent shall take all such steps as may be required to
cause any acquisitions of Parent Shares (including derivative securities with
respect to Parent Shares) resulting from the transactions contemplated by
Article III of this Agreement by each individual who is expected to be
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to Parent, in either case, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, such steps to be taken in accordance with
the No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC to Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP.    ARTICLE IV   REPRESENTATIONS AND

foreign corporation or foreign limited liability company in each
jurisdiction listed on Schedule 4.1 where the properties owned, leased or
operated or the business conducted by it require such qualification, except

Company Material Adverse Effect (as hereinafter defined in Section 9.10).
Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has all requisite power and
authority (corporate or otherwise) to own its properties and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted except where failure to have such power

forth above and on Schedule 4.2 and except for the Rights, there are not as
of the date hereof any outstanding or authorized options, warrants, calls,
rights (including preemptive rights), commitments or any other agreements of
any character which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or
may be bound by, requiring it to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or
acquire any shares of capital stock or any securities or rights convertible
into, exchangeable for, or evidencing the right to subscribe for, any shares
of capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.   4.3

jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, the authorized share or other

Company as of the date of this Agreement, the name of the owner and the
number and percentage of outstanding shares or other equity interests of each

outstanding capital stock of each of the Subsidiaries of the Company is
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, except as otherwise provided in
Section 180.0622(2)(b) of the WBCL. Except as set forth in this Agreement and
in Schedule 4.3, there are no agreements, arrangements, options, warrants,
calls, rights or commitments of any character (i) relating to the issuance,
sale, purchase or    9   redemption of any capital stock, partnership
interest or other equity interest of any of the Subsidiaries of the Company,
or (ii) requiring the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to purchase any

rights. Except as set forth in this Agreement and in Schedule 4.3, there are
no voting trust agreements or any other similar contracts,

Company and/or its Subsidiaries have good and valid title to, and

all encumbrances.   4.4 Authority Relative to this Agreement. (a) The
Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. This Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by the

transactions contemplated hereby (other than, with respect to the Merger, the
approval and adoption of the Merger and this Agreement by holders of the
Shares in accordance with the WBCL). This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming this
Agreement constitutes the valid and binding agreement of Parent and
Newco, constitutes the valid and binding agreement of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except that
such enforceability may be limited by (i) bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter
in effect relating to creditors\' rights generally and (ii) general
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law).   (b) The Board of Directors has duly and
validly approved and taken all corporate action required to be taken by the

by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby will:   (i) conflict
with or result in any breach of any  provision of or constitute a default, an
event of default or an event  creating rights of acceleration, termination or

(or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration or
lien or other charge or encumbrance) under any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any note, license, agreement or other instrument or obligation
to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries may be bound, except for such
violations, breaches and defaults (or rights of termination, cancellation or
acceleration or lien or other charge or encumbrance) as to which requisite
waivers or consents have been obtained or which individually or in the
aggregate would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or adversely affect
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; or   (d) assuming
the consents, approvals, authorizations or permits and filings or
notifications referred to in this Section 5.3 are duly and timely obtained or
made, violate any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or
regulation applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or to any of their
respective assets, except for violations which would not individually or in
the aggregate have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or adversely affect the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.   5.4 SEC Reports;
Financial Statements.    25    (a) Parent has filed all forms, reports
and documents required to be filed by it with the SEC since January 1, 1999
pursuant to the federal securities laws and the SEC rules and regulations
thereunder, all of which as of their respective dates complied in all
material respects with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act
(collectively, the "Parent SEC Reports"). None of the Parent SEC Reports,
including, without limitation, any financial statements or schedules included
therein, as of their respective dates, contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.   (b) The
consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders\' equity and cash flows (including the related notes
thereto) of Parent included in the Parent SEC Reports, as of their respective
dates, complied in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a basis consistent with prior periods (except as
otherwise noted therein), and present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries
as of their respective dates, and the consolidated results of their
operations and their cash flows for the periods presented therein (subject,
in the case of the unaudited interim financial statements, to normal year-end
adjustments).   5.5 Proxy Statement. None of the information supplied by
Parent or Newco in writing for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will, at the
time that it or any amendment or supplement thereto is mailed to the
Company\'s shareholders, at the time of the Shareholders\' Meeting or at the
Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading.   5.6 Financing. Parent or Newco will have
sufficient cash and/or cash equivalents available at the Effective Time to
pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and all other funds necessary to
consummate the Merger, the Agreement and the other transactions contemplated
hereby.   5.7 Interim Operations of Newco. Newco was formed solely for the

broker, finder, consultant or intermediary in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which would be entitled to
any investment banking, brokerage, finder\'s or similar fee or commission
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.   5.9 Share Ownership. Neither Parent nor Newco is an
"interested stockholder" as such term is defined in Section 1140(8)(a) of the
WBCL or a "significant shareholder" as such term is defined in Section
1130(11) of the WBCL.    ARTICLE VI   ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND
AGREEMENTS   6.1 Shareholders Meeting. The Company, acting through the
Board of Directors, shall:   (a) duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold a special meeting of its shareholders (the "Shareholders Meeting"), to
be held as soon as practicable after the date hereof, for the purpose of
considering and taking action upon this Agreement;   (b) include in the
Proxy Statement the recommendation of the Board of Directors that
shareholders of the Company vote in favor of the approval and adoption of
this Agreement; notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Board of Directors may withdraw, modify or amend its recommendation if in
the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors, after consultation with
counsel, such recommendation is reasonably determined to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s shareholders under applicable law; any
such withdrawal, modification or amendment shall not constitute a breach of
this Agreement; and   (c) use all reasonable efforts to promptly prepare
and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") the
Proxy Statement and (A) obtain and furnish the information required to
be included by it in the Proxy Statement and, after consultation with

respect to the Proxy Statement and any preliminary version thereof and cause

practicable time following the date hereof and (B) obtain the necessary
approvals by its shareholders of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby unless, in the    27   good faith opinion of the
Board of Directors after consultation with its counsel, obtaining such
approvals might be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s
shareholders under applicable law.   At such meeting, Parent and Newco will
vote all Shares, if any, owned by them in favor of approval and adoption of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.   6.2 Conduct of
Business of the Company.   The Company agrees that during the period from
the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time (unless the other party
shall otherwise agree in writing and except as otherwise contemplated by this
Agreement), the Company will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
conduct its operations according to its ordinary and usual course of
business consistent with past practice and, to the extent consistent
therewith, with no less diligence and effort than would be applied in the
absence of this Agreement, seek to preserve intact its current business
organizations, keep available the service of its current officers and
employees and preserve its relationships with customers, suppliers and others
having business dealings with it to the end that goodwill and ongoing
businesses shall not be impaired in any material respect at the Effective
Time. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and except as
otherwise permitted in this Agreement or as set forth in Schedule 6.2, prior
to the Effective Time, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will,

Shares outstanding on the date hereof;   (b) except pursuant to the
Company\'s stock-based employee benefit plans, redeem, purchase

split, combine, subdivide or reclassify any Shares or declare, set aside for
payment or pay any dividend, or make any other actual, constructive or deemed
distribution in respect of any Shares or otherwise make any payments to
shareholders in their capacity as such, other than the declaration and
payment of regular quarterly cash dividends in accordance with past dividend
policy (except that the Company shall not declare, set aside for payment or

of 2001 and shall not pay any such dividend prior to September 30, 2001) and
except for dividends by a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company;   (d)
adopt a plan of complete or partial liquidation, dissolution, merger,
consolidation, restructuring, recapitalization or other reorganization of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries not constituting an inactive subsidiary

past practice;   (g) other than in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, incur any indebtedness for borrowed
money or guarantee any such indebtedness or make any loans, advances or
capital contributions to, or investments in, any other person, other than to
the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company;   (h) grant any
material increases in the compensation of any of its directors, officers or

with past practice;    29    (i) except as set forth on Schedule 6.2(i),
pay or agree to pay any pension, retirement allowance or other employee
benefit not required or contemplated by any of the existing benefit,
severance, termination, pension or employment plans, agreements or
arrangements as in effect on the date hereof to any such director or officer,
whether past or present;   (j) except as set forth on Schedule 6.2(j),

any benefits thereunder;   (l) settle or compromise any material tax claim,

accounting inconsistent with a position, election or method incorporated in
past tax returns, except as required by law;   (m) except in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, (i) lease, sublease,

as contemplated or as otherwise permitted by this Agreement or pursuant to
the exercise of Options or pursuant to the ESPP, the Company shall not, nor
shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit
any officer, director or employee of, or any investment banker, attorney or
other advisor or representative of, the Company or any Subsidiary to (i)
solicit or initiate, encourage, or facilitate, directly or indirectly, any
inquiries relating to, or the submission of, any proposal or offer, whether
in writing or otherwise, from any person other than Parent, Newco or any
affiliates thereof (a "Third Party") to acquire beneficial ownership (as
defined under Rule 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of any of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, or any class of equity securities of the
Company pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other business combination,
sale of shares of stock, sale of assets, tender offer, exchange offer or
similar transaction (a "Competing Transaction"); (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any
information or data with respect to or access to the properties of, or take
any other action to knowingly facilitate the making of any proposal that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing
Transaction; or (iii) enter into any agreement with respect to any Competing
Transaction, approve or recommend or resolve to approve or recommend any
Competing Transaction or enter into any agreement requiring it to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if
the Company receives a bona fide, written proposal or offer for a Competing
Transaction by a Third Party, which the Board of Directors determines in good
faith (after consulting the Board of Directors\' independent financial
advisor) (A) is reasonably likely to result in terms which are more favorable
from a financial point of view to the holders of Shares than the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (B) is
reasonably capable of being consummated (provided that the Company, including
the Board of Directors, and any of its advisors shall be permitted to
contact such Third Party and its advisors solely for the purpose of
clarifying the proposal and any material contingencies and the capability of
consummation) (a "Superior Competing Transaction"), then the Company may, in
response to an unsolicited request therefor and subject to compliance with
Section 6.3(b), furnish information with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries to, and participate in discussions and negotiations
directly or through its representatives with, such Third Party. The Company
shall not be permitted to waive the provisions of any "standstill"
agreement between the Company and a Third Party and shall be required to use
all reasonable efforts to enforce the provisions of any such
"standstill" agreement. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the
Board of Directors from complying with    31   Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 6.3, nothing herein shall limit the
ability of the Company or its Subsidiaries to carry out the actions set forth
in Section 6.9.   (b) The Company shall advise Parent orally and in
writing of (i) any Competing Transaction or any inquiry with respect to or
which could reasonably be expected to lead to any Competing Transaction
received by any officer or director of the Company or, to the knowledge of
the Company, any financial advisor, attorney or other advisor or
representative of the Company and (ii) the material terms of such Competing
Transaction. The Company will keep Parent reasonably informed of the status
and details of any such Competing Transaction proposal or inquiry in a timely
manner.   6.4 Reasonable Efforts.   (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions herein provided, each of the parties hereto shall use all
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including using its reasonable efforts to
obtain all necessary or appropriate waivers, consents and approvals, to
effect all necessary registrations, filings and submissions (including, but
not limited to, (i) filings under the HSR Act and any other submissions
requested by the FCC, Federal Trade Commission , Department of Justice, MPUC
or WPSC and (ii) such filings, consents, approvals, orders registrations and
declarations as may be required under the laws of any foreign country in
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries conducts any business or owns
any assets) and to lift any injunction or other legal bar to the Merger (and,
in such case, to proceed with the Merger as expeditiously as possible),
subject, however, to the requisite votes of the shareholders of any or all of
the Company, Newco and Parent. Consistent with the foregoing, the parties
shall use all reasonable efforts to cooperate in the planning of any
dispositions of assets or operations that may be undertaken prior to and in
contemplation of the Merger, including planning to mitigate the tax costs of
any such dispositions.   (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall not be obligated to use its reasonable efforts or take any action
pursuant to this Section 6.4 if in the good faith opinion of the Board of
Directors after consultation with its counsel such actions are reasonably
determined to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s
shareholders under applicable law.    32    6.5 Access to Information.
Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to) afford to officers, employees, counsel, accountants and
other authorized representatives of Parent ("Representatives"), in order to
evaluate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, reasonable access,
during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice throughout the period
prior to the Effective Time, to its properties, books and records and, during
such period, shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish or
make available reasonably promptly to such Representatives all
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as may
reasonably be requested. Parent agrees that it will not, and will cause
its Representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to
this Section 6.5 for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Confidentiality
Agreement, dated October 12, 2000 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), by and
between the Company and Parent shall apply with respect to information
furnished by the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Company\'s officers,
employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives
hereunder.   6.6 Publicity. The parties will consult with each other
and will mutually agree upon any press releases or public
announcements pertaining to the Merger and shall not issue any such press
releases or make any such public announcements prior to such consultation
and agreement, except as may be required by applicable law or by
obligations pursuant to any agreement with any national securities exchange
or automated quotation system, in which case the party proposing to issue
such press release or make such public announcement shall use its
reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before
issuing any such press releases or making any such public announcements.  
6.7 Indemnification of Directors and Officers.   (a) In the event of any
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including, without
limitation, any such claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation
in which any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date
hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer,
employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
(the "Indemnified Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to
(i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or
agent of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, or is or was serving
at the request of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company as a director,
officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint    33   venture, trust or other enterprise or (ii) the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising
before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and
use their commercially reasonable efforts to defend against and respond
thereto. It is understood and agreed that the Company shall indemnify and
hold harmless, and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, indemnify and
hold harmless, as and to the full extent permitted by applicable Law,
each Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or
investigation, and in the event of any such threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation (whether asserted or
arising before or after the Effective Time), (A) the Company, and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the
Surviving Corporation shall, promptly pay expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Party to the full extent permitted by law, subject to the
provision by such Indemnified Party of an undertaking to reimburse the
amounts so advanced in the event of a final non-appealable determination by a
court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled
to such amounts, (B) the Indemnified Parties may retain one counsel
satisfactory to them (except in case of a conflict of interest among two or
more Indemnified Parties, in which case more than one counsel may be
retained), and the Company, and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties
within 30 days after statements therefor are received and (C) the Company and
the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, use their commercially reasonable efforts to assist in the
defense of any such matter; provided that neither the Company nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without its
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld);
and provided further, that the Surviving Corporation shall have no
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if, but only to the
extent that, a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine,
and such determination shall have become final and non-appealable,
that indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated
hereby is prohibited by applicable law. Any Indemnified Party wishing to
claim indemnification under this Section 6.7, upon learning of any such
claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation, shall notify the
Company and, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation,
thereof; provided, that the failure to so notify shall not affect the
obligations of the Company and    34   the Surviving Corporation except
to the extent such failure to notify materially prejudices such party.  
(b) Parent and Newco agree that all rights to indemnification existing in
favor of, and all exculpations and limitations of the personal liability of,
the directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company and the
Subsidiaries of the Company in the Amended and Restated Articles of
Incorporation and By-Laws of the Company as in effect as of the date hereof
with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective time,
including the Merger, shall continue in full force and effect for a period of
not less than six years from the Effective Time; provided, however, that all
rights to indemnification in respect of any claims (each, a "Claim") asserted
or made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such
Claim. For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause
to be maintained in effect the existing directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance and fiduciary insurance policies with an amount of coverage not
less than one-hundred-percent (100%) of the amount of existing coverage, or
policies that are no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties, and with an
amount of coverage not less than one-hundred-percent (100%) of the amount of
existing coverage, than the policies which are currently maintained by the
Company, with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred
at or before the Effective Time, so long as such policies are available for
an annual premium which is no more than two-hundred-percent (200%) of the
current annual premium for the existing policies; provided, that if such
policies are not available for an annual premium of no more than two-hundred-
percent (200%) of the current annual premium, then policies in an amount and
scope as great as can be obtained for an annual premium of two-hundred-
percent (200%) of the current annual premium shall be obtained.   (c) This
Section 6.7 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant third
party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation.
Each of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce the covenants
contained in this Section 6.7.   (d) In the event that the Surviving
Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other person or entity and shall not be the continuing or
surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys
a majority of its properties and assets to any person or entity, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors,
assigns and    35   transferees of the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.   (e) To
the extent permitted by law, all rights of indemnification for the benefit of
any Indemnified Party shall be mandatory rather than permissive.   6.8
Employees.   (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 6.8(a), Parent agrees to
provide or cause to be provided to at least December 31, 2002
employee benefit plans, programs, arrangements and policies for the benefit
of employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries that in the aggregate for
all employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as a group (and not as to
any individual employee) are substantially similar to the Company Plans and
no less favorable in the aggregate than those employee benefit
plans, programs, arrangements and policies for the benefit of similarly
situated employees of Parent and/or its Subsidiaries. In the case of benefit
plans and programs under which benefits are paid or determined by reference
to the value of Shares, Parent agrees that such benefits shall be paid
or determined by reference to the value of shares of Parent Common Stock in
an equitable manner. All service credited to each employee by the
Company through the Effective Time shall be recognized by Parent and/or
its Subsidiaries for all purposes, including for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals under any employee benefit plan
provided by Parent and/or its Subsidiaries for the benefit of the employees,
except that no credit shall be given for benefit accruals which would require
any contribution to or benefits under any or all of Parent\'s pension plans
for periods prior to the Effective Time or would result in duplication
of benefits. Without limiting the foregoing, neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall treat any Company employee as a "new" employee
for purposes of any pre-existing condition exclusions, waiting
periods, evidence of insurability requirements or similar provision under any
health or other welfare plan, and will make appropriate arrangements with
its insurance carrier(s), to the extent applicable, to ensure such
result.   (b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation hereby agree to honor
(without modification except as set forth on Schedule 6.8(b)) and assume the
employment agreements, executive severance agreements and individual benefit
arrangements listed on Schedule 6.8(b), all as in effect at the Effective
Time. It is understood and agreed by the parties hereto that a termination of
employment by an "Executive" after the Effective Time and within 36 calendar
months after a "Change of Control" shall meet the standard of a "Good Reason"
termination (as such terms are used and/or defined in the executive severance
agreements set forth in Schedule 6.8(b)).    36    (c) Parent and the
Surviving Corporation hereby agree to continue in effect the obligations
under the Company\'s Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and its related
trust for the greater of: (i) not less than two years following the Effective
Time and (ii) the time periods required under their respective terms;
provided that the Parent\'s or the Surviving Corporation\'s obligations to
accrue or credit benefits on behalf of a participant under the Company\'s
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan or make contributions under its
related trust shall terminate in the year of the participant\'s death or the
participant\'s termination of his employment with Mid-Plains, Inc.   (d)
Parent and the Surviving Corporation hereby agree to continue in effect the
sick pay banking policy referred to in the Mid- Plains, Inc. employee
handbook.   6.9 Transfer of Interests.   (a) The Company hereby agrees to
cause the transfer of its interest in PCS Wisconsin, LLC prior to the Closing
as set forth in Schedule 6.9(a).   (b) The Company hereby agrees to cause
the transfer of its interest in Madison SMSA Limited Partnership prior to the
Closing as set forth in Schedule 6.9(b).   6.10 Employment Plans. On or
before December 31, 2000 the Company shall amend the Company ESPP to provide
that no Shares will be offered for sale under such plan after that date.  
6.11 Change in Control Matters. The Company shall not take any action that
will trigger the provisions of Section 11 of that certain Joint Venture
Agreement dated September 23, 1999, between HBC Telecom, Inc. and Hiawatha
Broadband Communications, Inc.    37    ARTICLE VII   CONDITIONS TO

each party shall use its reasonable efforts to have any such decree,
ruling, injunction or order vacated.   (c) Governmental Filings and
Consents. All governmental consents, orders and approvals legally required
for the consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby

terminated.   7.2 Conditions to the Company\'s Obligations to Effect
the Merger. The obligations of the Company to effect the Merger are subject
