 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

 



 

 **THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER** (this " **Agreement** ") is entered
into as of October 16, 2017, by and among Midland States Bancorp, Inc., an
Illinois corporation (" **Acquiror** "), Peak Midland Acquisition, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (" **Merger Sub** "), and Alpine
Bancorporation, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " **Company** ").

 



 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

 **A.** The boards of directors of Acquiror and the Company, and the sole
member of Merger Sub have each approved, and the board of directors of the
Company has declared advisable, this Agreement and the merger of the Company
with and into Merger Sub (the " **Merger** "), upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each issued and
outstanding share of Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company
(" **Company Common Stock** "), other than any Excluded Shares, will be
converted into the right to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration.

 



 

 **B.** The parties intend that the Merger qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the
" **Code** "), and that this Agreement be, and hereby is adopted as, a "plan
of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

 



 

 **C.** The parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

 



 

 **AGREEMENTS**

 



 

In consideration of the foregoing premises, which are incorporated herein by
this reference, and the mutual representations, covenants and agreements of
the parties herein contained, and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties,
intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

 



 

 **Article 1**

 



 

 **THE MERGER; BANK MERGER**

 



 

 **Section 1.1** _The Merger_ **.** Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL and the DLLCA,
the Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub at the Effective Time.
Following the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of the Company
shall cease and Merger Sub shall continue as the surviving limited liability
company (the " **Surviving Company** ") and shall succeed to and assume all
the rights and obligations of Merger Sub and the Company in accordance with
the DGCL and the DLLCA.

 



 

 **Section 1.2** _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " **Closing** ")
shall occur at 10:00 a.m., Chicago, Illinois time, at the offices of Barack
Ferrazzano Kirschbaum and Nagelberg LLP, Chicago, Illinois on a date (the "
**Closing Date** ") that is (a) mutually agreed upon by the parties in writing
and that is within the five (5) Business Day period commencing on the date of
the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Legal Requirements) of the
conditions set forth in **Article 8** and **Article 9** (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions); (b) if the
parties are unable to agree upon a Closing Date that is within such five (5)
Business Day period, then the second Business Day after the end of such
period; _provided,_

      
 

 



 

 _however_ , that if the date determined pursuant to this clause (b) is within
the last five (5) Business Days of a month or the first five (5) Business Days
of a month immediately following the month in which such conditions are
satisfied or waived, then the Closing Date shall be the sixth (6th) Business
Day of such immediately following month; or (c) otherwise mutually agreed to
by the parties in writing. Subject to **Article 10**, failure to consummate
the Merger on the date and time and at the place determined pursuant to this
**Section 1.2** will not result in the termination of this Agreement and will
not relieve any party of any obligation under this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 1.3** _Effective Time_ **.** The Merger shall become effective
when a Certificate of Merger (the " **Certificate of Merger** "), executed by
Merger Sub in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and the
DLLCA, is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on
the Closing Date, or at such later time as Merger Sub and the Company shall
agree and is specified in the Certificate of Merger (the " **Effective Time**
"). The Parties shall cause the filing of the Certificate of Merger to be made
as soon as practicable on the Closing Date after the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in **Article 8** and **Article 9**.

 



 

 **Section 1.4** _Effects of the Merger_ **.** The Merger shall have the
effects set forth in the DGCL, the DLLCA and this Agreement. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company shall be vested in
the Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company
shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company.

 



 

 **Section 1.5** _Organizational Documents; Officers_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of formation of Merger Sub shall be
the certificate of formation of the Surviving Company, until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or permitted by applicable law.

 



 

(b) The limited liability company agreement of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the limited liability
company agreement of the Surviving Company until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by applicable law.

 



 

(c) The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Company until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be.

 



 

 **Section 1.6** _Bank Merger_. Following the Merger, if and at such time as
Acquiror may determine in its sole discretion, Alpine Bank and Trust (the "
**Company Bank** "), an Illinois state chartered bank and wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company, will merge with and into Midland States Bank ("
**Acquiror Bank** "), an Illinois state chartered bank and wholly owned
Subsidiary of Acquiror (the " **Bank Merger** "). Acquiror Bank shall be the
surviving entity in the Bank Merger and, following the Bank Merger, the
separate corporate existence of the Company Bank shall cease. In connection
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Acquiror and the Company
shall cause the Acquiror Bank and the Company Bank, respectively, to enter
into an agreement and plan of merger substantially in the form attached hereto
as **Exhibit A**, or such other form as may be mutually agreed (such
agreement, the " **Bank Merger Agreement** "). Prior to the Effective Time,
Acquiror shall cause Acquiror Bank, and the Company shall cause the Company
Bank, to execute such certificates or articles of merger and such other
documents and certificates, and to take such other actions, in each case as
are necessary to effectuate the Bank Merger.

 



       
 

 



 

 **Article 2**

 



 

 **CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER**

 



 

 **Section 2.1** **_Effect on Capital Stock_**. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquiror, Merger
Sub, the Company or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Acquiror,
Merger Sub or the Company, the following shall occur:

 



 

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any
Excluded Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive (i) the Per
Share Cash Consideration and (ii) a number of validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio
(collectively, the " **Common Stock Merger Consideration**"); _provided_ ,
that no fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall be issued in the
Merger. Each holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to
receive a fractional share of Acquiror Common Stock pursuant to this **Section
2.1(a)** shall instead be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in
cash, without interest, rounded to the nearest whole cent, determined by
multiplying the Acquiror Share Trading Price by the fractional share (rounded
to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share) of Acquiror Common Stock to which
such former holder would otherwise be entitled. For purposes of this
Agreement:

 



 

(i) " **Aggregate Cash Amount** " means $33,306,000, subject to adjustment
pursuant **** to **Section 2.1(e)** ;

 



 

(ii) " **Aggregate Share Number** " means 4,463,200;

 



 

(iii) " **Exchange Ratio** " means an amount equal to (x) the Aggregate Share
Number, _divided by_ (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Excluded
Shares;

 



 

(iv) " **Per Share Cash Consideration** " means an amount equal to (x) the
Aggregate Cash Amount, _divided by_ (y) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Excluded
Shares;

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share, including any
shares of Company Common Stock held in the Companys treasury, shall be
cancelled and no consideration will be issued or paid in exchange therefor.

 



 

(c) _No Effect on Limited Liability Company Interests of Merger Sub_ _._ The
Merger shall have no effect on the issued and outstanding limited liability
company interests of Merger Sub, which shall remain outstanding as limited
liability company interests of the Surviving Company.

 



 

(d) _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any issued and outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock held by a Person (a " **Dissenting Stockholder** ") who has not voted in
favor of or consented to the adoption of this Agreement and has complied with
all the provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of holders of such shares
to require appraisal of their Shares (" **Dissenting Shares** ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration, but
shall become the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to
be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to the procedures set forth in
Section 262 of the DGCL. If such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws its demand
for appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its right of appraisal,
in any case pursuant to the DGCL, its shares of Company Common Stock shall be
deemed to be converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Common

 



      
 

 



 

Stock Merger Consideration for each such share, without interest, subject to
the terms of this **Article 2**. At the Effective Time, any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the
previous sentence. The Company shall give Acquiror prompt notice of any
demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and
any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, and shall
give Acquiror the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect thereto. The Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Acquiror, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands.

 



 

(e) _Adjustment of Aggregate Cash Amount_.

 



 

(i) Not later than five (5) days before the expected Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Acquiror an estimated consolidated balance sheet of the
Company, as of the Measurement Date (the " **Estimated Closing Balance Sheet**
" ), which shall (1) be prepared in good faith based on all available
information at such time and in accordance with GAAP on a basis consistent
with the Company Financial Statements; and (2) include a calculation of
Tangible Equity as of the Meaurement Date prepared in accordance with this
Agreement. The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet shall be accompanied by a
certificate of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the
Company to the effect that (x) the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet was
prepared in good faith based on all available information at such time and
fairly presents the consolidated financial position of the Company as
estimated in good faith as of Measurement Date in accordance with GAAP on a
basis consistent with the Company Financial Statements, and (y) the
calculation of Tangible Equity contained therein was prepared in accordance
with this Agreement and includes, excludes, disregards and was reduced by all
amounts required to be included, excluded, disregarded or reduced by the
definition of Tangible Equity in this Agreement.

 



 

(ii) After delivery of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, the parties shall
work together in good faith to agree on a consolidated balance sheet of the
Company as of the Measurement Date (the " **Final Balance Sheet** "), which
shall (1) be prepared in good faith based on all available information at such
time and in accordance with GAAP on a basis consistent with the Company
Financial Statements, and (2) include a calculation of Tangible Equity as of
the Measurement Date in accordance with this Agreement (" **Final Tangible
Equity** "). The Final Balance Sheet and the calculation of Final Tangible
Equity contained therein, agreed to by the parties hereto in writing shall
become final and binding for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(iii) If, no later than the day before the expected Closing Date, the parties
are unable to agree upon a Final Balance Sheet and Final Tangible Equity, the
parties shall promptly submit any items over which a disagreement remains to a
recognized national or regional independent accounting firm mutually
acceptable to the parties, which will act as arbitrator to resolve the
remaining disputed items (the " **Independent Arbitrator** ") and the Closing
Date shall be postponed until the date that is two (2) Business Days after the
date the Independent Arbitrator determines the Final Balance Sheet and Final
Tangible Equity in accordance with this **Section 2.1(e)(iii)** or such other
date as Acquiror and the Company shall mutuall agree in writing; provided
that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Measurement Date shall not be changed
from the date used for preparation of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet. The
parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent
Arbitrator to resolve any dispute and issue a Final Balance Sheet confirming
the correct Final Tangible Equity (as determined in accordance with this
Agreement) as of the Measurement Date within five (5) Business Days following
engagement. The parties will cooperate fully with, and furnish such
information as may be reasonably requested to, the Independent Arbitrator. The
Final Balance Sheet issued by the Independent Arbitrator, as well as the
amount of Final Tangible Equity set forth therein, will be final and binding
for purposes of this Agreement. Each party will bear all costs and fees
incurred by it in connection with the foregoing

 



      
 

 



 

arbitration; _provided, however_ , that the fees and expenses of the
Independent Arbitrator shall be borne by the Company and the Acquiror in the
same proportion that the aggregate amount of disputed items submitted to the
Independent Arbitrator that are unsuccessfully disputed by the Company and the
Acquiror, respectively (as determined by the Independent Arbitrator), bears to
the total amount of items submitted to the Independent Arbitrator.

 



 

(iv) If the Final Tangible Equity is less than $105,400,000 (the " **Target
Tangible Equity** ") (any such deficiency, a " **Tangible Equity Deficiency**
"), the Aggregate Cash Amount shall be reduced by the amount of such Tangible
Equity Deficiency.

 



 

(f) _Adjustment of Aggregate Share Number_. If, between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Acquiror Common
Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number
of shares or into a different class by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or
exchange of shares, the Aggregate Share Number shall be adjusted appropriately
to provide the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 



 

 **Section 2.2** **_Cancellation of Shares_.** At the Effective Time, all
shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and any certificates (it
being understood that any reference herein to a "certificate" shall be deemed
to include reference to any book-entry account statement relating to the
ownership of Company Common Stock) that represented Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed for all purposes to
represent only the right to receive, upon surrender thereof, the Common Stock
Merger Consideration, subject to the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 2.3** **_Exchange of Certificates_**.

 



 

(a) Acquiror shall designate Computershare, Inc., or another Person reasonably
acceptable to the Company, to serve, pursuant to the terms of an exchange
agent agreement, as the exchange agent for purposes of this Agreement (the "
**Exchange Agent** "). Acquiror shall be solely responsible for the payment of
any fees and expenses of the Exchange Agent. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Acquiror shall authorize the issuance of and shall make available to the
Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock for
exchange in accordance with this **Article 2**: (i) the aggregate number of
shares of Acquiror Common Stock deliverable pursuant to **Section 2.1**, and
(ii) the aggregate cash consideration payable pursuant to **Section 2.1**,
including the amount of cash payable in lieu of fractional shares. Such amount
of cash and shares of Acquiror Common Stock, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto paid after the Effective Time, are referred
to in this **Article 2** as the " **Exchange Fund**."

 



 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no
event later than five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, Acquiror shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more
certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (" **Company Stock
Certificates** ") a letter of transmittal (" **Letter of Transmittal** "), in
a form to be agreed by the parties, which specifies, among other things, that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Stock
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such certificates to the
Exchange Agent, together with instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of Company Stock Certificates pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(c) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company. No dividends or other distributions declared
with respect to Acquiror Common Stock and payable to the holders of record
thereof after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any

 



      
 

 



 

unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate that previously represented shares of
Company Common Stock until the holder thereof shall surrender such Company
Stock Certificate in accordance with this **Article 2**. Promptly after the
surrender of a Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this **Article
2**, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends
or other distributions, without interest thereon, which theretofore had become
payable with respect to shares of Acquiror Common Stock into which the shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such Company Stock Certificate were
converted at the Effective Time pursuant to **Section 2.1**. No holder of an
unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate that previously represented shares of
Company Common Stock shall be entitled, until the surrender of such Company
Stock Certificate, to vote the shares of Acquiror Common Stock into which such
holders Company Common Stock shall have been converted.

 



 

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of the Company one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the Surviving Company, or its successors in interest. Any stockholders
of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this **Article 2**
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company, or its successors in
interest, for issuance and payment of the Common Stock Merger Consideration
(including the payment of cash in lieu of any fractional shares deliverable in
respect of such stockholders shares of Company Common Stock, as well as any
accrued and unpaid dividends or distributions on shares of such Acquiror
Common Stock). Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Company,
the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.

 



 

(e) If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Company Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Acquiror or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a
bond in such amount as Acquiror or the Exchange Agent may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Company Stock Certificate, Acquiror shall, or shall
cause the Exchange Agent to, deliver to such person the Common Stock Merger
Consideration (including cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in
respect of such stockholders shares of Company Common Stock, as well as any
accrued and unpaid dividends or distributions on shares of such Acquiror
Common Stock) into which the shares represented by such lost Company Stock
Certificate shall have been converted, subject to the terms of and in
accordance with this **Article 2**.

 



 

 **Section 2.4** **_Company Equity Awards_**. The Company shall take all
necessary actions so that all restricted stock units granted under the Company
Stock Plans will vest on the date on which the Effective Time occurs,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall be cancelled by the Company
in consideration for which the holder thereof shall thereupon be entitled to
receive from the Acquiror promptly after the Effective Time a cash payment for
each such restricted stock unit equal to $19.55.

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed, or
caused to be filed (taking into account all applicable extensions), all Tax
Returns that it was required to file, and each such Tax Return was true,
correct and complete in all material respects when filed. The Company and each
of its Subsidiaries has paid, or made adequate provision for the payment of,
all Taxes (whether or not reflected in Tax Returns as filed or due to be

in good faith and as to which adequate reserves have been provided.

 



 

(b) There is no claim or assessment pending or threatened against the Company
and its Subsidiaries for any Taxes that they owe. No audit, examination or
investigation related to Taxes paid or payable by the Company and each of its

(c) **Schedule 3.12(c)** of the Company Disclosure Schedules contains a true
and complete list of each state in which the Company and Company Bank are
treated for such states income or franchise Tax purposes, in a manner
comparable to the federal Tax treatment of a S Corporation, or a qualified
Subchapter S subsidiary within the meaning of Section 1361(b)(3)(B) of the
Code (a " **QSub** ), as appropriate. For purposes of this representation, the
state Tax treatment shall be deemed comparable to that of an S Corporation or
QSub if the states income or franchise Tax on the corporations net income is
eliminated or materially reduced and such net income (net of state corporate
Taxes, if any) is treated as taxable to the stockholders of the S Corporation
whether or not distributed thereto. **Schedule 3.12(c)** of the Company
Disclosure Schedules also specifies, for each such state listed therein, the
period during which the Company has been subject to such comparable S
Corporation or QSub state Tax treatment.

 



 

(d) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has delivered or made available
to Acquiror true, correct and complete copies of all Tax Returns relating to
income taxes, franchise taxes and all other material taxes owed by the Company

(e) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has not engaged in any
transaction that could materially affect the Tax liability for any Tax Returns
not closed by applicable statute of limitations: (i) which is a "listed
transaction" as set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(2) or
(ii) with respect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been
required to disclose on its federal income Tax Returns any position that could
give rise to a substantial understatement of federal income tax within the
meaning of Section 6662 of the Code or the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder.

 



 

(f) During the period commencing January 1, 2006, and ending on the close of
business on the Closing Date (the " **S Period** "), the Company has been an
"S corporation" within the meaning of Section 1361(a) of the Code, and a valid
election under Section 1362 of the Code (an " **S election** ") has been in
effect with respect to the Company at all times for the S Period. A valid S
election or similar election has been in effect with respect to the Company
during the S Period in all relevant state and local jurisdictions in which the
Company is subject to Tax and in which such election is required in order for
the Company to be treated as an "S corporation" for applicable state or local
Tax purposes.

 



      
 

 



 

There have been no events, transactions or activities of the Company, the
Companys Subsidiaries or any of the Companys stockholders which would cause,
or would have caused, the status of the Company as S corporation to be subject
to termination or revocation (whether purposefully or inadvertently). Each of
the Companys stockholders has been a Person described in Section
1361(b)(1)(B) of the Code at all times that such Person held shares of Company
Common Stock during the S Period, and at no time during the S Period was any
stockholder of the Company a non-resident alien.

 



 

(g) During the S Period, each of Company Bank and each other current or former
Subsidiary of the Company was a QSub, and a valid election under Section
1361(b)(3)(B) of the Code (a " **QSub election** ") has been in effect with
respect to the Company Bank and such other Subsidiaries at all times for such
period, without accounting for any later attempts or actions taken to cure an
invalid QSub election during the S Period, and as of the Closing Date each of
the Company Bank and such other Subsidiaries will be a QSub. A valid QSub
election or similar election has been in effect with respect to the Company
Bank and each other current or former Subsidiary of the Company during such
period, in all relevant state and local jurisdictions in which the Company is
subject to Tax and in which such election is required in order for each of
Company Bank and such other Subsidiaries to be treated as a QSub for
applicable state or local Tax purposes.

 



 

(h) To the Knowledge of the Company, no claim has been made in writing by any
Regulatory Authority in any jurisdiction where the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, is, or may be, subject to Tax by that
jurisdiction. No private letter rulings, technical advice memoranda or similar
rulings have been requested by or with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or entered into or issued by any taxing authority with respect
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(i) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have complied in all material
respects with all Legal Requirements relating to the payment and withholding
of Taxes and has properly and timely withheld all Taxes required to be
withheld by the Company in connection with amounts paid or owing to any
employee, former employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder,
Affiliate, customer, supplier or other Person. To the extent required, the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries have properly and timely paid all such
withheld Taxes to the Regulatory Authority or have properly set aside such
withheld amounts in accounts for such purpose.

 



 

(j) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
include any item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable
income for any taxable period or portion thereof ending after the Closing Date
as a result of any change in method of accounting under Section 481 of the
Code (or any comparable provision of state, local or foreign Tax laws), or use
of an improper method of accounting, for a taxable period ending on or prior
to the Closing Date.

 



 

(k) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a member of an
affiliated, combined, consolidated or unitary Tax group for Tax purposes,
other than the group the common parent of which is the Company. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability for the Taxes of any
Person under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision
of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract or
otherwise.

 



 

(l) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any potential
liability for any Tax under Section 1374 of the Code and shall not be subject
to Tax under Section 1374 of the Code in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions. During the past ten (10) years, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has (i) acquired assets from another corporation in a
transaction in which the Companys Tax basis for the acquired assets was
determined, in whole or in part, by reference to the Tax

 



      
 

 



 

basis of the acquired assets (or any other property) in the hands of the
transferor or (ii) acquired the stock of any corporation that is a QSub.

(b) Except as set forth on **Schedule 3.13(b)(i)** of the Company Disclosure
Schedules, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including possible

Company Benefit Plan that is a "multiple employer plan" (as described in
Section 413(c) of the Code) or is provided by or through a professional
employer organization, such Company Benefit Plan complies in all respects with
the requirements of the Code and ERISA and neither the Company nor any of the
Company ERISA Affiliates has any liabilities other than the payment and/or
remittance of premiums and/or required contributions on behalf of enrolled
individuals. Neither the Company nor any of the Company ERISA Affiliates
sponsors, maintains, administers or contributes to, or has ever sponsored,

Benefit Plan is underfunded when comparing the present value of accrued
liabilities under such plan to the market value of plan assets.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401
and related provisions of the Code is the subject of a favorable determination
letter from the IRS to the effect that it is so qualified under the Code and
that its related funding instrument is tax exempt under Section 501 of the
Code (or the Company and its Subsidiaries are otherwise relying on an opinion
letter issued to the prototype sponsor), and there are no facts or
circumstances that would adversely affect the qualified status of any Company
Benefit Plan or the tax-exempt status of any related trust.

 



 

(e) Each Company Benefit Plan is and has been administered in all material
respects in compliance with its terms and with all applicable Legal
Requirements.

Business, there is no litigation, claim or assessment pending or, to the
Companys Knowledge, threatened by, on behalf of, or against any Company
Benefit Plan or against the administrators or trustees or other fiduciaries of
any Company Benefit Plan that alleges a violation of applicable state or
federal law or violation of any Company Benefit Plan document or related
agreement.

 



 

(g) No Company Benefit Plan fiduciary or any other person has, or has had, any
liability to any Company Benefit Plan participant, beneficiary or any other
person under any provisions of ERISA or any other applicable Legal Requirement
by reason of any action or failure to act in connection with any Company
Benefit Plan, including any liability by any reason of any payment of, or
failure to pay, benefits or any other amounts or by reason of any credit or
failure to give credit for any benefits or rights. No disqualified person (as

would have any liability, whether absolute or contingent, under any Company

foregoing Persons with the meaning of Regulation O promulgated by the Federal
Reserve has any loan, deposit account or other agreement or arrangement with
the Company or Company Bank, or any interest in any material property (whether
real, personal or mixed or tangible or intangible) used in or pertaining to
the business of the Company or Company Bank.

 



 

 **Section 3.22** **_Voting Requirements_.** The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock at the
Company Stockholders Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof to
adopt this Agreement (such vote, the " **Company Stockholder Approval** ") is
the only vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock or voting
securities of, or other equity interests in, the Company necessary to adopt
this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 3.23** **_State Takeover Statutes_.** The restrictions contained
in Section 203 of the DGCL applicable to a "business combination" (as defined
in Section 203 of the DGCL) will not apply to this Agreement, the Bank Merger
Agreement, the Voting Agreement or any of the Contemplated Transactions. No
other state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation applies to this
Agreement, the Bank Merger Agreement, the Voting Agreement or any of the
Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

 **Section 3.24** **_Opinion of Financial Advisor_.** The Company has
received the opinion of Affiliated Bankers Capital, LLC d/b/a Sheshunoff and
Co., to the effect that, as of the date of the meeting at which the Company
Board approved and authorized the Companys entry into this Agreement, the
Common Stock Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, other than any Excluded Shares
and Dissenting Shares. The Company shall deliver an executed copy of such
opinion to Acquiror promptly following receipt of such opinion in written
form.

 



 

 **Section 3.25** **_Brokerage Commissions_.** Except for fees payable to
Sheshunoff and Co. pursuant to an engagement letter, a copy of which is attached
as **Schedule 3.25** of the Company Disclosure Schedules, none of the Company
or its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Representatives, has incurred
any obligation or liability, contingent or otherwise, for brokerage or
finders fees or agents commissions or other similar payment in connection
with this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 3.26** **_Approval Delays_.** To the Knowledge of the Company,
there is no reason why the granting of any of the Requisite Regulatory
Approvals would be denied or unduly delayed. The Company Banks most recent
CRA rating was "satisfactory" or better.

 



 

 **Section 3.27** **_Labor Matters_**.

 



 

(a) There are no collective bargaining agreements or other labor union
Contracts applicable to any employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. There is no labor dispute, strike, work stoppage or lockout, or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, threat thereof, by or with respect to any
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and there has been no
labor dispute, strike, work stoppage or lockout in the previous three (3)
years. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no

 



      
 

 



 

organizational efforts with respect to the formation of a collective
bargaining unit presently being made, or threatened, involving employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged or is engaging in any unfair labor practice. The
Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with
all applicable Legal Requirements respecting employment and employment
practices, terms and conditions of employment, wages, hours of work, overtime
and occupational safety and health. No Proceeding asserting that the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor practice (within the
meaning of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935) or seeking to compel the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to bargain with any labor organization as
to wages or conditions of employment is pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
before the National Labor Relations Board, the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission or any other Regulatory Authority.

 



 

(b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or
otherwise bound by, any consent decree with, or citation by, any Regulatory
Authority relating to employees or employment practices. None of the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their executive officers has received
within the past three (3) years any written notice of intent by any Regulatory
Authority responsible for the enforcement of labor or employment laws to
conduct an investigation relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no such investigation is in progress.

 



 

 **Section 3.28** **_Intellectual Property_. ** Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has the unrestricted right and authority, and the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries will have the unrestricted right and authority
from and after the Effective Time, to use all patents, trademarks, copyrights,
service marks, trade names or other intellectual property owned by them as is
necessary to enable them to conduct and to continue to conduct all material
phases of the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries in the manner
presently conducted by them, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, such use
does not, and will not, conflict with, infringe on or violate any patent,
trademark, copyright, service mark, trade name or any other intellectual
property right of any Person.

 



 

 **Section 3.29** **_Investments_**.

 



 

(a) **Schedule 3.29(a)** of the Company Disclosure Schedules includes a
complete and correct list and description as of September 30, 2017, of: (i)
all investment and debt securities, mortgage-backed and related securities,
marketable equity securities and securities purchased under agreements to
resell that are owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries, other than, with
respect to the Company Bank, in a fiduciary or agency capacity (the "
**Company Investment Securities** "); and (ii) any such Company Investment
Securities that are pledged as collateral to another Person. The Company and
each Subsidiary has good and marketable title to all Company Investment
Securities held by it, free and clear of any liens, mortgages, security
interests, encumbrances or charges, except for Company Permitted Exceptions
and except to the extent such Company Investment Securities are pledged in the
Ordinary Course of Business consistent with prudent banking practices to
secure obligations of the Company or the Company Bank. The Company Investment
Securities are valued on the books of the Company and the Company Bank in
accordance with GAAP.

 



 

(b) Except as may be imposed by applicable securities laws and restrictions
that may exist for securities that are classified as "held to maturity," none
of the Company Investment Securities is subject to any restriction, whether
contractual or statutory, that materially impairs the ability of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of such investment at any time. With
respect to all material repurchase agreements to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party, the Company or such Subsidiary of the Company, as
the case may be, has a valid, perfected first lien or security interest in the
securities or other collateral securing each such repurchase agreement, and
the value of the collateral

 



      
 

 



 

securing each such repurchase agreement equals or exceeds the amount of the
debt secured by such collateral under such agreement.

 



 

(c) None of the Company or its Subsidiaries has sold or otherwise disposed of
any Company Investment Securities in a transaction in which the acquiror of
such Company Investment Securities or other person has the right, either
conditionally or absolutely, to require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to repurchase or otherwise reacquire any such Company Investment Securities.

 



 

(d) **Schedule 3.29(d)** of the Company Disclosure Schedules lists as of
September 30, 2017, and the Company has previously made available a true,
complete and correct copy of, each Contract with respect to each Derivative
Transaction, whether entered into for the account of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or for a Trust Account, all of which were entered into in the
Ordinary Course of Business and in accordance with prudent banking practice
and applicable Legal Requirements of applicable Regulatory Authorities and in
accordance with the investment, securities, commodities, risk management and
other policies, practices and procedures employed by the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and with counterparties believed at the time to be financially
responsible and able to understand (either alone or in consultation with their
advisers) and to bear the risks of such Derivative Transactions. All of such
Derivative Transactions are legal, valid and binding obligations of the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries enforceable against it in accordance with
their terms (except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and
subject to general principles of equity), and are in full force and effect.
The Company and its Subsidiaries have duly performed their obligations under
the Derivative Transactions to the extent that such obligations to perform
have accrued and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no breaches,
violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any party
thereunder.

 



 

 **Section 3.30** **_No Other Representations or Warranties_**

 



 

(a) Except for the representations and warranties made by the Company in this
**Article 3**, neither the Company nor any other Person makes any express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to the Company, its
Subsidiaries, or their respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities,
conditions (financial or otherwise) or prospects, and the Company hereby
disclaims any such other representations or warranties. In particular, without
limiting the foregoing disclaimer, except as expressly set forth herein
neither the Company nor any other Person makes or has made any representation

respect to: (i) any financial projection, forecast, estimate, budget or
prospective information relating to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective businesses; or (ii) any oral or written information presented

due diligence investigation of the Company, the negotiation of this Agreement
or in the course of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Person has made or is making any express or implied representation or warranty
other than those contained in **Article 4**.

a corporation or limited liability company duly organized or formed, as
applicable, and validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
state of organization of formation, and is also in good standing in each other
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted or the properties

where the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror; and (b) has full corporate and limited
liability company power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties
as presently owned, operated and leased, and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted. Acquiror is registered with the Federal Reserve as a

full corporate or limited liability company power and authority to operate as
a bank holding company. The copies of the Acquiror Articles of Incorporation
and Acquiror Bylaws and all amendments thereto set forth in the Acquiror SEC

date of this Agreement. Acquiror has no subsidiary other than Merger Sub and
the subsidiaries listed on Exhibit 21.1 to Acquirors Registration Statement
on Form S-4 (File No. 333-216708).

 



 

 **Section 4.2** **_Acquiror Subsidiary Organizations_**. Acquiror Bank is an
Illinois state chartered bank duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Illinois and is a member of the
Federal Reserve System. Each Acquiror Subsidiary is an entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its organization and is also in good standing in each other jurisdiction in
which the nature of the business conducted or the properties or assets owned
or leased by it makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure
to be so qualified and in good standing would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on Acquiror. Each Subsidiary of Acquiror has full corporate or similar
power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties as presently
owned, operated and leased, and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. The deposit accounts of Acquiror Bank are insured by the FDIC
through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements, and all premiums and assessments required to be
paid in connection therewith have been paid when due. Acquiror has delivered
or made available to the Company copies of the charter (or similar
organizational documents) and bylaws of each Subsidiary of Acquiror and all
amendments thereto, each of which are true, complete and correct and in full
force and effect as of the date of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 4.3** **_Authorization; Enforceability_.** Each of Acquiror and
Merger Sub has the requisite corporate or limited liability company power and
authority to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by the
Acquiror Board and the sole member of Merger Sub. The sole member of the
Merger Sub has the sole right to manage the business and affairs of the Merger
Sub pursuant to the limited liability company agreement. The Acquiror Board
and the sole member of Merger Sub have each determined that the Merger, on the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, is in the best interests of
its respective shareholders or member, and that this Agreement and
transactions contemplated hereby are in the best interests of its respective
shareholders or member. To the extent required by NASDAQ Rules, the Acquiror
Board has directed the Acquiror Stock Issuance be submitted to Acquirors
shareholders for consideration at a duly held meeting of such shareholders and
has resolved to recommend that Acquirors shareholders vote in favor of the
Acquiror Stock Issuance. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Acquiror, and the consummation by it of its obligations under
this Agreement, have been authorized by all necessary corporate action,
subject to the Acquiror Shareholder Approval, and, subject to the receipt of
the Requisite Regulatory Approvals, this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of Acquiror enforceable in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or other Legal Requirements affecting creditors rights
generally and subject to general principles of equity.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 4.4** **_No Conflict_.** Neither the execution nor delivery of
this Agreement nor the consummation or performance of any of the Contemplated
Transactions will, directly or indirectly (with or without notice or lapse of
time): (a) assuming receipt of the Acquiror Shareholder Approval, as
necessary, contravene, conflict with or result in a violation of any provision
of the articles of incorporation, certificate of formation or charter (or
similar organizational documents) or bylaws or operating agreement, each as in
effect on the date hereof, or any currently effective resolution adopted by
the board of directors, shareholders, manager or members of, Acquiror or any

(c) Other than awards under Acquiror Stock Plans that are outstanding as of
the date of this Agreement, no equity-based awards were outstanding as of the

otherwise acquire, any shares of capital stock of Acquiror or any of its
Subsidiaries; and (ii) no contractual obligations of Acquiror or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of Acquiror

of capital stock or any other equity security of Acquiror or its Subsidiaries.
Except as permitted by this Agreement, since the Acquiror Capitalization Date,
no shares of Acquiror Common Stock have been purchased, redeemed or otherwise
acquired, directly or indirectly, by Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries and
no dividends or other distributions payable in any equity securities of

 **Section 4.6** **_Acquiror Subsidiary Capitalization_**. Except as
disclosed in the Acquiror SEC Reports, as of the date hereof all of the issued
and outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of
each Subsidiary of Acquiror are owned by Acquiror, directly or indirectly,
free and clear of any liens, pledges, charges, claims and security interests
and similar encumbrances, and all of such shares or equity ownership interests
are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and
free of preemptive rights. No Subsidiary of Acquiror has or is bound by any
outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements
of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital
stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities
representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital
stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary.

 



 

 **Section 4.7** **_Acquiror SEC Reports; Financial Statements and Reports;
Regulatory Filings_**.

 



 

(a) Acquiror has timely filed all Acquiror SEC Reports, except where the
failure to file any Acquiror SEC Report, either individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Acquiror, and all such Acquiror SEC Reports complied as to form in all
material respects, as of their respective filing dates and effective dates, as
the case may be, with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder. The Acquiror SEC Reports were prepared in accordance with

 



      
 

 



 

applicable Legal Requirements in all material respects. As of their respective
filing dates, none of the Acquiror SEC Reports contained an untrue statement
of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that
information filed as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement)
is deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of the date hereof,
there are no outstanding comments from or unresolved issues raised by the SEC
with respect to any of the Acquiror SEC Reports. No Subsidiary of Acquiror is
required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d)
of the Exchange Act.

 



 

(b) The financial statements presented (or incorporated by reference) in the
Acquiror SEC Reports (including the related notes, where applicable) have been
prepared in conformity with GAAP, except in each case as indicated in such
statements or the notes thereto, and comply in all material respects with all
applicable Legal Requirements. Taken together, the financial statements
presented in the Acquiror SEC Reports (collectively, the " **Acquiror
Financial Statements** ") are complete and correct in all material respects
and fairly and accurately present the respective financial position, assets,
liabilities and results of operations of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries at the
respective dates of and for the periods referred to in the Acquiror Financial
Statements, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments in the case of
unaudited Acquiror Financial Statements. The Acquiror Financial Statements do
not include any assets or omit to state any liabilities, absolute or
contingent, or other facts, which inclusion or omission would render the
Acquiror Financial Statements misleading in any material respect as of the
respective dates thereof and for the periods referred to therein. As of the
date hereof, Crowe Horwath LLP has not resigned (or informed Acquiror that it
intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent registered public
accountants of Acquiror.

 



 

(c) Acquiror is in compliance in all material respects with all of the
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that are applicable to it or any
of its Subsidiaries. Acquiror maintains a system of disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that
are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed by Acquiror in reports that Acquiror is required to file under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to Acquirors management to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures. As of December 31, 2016, to the
Knowledge of Acquiror, such controls and procedures were effective, in all
material respects, to provide such reasonable assurance.

 



 

(d) Acquiror and its consolidated Subsidiaries have established and maintained
a system of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Acquirors certifying
officers have evaluated the effectiveness of Acquirors Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting as of the end of the period covered by the most recently
filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Acquiror under the Exchange Act (the "
**Acquiror Evaluation Date** "). Acquiror presented in such quarterly report
the conclusions of the certifying officers about the effectiveness of
Acquirors Internal Control Over Financial Reporting based on their
evaluations as of the Acquiror Evaluation Date. Since the Acquiror Evaluation
Date, there have been no changes in Acquirors Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, Acquirors Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Acquiror has devised and maintains a system of internal accounting controls
sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that: (i) transactions are
executed in accordance with managements general or specific authorization;
(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets;
(iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements
general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for
assets is compared with existing assets at reasonable intervals and
appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all forms, reports and
documents required to be filed since January 1, 2014, with all applicable
federal or state securities or banking authorities except to the extent
failure would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror and its
Subsidiaries. Such forms, reports and documents: (i) complied as to form in
all material respects with applicable Legal Requirements; and (ii) did not at
the time they were filed, after giving effect to any amendment thereto filed
prior to the date hereof, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed as of a
later date (but before the date of this Agreement) is deemed to modify
information as of an earlier date.

 



 

(f) To the Knowledge of Acquiror, there has not been any event or occurrence
since January 1, 2014 that would result in a determination that Acquiror Bank
is not an eligible depository institution as defined in 12 C.F.R. §303.2(r).

 



 

(g) Acquirors securities are not listed, or quoted, for trading on any U.S.
domestic or foreign securities exchange, other than the NASDAQ Global Select
Market. Acquiror satisfies all of the quantitative maintenance criteria of the
NASDAQ Global Select Market.

 



 

 **Section 4.8** **_Books and Records_**. The books of account, minute books,
stock record books and other records of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries are
complete and correct in all material respects and have been maintained in
accordance with Acquirors business practices and all applicable Legal
Requirements in all material respects, including the maintenance of an
adequate system of internal controls required by such Legal Requirements. The
minute books of Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries fairly reflect the
substance of events and transactions included therein.

 



 

 **Section 4.9** **_Loans; Loan Loss Reserve_**.

 



 

(a) Acquiror Banks allowance for loan and lease losses reflected in the
Acquiror Financial Statements (including footnotes thereto) was determined on
the basis of Acquiror Banks continuing review and evaluation of the portfolio
of Acquiror Loans under the requirements of GAAP and Legal Requirements, was
established in a manner consistent with Acquiror Banks internal policies,
and, in the reasonable judgment of Acquiror Bank, was adequate in all material
respects under the requirements of GAAP and all Legal Requirements to provide
for possible or specific losses, net of recoveries relating to Acquiror Loans
previously charged-off, on outstanding Acquiror Loans.

 



 

(b) To the Knowledge of Acquiror: (i) none of the Acquiror Loans is subject to
any material offset or claim of offset; and (ii) the aggregate loan balances
in excess of Acquiror Banks allowance for loan and lease losses are, based on
past loan loss experience, collectible in accordance with their terms (except
as limited above) and all uncollectible loans have been charged off.

 



 

 **Section 4.10** **_Taxes_**.

 



 

(a) Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries have duly and timely filed (taking
into account all applicable extensions) all Tax Returns required to be filed
by them, and each such Tax Return was true, correct and complete in all
material respects when filed. Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries have paid,
or made adequate provision for the payment of, all Taxes (whether or not
reflected in Tax Returns as filed or to be filed) due and payable by Acquiror
and each of its Subsidiaries, or claimed to be due and payable by any
Regulatory Authority, and are not delinquent in the payment of any Tax, except
such Taxes as are being contested in good faith and as to which adequate

Proposal) on a reasonably current basis.

 



 

(b) The Company agrees that it will not, and will cause its respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and its and their respective officers, directors,
agents and advisors not to, initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly
facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to, or engage in any
negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or nonpublic information
or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to, any
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that, if the Company receives an unsolicited
_bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal from a Person other than Acquiror after the
execution of this Agreement and prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, and the Company Board concludes in good faith that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be likely to
result in a Superior Proposal and, after considering the advice of outside
counsel, that failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Legal Requirements, the Company
may: (i) furnish information with respect to it to such Person making such
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement
(subject to the requirement that any such information not previously provided
to Acquiror shall be promptly furnished to Acquiror); (ii) participate in
discussions or negotiations regarding such Acquisition Proposal; and (iii)
terminate this Agreement in order to concurrently enter into an agreement with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal; _provided, however_ , that the Company
may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this **Section** **5.9** unless
and until (x) five (5) Business Days have elapsed following the delivery to
Acquiror of a written notice of such determination by the Company Board and,
during such five (5) Business-Day period, Acquiror and the Company cooperate
with one another with the intent of enabling them to engage in good faith
negotiations so that the Contemplated Transactions may be effected, and (y) at
the end of such five (5) Business-Day period, the Company continues, in good
faith and after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, to believe that a Superior Proposal continues to exist.

 



 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange
Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ that such Rules will
in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such
Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 5.10** **_Subordinated Note Divestiture_**. Prior to the Closing,

that were issued by Acquiror, including the Fixed-to-Floating Rate
Subordinated Note due June 18, 2025 that was issued by Acquiror to Alpine Bank
prior to the date hereof (the " **Subordinated Note** "), which sale or
approval shall be subject to the receipt of Acquirors prior written consent,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. From and
after the

 



      
 

 



 

date hereof and prior to the Closing, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall acquire any debt securities issued by Acquiror or any of
its Subsidiaries.

days following the date hereof, prepare and file all applications and other
documents necessary to, and to as promptly as practicable thereafter, effect
and obtain, all Requisite Regulatory Approvals, and the parties will comply
with the terms of such Requisite Regulatory Approvals. Each of Acquiror and
the Company will have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult with the other, in each case subject to
applicable Legal Requirements relating to the exchange of information, with
respect to all public, non-confidential substantive written applications,
documents and information submitted to any Regulatory Authority in connection
with the Requisite Regulatory Approvals. In exercising the foregoing right,
each of the parties will act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each
party agrees that it will consult with the other party with respect to
obtaining all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
Regulatory Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions, and each party will keep the other party apprised of the status
of material matters relating to completion of the Contemplated Transactions.
Acquiror and the Company will, upon request, furnish the other party with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such other party or any of its Subsidiaries with or to any
Regulatory Authority in connection with the

 



      
 

 



 

Contemplated Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, including
the covenants set forth in **Sections 7.1** and **7.4** , nothing in this

agree to any concession, make any payment, take (or refrain from taking) any
action, or commit to do any of the foregoing, to obtain any Requisite
Regulatory Approval, or to enable, facilitate or permit the Company to obtain
any Requisite Regulatory Approval, if such consent, undertaking, concession or
action is materially adverse to Acquiror.

and file with the SEC the Registration Statement, in which the Joint Proxy
Statement will be included. Acquiror shall use its reasonable best efforts to
have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep the Registration
Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the
Contemplated Transactions. Prior to the filing of the Registration Statement,
Acquiror shall consult with the Company with respect to such filing and shall
afford the Company and its representatives reasonable opportunity to review
and comment thereon. The Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement
shall include all information reasonably requested by the Company to be
included. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders, and Acquiror will
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be
mailed to Acquirors shareholders, in each case as promptly as practicable
after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities
Act. Acquiror shall also take any action required to be taken under any
applicable Legal Requirement in connection with the Acquiror Stock Issuance,
and each party shall furnish all information concerning itself and its
stockholders as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such
action. Acquiror will advise and consult with the Company, promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has
become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance
of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of Acquiror Common
Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC to amend the Joint Proxy Statement or
the Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional information, and the Company will advise
Acquiror, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC
to amend the Joint Proxy Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto
or requests by the SEC for additional information. The parties shall use
reasonable best efforts to respond (with the assistance of the other party) as
promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto. If
prior to the Effective Time any event occurs with respect to the Company,
Acquiror or any Subsidiary of the Company or Acquiror, respectively, or any
change occurs with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of the
Company or Acquiror, respectively, for inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement
or the Registration Statement that, in each case, is required to be described
in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement or the
Registration Statement, the Company or Acquiror, as applicable, shall promptly
notify the other of such event (including, prior to entering into any
agreement providing for any merger, consolidation, amalgamation, share
exchange, business combination, issuance of securities, acquisition of
securities, tender offer, exchange offer or other similar transaction
involving Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries), and the Company or Acquiror,
as applicable, shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any
necessary amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement and the
Registration Statement and, as required by applicable Legal Requirements, in
disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to the
Companys stockholders and to Acquirors shareholders. Acquiror shall take all
action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it
is not now so qualified) required to be taken under the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, any application foreign or state securities or "blue sky" Legal
Requirements and the rules and regulations thereunder in connection with the
Merger and the issuance of Acquiror Common Stock as consideration hereunder.

 



       
 

 



 

 **Section 7.3** **_Publicity_.** Neither the Company nor Acquiror shall, and
neither the Company nor Acquiror shall permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
announcement with respect to, or otherwise make any public statement or,
except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, any disclosure of
nonpublic information to a third party, concerning, the Contemplated
Transactions without the prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) of Acquiror, in the case of a proposed announcement,
statement or disclosure by the Company, or the Company, in the case of a
proposed announcement, statement or disclosure by Acquiror; _provided,
however_ , that either party may, without the prior consent of the other party
(but after prior consultation with the other party to the extent practicable
under the circumstances), issue or cause the publication of any press release
or other public announcement to the extent required by applicable Legal
Requirements or by the NASDAQ Rules.

 



 

 **Section 7.4** **_Reasonable Best Efforts; Cooperation_**. Each of Acquiror
and the Company agrees to exercise good faith and use its commercially
reasonable efforts to satisfy the various covenants and conditions to Closing
in this Agreement, and to consummate the Contemplated Transactions as promptly
as practicable. Neither Acquiror nor the Company will intentionally take or
intentionally permit to be taken any action that would be a breach of the
terms or provisions of this Agreement. Between the date of this Agreement and
the Closing Date, each of Acquiror and the Company will, and will cause each
Subsidiary of Acquiror and the Company, respectively, and all of their
respective Affiliates and Representatives to, cooperate with respect to all
filings that any party is required by any applicable Legal Requirements to
make in connection with the Contemplated Transactions. Subject to applicable
Legal Requirements and the instructions of any Regulatory Authority, each
party shall keep the other party reasonably apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the Contemplated Transactions, including
promptly furnishing the other party with copies of notices or other written
communications received by it or any of its Subsidiaries from any Regulatory

 **Section 7.5** **_Tax Matters_**.

 



 

(a) The parties intend that the Merger qualify as a nontaxable reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) and related sections of the Code and that
this Agreement constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 1.368-2(g) of the income tax regulations promulgated under the Code.
From and after the date of this Agreement and until the Effective Time, each
of the Company and Acquiror shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, and
shall cause their Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts, to
cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code, and will not knowingly take any action, cause any action
to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken
which action or failure to act could prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Following the
Effective Time, neither Acquiror nor any Affiliate of Acquiror knowingly shall
take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action, or
cause any action to fail to be taken, which action or failure to act could
prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. Prior to the earlier of: (i) forty-five (45) days
following the Effective Time; and (ii) January 15 of the calendar year
following the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall comply with the
reporting requirements of Section 1.6045B-1(a)(2) of the Treasury Regulations.
Each of the Company and Acquiror shall report the Merger as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code on its United States federal
income Tax Return, unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination"
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code. Neither Acquiror nor any of
its Affiliates will make an election pursuant to Section 301.7701-3 of the
Treasury Regulations with respect to Merger Sub effective on or prior to the
Effective Time.

 



 

(b) As of the date hereof, the Company has no Knowledge of any reason: (i) why
it would not be able to deliver to counsel to the Company and counsel to
Acquiror, at the date of the legal

 



      
 

 



 

opinions referred to in **Section 8.9** and **Section 9.7**, certificates
substantially in compliance with IRS published advance ruling guidelines, with
reasonable or customary exceptions and modifications thereto (the " **IRS
Guidelines** ), to enable counsel to Acquiror and counsel to the Company to
deliver the legal opinions contemplated by **Section 8.9** and **Section
9.7**, respectively, and the Company hereby agrees to deliver such
certificates effective as of the date of such opinions; or (ii) why counsel to
the Company would not be able to deliver the opinion required by **Section
9.7**. The Company will deliver such certificates to counsel to the Company
and counsel to Acquiror.

 



 

(c) As of the date hereof, Acquiror has no Knowledge of any reason: (i) why it
would not be able to deliver to counsel to Acquiror and counsel to the
Company, at the date of the legal opinions referred to in **Section 8.9** and
**Section 9.7**, certificates substantially in compliance with the IRS
Guidelines, to enable counsel to Acquiror and counsel to the Company to
deliver the legal opinions contemplated by **Section 8.9** and **Section
9.7**, respectively, and Acquiror hereby agrees to deliver such certificates
effective as of the date of such opinions; or (ii) why counsel to Acquiror
would not be able to deliver the opinion required by **Section 8.9**.
Acquiror will deliver such certificates to counsel to Acquiror and counsel to
the Company.

 



 

(d) Acquiror shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns of the Company for taxable periods (or portion thereof)
that end on or before the Closing Date and that are required to be filed after
the Closing Date (" **Pre-Closing Tax Returns** "). Such Pre-Closing Tax
Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice (unless
otherwise required by law) and without a change of any election or any
accounting method. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Companys
stockholders shall include any income, gain, loss, deduction or other tax
items for such taxable periods on their Tax Returns in a manner consistent
with the Schedule K-1s prepared by the Companys stockholders for such taxable
periods. Without limiting the foregoing, Acquiror shall permit a Person
designated by the Company in writing prior to the Closing Date to review, on
behalf of such stockholders, the Pre-Closing Tax Returns at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the filing of such Pre-Closing Tax Returns, and shall
consider any comments of such Person with respect thereto.

 



 

(e) Other than the Contemplated Transactions, the Company shall not, and shall
cause the Companys stockholders to not, revoke the Companys election to be
taxed as an S corporation within the meaning of Section 1361 and Section 1362
of the Code and the Company will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not to,
revoke any of its Subsidiarys election to be taxed as a QSub within the
meaning of Section 1361(b)(3)(B) of the Code. Other than the Contemplated
Transactions, none of the Company or its Subsidiaries, and the Company shall
cause the Companys stockholders not to, take any action or allow any action
that would cause the Company to no longer be treated as an S corporation or
the Company Bank to no longer be treated as a QSub within the meaning of
Section 1361 and Section 1362 of the Code.

 



 

(f) Any and all Tax sharing agreements or other similar agreements (whether
written or not) with respect to or involving the Company shall be terminated
as of the Closing Date. After the Closing Date, the Company shall not be bound
thereby or have any liability thereunder.

 



 

(g) The Company shall cause the Companys stockholders to not make an election
under Section 338(h)(10) or Section 336(e) of the Code with respect to the
Contemplated Transactions.

 



 

 **Section 7.6** **_Transaction Structure_**. Acquiror may at any time change
the method of effecting the Merger or the Bank Merger if and to the extent
requested by Acquiror, and the Company agrees to enter into such amendments to
this Agreement as Acquiror may reasonably request in order to give effect to
such restructuring; _provided, however_ , that no such change or amendment:
(a) alters or

 



      
 

 



 

changes the amount or kind of the Common Stock Merger Consideration; (b)
adversely affects the Tax treatment of the Merger with respect to the
Companys stockholders; (c) is reasonably likely to cause the Closing to be
delayed or the receipt of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals to be prevented
or delayed, in each case beyond the Termination Date; or (d) requires
submission to or approval of the Companys stockholders or Acquirors
stockholders after the Agreement has been adopted by the Companys
stockholders or the Acquiror Stock Issuance has been approved by Acquirors
shareholders.

 



 

 **Section 7.7** **_Takeover Statutes_**. No party shall take any action that
would cause any Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the
Bank Merger Agreement, the Voting Agreement or any of the Contemplated
Transactions, and each party shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or
ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other
Contemplated Transactions from any applicable Takeover Statute now or
hereafter in effect. If any "moratorium," "control share," "fair price,"
"affiliate transaction," "business combination" or other anti-takeover Legal
Requirement is or may become applicable to the Merger, the parties shall use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to: (a) take such actions as
are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereunder may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement; and (b) otherwise take all such actions as are reasonably necessary
to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such Legal Requirement on the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 7.8** **_Employees and Employee Benefits_**.

 



 

(a) All individuals employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Closing (" **Covered Employees** ") shall
automatically become employees of Acquiror as of the Closing. Following the
Closing, Acquiror shall maintain employee benefit plans and compensation
opportunities for the benefit of Covered Employees that provide employee
benefits and compensation opportunities that, in the aggregate, are
substantially comparable to the employee benefits and compensation
opportunities that are made available to similarly-situated employees of
Acquiror under the Acquiror Benefit Plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that: (i)
in no event shall any Covered Employee be eligible to participate in any
closed or frozen Acquiror Benefit Plan; and (ii) until such time as Acquiror
shall cause Covered Employees to participate in the Acquiror Benefit Plans, a
Covered Employees continued participation in Company Benefit Plans shall be
deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this sentence (it being
understood that participation in the Acquiror Benefit Plans may commence at
different times with respect to each Acquiror Benefit Plan).

 



 

(b) For the purpose of satisfying eligibility requirements and vesting periods
(but not for the purpose of benefit accruals) under the Acquiror Benefit Plans
providing benefits to the Covered Employees (the " **New Plans** "), each
Covered Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors to the same
extent as such Covered Employee was entitled to credit for such service under
any applicable Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Transition Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply
to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits
with respect to the same period of service.

 



 

(c) In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of
the Transition Date, Acquiror shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide that: (i) each Covered Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is similar in type to an applicable Company
Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was participating immediately
prior to the Transition Date (such Company Benefit Plans prior to the
Transition Date collectively, the " **Old Plans** "); (ii) for purposes of
each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or similar
benefits to any Covered

 



      
 

 



 

Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan shall be waived for such Covered Employee and
his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been

**Company** "), whose names appear on the signature page of this Agreement
(such stockholders collectively referred to in this Agreement as the "
**Principal Stockholders** ," and individually as a " **Principal
Stockholder** ").

 



 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

 **A.** As of the date hereof, each Principal Stockholder is the owner and
controls voting power of the number of shares of the Companys common stock,
$1.00 par value per share (" **Company Common Stock** "), as is set forth
opposite such Principal Stockholders name on the signature page attached

 **B.** Acquiror is contemplating the acquisition of the Company by means of a
merger (the " **Merger** ") of the Company with and into Merger Sub, all
pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger to be dated as of October 16, 2017
(the " **Merger Agreement** "), among Acquiror, Merger Sub and the Company.

 



 

 **C.** Acquiror and Merger Sub are unwilling to expend the substantial time,
effort and expense necessary to implement the Merger, including applying for
and obtaining necessary approvals of regulatory authorities, unless all of the
Principal Stockholders enter into this Agreement.

 



 

 **D.** Each Principal Stockholder believes it is in his, her or its best
interest as well as the best interest of the Company for Acquiror, Merger Sub
and the Company to consummate the Merger.

 



 

 **AGREEMENTS**

 



 

In consideration of the foregoing premises, which are incorporated herein by
this reference, and the covenants and agreements of the parties herein
contained, and as an inducement to Acquiror and Merger Sub to enter into the
Merger Agreement and to incur the expenses associated with the Merger, the
parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

 



 

 **Section 1.** **_Representations and Warranties_**. Each Principal
Stockholder represents and warrants that as of the date hereof, he, she or it:
(a) owns beneficially and of record the number of shares of Company Common
Stock as is set forth opposite such Principal Stockholders name on the
signature page attached hereto; (b) has the sole, or joint with any other
Principal Stockholder, voting power, or another Principal Stockholder has sole
voting power, in each case with respect to such shares of Company Common
Stock; and (c) has all necessary power and authority to enter into this
Agreement, and further represents and warrants that this Agreement is the
legal, valid and binding agreement of such Principal Stockholder, and is
enforceable against such Principal Stockholder in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or other laws affecting creditors rights generally and subject
to general principles of equity.

 



 

 **Section 2.** **_Voting Agreement; Proxy_**.

 



 

(a) Each Principal Stockholder hereby agrees that at any meeting of the
Companys stockholders however called, and any adjournment or postponement
thereof, and in any action by written

 



      
 

 



 

consent of the Companys stockholders, such Principal Stockholder shall vote,
or cause to be voted, all shares of Company Common Stock owned or controlled
by him, her or it at the time of such meeting of the Companys stockholders
(collectively, the " **Subject Shares** "): (i) in favor of adoption of the
Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (ii) against any tender or exchange
offer to acquire more than fifteen percent (15%) of the voting power in the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, any proposal for a merger, consolidation
or other business combination involving the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, or any other proposal or offer to acquire in any manner more
than fifteen percent (15%) of the voting power in, or more than fifteen
percent (15%) of the business, assets or deposits of, the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, in each case involving any party other than Acquiror or an
affiliate of Acquiror (an " **Acquisition Proposal** "); and (iii) against any
action or agreement that could reasonably be expected to result in a material
breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation of
the Company under the Merger Agreement, or in any manner prevent or materially
impede, interfere with or delay the Merger, the adoption of the Merger
Agreement or the consummation of any of the transactions involving Acquiror
and Merger Sub contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

 



 

(b) Each Principal Stockholder hereby grants to, and appoints, Acquiror and
Merger Sub, or any of them, and any individual designated in writing by any of
them, and each of them individually, as such Principal Stockholders proxy and
attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution), for and in the name, place
and stead of such Principal Stockholder, to vote such Principal Stockholders
Subject Shares, or grant a consent or approval in respect of such Subject
Shares, solely for the matters covered by Section 2(a). Such Principal
Stockholder understands and acknowledges that Acquiror and Merger Sub are
entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon such Principal
Stockholders execution and delivery of this Agreement. Such Principal
Stockholder hereby affirms that the proxy set forth in this Section 2(b) is
given in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, and that such
proxy is given to secure the performance of the duties of such Principal
Stockholder under this Agreement. Such Principal Stockholder hereby further
affirms that this proxy is coupled with an interest and may under no
circumstances be revoked (except that such proxy is automatically revoked and
terminated upon termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 5).
Such Principal Stockholder hereby ratifies and confirms all that such proxy
may lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof. Such proxy is executed
and intended to be irrevocable in accordance with the provisions of Section
212(e) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (except that
such proxy is automatically revoked and terminated upon termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 5). Such Principal Stockholder hereby
represents that any proxies heretofore given by it in respect of the Subject
Shares with respect to the matters covered by this Section 2(b), if any, are
revocable, and hereby revokes such proxies. Upon delivery of written request
to do so by Acquiror, such Principal Stockholder shall as promptly as
practicable execute and deliver to Acquiror and Merger Sub a separate written
instrument or proxy that embodies the terms of the proxy set forth in this
Section 2(b).

 



 

 **Section 3.** **_Additional Covenants_.** Except as required by law, each
Principal Stockholder agrees that he, she or it will:

 



 

(a) not, and will not permit any of his, her or its affiliates to, prior to
the effective time of the Merger, sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose
of, or permit to be sold, assigned, transferred or otherwise disposed of, any
shares of Company Common Stock owned of record or beneficially by such
Principal Stockholder on or after the date hereof, or engage in any
discussions with any person or entity related to any of the foregoing, except:
(i) for transfers by will or by operation of law (in which case this Agreement
shall bind the transferee); (ii) for a transfer for estate and tax planning
purposes, subject in each case to the transferee agreeing in writing to be
bound by the terms of this Agreement; or (iii) as Acquiror may otherwise
agree in writing in its sole discretion;

 



      
 

 



 

(b) except as expressly permitted under, and subject to the conditions of,
**Section 5.9(b)** of the Merger Agreement with respect to an unsolicited
_bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal, not engage in any activities, discussions or
negotiations with any persons or entities other than Acquiror with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal;

 



 

(c) not vote or execute any written consent to rescind or amend in any manner
any prior vote or written consent to approve or adopt the Merger Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated thereby;

 



 

(d) use his, her or its best efforts to cause any necessary meeting of the
Companys stockholders to be duly called and held, or any necessary consent of
stockholders to be obtained, for the purpose of approving or adopting the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby;

 



 

(e) cause each of his, her or its affiliates to cooperate fully with Acquiror
in connection with the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby; and

 



 

(f) execute and deliver such additional instruments and documents and take
such further action as may be reasonably necessary to effectuate and comply
with his, her or its respective obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 4.** **_No Dissent_**. Each Principal Stockholder hereby waives,
and agrees that he, she or it will not exercise, any rights of dissent or
appraisal provided under the Merger Agreement, any applicable laws (including
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " **DGCL** ")) or
otherwise in connection with the approval of the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 5.** **_Termination_**. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, this Agreement shall automatically terminate on the earlier
of: (a) the second anniversary of the date hereof, (b) the date of termination
of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms; and (c) the date, if
any, on which the Company publicly discloses that the board of directors of
the Company (the " **Company Board** ") has withdrawn, qualified or adversely
modified its recommendation to the stockholders of the Company that the
Companys stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement,
in each case because the Company Board has determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that to, or to continue to, recommend the
Merger Agreement to the Companys stockholders would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law.

 



 

 **Section 6.** **_Amendment and Modification_**. This Agreement may be
amended, modified or supplemented at any time by the written approval of such
amendment, modification or supplement by Acquiror, Merger Sub and all of the
Principal Stockholders.

 



 

 **Section 7.** **_Entire Agreement_.** This Agreement evidences the entire
agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the matters provided for
herein and there are no agreements, representations or warranties with respect
to the matters provided for herein other than those set forth herein and in
the Merger Agreement and any written agreements related thereto. Except for
the Merger Agreement, this Agreement supersedes any agreements and
understandings, written or oral, among any of the Principal Stockholders and
Acquiror or Merger Sub concerning the acquisition, disposition or control of
any shares of Company Common Stock.

 



 

 **Section 8.** **_No Economic Benefit; Absence of Control_.** Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in Acquiror any direct or
indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to any of the
Company Common Stock. All rights, ownership and economic

 



      
 

 



 

benefits of and relating to the Company Common Stock shall remain and belong
to the applicable stockholder and Acquiror shall have no power or authority to
direct any stockholder in the voting of any of the Company Common Stock or the
performance by any stockholder of his, her or its duties or responsibilities
as a stockholder of the Company, except as otherwise provided herein. Subject
to any specific provisions of this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties
to this Agreement that neither Acquiror nor Merger Sub, by reason of this
Agreement, shall be deemed (until consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement) to control, directly or indirectly, the
Company and shall not exercise, or be deemed to exercise, directly or
indirectly, a controlling influence over the management or policies of the
Company.

 



 

 **Section 9.** **_Informed Action_.** Each Principal Stockholder
acknowledges that he, she or it has had an opportunity to be advised by
counsel of his, her or its choosing with regard to this Agreement and the
transactions and consequences contemplated hereby. Each Principal Stockholder
further acknowledges that he, she or it has received a copy of the Merger
Agreement and is familiar with its terms.

 



 

 **Section 10.** **_Severability_.** The parties agree that if any provision
of this Agreement shall under any circumstances be deemed invalid or
inoperative, this Agreement shall be construed with the invalid or inoperative
provisions deleted and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be
construed and enforced accordingly.

 



 

 **Section 11.** **_Notices_.** All notices, requests, claims, demands, and
other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have
