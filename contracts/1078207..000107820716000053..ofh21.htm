is inconsistent with GAAP as so used, this Agreement and/or Exhibit A hereto
shall control, and the Sellers' Representative has delivered the Closing
Statement to the Buyer together with the certification of the Sellers'
Representative on behalf of the Sellers and the Optionholders that the Closing
Statement meets the foregoing requirements.

deliver to Sellers' Representative a report (the "Adjustment Report") showing
in reasonable detail Buyer's computation of (A) Working Capital as of the
Determination Time, (B) Cash as of the Determination Time, (C) Foreign Cash as

which Adjustment Report shall be prepared in good faith in accordance with
GAAP on a basis consistent with that used in the preparation of the Financial
Statements, provided that if this Agreement or the methodology for calculating
Working Capital set forth in Exhibit A hereto is inconsistent with GAAP as so
used, this Agreement and/or Exhibit A hereto shall control. For the avoidance
of doubt, no changes shall be made in any reserve or other account existing as
of the Closing Date except as a result of events occurring after the Closing
Date, or as required to conform to GAAP as in effect as of the Determination
Time (provided that if this Agreement or the methodology for calculating
Working Capital set forth in Exhibit A hereto is inconsistent with GAAP as so
used, this Agreement and/or Exhibit A hereto shall control), and, in either
event, only in a manner consistent with the Company's past practices (to the
extent such past practices are consistent with GAAP as in effect as of the
Determination Time, provided that if this Agreement or the methodology for
calculating Working Capital set forth in Exhibit A hereto is inconsistent with
GAAP as so used, this Agreement and/or Exhibit A hereto shall control). The
Adjustment Report shall not be amended without the consent of Sellers'
Representative after it has been delivered to Sellers' Representative.
Following the Closing, Buyer and the Company shall not take, or permit to be
taken, any action with respect to the accounting books and records of the
Company on which the Adjustment Report is to be based that would obstruct or
hinder the preparation of the Adjustment Report or the determination of
Working Capital as of the Determination Time, Cash as of the Determination
Time, Foreign Cash as of the Determination Time, the Foreign Cash Rate, Funded
Indebtedness as of the Closing or Company Transaction Expenses as of the
Closing. 

(iii)Within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Adjustment Report (the
"Objection Period"), Sellers' Representative, by written notice to Buyer,
shall have the right to object to the computation of Working Capital, Cash,
Foreign Cash, the Foreign Cash Rate, Funded Indebtedness and/or Company
Transaction Expenses as set forth in the Adjustment Report, setting forth in
such notice (the "Objection Notice") Sellers' Representative's objection in
reasonable detail to Buyer's calculation of Working Capital, Cash, Foreign
Cash, the Foreign Cash Rate, Funded Indebtedness and/or Company Transaction
Expenses, and Sellers' Representative's proposal with respect to the
calculation of Working Capital, Cash, Foreign Cash, the Foreign Cash Rate,
Funded Indebtedness and/or Company Transaction Expenses. Only those items
specifically identified in the Objection Notice shall be deemed to be in
dispute. Within thirty (30) days following timely delivery of the Objection
Notice, Sellers' Representative and Buyer shall attempt, in good faith, to
resolve all disputes between them concerning any matter set forth in the
Objection Notice. If Buyer and Sellers' Representative cannot resolve such
disputes within such thirty (30) day period, then (i) the matters in dispute
shall be determined by KPMG LLP or, if KPMG LLP is unavailable, another
accounting firm mutually agreed to by Sellers' Representative and Buyer (the
"Arbitrator"), and (ii) the Arbitrator shall be engaged by Sellers'
Representative and Buyer within five (5) days after the later to occur of the
expiration of such thirty (30) day period and written notice from either
Sellers' Representative or Buyer to the other of its desire to engage the
Arbitrator (and Sellers' Representative and Buyer shall execute any agreement
reasonably required by the Arbitrator in connection with its engagement). In
any such case, a single partner of the Arbitrator selected by the Arbitrator
in accordance with its normal procedures and having expertise with respect to
settlement of such disputes shall act for the Arbitrator in the determination
proceeding, and, promptly, but not later than thirty (30) days after
acceptance of this appointment, the Arbitrator shall determine (based solely
on presentations by Sellers' Representative and Buyer to the Arbitrator, and
not by independent review) only those items identified on the Objection Notice
and in dispute and will render to Sellers' Representative and Buyer a written
report as to its resolution of such terms and resulting calculations of
Working Capital as of the Determination Time, Cash as of the Determination
Time, Foreign Cash as of the Determination Time, the Foreign Cash Rate, Funded
Indebtedness as of the Closing and/or Company Transaction Expenses as of the
Closing in accordance with this Agreement. In determining each disputed item,
the Arbitrator may not assign a value to such item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either Buyer or Sellers' Representative or less
than the lowest value for such item claimed by either Buyer or Sellers'
Representative. For the purposes of the Arbitrator's calculations, the amounts
to be included shall be the amounts from the Adjustment Report as to items
that are not in dispute, and the amounts determined by the Arbitrator as to
items from the Objection Notice that are submitted for resolution by the
Arbitrator. Sellers' Representative and Buyer shall cooperate with the
Arbitrator in making its determination and such determination shall be
conclusive and binding upon the Parties absent manifest error or fraud;
provided, that (1) the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator shall be limited to the
resolution of the disputed items on the Adjustment Report identified in the
Objection Notice, (2) all determinations and calculations by the Arbitrator
shall consider only those items or amounts on the Adjustment Report that
Sellers' Representative has specifically disputed in the Objection Notice, and
(3) the Arbitrator shall have no authority to resolve other issues that may
arise under this Agreement, including whether the Objection Notice has been
timely given. The fees and disbursements of the Arbitrator shall be paid by
Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers and Optionholders, on the other hand, on
an inversely proportional basis, based upon the relative difference between
the amounts in dispute that have been submitted to the Arbitrator and the
Arbitrator's calculation of Working Capital as of the Determination Time, Cash
as of the Determination Time, Foreign Cash as of the Determination Time, the
Foreign Cash Rate, Funded Indebtedness as of the Closing and/or Company
Transaction Expenses as of the Closing. Solely by way of example, if Buyer
claims in the Adjustment Report that Working Capital is $1,000,000, Sellers'
Representative claims in the Objection 

Notice that Working Capital is $1,500,000, and the Arbitrator determines that
Working Capital is $1,100,000, then Buyer shall pay 20% of the Arbitrator's
fees and disbursements and Sellers and Optionholders shall pay 80% of the
Arbitrator's fees and disbursements. Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers and
Optionholders, on the other hand, shall each pay their own fees and expenses
related to such determination.



(iv)Buyer will make the work papers (including the work papers of its
independent accountants and of the Company's independent accountants subject
to Sellers' Representative executing any access letter required by such
accountants) and back up materials used in preparing the Adjustment Report and
the books, records, facilities, properties, personnel and accountants of the
Company available to Sellers' Representative and its accountants and other
representatives at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice at any time
during (A) the review by Sellers' Representative of the Adjustment Report, and
(B) the period when any disputes concerning any matter set forth in the
Objection Notice remain unresolved.



(v)If Sellers' Representative does not deliver an Objection Notice within the
Objection Period, then Sellers and Optionholders shall be deemed to have
accepted the calculation of Working Capital as of the Determination Time, Cash
as of the Determination Time, Foreign Cash as of the Determination Time, the
Foreign Cash Rate, Funded Indebtedness as of the Closing and Company
Transaction Expenses as of the Closing, in each case as set forth in the
Adjustment Report. The term "Final Working Capital" shall mean (x) Working
Capital as of the Determination Time as set forth in the Adjustment Report if
Sellers' Representative accepts the Adjustment Report as delivered or does not
deliver an Objection Notice with respect thereto within the Objection Period,
or (y) Working Capital as of the Determination Time as determined pursuant to
Section 2(e)(iii), if Sellers' Representative delivers an Objection Notice
with respect thereto within the Objection Period. The term "Final Cash" shall
mean (x) the Cash as of the Determination Time as set forth in the Adjustment
Report if Sellers' Representative accepts the Adjustment Report as delivered
or does not deliver an Objection Notice with respect thereto within the
Objection Period, or (y) the Cash as of the Determination Time as determined
pursuant to Section 2(e)(iii), if Sellers' Representative delivers an
Objection Notice with respect thereto within the Objection Period. The term
"Final Foreign Cash" shall mean (x) the Foreign Cash as of the Determination
Time as set forth in the Adjustment Report if Sellers' Representative accepts
the Adjustment Report as delivered or does not deliver an Objection Notice
with respect thereto within the Objection Period, or (y) the Foreign Cash as

Sellers' Representative delivers an Objection Notice with respect thereto
within the Objection Period. The term the "Final Foreign Cash Rate" shall mean
(x) the Foreign Cash Rate as set forth in the Adjustment Report if Sellers'
Representative accepts the Adjustment Report as delivered or does not deliver
an Objection Notice with respect thereto within the Objection Period, or (y)
the Foreign Cash Rate as determined pursuant to Section 2(e)(iii), if Sellers'
Representative delivers an Objection Notice with respect thereto within the
Objection Period. The term "Final Funded Indebtedness" shall mean (x) Funded
Indebtedness as of the Closing as set forth in the Adjustment Report if
Sellers' Representative accepts the Adjustment Report as delivered or does not
deliver an Objection Notice with respect thereto within the Objection Period,
or (y) Funded Indebtedness as of the Closing determined pursuant to Section
2(e)(iii), if Sellers' Representative delivers an Objection Notice with
respect thereto within the Objection Period. The term "Final Company

(iii), if Sellers' Representative delivers an Objection Notice with respect
thereto within the Objection Period.

(vi)For purposes of calculating the Purchase Price, the Estimated Purchase
Price shall be adjusted in accordance with this Section 2(e)(vi), with all
such adjustments to be netted against each other as applicable. If Final
Working Capital is greater than Estimated Working Capital, then the Estimated
Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount of such difference. If Final
Working Capital is less than Estimated Working Capital, then the Estimated
Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amount of such difference. If Final
Cash is greater than Estimated Cash, then the Estimated Purchase Price shall
be increased by the amount of such difference. If Final Cash is less than
Estimated Cash, then the Estimated Purchase Price shall be decreased by the
amount of such difference. If Final Foreign Cash multiplied by the Final
Foreign Cash Rate is greater than Estimated Foreign Cash multiplied by 95%,
then the Estimated Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount equal to
such difference. If Final Foreign Cash multiplied by the Final Foreign Cash
Rate is less than Estimated Foreign Cash multiplied by 95%, then the Estimated
Purchase Price shall be decreased by an amount equal to such difference. If
Final Funded Indebtedness is greater than Estimated Funded Indebtedness, then
the Estimated Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amount of such
difference. If Final Funded Indebtedness is less than Estimated Funded
Indebtedness, then the Estimated Purchase Price shall be increased by the
amount of such difference. If Final Company Transaction Expenses is greater

difference.

(vii)If the Purchase Price (as finally determined in accordance with this
Section 2(e)) is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price, then (x) Buyer
shall pay (I) all or a portion of such difference to the Sellers'
Representative, in the amount, if any, as designated in writing by Sellers'
Representative to be added to the Sellers' Representative Reserve for the
benefit of the Sellers and Optionholders, and (II) the remainder, after
deducting such additional Sellers' Representative Reserve amount, to each
Seller with respect to its Allocable Portion and to the Company (for payment
with respect to the Options) with respect to the aggregate Allocable Portions
of the Optionholders (the methodology for allocating such payments as among
Sellers' Representative, Sellers and the Company as set forth in the foregoing
clauses (I) and (II) is hereinafter referred to as the "Allocation
Methodology"), and (y) Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
release the Working Capital Escrow Amount, together with any interest or other
amounts earned thereon, to Sellers' Representative, Sellers and the Company
(for payment with respect to the Options), in accordance with the Allocation
Methodology, in each case within five (5) Business Days after the Purchase
Price is finally so determined. Each Optionholder shall be entitled to receive
with respect to such Optionholder's Options from the Company through payroll
as set forth in Section 2(g), such Optionholder's Allocable Portion of such
payment from Buyer and of such amount released by the Escrow Agent. If the
payment referenced in clause (x) of the first sentence of this Section
2(e)(vii) is not paid by Buyer when due, or the joint written instructions
referenced in clause (y) of the first sentence of this Section 2(e)(vii) are
not delivered when required, then in either case Sellers' Representative may
proceed against Buyer for payment, in which event Buyer shall be liable for
all costs and expenses of collection, including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses.



(viii)If the Purchase Price (as finally determined in accordance with this
Section 2(e)) is less than the Estimated Purchase Price (the difference
between the two, the "Negative 

Adjustment Amount"), then, within five (5) Business Days after the Purchase
Price is finally so determined, (x) Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow
Agent to disburse to Buyer from the Working Capital Escrow Amount, including
any interest or other amounts thereon, an amount equal to the Negative
Adjustment Amount, (y) to the extent that the Negative Adjustment Amount
exceeds the Working Capital Escrow Amount, together with any interest or other
amounts earned thereon, each Seller and each Optionholder, severally and not
jointly, shall pay to Buyer such Seller's or Optionholder's Allocable Portion
of such excess, and (z) to the extent that the Working Capital Escrow Amount,
together with any interest or other amounts earned thereon, exceeds the
Negative Adjustment Amount, Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
disburse such excess to Sellers' Representative, Sellers and the Company (for
payment with respect to the Options), in accordance with the Allocation
Methodology. Each Optionholder shall be entitled to receive with respect to
such Optionholder's Options from the Company through payroll as set forth in
Section 2(g), such Optionholder's Allocable Portion of any such excess
referenced in clause (z) of this Section 2(e)(viii).

and authority until receipt of notice of the appointment of a successor
Sellers' Representative upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to Buyer.

independently of any information, materials, statements or opinions as to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement that may
have been made or given by the Company, Sellers' Representative, any other
Seller or Optionholder or by any agent, employee or other representative of
Sellers' Representative or the Company, or any other Seller or Optionholder,
and neither Sellers' Representative nor any Seller or Optionholder or any of
their respective agents, employees or other representatives shall have any
liability to any other Seller or Optionholder (or any other Person) relating
to or arising from any such information, materials, statement or opinions,
except as expressly provided in a written agreement, if any, between or among
Sellers and Optionholders.



(iv)In the event that the Sellers' Representative becomes unable to perform
its responsibilities hereunder or resigns from such position while the Escrow
Agent holds all or any portion of the Escrow Amount, the Sellers and
Optionholders holding a majority of the aggregate 

Allocable Portions shall, as promptly as practicable, select another
representative to fill such vacancy and such substituted representative shall
be deemed to be the Sellers' Representative for all purposes of this
Agreement.



(c)Cancellation of Options

Optionholder's Allocable Portion of the Closing Distribution Amount with
respect to such Optionholder's Options minus (y) the sum of the aggregate
Exercise Price for such Optionholder's Options and such Optionholder's
Allocable Portion of the Sellers' Representative Reserve (collectively, the
"Option Cancellation Payments"), (B) the right to receive such Optionholder's
Allocable Portion of any additional Purchase Price pursuant to Section
2(e)(vii), (C) the right to receive such Optionholder's Allocable Portion of
any remaining portion of the Escrow Amount pursuant to Section 2(e)(vii) or
2(e)(viii) or the Escrow Agreement, (D) the right to receive such
Optionholder's Allocable Portion of any payments pursuant to Section 6(d)(i),

receive such Optionholder's Allocable Portion of (x) the Sellers'
Representative Reserve, from the Sellers' Representative, and (y) any other
additional Purchase Price or other payments which such Optionholder is
entitled to receive under the Sellers' Representative Agreement (from amounts
paid by the Sellers' Representative to the Company).



(ii)Each Optionholder shall receive (x) at the Closing such Optionholder's
Option Cancellation Payment from the Company through the Company's payroll
system and (y) promptly after the Company has received the relevant funds, if
any, the amount to which such Optionholder is entitled pursuant to Section
2(e)(vii), Section 2(e)(vii), Section 6(d)(i), Section 6(d)(iii), Section
6(d)(vi), Section 8(c), the Escrow Agreement and the Sellers' Representative
Agreement, in respect of such Optionholder's Options through the Company's
payroll system. Each Optionholder shall also receive such Optionholder's
Allocable Portion of the Sellers' Representative Reserve from the Sellers'
Representative pursuant to the Sellers' Representative Agreement. The Company

required to be deducted and withheld with respect to such payments, in each
case under the Code, or any provision of applicable U.S. federal, state, local
or foreign Tax laws, including the Optionholder's share of FICA Taxes and any
applicable state, local or foreign payroll Taxes normally imposed on an
employee with respect to compensation. To the extent that such amounts are so
deducted and withheld, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Optionholders in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Option Cancellation Payments (A) shall be deemed made on the
Closing Date and any corresponding Tax deductions shall be allocated to the
taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on the Closing Date, (B) shall be
includible in each Optionholder's income on the Closing Date, and (C) shall
include each Optionholder's Allocable Portion of the Sellers' Representative
Reserve for purposes of determining the amount required to be deducted and

to be deducted and withheld, from such payments such amounts as are required
to be deducted and withheld with respect to such payments under the Code, or
any provision of applicable U.S. federal, state, local or foreign Tax laws,
including the employee's share of FICA taxes and any applicable state, local
or foreign payroll Taxes normally imposed on an employee with respect to
compensation. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted and withheld,
such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Sale Bonus Recipients in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made. For the avoidance of doubt, the Sale
Bonuses (A) shall be deemed made on the Closing Date and any corresponding Tax
deductions shall be allocated to the taxable period (or portion thereof)
ending on the Closing Date and (B) shall be includible in each Sale Bonus
Recipient's income on the Closing Date.

Letter, as of the date hereof, all compensation, including wages, commissions
and bonuses, payable to all Personnel of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for services performed on or prior to the date hereof have been
paid in full.

(lxxi)Each current independent contractor or consultant of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is and has been properly characterized as an independent
contractor or consultant based on the applicable standards under applicable
law, except to the extent such mischaracterization would 

not be material. There is no officer, key employee or group of employees of
the Company or its Subsidiaries who have given written notice of the intention
to terminate his, her or their employment with the Company or its Subsidiaries
and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no current officer, key employee or
group of employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries have any plans to
terminate employment with the Company or its Subsidiaries.



(lxxii)To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Personnel has any plans to
terminate his, her or its employment or independent contractor relationship,
as applicable, with the Company or its applicable Subsidiary.

(lxxiii)The Company or the applicable Subsidiary of the Company has in its
possession for all employees hired after November 6, 1986, (i) a currently
valid and fully executed Form I-9 (Employment Eligibility Verification) for
each of the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who provide services
in the United States, and (ii) any and all required documentation confirming
the identity and work authorization for each of the employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries who provide services in each other jurisdiction in which
the Company or its Subsidiaries operate.

Litigation. Section 4(q) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth each instance in
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (i) is subject to any outstanding
injunction, judgment, order, decree, ruling, or charge or (ii) is a party to
any action, suit, proceeding, hearing, or investigation of, in, or before any
court or quasi-judicial or administrative agency of any federal, state, local,
or foreign jurisdiction. Except as set forth set forth on Section 4(q) of the
Disclosure Letter, there are no actions, suits, proceedings, hearings or
investigations of, in, or before any court or quasi-judicial or administrative
agency of any federal, state, local, or foreign jurisdiction pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against or by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

(b)Employee Benefits.



(i)Section 4(r)(i) of the Disclosure Letter lists each Employee Benefit Plan.
With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, the Company has provided or made
available to Buyer true and complete copies of: (i) such Employee Benefit Plan
(or, in the event the Employee Benefit Plan is not written, a written
description thereof); and (ii) to the extent applicable to such Employee
Benefit Plan: all trust agreements, insurance or group annuity contracts or
other funding arrangements; the three (3) most recent annual reports (Form
5500) required to have been filed and all schedules and attachments thereto;
all governmental rulings, opinions, determinations (and pending requests
therefor), including with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan intended to
qualify under Code §401(a) the most recent determination or advisory letter
received from the IRS; all reports since January 1, 2012 from third-party
administrators, actuaries, investment managers or advisors, consultants or
other independent contractors (other than individual account records or
participant statements); all current employee handbooks or manuals; all
current summary plan descriptions; and all amendments and modifications to any
such document.



(ii)Each Employee Benefit Plan has been established, maintained, operated,
funded and administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms
and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including, the
ACA, ERISA, the Code and all applicable foreign laws and regulations. All
contributions (including employee salary reduction contributions) and premiums
required to have been paid by the Company or its Subsidiaries to any Employee
Benefit Plan under the terms of any such Employee Benefit Plan or its related
trust, insurance or annuity contract or other funding arrangement, or pursuant
to any applicable law have been paid within the 

time prescribed by any such Employee Benefit Plan, arrangement or applicable
law. The Company has fiduciary liability insurance in force covering the
fiduciaries of the Employee Benefit Plans. The necessary fidelity bond
coverage is in force for each Employee Benefit Plan that required to have such
coverage under ERISA Section 412. There is no material action, claim,
complaint, investigation, petition, suit, or other proceeding in law or in
equity pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to
any Employee Benefit Plan, the assets of any Employee Benefit Plans (other
than routine claims for benefits), or any fiduciary thereof and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, no facts or circumstances exist that would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any such material action, claim,
complaint, investigation, petition, suit, or other proceeding or to any
contractual indemnification or contribution obligation to any fiduciary,
insurer or service provider with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan. Within
the past six (6) years, no incident has occurred that has required or would
reasonably be expected to require the filing of a claim under the fiduciary
liability insurance or ERISA bond referenced above. Neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate uses the services of any "leased employees"
(as that term is defined in Code § 414(n)). To the Knowledge of the Company,
no Employee Benefit Plan is or has been within the past six (6) years under
audit, investigation or examination (nor has notice been received of a
potential audit, investigation or examination) by any governmental authority
(including the IRS, U.S. Department of Labor or foreign governmental
authority), and no voluntary or required corrections procedures under either
an internal or a governmental corrections program are in progress or are
contemplated with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan, and no such
corrections procedures have been undertaken in the past six (6) years.



(iii)Each Employee Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Code §401(a),
and the trust (if any) forming a part thereof, has received a favorable
determination letter (or opinion or advisory letter, if such Employee Benefit
Plan is a preapproved prototype or volume submitter plan) from the IRS as to
the qualification of the form of the plan document under Code §401(a) and to
the effect that each such trust is exempt from taxation under Code §501(a)
and, to the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred since the date of
such determination letter that will adversely affect such qualification or
tax-exempt status. Each Employee Benefit Plan that is a group health plan
materially complies with the applicable requirements of the ACA, COBRA, Code
§5000, HIPAA and any other comparable laws and regulations (including
applicable foreign laws and regulations). Neither the Company, nor any of its
Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates provides benefits through a voluntary
employee beneficiary association, as defined in Code §501(c)(9). All
amendments and actions required to bring each Employee Benefit Plan into
conformity with applicable provisions of all applicable laws and regulations,
including, without limitation, the ACA, ERISA, the Code and all applicable
foreign laws and regulations, have been made or taken, except to the extent
that such amendments or actions are not required by applicable law to be made
or taken until after the Closing Date. None of the Company, its Subsidiaries,
ERISA Affiliates or any current or former employee or independent contractor
thereof, has incurred any material liability (including as a result of any
indemnification obligation) arising out of or relating to Code §409A, and no
condition exists that would reasonably be expected to subject such person to
any material liability (including as a result of any indemnification
obligation) arising out of or relating to Code §409A.



(iv)No Employee Benefit Plan is or has been within the last six (6) years (i)
a "multiple employer plan" for purposes of §4063, §4064 or §4066 of ERISA or
§413 of the Code (ii) a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of §3(37) or
§4001(a)(3) of ERISA, (iii) subject to Code §412 or §302 or Title IV of ERISA,
or (iv) a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" as defined in §3(40) of
ERISA. To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries
or any ERISA Affiliate, nor any other "disqualified person" or "party in
interest" (as such terms are defined 

in Code §4975 and ERISA §3(14) respectively) with respect to such Employee
Benefit Plan has breached the fiduciary rules of ERISA or engaged in a
prohibited transaction that could subject any of the foregoing to any material
Tax or penalty imposed under Code §4975 or ERISA §502(i), (j), or (l). None of
the Company, its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any material
liability (including as a result of any indemnification obligation) under
Title I or Title IV of ERISA or under Code §4980H for which the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate would reasonably be expected to be liable,
and no condition exists that would reasonably be expected to subject the
Company or its Subsidiaries, either directly or by reason of affiliation with
an ERISA Affiliate, to any material Tax, fine, encumbrance, or other liability
imposed by the ACA, ERISA, the Code or other applicable law, including foreign
laws and regulations.



(v)Except as set forth on Section 4(r)(v) of the Disclosure Letter, each
Employee Benefit Plan is amendable and terminable unilaterally by and with no
further expense to the Company or the applicable Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate
(other than for benefits accrued through the date of termination or amendment
and reasonable administrative expenses related thereto) and no agreement,
summary plan description or other written communication which has been
distributed to one or more employees by its terms prohibits the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate from amended or terminating any such
plan. All agreements with third party service providers to the Employee
Benefit Plans may be terminated without material penalty by the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate, as the case may be, upon not more
than ninety (90) days' notice.



(vi)No current or former director, manager, officer, employee or independent
contractor of the Company or its Subsidiaries is or will become entitled to
death or post-employment death, medical or other welfare benefits by reason of
service to the Company or its Subsidiaries, other than coverage mandated by
Code §4890B.



(vii)Except as set forth on Section 4(r)(vii) of the Disclosure Letter, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not,
either alone or in combination with any other event, (i) entitle any current
or former director, manager, officer, consultant employee, independent
contractor, leased employee or contingent worker of the Company or its
Subsidiaries to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment
or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of
compensation due any such individual or require any contributions or payments
to fund any obligations under any Employee Benefit Plan.

(viii)The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not, either alone or in combination with any other event, give rise to any
payment (or acceleration of vesting of any amounts or benefits) that will be
an "excess parachute payment" as defined in Code §280G.



(c)Environmental, Health, and Safety Matters.



(i)Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has been for the past five (5)
years, and is, in compliance with Environmental, Health, and Safety
Requirements, except for such noncompliance as would not have a Material
Adverse Effect.



(ii)Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written
notice, report or other information regarding any actual or alleged material
violation of Environmental, Health, and Safety Requirements, or any material
liabilities or potential material liabilities (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent, unliquidated or otherwise), including any investigatory, remedial
or 

corrective obligations, relating to the Company or its facilities arising
under Environmental, Health, and Safety Requirements.



(iii)Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has obtained and is in material
compliance with all permits necessary for and material to the ownership,
lease, operation or use of the business or assets of the Company or such
Subsidiary in the conduct of its business as currently conducted, and all such
permits are in full force and effect and shall remain in full force and effect
immediately following the Closing.



(iv)No real property currently (or, to the Knowledge of the Company, formerly)
owned, operated or leased by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is listed
on, or has been proposed for listing on, the National Priorities List (or
CERCLIS) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act of 1980, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and
Reauthorization Act of 1986, 42 U.S.C. §§ 9601 et seq., or any similar state
list.



(v)This Section 4(s) contains the sole and exclusive representations and
warranties of the Company with respect to any environmental, health, or safety
matters, including any arising under any Environmental, Health, and Safety
Requirements.



Inventory. All inventory reflected on the Most Recent Balance Sheet consists
of a quality usable in the Ordinary Course of Business (subject to defects
that are not material in nature or cost and to any inventory write-down or
reserve reflected on such Most Recent Balance Sheet). All such inventory is
owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries free and clear of all Liens (other
than Permitted Encumbrances), and no inventory is held on a consignment basis.
The quantities of each item of inventory (whether raw materials, work-in-
progress or finished goods) are reasonable in the present circumstances of the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

Accounts Receivable. All of the outstanding accounts receivable shown on the
balance sheet included in the Most Recent Financial Statements represent, as
of the respective dates thereof, valid obligations arising from sales actually
made or services actually performed, in each case in the Ordinary Course of
Business, and the accounts receivable created since the Most Recent Balance
Sheet Date represent valid obligations arising from sales actually made or
services actually performed, in each case in the Ordinary Course of Business,
and in each case are not subject to claims of set-off or other defenses or
counterclaims other than normal cash discounts accrued, or such other claims
or counterclaims that may arise, in the Ordinary Course of Business. The
reserve for bad debts shown on the Most Recent Balance Sheet or, with respect
to accounts receivable arising after the Most Recent Balance Sheet Date, on
the accounting records of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been
determined in accordance with GAAP, subject to normal year-end adjustments and
the absence of disclosures normally made in footnotes.

(d)Customers and Suppliers.



(i)Section 4(v)(i) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and accurate
list of the names of (A) the ten (10) largest customers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, based on revenue and (B) the three (3) largest
suppliers of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, based on
purchases by the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case during the twelve
month period ended November 30, 2015.



(ii)Other than as set forth in Section 4(v)(ii) of the Disclosure Letter,
since the Most Recent Balance Sheet Date, no customer or supplier set forth on
Section 4(v)(i) of the Disclosure Letter has terminated, cancelled or has
delivered any written notice relating to any plan to terminate, 

cancel or otherwise materially and adversely modify its relationship with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.



Certain Business Relationships with the Company. No Seller, nor any Affiliate
of any Seller, (i) has been involved in any material business arrangement or
relationship with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries within the past

Consulting Agreement), or (ii) owns any material asset, tangible or
intangible, used in the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

current bank accounts and to the Company's Knowledge, safe deposit boxes of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and the names of persons having signature

past three (3) years, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received written notice of any unresolved claim of personal injury, death, or
property or economic damages, or for injunctive relief, in each case as a
result of any defect or other deficiency (whether of design, materials,
workmanship, labeling, instructions or otherwise) with respect to any product
designed, manufactured, sold, leased, licensed or delivered, or any service
provided, by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than claims made
under or pursuant to contractual product or service warranties. No
Governmental Entity has alleged in writing within the past three (3) years
that any product designed, manufactured, sold, leased, licensed or delivered
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is defective or unsafe or fails to
meet any product warranty or standards promulgated by any such Governmental
Entity. No product designed, manufactured, sold, leased, licensed or delivered
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been recalled, and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice of recall
of any such product from any Governmental Entity.



(ii)Section 4(y)(ii) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth the form warranty
terms applicable to the products manufactured, sole, leased, licensed or
delivered by the Company and its Subsidiaries (it being understood and
acknowledged that the Company and its Subsidiaries have deviated from such
form warranty terms with respect to certain products, services and customers).

complete description of all Governmental Contracts to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party. Except as set forth in Section 4(z)(i) of the

specific authorizations; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of their financial statements in a manner that is true, complete
and accurate in all material respects and to maintain accountability for
assets; (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with
management's general or specific authorizations; and (iv) the recorded
accountability of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries is compared

WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE BY THE RESPECTIVE SELLERS EXPRESSLY SET
FORTH IN SECTION 3(a) AND THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE BY THE

RESPECT TO ANY OTHER INFORMATION OR DOCUMENTS MADE AVAILABLE AT ANY TIME TO

[Reserved].

Covenants. The Parties agree as follows with respect to the period following
the Closing:

General. In case at any time after the Closing any further action is necessary
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each Party will take such further
action (including the execution and delivery of such further instruments and
documents) as any other Party reasonably may request, all at the sole cost and
expense of the requesting Party (unless the requesting Party is entitled to
indemnification therefor under Section 8).

Litigation Support; Preservation of Books and Records.

(i)In the event and for so long as any Party actively is contesting or
defending against any action, suit, proceeding, hearing, investigation,
charge, complaint, claim, or demand in connection with (i) any transaction
contemplated under this Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance,
status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident,
action, failure to act, or transaction on or prior to the Closing Date
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, each of the other Parties
shall reasonably cooperate with such Party and such Party's counsel in the
defense or contest, make available their personnel, and provide such testimony
and reasonable access to their books and records as shall be necessary in
connection with the defense or contest, all at the sole cost and expense of
the contesting or defending Party (unless the contesting or defending Party is
entitled to indemnification therefor under Section 8).



(ii)For a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date or such longer time
as may be required by applicable law, Buyer shall not and shall cause its
Affiliates not to dispose of or destroy any of the books and records of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to periods prior to the Closing
without first offering to turn over possession thereof to the Sellers'
Representative by written notice to the Sellers' Representative at least sixty
(60) days prior to the proposed date of such disposition or destruction. Buyer
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, allow the Sellers' Representative
and its agents access to all such books and records on reasonable notice and
at reasonable times at Buyer's principal place of business or at any location
where any such books and records are stored, and the Sellers' Representative
shall have the right, at its own expense, to make copies of any such books and
records; provided, that the Sellers' Representative shall take such action as
is deemed necessary in the reasonable judgment of Buyer to schedule such
access and visits through a designated officer of the party providing access
and in such a way as to avoid disrupting in any material respect the normal
business of the party providing access.



Employee Benefits. Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company or its Subsidiaries
to, provide the individuals who are employees of the Company (including, but
not limited to, employees who are not actively at work on account of illness,
disability or leave of absence consistent with policies, practices and
procedures of the employing company, but excluding any employees who were
hired by the Company prior to the Closing on a temporary basis) on the Closing
Date (the "Continuing Employees"), while employed by Buyer, the Company or its
Subsidiaries, or any Affiliates thereof, with (i) for a period of not less
than one (1) year following the Closing Date, wages or salaries and bonus
opportunities, as applicable, that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable to
such person than the wages or salaries and bonus opportunities, as applicable,
of such Continuing Employee in effect immediately prior to the Closing, and
(ii) until the earlier of (x) the first regularly scheduled renewal period, if
any, for the Company's welfare and retirement plans following the Closing, and
(y) the first anniversary of the Closing Date, welfare and retirement benefits
that, in the aggregate, 

are no less favorable to such person than the welfare and retirement benefits
of such person in effect immediately prior to the Closing as reflected on
Section 4(r)(i) of the Disclosure Letter under the heading "Welfare and
Retirement Plans"; provided, however, that, subject to compliance with the
foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the amendment or termination of any
Employee Benefit Plan. Service accrued by the Continuing Employees during
employment with the Company or its Subsidiaries or prior to the Closing shall
be recognized for all eligibility, vesting and all other benefit plan purposes
(including, without limitation, vacation policy purposes) (except benefit
accrual), except to the extent necessary to prevent duplication of benefits.
Any and all pre-existing condition limitations and eligibility waiting periods
under any employee benefit plan of Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer (such plans
of Buyer or one or more of its Affiliates, collectively, "Buyer Plans") in
which Continuing Employees may participate following the Closing shall, to the
greatest extent allowed under applicable law or by (or with the consent of)
any insurer of such Buyer Plan, be waived with respect to the Continuing
Employees and their eligible dependents to the extent such limitations did not
apply or were satisfied under the applicable Employee Benefit Plan. The
Continuing Employees shall, to the greatest extent allowed under applicable
law or by (or with the consent of) any insurer of such Buyer Plan, be given
credit for amounts paid under any plan during the same period for purposes of
applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such
amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of an
analogous Buyer Plan.

(h)Tax Matters



(i)Tax Return Filing. Buyer shall prepare and timely file all Tax Returns of
each of the Company and its Subsidiaries attributable to any taxable period
beginning on or before and ending after the Closing Date (the "Straddle
Period"). Buyer shall pay and discharge all Taxes shown to be due on such
Straddle Period Tax Returns. No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the
due date of each such Straddle Period Tax Return, Buyer and Sellers'
Representative shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
directing the Escrow Agent to disburse to Buyer out of the portion of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount, if any, then held in escrow and not previously
distributed pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the amount of Taxes
shown due with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries which are
attributable to the pre-Closing portion of the Straddle Period, (or, if such
portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount is not available or is otherwise
insufficient to cover such amount, each Seller and Optionholder shall pay to
Buyer such Seller's or Optionholder's respective Allocable Portion of such
amount) except to the extent: (A) the same are being contested; (B) all or a
portion of the amount of the Taxes (together with interest and penalties
relating thereto, if any) is reflected in Estimated Working Capital or in
Final Working Capital; or (C) estimated Tax payments have been made with
respect to such Taxes prior to the Closing Date. Sellers' Representative shall
have at least fourteen (14) days to review all such Straddle Period Tax
Returns, and Buyer shall not file such Tax Returns without the prior written
consent of Sellers' Representative, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld. Buyer shall prepare and timely file all Tax Returns of each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods ending on or before the
Closing Date (hereinafter, "Pre-Closing Periods") for which Tax Returns are
not yet due (taking into account any extensions) and have not been filed, as
of the Closing Date. Sellers' Representative shall have at least fourteen (14)
days to review all such Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns, and Buyer shall not
file such Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns without the prior written consent of
Sellers' Representative, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Buyer
shall pay and discharge all Taxes shown to be due on such Pre-Closing Period
Tax Returns before the same shall become delinquent and before penalties
accrue thereon. No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the due date of
each such Tax Return, Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall deliver a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to disburse
to Buyer out of the Indemnity Escrow Amount, if any, then held in escrow and
not previously distributed pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the
amount of Taxes 

shown due attributable to the Company and its Subsidiaries on such Pre-Closing
Period Tax Returns (or, if such portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount is not
available or is otherwise insufficient to cover such amount, each Seller and
Optionholder shall pay to Buyer such Seller's or Optionholder's respective
Allocable Portion of such amount), except to the extent: (A) the same are
being contested; (B) all or a portion of the amount of the Taxes (together
with interest and penalties relating thereto, if any) is reflected in
Estimated Working Capital or in Final Working Capital; or (C) estimated Tax
payments have been made with respect to such Taxes prior to the Closing Date.
The Tax Returns referred to in this Section 6(d)(i) shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with past practice to the extent consistent with applicable
law and regulation. An exact copy of any Tax Return filed by Buyer under this
Section 6(d)(i) shall be provided to Sellers' Representative not later than
ten (10) days after such Tax Return is filed. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, none of Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company shall file any Tax Return or amended Tax Return, make an election
or take any action relating to the Taxes of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or otherwise change such Tax Returns or elections) with respect
to taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing
Date without the prior written consent of Sellers' Representative, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld. If Buyer, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is required by law to file an amended Tax Return for the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to taxable periods (or portions
thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date, Buyer and Sellers'
Representative shall cooperate in the filing of such amended Tax Return, but
Sellers' Representative shall have the right to review and consent to such
amended returns (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld). Anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, all payments to
be made by Sellers and Optionholders (whether from the Indemnity Escrow or
otherwise) under this Section 6(d)(i) ("Section 6(d) Seller Payments") shall
be deemed adjustments to the Purchase Price. To the extent that the Tax
Returns described in this Section 6(d)(i) indicate that the Company has made
an overpayment of Taxes for any Pre-Closing Period or pre-Closing portion of a
Straddle Period (taking into account all estimated Tax payments that have been
made with respect to such Taxes prior to the Closing Date) the Buyer shall pay
or cause to be paid to Sellers' Representative, Sellers, and the Company, for
the benefit of the Optionholders for further payment by the Company to each
Optionholder through payroll, in each case, in accordance with the Allocation
Methodology, such overpayment when credited on the Tax Returns of the Buyer,
the Company, or its Subsidiaries or refunded by the applicable tax authority,
provided that if any such Tax Return is filed after the applicable filing
deadline (including extensions), the amount that shall be so required to pay
over to Sellers' Representative, Sellers, and the Company shall include
interest at the rate of 9% per annum accruing from such filing deadline to the
actual filing date.



(ii)Allocation for Straddle Period. For purposes of this Agreement, the amount
of Taxes of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the Straddle Period
shall be determined based upon a hypothetical closing of the taxable year on
such Closing Date, with the Closing Date being included in the pre-Closing
portion of such Straddle Period (except to the extent of any actions outside
the Ordinary Course of Business taken by Buyer after the Closing on the
Closing Date); provided, however, that real and personal property Taxes (and
other similar Taxes which are not based on income, revenues or sales) shall be
determined by reference to the relative number of days in the pre-Closing and
post-Closing portions of such Straddle Period. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Parties further understand and agree that all Tax deductions attributable to
the payment of the Company Specified Expenses shall be treated as properly
allocable to the pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period of the Company and
its Subsidiaries that includes the Closing Date for U.S. Federal income Tax
purposes and state income Tax purposes.



(iii)Refunds. Buyer and/or the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to
Sellers' Representative, Sellers, and the Company, for the benefit of the
Optionholders for further payment by the Company to each Optionholder through
payroll, in each case, in accordance with the Allocation Methodology, any
refunds of the Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries plus any interest
received with respect thereto from the applicable taxing authorities for any
Pre-Closing Period or pre-Closing portion of a Straddle Period (including
refunds arising from amended returns filed after the Closing Date) within ten
(10) days after Buyer or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries receives such
refund, less Buyer's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable
fees and expenses of professional advisors) incurred in obtaining such refund
or offset. Buyer agrees that it will not carry back losses from post-Closing
periods to Pre-Closing Periods. Any refunds or credits of Taxes of the Company
or its Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period shall be apportioned between
Sellers, Optionholders and Buyer in the same manner as the liability for such
Taxes is apportioned pursuant to Section 6(d)(ii).



(iv)Transfer Taxes. Buyer shall be responsible for the preparation and filing
of Tax Returns (including any documentation) with respect to all transfer,
documentation, sales, use, stamp, registration, and similar Taxes incurred in
connection with this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby. Buyer,
on the one hand, and Sellers and the Optionholders, on the other hand, shall
each pay half of any such taxes and each shall indemnify and hold the other
harmless, for the amount of such Taxes.



(v)Cooperation. Sellers' Representative, on behalf of Sellers and
Optionholders, and Buyer agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each
other, and upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and
assistance (including access to books and records) as is reasonably necessary
for preparation of any Tax Return, claim for refund or audit, and the
prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to the Tax
liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The requesting party
shall bear all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the other party
hereto in providing such assistance. In providing or receiving the information
and assistance contemplated by this Section 6(d)(v), each Party shall maintain
such information confidential except as required by law or regulation, or as
reasonably requested by a Party.



(vi)Stub Taxable Year. The Parties intend that the Company and its
Subsidiaries will join Buyer's consolidated tax group upon the acquisition,
and, as a result, the current Tax year of the Company and its Subsidiaries
will end for federal income Tax purposes on the Closing Date. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Parties understand and agree that all tax deductions,
credits or similar benefits attributable to the Company Specified Expenses
shall be treated as properly allocable to the taxable periods, or portions
thereof, ending on or before the Closing Date for U.S. federal, state, and
local Tax purposes. In the event that the calculation of the Tax of the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries for the taxable period (or portion thereof)
ending on the Closing Date results in a net loss (taking into account any
deductions for Company Specified Expenses, including compensation
arrangements), then the Company and/or its Subsidiaries shall, if possible,
carry back the net loss to prior years in order to generate a Tax refund for
Sellers' and Optionholders' benefit. Buyer agrees to prepare and file amended
Tax Returns for the Company and/or its Subsidiaries and obtain such Tax refund
or credit as promptly as practicable. To the extent such net loss (or a
portion thereof) or a net loss for the pre-Closing portion of the Straddle
Period generates a state or local Tax refund or offset against current state
or local Tax in the post-Closing portion of the Straddle Period of the Company
and/or its Subsidiaries, then the Company and/or its Subsidiaries shall make a
payment in an amount equal to such Tax refund or offset, less Buyer's
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of
professional advisors) incurred in obtaining such refund or offset to Sellers' 

Representative, Sellers, and the Company, for the benefit of the Optionholders
for further payment by the Company to each Optionholder through payroll, in
each case, in accordance with the Allocation Methodology. The amount of such
Tax refunds or offset credits shall be (a) in the case of Tax refunds, paid to
the Sellers' Representative, the Sellers, and the Company, for the benefit of
the Optionholders, within fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof, and (b) in
the case of an offset, paid to the Sellers' Representative, the Sellers, and
the Company, for the benefit of the Optionholders, when the relevant Tax
Return for the taxable year in which such offset is reflected is filed,
provided that if any such Tax Return is filed after the applicable filing
deadline (including extensions), the amount that shall be so required to pay
over to Sellers' Representative, Sellers, and the Company shall include
interest at the rate of 9% per annum accruing from such filing deadline to the
actual filing date.



(vii)Nonforeign Affidavit. Each Seller shall furnish to Buyer an affidavit,
stating, under penalty of perjury, the Seller's United States taxpayer
identification number and that the Seller is not a foreign person, in
accordance with section 1445(b)(2) of the Code and the regulations issued
thereunder.



(viii)Disputes. In the event that a dispute arises between Sellers'
Representative and Buyer as to the amount of Taxes or indemnification or any
matter relating to Taxes attributable to the Company and its Subsidiaries, the
Parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute, and any agreed
upon amount shall be paid to the appropriate Party. If such dispute is not
resolved thirty (30) calendar days thereafter, the Parties shall submit the
dispute to KPMG LLP or, if KPMG LLP is unavailable, another accounting firm
mutually chosen by Buyer and Sellers' Representative for resolution, which
resolution shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties.
Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, the fees and
expenses of the independent accounting firm in resolving this dispute shall be
borne equally by Sellers and Optionholders, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the
other hand.



(i)Exculpation; Indemnification.



(i)After the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries
to, and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, exculpate (to
the greatest extent permitted by applicable law) and indemnify, defend and
hold harmless each of the present and former directors, managers, officers and
controlling Persons of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each of them
acting in such capacity at or prior to the Closing) against all Adverse
Consequences against such Person for actions or omissions in his or her
capacity as an officer, director, manager or controlling Person of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries arising out of any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law.

(ii)For a period of at least six (6) years commencing from the Closing Date,
Buyer shall pay for officers' and directors' liability insurance covering the
Persons who are, as of and prior to the Closing Date, covered by the officers'
and directors' liability insurance policies of the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to actions and omissions occurring prior to and on
the Closing Date, with benefits, levels of coverage and other terms which are
no less favorable to such Persons than the terms of such current insurance in
effect for the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. In the event
that any Person is or would have been entitled to coverage under an officers'
and directors' liability insurance policy pursuant to this Section 6(e)(ii)
and such policy has lapsed, not been purchased, terminated or is otherwise in
breach or default or affords lesser coverage than is required by this Section
6(e)(ii) as a result of any failure by the Company to maintain and fulfill its
obligations 

pursuant to this Section 6(e)(ii) or for any other reason, Buyer shall pay, or
shall cause the Company to pay, such Persons such amounts and provide any
other coverage or benefits as such Persons would have received pursuant to
such policy.



(iii)If (but only if) for any reason the indemnity provided for in this
Section 6(e) is unavailable to any such Person entitled to indemnification or
is insufficient to hold each such Person harmless from all such Adverse
Consequences, then Buyer shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by
such Person in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the
relative benefits received by the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and such Person, on the other hand, but also the relative fault of such
Persons, as well as any relevant equitable considerations.

(iv)The provisions of this Section 6(e) are intended to be for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by, each such Person entitled to indemnification under
this Section 6(e), his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and the
obligations of Buyer and the Company under this Section 6(e) shall not be
terminated or modified in such manner as to adversely affect any such Person
to whom this Section 6(e) applies without the consent of such affected Person.
The rights of each such Person entitled to indemnification under this Section
6(e), and his or her heirs and his or her representatives, shall be in
addition to any rights such Persons may have under the Governing Documents of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable contracts or
agreements, or under any applicable law.



(v)In the event Buyer, the Company or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or the Company, as the case may
be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6(e).



Confidentiality. Buyer acknowledges that any and all information provided to
it by, or on behalf of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any Seller,
any Optionholder or any representative or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any Seller or Optionholder solely to the extent that it or any
portion of it relates to any Seller or Optionholder and not to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of
the non-disclosure agreement, dated as of June 5, 2015, between Buyer and the
Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), and shall be enforceable by such
Seller or Optionholder (or the Sellers' Representative on behalf of such
Seller or Optionholder) as if such Seller or Optionholder were a party
thereto.

(j)Parachute Payments. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall submit to the
Company's shareholders who are entitled to vote (as determined under Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) any and
all payments or other benefits contingent on the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
(within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder) for a vote in a manner such that, if such
vote is adopted by such shareholders in a manner that satisfies the
shareholder approval requirements under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and
regulations promulgated thereunder, no payment received by any "disqualified
individual" would be a "parachute payment" under Section 280G(b) of the Code
(determined without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code). Such vote shall
establish such "disqualified individual's" right to the payment or other
compensation. In addition, the Company shall provide adequate disclosure (in a
manner that satisfies Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and regulations
promulgated thereunder) 

to such shareholders of all material facts concerning all payments that, but
for such vote, could be deemed "parachute payments" to any such "disqualified
individual" under Section 280G of the Code. The Company agrees to provide
written drafts of the shareholder disclosure statement and shareholder
approval forms that will be provided to such shareholders to Buyer for Buyer's
approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably delayed, withheld or
conditioned) in advance of delivering such documents to such shareholders, and
allow Buyer and its representatives a reasonable opportunity to provide
comments on such documents. For the avoidance of doubt, the Closing is not
contingent on the submission or adoption of such vote.



(k)Incentive Awards for Specified Employees. As promptly as practicable
following the Closing, Buyer shall make long-term incentive compensation
awards, with an aggregate value of up to Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars
($800,000), to the employees set forth on Section 6(h) of the Disclosure
Letter and in the amounts set forth opposite each such employee's name
thereon. Such awards shall be subject to the Nautilus Inc. 2015 Long-Term
Incentive Plan and an applicable award agreement entered into with each such
employee. The performance period and long term performance goals applicable
to such awards shall be substantially consistent with the performance period
and performance goals set forth in the Performance Stock Unit awards granted
pursuant to the Employment Agreements.



4.Deliveries at Closing.



Deliveries of the Sellers' Representative, the Company, the Sellers, and the
Optionholders. At the Closing, the Sellers' Representative, the Company, each
Seller, and/or each Optionholder, as applicable, shall deliver to the Buyer

each case in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer;

Deliveries of Buyer. At the Closing, the Buyer shall deliver to the Sellers'
Representative a counterpart to the Escrow Agreement duly executed by Buyer.

5.Remedies for Breaches of this Agreement.



Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and warranties
made by the Parties in this Agreement shall survive the Closing until (and
shall terminate on) the sixteen (16) month anniversary thereof; provided,
however, that the representations and warranties contained in (i) Section
3(a)(i) (Organization of Certain Sellers), Section 3(a)(ii) (Authorization of
Transaction), Section 3(a)(iv) (Brokers' Fees), Section 3(a)(v) (Shares),
Section 4(a) (Organization, Qualification and Corporate Power), Section 4(b)
(Capitalization), and Section 4(e) (Brokers' Fees) (collectively with the
representations set forth in Section 4(k) (Tax Matters), the "Special Sellers'
Representations"), and (ii) Section 3(b)(i) (Organization of Buyer), Section
3(b)(ii) (Authorization of Transaction), and Section 3(b)(iv) (Brokers' Fees),
each shall survive the Closing indefinitely; and provided, further, that the
representations and warranties contained in Section 4(k) (Tax Matters) and
Section 4(r)(viii) (Employee Benefits) shall survive the Closing until (and
shall terminate on) the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.
None of the covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement shall
survive following the Closing other than those which by their terms
contemplate performance after the Closing, and each such surviving covenant
and agreement shall survive the Closing for the period contemplated by its
terms. Any claims under this Agreement with respect to a breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement must be asserted by a written
notice on or before the expiration of the applicable survival period for such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in accordance with this
Section 8, and if such a notice is given, the survival period for such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall continue solely as to
the specific matters subject to the claim asserted until it is fully resolved
as provided herein. It is the intention of the Parties that the survival
periods set forth in this Section 8 shall supersede the application of any
longer statute of limitations to such representations and warranties or claim
with respect thereto.

(a)Indemnification Provisions for Buyer's Benefit.



(i)Subject to the provisions of this Section 8, including the limitations set
forth in this Section 8(b)(i), and provided that Buyer makes a written claim
for indemnification pursuant to Section 8(d) within the applicable survival
period, from and after the Closing each Seller and each Optionholder,
severally and not jointly, will indemnify Buyer from and against such Seller's
or Optionholder's Allocable Portion of any Adverse Consequences Buyer shall
suffer resulting from (A) the breach of any representation or warranty made by
the Company in Section 4 of this Agreement; (B) any breach by the Company of
its agreement to pay the Option Cancellation Payments to the 

Optionholders at Closing in accordance with Section 2(g)(ii)(x) and the Sale
Bonuses to the Sale Bonus Recipients at Closing in accordance with Section
2(h); (C) any breach by the Sellers' Representative, in its capacity as
Sellers' Representative, under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement,
including any breach under Section 2(d); (D) any claims by any Seller to the
extent relating to or arising out of any error in any payment made to the
Sellers by the Sellers' Representative, any Liabilities to the extent in
connection with, as a result of, or arising out of any payment made by Buyer,
the Company or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement or as directed in writing by the Sellers'
Representative, or any claims by any Seller to the extent relating to or
arising out of any misallocation of the Purchase Price among the Sellers by
the Sellers' Representative; and (E) the matters set forth on Schedule
8(b)(i)(E); provided, however, that no Seller or Optionholder shall have any
obligation to indemnify Buyer from and against any Adverse Consequences
pursuant to Section 8(b)(i)(A): (1) until Buyer has suffered Adverse
Consequences by reason of all such breaches in excess of a $550,000 aggregate
deductible (after which point Sellers and Optionholders will be obligated to
indemnify Buyer from and against such Adverse Consequences in excess of
$250,000) or thereafter (2) to the extent Buyer has received indemnity
payments hereunder in the amount of $5,750,000 in the aggregate (after which
point Sellers and Optionholders will have no obligation to indemnify Buyer
from and against further such Adverse Consequences); provided, however, that
Sellers and Optionholders shall not be liable to Buyer for any claim if the
Adverse Consequences relating to such claim are less than $25,000 (each a
"Minor Claim"); and provided, further, that Minor Claims shall not be included
in the computation of the aggregate deductible under clause (1) (and shall not
be included in the computation of the amount described in the parenthetical
within clause (1)). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
claims for indemnification made pursuant to this Section 8(b)(i) with respect
to Adverse Consequences resulting from (x) any breaches of Section 4(a)
(Organization, Qualification and Corporate Power), Section 4(b)
(Capitalization), Section 4(e) (Brokers' Fees) or Section 4(k) (Tax Matters),
or (y) the fraud of any Seller, Optionholder or the Company, shall not be
subject to the foregoing limitations set forth in clauses (1), (2), and the
proviso relating to Minor Claims, in each case within this Section 8(b)(i);
provided, however, that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
except in the case of fraud or intentional misrepresentation, no Seller's or
Optionholder's aggregate liability for Adverse Consequences under any
provision of this Agreement shall exceed such Seller's or Optionholder's
Allocable Portion of the Purchase Price.



(ii)Subject to the provisions of this Section 8, including the limitations set
forth in this Section 8(b)(ii), and provided that Buyer makes a written claim
for indemnification pursuant to Section 8(d) within the applicable survival
period, from and after the Closing each Seller and each Optionholder,
individually, and not severally or jointly, will indemnify Buyer from and
against and will pay to Buyer the amount of Adverse Consequences Buyer shall
suffer resulting from: (A) any breach of any representation or warranty made
by such Seller in Section 3(a) or by such Optionholder in its Option
Cancellation Agreement, or (B) any failure by such Seller or Optionholder to
perform or comply with such Seller's or Optionholder's covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement or in such Optionholder\'s Option Cancellation
Agreement; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, except in the case of fraud or intentional misrepresentation, no
Seller's or Optionholder's aggregate liability for Adverse Consequences under
any provision of this Agreement shall exceed such Seller's or Optionholder's
Allocable Portion of the Purchase Price.



Indemnification Provisions for Sellers' and Optionholders' Benefit. Subject to
the provisions of this Section 8 and provided that any Seller or Optionholder
(or Sellers' Representative, on behalf of any Seller or Optionholder) makes a
written claim for indemnification against Buyer pursuant to Section 8(d)
within the applicable survival period, from and after the Closing Buyer will
indemnify each Seller and each 

Optionholder from and against and will pay to each Seller and each
Optionholder the amount of Adverse Consequences such Person shall suffer
resulting from (A) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer
in Section 3(b), or (B) any failure by Buyer to perform or comply with Buyer's
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement.

(b)Matters Involving Third Parties; Direct Claims



(i)If any third party shall notify any Party (the "Indemnified Party") with
respect to any matter (a "Third Party Claim") which may give rise to a claim
for indemnification against any other Party (the "Indemnifying Party") under
this Section 8, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in any event
within ten (10) Business Days after receiving notice of the Third Party Claim)
notify each Indemnifying Party thereof in writing; provided, that the failure
or delay to so notify an Indemnify Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party is prejudiced by such failure or delay. Thereafter, the Indemnified
Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, within five (5) Business Days
after the Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating
to the Third Party Claim.



(ii)Any Indemnifying Party will have the right at any time to assume and
thereafter conduct and control the defense of the Third Party Claim with
counsel of such Indemnifying Party's choice reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party will not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party (not to be withheld unreasonably) unless the judgment or proposed
settlement involves only the payment of money damages and does not impose an
injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party. Once the
Indemnifying Party has duly assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate
in any such defense and to employ separate counsel of its choosing at its sole
cost and expense. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third
Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the
Indemnified Party's expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and
information in the Indemnified Party's possession or under the Indemnified
Party's control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying
Party. Notwithstanding the Indemnifying Party's assumption of the defense of
any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall continue to be entitled to
assert any limitations on claims set forth in this Section 8.



(iii)Unless and until an Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Third
Party Claim as provided in Section 8(d)(ii), the Indemnified Party may defend
against the Third Party Claim in any manner he, she, or it reasonably may deem
appropriate (subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 8) with the
assistance of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party;
provided, however, that in no event will the Indemnified Party consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of each of the Indemnifying
Parties (not to be withheld unreasonably). Each of the Indemnified Party and
Indemnifying Party will, at their own expense, cooperate and assist each other
and their respective counsel in the review, investigation and defense of any
such Third Party Claim, shall make available its personnel, and shall provide
such testimony and access to its books and records as may be reasonable in
connection therewith.



(iv)If, after the Closing, an Indemnified Party incurs Adverse Consequences
for which it is entitled to indemnification under this Section 8, other than
as a result of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall provide
written notice of such direct Adverse Consequences to the Indemnifying Party
within the applicable time limits set forth in Section 8(a), which notice must
certify in good faith that the Indemnified Party has already sustained some
(though not necessarily all) Adverse Consequences with respect to such claim.
The notice shall describe the claim or matter in reasonable detail, including
the amount of such Adverse Consequences (estimated if appropriate) that have
been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party, and the method of
computation thereof, and contain a reference to the provisions of this
Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or
arises. If the Indemnifying Party does not agree to the amount of Adverse
Consequences claimed by the Indemnified Party and the parties are not able to
resolve such matter, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to submit
such indemnification claim to any court or authority of competent jurisdiction
described in Section 10(h) for determination of the amount of Adverse
Consequences, subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 8.



(v)Sellers' Representative shall act on behalf of Sellers and the
Optionholders for all purposes of this Section 8 for any claim (including any
Third Party Claim) which is the subject of the indemnification provisions of
this Section 8 (unless such claim (A) is brought under Section 8(b)(ii), or
(B) arises out of or results from the alleged or actual fraud or intentional
misrepresentation of any Seller or Optionholder, in each case within the
foregoing clauses (A) and (B) as to which Buyer is seeking indemnification or
other remedy from one or more individual Sellers or Optionholders but not all
of the Sellers and Optionholders). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Section 8, if a Seller or an Optionholder that is an
Indemnified Party is required to give notice under Section 8(d)(iv), such
Seller or Optionholder shall provide such notice to the Sellers'
Representative within the applicable time limits set forth in Section 8(a),
which notice shall describe such Adverse Consequences in sufficient detail to
permit Sellers' Representative to provide the information required by Section
8(d)(iv) to the Indemnifying Party, and Sellers' Representative shall have the
sole discretion and authority to determine whether or not to seek
indemnification with respect to such Adverse Consequences.



Determination of Adverse Consequences. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement, (i) no Party shall be liable for, and the definition of Adverse
Consequences shall not include, (x) any punitive, consequential, incidental,
special or indirect damages, including any such damages based on lost profits
or diminution in value, and in particular, without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, any "multiple of earnings" or "multiple of cash flow" or
similar valuation methodology based on financial "multiples", except to the
extent actually awarded and paid to a third party, or (y) any damages based on
reputational harm, except to the extent actually awarded and paid to a third
party, and (ii) for purposes of this Section 8, any inaccuracy in or breach of
any representation or warranty, and the resulting determination of the Adverse
Consequences arising therefrom, shall be determined without reference to any
"material" qualification (other than those contained in Section 4(h)(i) and
Section 4(aa)) or "Material Adverse Effect" qualification (other than that
contained in clause (1) of the first paragraph of Section 4(i)) contained in
or otherwise applicable to such representation or warranty. All
indemnification payments under this Section 8 shall be reduced by (i)
insurance proceeds or any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment
actually received by the Indemnified Party and (ii) the value of any Tax
benefits actually realized by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates arising
from the Adverse Consequences. The Indemnified Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to recover under insurance policies or
indemnification, contribution or similar agreement for Adverse Consequences
prior to seeking indemnification under this Agreement and to obtain and
realize the value of any Tax benefits described above. All indemnification
payments under this Section 8 shall be deemed adjustments to the Purchase
Price, and shall be allocated to the appropriate Seller(s) and Optionholder 

(s) if made under Section 8(b)(ii). If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount
from a third party or realizes a Tax benefit in respect of any Adverse
Consequences that are the subject of indemnification hereunder after all or a
portion of such Adverse Consequences have been paid by the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Section 8, the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to the
Indemnifying Party the lesser of (i) the amount paid by the Indemnifying Party
in respect of such Adverse Consequences and (ii) (x) the amount received from
the third party, or the applicable Tax benefit, less (y) the amount of
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses expended by the Indemnified Party in
connection with the collection of any such amount in respect thereof.

Additional Limitations on Sellers' and Optionholders' Indemnification
Obligations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Seller or
Optionholder shall be obligated to indemnify Buyer with respect to claims for
indemnification of Adverse Consequences made pursuant to this Section 8 with
respect to (i) any covenant or condition waived in writing by Buyer at or
prior to the Closing, (ii) any Adverse Consequences with respect to any
matter, to the extent that such matter was reflected in the calculation of the
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2(e) of this Agreement, (iii) any Adverse
Consequences arising out of a breach by Buyer of a covenant under this
Agreement, (iv) any Taxes (or related Adverse Consequences) with respect to
taxable periods, or portions thereof, that begin after the Closing Date, (v)
any Taxes (or related Adverse Consequences) that result from the failure of
the Buyer to perform any covenant or other agreement in Section 6(d), (vi) any
Taxes (or related Adverse Consequences) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to the extent attributable to any action taken by the Buyer or
its Affiliates on the Closing Date after the Closing, or (vii) any Taxes (or
related Adverse Consequences) to the extent attributable to any action by the
Buyer or its Affiliates relating to taxable periods or portions thereof ending
on or prior to the Closing Date, including a tax election with retroactive
effect.

Exclusive Remedy. Except (i) for any equitable remedies of the Parties
expressly provided herein (including pursuant to Section 10(o)), (ii) as
expressly contemplated in Section 2(e)(iii) and (iii) with respect to claims
arising from fraud on the part of a Party hereto in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Parties acknowledge and agree
that the provisions in this Section 8 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Parties after the Closing with respect to claims arising under or as a
result of this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. Without limiting and subject to the foregoing,
Buyer agrees that it shall not make any claim under any legal theory,
including under any law, judgment, order or decree of any government,
governmental agency or court (including claims for breach of contract or
implied warranty, failure of disclosure, tortious wrong, violation of
securities laws or violation of Environmental, Health and Safety
Requirements), arising out of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c)Manner of Payment



(i)All Adverse Consequences relating to claims for indemnification pursuant to
Section 8(b)(i) shall be satisfied as follows: (i) first, out of the portion
of the Indemnity Escrow Amount, if any, then held in escrow and not previously
distributed pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, and (ii)
thereafter, by Sellers and Optionholders, severally (in accordance with their
respective Allocable Portions), and not jointly, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account specified by Buyer within five (5)
Business Days following the final determination of the claim for
indemnification giving rise to such payment obligation.



(ii)All Adverse Consequences relating to claims for indemnification pursuant
to Section 8(b)(ii) shall be satisfied by the relevant Seller or Optionholder
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated by Buyer within five (5) Business Days following the final
determination of the claim for indemnification giving rise to such payment
obligation. 

(iii)Any amount payable by Buyer to a Seller or Optionholder pursuant to this
Section 8 shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account or accounts designated by Sellers' Representative (including, if so
designated by the Sellers' Representative, to the Company for the benefit of
the Optionholders for further payment by the Company to the Optionholders in
accordance with Section 2(g)) within five (5) Business Days following the
final determination of the claim for indemnification giving rise to such
payment obligation.



Mitigation. Each Indemnified Party shall take all commercially reasonable
steps to mitigate any of its Adverse Consequences (including, to the extent
consistent with sound business judgment, incurring costs only to the minimum
extent necessary to remedy the breach which gives rise to the Adverse
Consequences) upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be
expected to, or does, give rise thereto. Buyer, each Seller and each
Optionholder shall cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any
claim or liability with respect to which one Party is obligated to indemnify
the other Party hereunder, including by making commercially reasonable efforts
to mitigate or resolve any such claim or liability; provided, however, that
such Party shall not be required to make such efforts if they would be
detrimental in any material respect to such Party. In the event that the
Indemnified Party shall fail to make commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate or resolve any claim or liability, then (unless the proviso to the
foregoing sentence shall be applicable), notwithstanding anything else to the
contrary contained herein, the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to
indemnify the Indemnified Party for any Adverse Consequences that could
reasonably be expected to have been avoided if the Indemnified Party had made
such efforts.

(d)Effect of Investigation. The representations, warranties and covenants of
the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification
with respect thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any
investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party (including any of
its representatives) or by reason of the fact that the Indemnified Party or
any of its representatives should have known that any such representation or
warranty is, was or might be inaccurate.

Incorporation of Exhibits, Annexes, and Schedules. The Exhibits, Annexes, and
Schedules identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference
and made a part hereof.

Legal Representation.

(iv)Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Company), acknowledges and agrees that Morrison Cohen LLP
("MoCo") may have acted as counsel for North Castle Partners III, L.P.
(together with its Affiliates, "North Castle"), Sellers' Representative, the
Company and/or their respective Affiliates in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Acquisition Engagement").



(v)Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the Closing,
the Company), acknowledges and agrees that all confidential communications
between North Castle, Sellers' Representative, the Company and/or their
respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and MoCo, on the other hand, in the
course of the Acquisition Engagement, and any attendant attorney-client
privilege, attorney work product protection, and expectation of client
confidentiality applicable thereto, shall be deemed to belong solely to North
Castle and its Affiliates (other than the Company), 

and not the Company, and shall not pass to or be claimed, held, or used by
Buyer or the Company upon or after the Closing. Accordingly, Buyer shall not
have access to any such communications, or to the files of MoCo relating to
the Acquisition Engagement, whether or not the Closing occurs. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (x) to
the extent that files of MoCo in respect of the Acquisition Engagement
constitute property of the client, only North Castle and its Affiliates shall
hold such property rights, and (y) MoCo shall have no duty whatsoever to
reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to the
Company or Buyer by reason of any attorney-client relationship between MoCo
and the Company or otherwise. Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
(including after the Closing, the Company) irrevocably waives any right it may
have to discover or obtain information or documentation relating to the
Acquisition Engagement, to the extent that such information or documentation
was subject to an attorney-client privilege, work product protection or
protection under applicable attorney work-product doctrine arising from MoCo's
representation of North Castle, Sellers' Representative, the Company and/or
their respective Affiliates. If and to the extent that, at any time subsequent
to Closing, Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the
Company) shall have the right to assert or waive any attorney-client privilege
with respect to any communication between the Company or its Affiliates and
any Person representing them that occurred at any time prior to the Closing,
Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the Closing,
the Company) shall be entitled to waive such privilege only with the prior
written consent of Sellers' Representative (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).



(vi)Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the
Closing, the Company), acknowledges and agrees that MoCo may have acted as
counsel for North Castle, Sellers' Representative, the Company and/or their
respective Affiliates in certain matters for several years and that Sellers'
Representative and North Castle reasonably anticipate that MoCo will continue
to represent them or their respective Affiliates (other than the Company) in
future matters. Accordingly, Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Company), expressly: (A) consents to MoCo's
representation of North Castle, Sellers' Representative and/or their
Affiliates in any matter, including any post-Closing matter in which the
interests of Buyer or the Company, on the one hand, and North Castle, Sellers'
Representative or their Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse, including
any matter relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
whether or not such matter is one in which MoCo may have previously advised
North Castle, Sellers' Representative or their Affiliates; and (b) consents to
the disclosure by MoCo to Sellers' Representative, North Castle or their
Affiliates of any information learned by MoCo in the course of its
representation of Sellers' Representative, North Castle, the Company or their
respective Affiliates, whether or not such information is subject to attorney-
client privilege, attorney work product protection, or MoCo's duty of
confidentiality.

(vii)Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including after the
Closing, the Company) further covenants and agrees that each shall not assert
any claim against MoCo in respect of legal services provided to the Company or
their Affiliates by MoCo in connection with the Acquisition Engagement.



(viii)Upon and after the Closing, the Company shall cease to have any
attorney-client relationship with MoCo, unless and to the extent MoCo is
specifically engaged in writing by the Company to represent such Person after
the Closing and such engagement either (i) involves no conflict of interest
with respect to Sellers' Representative, North Castle and/or their Affiliates
or (ii) Sellers' Representative, North Castle and/or their Affiliates, as
applicable, consents in writing at the 

time to such engagement. Any such representation by MoCo after the Closing
shall not affect the foregoing provisions hereof.



(ix)Sellers, Optionholders, the Company and Buyer consent to the arrangements
in this Section 10(n) and waive any actual or potential conflict of interest
that may be involved in connection with any representation by MoCo permitted
hereunder.



Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if
any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the
terms hereof and that the Parties shall be entitled to specific performance of
the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. Each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing
or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy. Each party further
agrees that the only permitted objection that it may raise in response to any
action for equitable relief is that it contests the existence of a breach or
threatened breach of this Agreement.

No Recourse. Subject to the rights of Buyer against Sellers and the
Optionholders under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which each
such Seller and any Optionholder is a party, each of the Company and Buyer
agrees (and, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Company to take
any further action necessary or appropriate to carry out such agreement) that
none of the Sellers or Optionholders, any of their respective Affiliates, and
the current or former officers, directors, employees, partners, members,
managers, stockholders, optionholders or representatives of Sellers or
Optionholders or their respective Affiliates, or any financial advisor or
lender thereto, as of or prior to the Closing Date shall have any liability or
responsibility to either Buyer or the Company for (and each of the Company and
Buyer hereby unconditionally releases (and from and after the Closing Buyer
shall cause the Company to take any further action necessary or appropriate to
carry out such unconditional release) such Persons from) any obligations or
liability:

(x)arising out of, or relating to, the organization, management or operation
of the businesses of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to any
matter, occurrence, action or activity on or prior to the Closing Date;



(xi)relating to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby and any
failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated;



(xii)arising out of or due to any inaccuracy or breach of any representation
or warranty or the breach of any covenant, undertaking or other agreement
contained in this Agreement, the Schedules and Exhibits hereto or in any
certificate contemplated hereby and delivered in connection herewith; or



(xiii)relating to any information (whether written or oral), documents or
materials furnished by or on behalf of Sellers, Optionholders, the Sellers'
Representative and the Company, including the Evaluation Material (as such
term is defined in the Confidentiality Agreement).



(b)Seller and Optionholder Release. Subject to the rights of such Seller or
Optionholder (including the Sellers' Representative acting on its behalf)
under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, each Seller and
Optionholder agrees, severally and not jointly and only with respect to
itself, that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any
liability or responsibility to such Seller or Optionholder for (and such
Seller and Optionholder hereby unconditionally releases the Company and all of
its Subsidiaries, and each of their present, former and future owners,
shareholders, members, partners, 

officers, directors, employees, agents and insurers, in their individual and
representative capacities from) any and all claims, causes of action, demands,
suits, liabilities, damages, charges, controversies, expenses or obligations
of every nature, character or kind arising, or related to acts or omissions
arising out of, or relating to, the organization, management or operation of
the businesses of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries relating to any
matter, occurrence, action or activity up to and including the Closing,
whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, matured or contingent,
existing or hereafter discovered, arising in equity or at law.



(r) Termination of Company Stockholders' Agreement. Effective as of the
Closing, each Seller and the Company hereby agree that the Company
Stockholders' Agreement is and shall be terminated and of no further force or
effect, and all rights and obligations provided therein shall be null and
void, including any such rights and obligations that survive the termination
thereof in accordance with the terms thereof.

(s) Ratification by Stockholders of Board of Director Action. Each Seller
hereby ratifies and confirms all prior acts authorized and/or taken by the
Board of Directors of the Company and/or any comparable governing bodies of
the Company\'s Subsidiaries.
