Exhibit A 

   

 (a) Acquirer shall have no obligation to include shares of Western Common Stock owned by any shareholder in a registration statement unless and until such Shareholder in connection with any underwritten offering, agrees to enter into an underwriting agreement, a custody agreement and power of attorney and any other customary documents required in an underwritten offering all in customary form and containing customary provisions. 

  

 (b) In connection with any registration statement in which a Shareholder is participating, each such holder shall furnish to Acquirer in writing such information and affidavits as Acquirer reasonably requests for use in connection with any such registration statement or prospectus and, to the extent permitted by law, shall indemnify Acquirer, its directors and officers and each person or entity who controls Acquirer (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses resulting from any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in the registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information or affidavit so furnished in writing by such Shareholder; provided that the obligation to indemnify shall be individual, not joint and several, for each Shareholder and shall be limited to the net amount of proceeds received by such Shareholder from the sale of shares of Western Common Stock pursuant to such registration statement. 

  

 (c) Any person or entity entitled to indemnification hereunder shall (i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt notice shall not impair such person or entitys right to indemnification hereunder to the extent such failure has not prejudiced the indemnifying party) and (ii) unless in such indemnified partys reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim. 

  

 (d) The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling person or entity of such indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities.
