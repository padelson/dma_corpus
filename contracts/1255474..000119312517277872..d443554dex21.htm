fees, court costs and related expenses), if any, resulting from such a Like-

(a) Upon execution of this Agreement, Buyer shall deliver to Seller Twenty-
Five Million U.S. Dollars (U.S. $25,000,000), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, as a Deposit (together with all interest accrued thereon, the
" _Deposit_ "). The Deposit shall be fully maintained by Seller in a separate
interest bearing account not to be commingled with any other accounts or
funds. If Closing occurs, the Deposit shall be credited to the Purchase Price.
If this Agreement is terminated prior to Closing, the Deposit shall be
distributed by Seller in accordance with _Article XII_. 

(b) Contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer has
deposited by wire transfer in same day funds into an escrow account (the "
_Escrow Account_ ") established pursuant to the terms of a mutually agreeable
Escrow Agreement (the _"_ _Escrow Agreement_ ") an amount equal to Ten Million
U.S. Dollars (U.S. $10,000,000) (the " _Hedge Deposit_ "). The Hedge Deposit
shall be held by the Escrow Agent, and distributed in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 9.6_ or _Section_ __ _ 12.2(b)_, as applicable. 

 



-16- Section 3.3 _Allocation of the Purchase Price_. Solely for the purposes of 
_Article V_ and _Article VI_ , Buyer and Seller have allocated the Purchase
Price among the Assets set forth on _Exhibit_ __ _ B-1_. The value so
allocated to a particular Asset may be referred to as the " _Allocated Value_
" for that Asset. Seller makes no representation or warranty concerning the
accuracy of the Allocated Values.

 

Section 3.4 _Adjustments to Purchase Price_. All adjustments to the Purchase
Price shall be made according to the factors described in this _Section_ __ _
3.4_ and without duplication.

(a) _Settlement Statements_. The Purchase Price shall be adjusted at Closing
pursuant to a " _Preliminary Settlement Statement_ " prepared by Seller and
submitted to Buyer not less than five (5) Business Days prior to Closing for
Buyers comment and agreement. If Buyer and Seller are unable to agree upon
this Preliminary Settlement Statement, Sellers good faith estimate shall be
used at Closing and the Parties shall resolve such disagreement after Closing

Settlement Statement shall set forth the Closing Amount and all adjustments to
the Purchase Price and associated calculations. The term " _Closing Amount_ "
means the Purchase Price, adjusted as provided in this _Section_ __ _ 3.4_
using reasonable estimates of amounts paid or received before Closing if
actual numbers are not available. After Closing, the Purchase Price shall be
adjusted pursuant to the Final Settlement Statement delivered pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 14.1_.

 

(b) _Proceeds; Property Costs_.

 

(i) Buyer shall be entitled to all production and products from or
attributable to the Assets from and after the Effective Time and the proceeds
thereof, and to all other income, proceeds, receipts, and credits earned with
respect to the Assets on or after the Effective Time, and shall be responsible
for (and entitled to any refunds with respect to) all Property
Costs attributable to the Assets and incurred from and after the Effective
Time. Subject to production for which Seller receives a Purchase Price
adjustment, Seller shall be entitled to all production and products from or
attributable to the Assets prior to the Effective Time and the proceeds
thereof, and shall be responsible for (and entitled to any refunds with
respect to) all Property Costs attributable to the Assets and incurred prior
to the Effective Time. Seller shall be responsible for and pay the costs
associated with the MHA Wells and Charging Eagle Well described in Part 1 of
_Schedule_ __ _ 9.1(a)_, and Buyer shall be responsible for and pay the costs
associated with the MHA Wells and Charging Eagle Well described in Part 2 of
_Schedule_ __ _ 9.1(a)_, in each case irrespective of whether such costs are
incurred or paid prior to or following the Effective Time. "Earned" and
"incurred," as used in this Agreement, shall be interpreted in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles and COPAS standards. For
purposes of allocating revenues, production, proceeds, income, accounts
receivable, and products under this  _Section_ __ _ 3.4(b)(i)_, (A) liquid
Hydrocarbons produced into storage facilities will be deemed to be "from or
attributable to" the Wells when they pass through the pipeline connecting into
the storage facilities into which they are run, and (B) gaseous Hydrocarbons
and liquid Hydrocarbons produced into pipelines will

 



-17-  be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the Wells when they pass through
the receipt point sales meters on the pipelines through which they are
transported. In order to accomplish the foregoing allocation of production,
the Parties shall rely upon the gauging, metering, and strapping procedures
which were conducted by Seller on or about the Effective Time and, unless
demonstrated to be inaccurate, shall utilize reasonable interpolating
procedures to arrive at an allocation of production when exact gauging,
metering, and strapping data is not available on hand as of the Effective
Time. Seller shall provide to Buyer evidence of all meter readings and all
gauging and strapping procedures conducted on or about the Effective Time in
connection with the Assets, together with all data necessary to support any
estimated allocation, for purposes of establishing the adjustment to the
Purchase Price pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.4(c)(v)_.

(ii) _Operator Costs_. For any Wells operated by Seller or its Affiliates (i)
Seller shall retain overhead charges and rates received from Third Parties in
its capacity as "Operator" under any applicable operating agreement or COPAS
accounting procedure attributable to such Wells through the Closing Date and
(ii) from the Effective Time until Closing Date Seller shall be entitled to
deduct and retain, without duplication of Property Costs, overhead charges
with respect to the Assets for properties where Seller or its Affiliate is
the operator as chargeable under applicable JOAs and as adjusted pursuant to
the standards established by COPAS (such office overhead to be calculated in a
similar manner for properties without a JOA but where Seller or its Affiliate
is the operator) each month through the Closing Date (proportionately reduced
for partial months); _provided however_ , that, except as provided in
_Exhibit_ __ _ F_, the overhead charges for the month in which Closing occurs
shall be prorated between Buyer and Seller based upon the number of days in
such month that Seller operated such Wells.

(c)  _Upward Adjustments_. The Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward by the
following without duplication:

(i) An amount equal to all proceeds (net of applicable Asset Taxes and
Royalties and other burdens) received and retained by Buyer that are
attributable to production of Hydrocarbons from the Assets prior to the
Effective Time;

 

(ii) (A) An amount equal to all Property Costs incurred and paid by Seller or
its Affiliate (whether paid before or after the Effective Time) that are
attributable to the ownership or operation of the Assets during the period
after the Effective Time, and (B) all overhead and other overhead type income
owed to Seller by Third Parties as operator under applicable COPAS procedures
relating to the operation of the Assets attributable to the period prior to
the Closing, but paid to Buyer;

 

(iii) An amount equal to all proceeds received and retained by Buyer in
respect of Accounts Receivable attributable to periods prior to the Effective
Time;

 



-18- (iv) An amount equal to all Seller Hedge Losses realized by Seller;

 

(v) An amount equal to the value (net of Royalties and other burdens and
applicable Asset Taxes) of Sellers share of all liquid Hydrocarbons in
storage facilities from or attributable to Assets at the Effective Time to be
calculated as follows: The value shall be the product of (A) the volume in
each storage tank (attributable to Sellers interest) as of the Effective
Time as shown by the actual gauging reports, less any volumes below the load
line, multiplied by (B) the price actually received for production under the
applicable marketing contract (less any costs incurred to reach the point
of sale) for the liquid Hydrocarbons sold, or if not sold, the price that
would be received for the liquid Hydrocarbons as if they had been sold in the
month of September 2017; _provided_ , _however_ , that the adjustment
contemplated by this subsection (iv) shall be made only to the extent that
Seller does not receive and retain the proceeds, or portion thereof,
attributable to the pre-Effective Time merchantable oil in the storage tanks;

(vi) An amount equal to the sum of Interest Addition adjustments, if any,
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, which amount is limited to the downward
Purchase Price adjustments for Title Defects in _Section_ __ _ 3.4(d)(iii)_;

 

(vii) To the extent that there is any Imbalance attributable to the Assets as
of the Effective Time, if the net of such Imbalance is in an over-delivery or
under-produced Imbalance (resulting in amounts owed by third parties to
Seller), the Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward by Sellers applicable
average price per unit for sales of production during the calendar month in
which the Effective Time occurs, multiplied by the net over-delivery or under-
produced Imbalance attributable to the Assets in the appropriate units of
measure consistent with such applicable average sales price;

 

(viii) An amount equal to all Asset Taxes allocable to Buyer in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ that are paid or otherwise borne by Seller;

(ix) An amount equal to all costs incurred and paid by Seller or its Affiliate
(whether paid before or after the Effective Time) with respect to the MHA

Part 2 of _Schedule_ __ _ 9.1(a)_;

 

(x) An amount equal to all Royalty related deposits and prepaids associated
with the Bureau of Indian Affairs to the extent attributable to the Assets as
of the Termination Date (as defined in the TSA) of the TSA for all revenue
accounting-related payments and disbursements, which such revenue accounting
functions will continue through the last full production month under the TSA
and cease thereafter;

(xi) An amount equal to the value of Sellers share of line fill from
or attributable to the Assets as of the Effective Time to be calculated as
follows: The value shall be the product of (A) the line fill volume
(attributable to Sellers interest) as of the Effective Time multiplied by (B)
the price actually received for production under the applicable marketing
contract in the month of September 2017; and

 



-19- (xii) Any other amount agreed to by Seller and Buyer or as otherwise provided
for in this Agreement.

(d) _Downward Adjustments_. The Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by
the following without duplication:

(i) An amount equal to all proceeds (net of applicable Asset Taxes and
royalties and other burdens) received and retained by Seller or its Affiliate
that are attributable to production of Hydrocarbons from the Assets after the
Effective Time;

 

(ii) The amount of all Property Costs that remain unpaid by Seller or its
Affiliate and will be paid by Buyer, or that have been paid by Buyer that are
attributable to the period prior to the Effective Time;

(iii) As applicable, an amount equal to the sum of all adjustments to the
Purchase Price for Environmental Defects and Title Defects but only for the
excess of Environmental Defects over the Environmental Deductible and the
Title Defects over the Title Deductible and all on the terms and conditions
set forth in _Article V_ and _Article VI_ , but subject to the Parties right
to termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.1(f)_;

 

(iv) An amount equal to the sum of all Net Casualty Losses, if any;

 

(v) An amount equal to all proceeds from sales of Hydrocarbons relating to the
Assets and payable to owners of working interests, royalties, overriding
royalties and other similar interests (in each case) that are held in suspense
or escrow by Seller or its Affiliate as of the Termination Date (as defined in
the TSA) of the TSA for all revenue accounting-related payments and
disbursements, which such revenue accounting functions will continue through
the last full production month under the TSA and cease thereafter;

 

(vi) To the extent that there is any Imbalance attributable to the Assets as
of the Effective Time, if the net of such Imbalance is in an under-delivery
or over-produced Imbalance (resulting in amounts owed by Seller to third
parties), the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by Sellers applicable
average price per unit for sales of production during the calendar month in
which the Effective Time occurs, multiplied by the net under-delivery or over-
produced Imbalance attributable to the Assets in the appropriate units of
measure consistent with such applicable average sales price;

 

(vii) An amount equal to the Deposit;

 



-20- (viii) As applicable, an amount equal to the sum of all adjustments to
the Purchase Price for Preferential Rights and Required Consents on the terms
and conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.6_, but subject to the Parties
right to termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.1(f)_; 

(ix) An amount equal to all Seller Hedge Gains as of Closing;

 

(x) An amount equal to all Asset Taxes allocable to Seller in accordance with

affirmatively shown to exist by an abstract of title or opinion, which
documents shall be included in the Notice of Title Defects;

(viii) defects that are barred under applicable statutes of limitation.

(d) _Title Defect Value_. " _Title Defect Value_ " means the amount by which
the Allocated Value of an Asset is reduced by a Title Defect. The Title Defect
Value will be determined on a Lease-by-Lease basis with respect to Leases (
_i.e._ , based on the aggregate value of all Title Defects related to a Lease
and the Lands pooled or communitized therewith) and on a Well-by-Well basis
with respect to Wells ( _i.e._ , based on the aggregate value of all Title
Defects related to a Well). The Title Defect Value with respect to a Title
Defect Property shall be determined without duplication of any costs or Losses
included in any other Title Defect Value hereunder. The Title Defect Value
must exceed the applicable Title Threshold and may not exceed the Allocated
Value of the applicable Lease or Well. The Parties shall determine the Title
Defect Value as follows:

 

(i) if the Title Defect is a Lien on the Asset, the Title Defect Value shall
be the cost of removing such Lien;

 

(ii) if the Title Defect for any Lease or Well is the actual failure of Seller
to own the represented NRI for such Lease or Well as set forth on _Exhibit_
__ _ B-1_, and the WI attributable to such Lease or Well has been reduced
proportionately, then the Title Defect Value will be the product of (i) the 

 



-27-  Allocated Value of such Lease or Well _multiplied by_ (ii) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the positive difference between (A) the NRI for such
Title Defect Property set forth on _Exhibit_ __ _ B-1_, and (B) the actual
NRI for such Lease or Well and the denominator of which is the NRI set forth
in _Exhibit  B-1_ for such Lease or Well;

(iii) if the Title Defect with respect to a Lease results from a discrepancy
where (i) the actual Net Acres for such Lease is less than (ii) the Net Acres
set forth on _Exhibit_ __ _ B-1_, for such Lease, then the Title
Defect Value shall be calculated by multiplying the Net Acre deficiency with
respect to such Lease by the per Net Acre Allocated Value of such Lease; and

 

(iv) if the Title Defect does not fall into subsections (i) through (iii),
above, then the Title Defect Value shall be determined by the Parties in good
faith, taking into account all relevant factors, including the following: (i)
the Allocated Value of the affected Lease or Well; (ii) if the Title Defect
represents only a possibility of title failure, the probability that such
failure will occur; (iii) the portion of the Lease or Well affected by the
Title Defect; (iv) the legal effect of the Title Defect; (v) the potential
economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Lease or Well; (vi)
the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller; and (vii) such
other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation.

 

Section 5.2 _Purchase Price Adjustments for Title Defects_.

 

(a) _Special Warranty of Title_. The Conveyance shall contain a special
warranty of title by, through, and under Seller and its Affiliates, but not
otherwise, to the Leases and Wells shown on _Exhibit_ __ _ B-1_, subject to
the Permitted Encumbrances, but shall otherwise be without warranty of title
of any kind, express, implied, statutory or otherwise (the " _Special
Warranty of Title_ "). The Net Acres, WI, and NRI of Seller described in the
Conveyance will be deemed to be amended based on the result of the title
defect process in _Article V_ regardless of whether there has been any
adjustment to the Purchase Price for any Title Defects.

(b)  _Notices of Title Defects_. Buyer shall give Seller each written "
_Notice of Title Defects_ " as soon as reasonably possible but no later than
5:00 pm Mountain Time on the date that is three (3) calendar days before the
Scheduled Closing Date (the " _Title Defect Date_ "). Each such notice must
(i) be in writing and asserted in good faith; (ii) name the affected Lease or
Well; (iii) describe each Title Defect and the basis for it; (iv) attach
copies of the Supporting Documentation; (v) state the Allocated Value of the
applicable Lease or Well; (vi) state Buyers good faith estimate of the Title
Defect Value; and (vii) set forth the computations upon which Buyers
estimate is based. To give Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing and
curing Title Defects, Buyer agrees to use reasonable efforts to give Seller,
on or before the end of each calendar week prior to the Title Defect Date,
written notice of all alleged Title Defects discovered by Buyer during the
preceding calendar week, which notice may be preliminary in nature and
supplemented prior to the expiration of the Title Defect Date; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that

 



-28-  Buyers failure to notify Seller as set forth above shall not constitute a
waiver of any such alleged Title Defect to the extent that notice is received
prior to the Title Defect Date. " _Supporting Documentation_ " for a
particular Title Defect means, (x) if the basis is derived from any document,
a copy of such document (or pertinent part thereof) or (y) if the basis is
derived from any gap in the Sellers chain of title, the recorded documents
preceding and following the gap, or (z) if the basis is not as described in
subsections (x) and (y), then reasonable, written documentation. Buyer
irrevocably waives all Title Defects not timely submitted in a valid Notice
of Title Defect, including any and all claims under Sellers Special Warranty
of Title in the Conveyance if such claim arises out of or relates to any Title
Defect which Buyer had Knowledge of on or prior to the Title Defect Date;
_provided_ that the foregoing waiver shall not limit Buyers right to bring
any claim under the Special Warranty of Title in the Conveyance for claims
under such Special Warranty of Title that Buyer did not have Knowledge of
prior to the Title Defect Date.

(c) _Purchase Price Adjustments for Title Defects_. Seller will provide a
written response to Buyers Notice of Title Defects no later than one (1)
calendar day before Closing, which shall include identification of any Title
Defects Seller disputes. The Purchase Price shall be reduced at Closing
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.4_ by an amount equal to the aggregate of all
Title Defect Values but only to the extent they exceed the Title Deductible,
unless, (1) Seller disputes the Title Defect, (2) Seller cures the Title
Defect prior to Closing, (3) Buyer agrees to waive the relevant Title Defect,
(4) Seller elects on or before Closing to cure such Title Defect within the
Cure Period or (5) the Parties mutually agree to require Seller to indemnify
Buyer and the Buyer Indemnified Parties against all Losses (up to the
Allocated Value of the applicable Title Defect Property) resulting from such
Title Defect with respect to the Asset subject to the claimed Title Defect
(the " _Title Defect Property_ ") pursuant to an indemnity agreement prepared
by Buyer in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to Seller (the " _Title
Indemnity_ ").

 

(d) _Post-Closing Cure_. Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure, at any time prior to one hundred
eighty (180) days after Closing (or such longer period as may be agreed to by
the Parties) (the " _Cure Period_ "), any Title Defects that Seller has
elected to cure under  _Section_ __ _ 5.2(c)_.

(i) If Seller elects to cure the applicable Title Defect post-Closing, but
does not cure the applicable Title Defect within the Cure Period, then
following Sellers receipt of notice from Buyer of such failure to cure and
(A) Seller and Buyers agreement upon the existence and value of the Title
Defect or (B) resolution of any Disputed Title Matter applicable to such
Title Defect by binding arbitration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 15.7_,
(I) Seller shall pay Buyer an amount equal to the Title Defect Value or (II)
the Parties may mutually agree to enter into a Title Indemnity with respect
to such Title Defect Property.

(ii) If Seller elects to cure the applicable Title Defect post-Closing, and
does cure the applicable Title Defect post-Closing within the Cure Period,
then Seller shall be entitled to retain the Title Defect Value paid by Buyer
to Seller at Closing in respect of such Title Defect Property, such Title
Defect will thereafter no longer be considered for purposes of determining
whether the Title Deductible has been met, and the Parties shall no longer
have any rights or obligations under this _Article V_  in respect of such
Title Defect.

 



-29- Section 5.3 _Interest Additions_.

 

(a) Promptly on discovery, but on or before the Title Defect Date, either
Party shall in good faith notify the other of any circumstance or condition
such Party discovers that operates (A) to increase Sellers NRI above that
shown on _Exhibit_ __ _ B-1_ for any Lease or Well, (B) to decrease Sellers
WI in any Lease or Well below that shown in _Exhibit_ __ _ B-1_, without a
proportionate change in NRI, or (C) to increase the Net Acres owned by Seller
above that shown on  _Exhibit_ __ _ B-1_ (each being an " _Interest
Addition_ "). Buyer acknowledges and agrees to comply with the affirmative
obligation set forth in the preceding sentence. Seller shall promptly provide
Buyer thereafter with the value of the Interest Addition or the amount by
which Seller believes the Allocated Value of the Oil and Gas Asset has been
increased by the Interest Addition (" _Interest Addition Value_ ") and the
associated computations. The Parties shall determine the Interest Addition
Value as follows:

 

(i) if the Interest Addition represents a discrepancy between (A) Sellers NRI
for any Lease or Well and (B) the NRI set forth for such Lease or Well in _
Exhibit_ __ _ B-1_, __ then the Interest Addition Value shall be the product
of the Allocated Value of such Lease or Well _multiplied_  by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the NRI increase and the denominator of which is the NRI
set forth for such Lease or Well in _ Exhibit_ __ _ B-1_;

 

(ii) if the Interest Addition represents a decrease of (A) Sellers WI for any
Lease or Well below (B) the WI set forth for such Lease or Well in _Exhibit_
__ _ B-1_, without a proportionate change in NRI, then the Interest Addition
Value shall be determined by the product of the Allocated Value of such Lease
or Well, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the WI decrease
and the denominator of which is the WI set forth for such Lease or Well in
_Exhibit_ __ _ B-1_;

 

(iii) if the Interest Addition represents an increase Sellers Net Acres so
that the actual Net Acres covered by the Lease is greater than the Net Acres
set forth on _Exhibit_ __ _ B-1_ for such Lease, then the Interest Addition
Value shall be calculated by multiplying increase in Net Acres with respect to
such Lease by the per Net Acre Allocated Value of such Lease; and

(iv) if the Interest Addition does not fall into subsections (i) through
(iii), above, then the Interest Addition Value shall be determined by the
Parties in good faith, taking into account all relevant factors, including the
following: (A) the Allocated Value of the affected Lease or Well; (B) if the
Interest Addition represents only a possibility of title benefit, the
probability that such benefit will occur; (C) the portion of the Lease or Well
affected by the Interest Addition; (D) the legal effect of the Interest
Addition; (E) the potential economic effect of the Interest Addition over the
life of the Lease or Well; (F) the values placed upon the Interest Addition by
Buyer and Seller; and (G) such other reasonable factors as are necessary to
make a proper evaluation.

 



-30- (b) The Parties agree that Interest Additions shall only be accounted for if
the Interest Addition Value of such Interest Addition exceeds the applicable
Title Threshold, and then only to the extent that all Interest Addition Values
that exceed the Title Threshold, in the aggregate, exceed the Title
Deductible. Further, the Parties agree that the sum of such Interest Addition
Values in excess of the Title Deductible may only be used to offset Title
Defects and there shall be no upward adjustment to the Purchase Price for
Interest Additions in excess of the aggregate downward adjustment to the
Purchase Price for Title Defect Values. At Closing, the Interest Additions
that exceed the Title Threshold, and then only to the extent that all Interest
Addition Values that exceed the Title Threshold, in the aggregate, exceed the
Title Deductible, shall be used to offset Title Defects, unless (1) Buyer
disputes the Interest Addition or (2) Seller agrees to waive the relevant
Interest Addition.

 

Section 5.4 _Dispute Resolution_.

 

(a) _Disputed Title Matters_. " _Disputed Title Matter_ " means any dispute
regarding (i) the existence and scope of a Title Defect or Interest Addition,
(ii) the Title Defect Value or that portion of the Asset affected by a Title
Defect, (iii) the Interest Addition Value, or (iv) the adequacy of Sellers
Title Defect curative materials or actions. The Parties will attempt to
initially resolve all Disputed Title Matters through good faith negotiations.
If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve any such Disputed Title Matters
within thirty (30) days following Closing, either Party may initiate the
dispute procedure under _Section_ __ _ 15.7_ and have such dispute resolved
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 15.7_. Within five (5) Business Days
following resolution of any such Disputed Title Matter by binding arbitration
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 15.7_, if and to the extent the Arbitrators
determine that Seller is required to make any payment to Buyer in respect of
such Disputed Title Matter (which in no event shall exceed the Title Defect
Value), then Seller shall promptly pay to Buyer the finally determined Title
Defect Value, or portion thereof, consistent with such arbitration judgment or
award. If and to the extent the Arbitrators determine that Seller is entitled
to an Interest Addition credit, the Parties will (1) first apply such amounts
against any future Title Defects and (2) if all Title Defects have been
resolved, Buyer shall pay Seller the Interest Addition Value to the extent it
does not exceed the Title Defect Values that have not previously been offset
by an Interest Addition. Following resolution and payment pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.4(a)_, if any, the Parties shall no longer have any rights
or obligations under this _Article V_ in respect of such Title Defect or
Interest Addition, as applicable.

 

(b) If the Parties cannot resolve any matters with respect to Title Defects or
Title Defect Values on or before Closing, the Closing will be delayed due to
such dispute if, and only if, either Party seeks to terminate this Agreement
under _Section_ __ _ 12.1(f)_, and such Partys election to terminate this
Agreement under such Section relies upon alleged Title Defects and/or Title
Defect Values that are disputed matters in order to reach the termination
threshold set forth therein, in which case the Parties will resolve all such
disputed matters under _Section_ __ _ 15.7_ prior to Closing or such
termination, as applicable.

 



-31- Section 5.5 _Casualty Loss_ _._

 

(a) _Assumed Risk_. Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary,
any diminution in value of the Assets from and after the Effective Time that
results from production of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion, a decrease
in the estimated recoverable reserves or market value thereof or from
mechanical failure that arises in the ordinary course of operating oil and
gas wells (including watering out of any well, the loss of an injector well,
collapsed casing or sand infiltration of any well) and the depreciation of
personal property due to ordinary wear and tear; in each case, with respect to
the Assets, shall not be treated as a Casualty Loss or other Loss for which
Seller indemnifies Buyer or otherwise has responsibility hereunder.

 

(b) _Loss_. Prior to Closing, if a portion of the Assets is destroyed by fire
or other casualty, or is taken or threatened to be taken in condemnation or
under the right of eminent domain and such damage, destruction or taking has
an adverse effect on the value of the Asset in an amount that exceeds One
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) (with such event as so limited being a "
_Casualty Loss_ "), Buyer shall purchase the Asset at Closing for the
Allocated Value of the Asset reduced by the portion of the estimated cost to
repair or replace such Asset (with equipment of similar grade and utility) in
excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) (the reduction being the "
_Net Casualty Loss_ "), _provided_ that such reduction shall in no event
exceed the Allocated Value of such Asset. Seller, at its sole option, may
elect to cure such Casualty Loss by repairing the affected Asset no later than
the Closing Date.

Section 5.6  _Preferential Rights and Consents_. The Preferential Rights and
the Assets subject to such rights, and the Required Consents, and the Assets
affected by such Required Consents are listed on _Exhibit_ __ _ B-3_. The
term " _Required Consent_ " means (i) a provision within the applicable
instrument that such consent may be withheld for any reason or in the sole
discretion of the holder or words of similar effect, or (ii) a consent that,
if not obtained by Closing, would invalidate the conveyance of the Assets by
its express terms with words such as "the failure to obtain such consent will
void the assignment";  _provided, however,_ that, Customary Post-Closing
Consents and consents that by their terms cannot be unreasonably withheld are
not Required Consents. Seller shall, as promptly as practical but in no event
later than five (5) days after the Execution Date, provide all notices
required to comply with or obtain all consents (including Required Consents)
and Preferential Rights in compliance with the contractual provisions
applicable thereto required for the transfer of the Assets. Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents and waivers of
Preferential Rights prior to Closing. In the event that any non-Required
Consent is not obtained prior to Closing, Seller and Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts ( _provided_ that Seller shall not be
obligated to make any payment in connection with such consent or to incur any
expenses in connection therewith) to obtain such consent in favor of
Buyer following the Closing. Prior to Closing, if Buyer discovers other
Assets affected by Required Consents or Preferential Rights, Buyer shall
notify Seller immediately and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain such consents and/or to give the notices required in connection
with the Preferential Rights prior to Closing. For purposes of clarification
and avoidance of doubt, Preferential Rights, Required Consents and other any
other consents shall not constitute Title Defects.

 



-32- (a) _Consents_. If a Required Consent has not been obtained as of the Closing
with respect to an Asset (a " _Restricted Asset_ "), then the Restricted Asset
shall not be conveyed at the Closing and the Purchase Price shall be adjusted
downward by the Allocated Value of such Restricted Asset, if any (including
the portion of the Allocated Value of any Wells in a drilling spacing unit for
a Lease that is a Restricted Asset to the extent Buyers NRI in such Well will
be reduced by exclusion of such Restricted Asset from the Transaction
herein). After Closing, Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the consent of the Third Parties required thereunder (
_provided_ that Seller shall not be obligated to make any payment in
connection with such consent or to incur any expenses in connection
therewith). With respect to any such Restricted Asset(s) as to which the
necessary approval or consent for the assignment or transfer to the Buyer is
obtained following the Closing, Seller shall transfer such Restricted Asset
to Buyer by execution and delivery of an instrument of conveyance in the form
of _Exhibit_ __ _ E_ and Seller and Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal
to the Allocated Value of such Restricted Asset(s), if any, in accordance
with wire transfer instructions provided by Seller. If any consent is not
obtained within one hundred and eighty (180) days following the Closing,
Seller shall have the option, at its sole discretion, to elect to retain such
Restricted Asset, and upon such election by Seller, such Restricted Asset
shall be deemed an Excluded Asset, and neither Party shall have any duty or
obligation pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.6(a)_ or under any other
provision of this Agreement to obtain such consent.

(b) If Seller fails to obtain a consent that does not constitute a Required
Consent (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Customary Post-Closing
Consents and those consents required in connection with transfer of the Leases
identified on  _Schedule_ __ _ 5.6(b)-_ _1_ ), then the Assets subject to
such un-obtained consent shall be conveyed to and acquired by Buyer at Closing
as part of the Assets with no adjustment to the Purchase Price; _provided_ ,
_however_ , in the event that a consent to assignment of a Lease identified on
_Schedule_ __ _ 5.6(b)-1_ is denied in writing prior to Closing, then
the procedures below that apply with respect to Specified Leases shall also
apply with respect to the Leases identified on _Schedule_ __ _ 5.6(b)-1_ and,
in such case, no adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be made at Closing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect to
the Leases identified on _Schedule_ __ _ 5.6(b)-2_, in the event that
the consents with respect to such Leases are not obtained by Closing ("
_Specified Leases_ "), then (1) such Specified Leases shall not be conveyed at
Closing, (2) the Purchase Price shall not be adjusted, (3) Seller and Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of the Third
Parties required thereunder ( _provided_ that Seller shall not be obligated to
make any payment in connection with such consent or to incur any expenses
in connection therewith) and (4) Seller shall provide Buyer the economic
benefit of such Specified Leases until the applicable consent has been
obtained, _provided_ that Seller shall be entitled to deduct applicable
Royalties, operating expenses and Taxes (excluding Income Taxes) related to
Sellers ownership and operation of the Specified Leases. With respect to any
such Specified Lease as to which the necessary approval or consent for the
assignment or transfer to the Buyer is obtained following the Closing, Seller
shall transfer such Specified Lease to Buyer by execution and delivery of an
instrument of conveyance in the form of _Exhibit_ __ _ E_.

 



-33- (c) _Midstream and Marketing Consents_. Without limiting the
foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_, with respect to consents
relating to the midstream, marketing and other contracts identified on
_Exhibit_ __ _ D_ that relate to the gathering, processing,
sale, distribution and delivery of Hydrocarbons (" _Midstream Agreements_ "),
the Parties agree that, from the Execution Date until Closing, Seller and
Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use their
commercially reasonable efforts in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.6(c)_ of
the Disclosure Schedule to obtain (1) any consents to assignment required
under the Midstream Agreements, and, if requested by Seller, (2) novations of
the Midstream Agreements from Seller or its Affiliates to Buyer with respect
to any liabilities or Losses related to or arising from the Midstream
Agreements after the Effective Time. The Parties further agree that: (A) with
respect to the Midstream Agreements with Required Consents that are not
obtained by Closing (" _Restricted Midstream Agreements_ "), then (1) such
Restricted Midstream Agreements shall not be conveyed at Closing, (2) the
Purchase Price shall not be adjusted, (3) Seller and Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Required Consent and, if
requested, novation ( _provided_ that Seller shall not be obligated to make
any payment in connection with such consent and novation, to incur any
expenses or to post any credit support in connection therewith), (4) Seller
shall provide Buyer the economic benefit of such Restricted Midstream
Agreements until the applicable consent and novation has been obtained,
_provided_ that Seller shall be entitled to deduct applicable Royalties,
operating expenses and Taxes (excluding income Taxes), as applicable, related
to Sellers ownership and operation of the Restricted Midstream
Agreements, and (5) upon obtaining the Required Consent and novation, Seller
shall transfer such Restricted Midstream Agreement to Buyer by execution and
delivery of an instrument of conveyance in the form of _Exhibit_ __ _ E_;
and, (B) in the event that Seller fails to obtain the consent and, if
requested, novation with respect to a Midstream Agreement that does not
constitute a Required Consent, then such Midstream Agreement shall be conveyed
and acquired by Buyer at Closing as part of the Assets with no adjustment to
the Purchase Price and, thereafter, Seller and Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.6(c)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule to obtain such consent and novation ( _provided_ that
Seller shall not be obligated to make any payment, to incur any expenses or to
post any credit support in connection therewith).

 

(d) _Preferential Rights_. If any Preferential Right is exercised prior to the
Closing Date, or if the time frame for the exercise of such Preferential
Right has not expired and Seller has not received notice of an intent not to
exercise or waiver of the Preferential Right, then that portion of the Assets
affected by such Preferential Right shall be excluded from the Assets at
Closing and the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by an amount equal
to the Allocated Value of such affected Assets.

 

(i) If a Third Party exercises its Preferential Right, but fails to consummate
the transaction prior to the Closing, Seller shall retain the affected Assets
at Closing and the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by an amount
equal to the Allocated Value of such affected Assets.

 



-34- (ii) If a Third Party exercises its Preferential Right, but does not
consummate the transaction within the time frame specified in the
Preferential Right ( _provided_ that the reason therefor is not Sellers
default), Seller agrees to convey the affected Asset to Buyer as soon as
possible after the expiration of the time for consummation of the transaction
by the holder of the Preferential Right, such conveyance to be effective as of
the Effective Time, and Buyer agrees to pay Seller the Allocated Value of the
affected Asset.

 

(iii) If a Preferential Right is not discovered prior to Closing, and the
affected Asset is conveyed to Buyer at Closing, and the Preferential Right is
exercised after Closing, then Buyer shall convey the affected Asset(s) to such
party, and shall receive the consideration for such affected Asset(s) directly
from such party and Buyer shall be entitled to (1) receive from Seller the
difference between the Allocated Value of such Assets (as adjusted) paid to
Seller by Buyer and the amount paid by the holder of such Preferential Right
and (2) all out of pocket costs or expenses that Buyer reasonably incurs as a
result of such conveyance.

(e) _Remedies_. The remedies set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ are the
exclusive remedies for the Preferential Rights and consents (including
Required Consents).

ARTICLE VI

 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

 

Section 6.1 _Environmental Procedures_.

 

(a) Buyer will have from the Execution Date until the Environmental Defect
Notice Date (as defined in  _Section_ __ _ 6.4_) to conduct an Environmental
Inspection of the Assets. Should Buyer elect to conduct such Environmental
Inspection, Buyer will employ a Third Party environmental consultant selected
by Buyer and approved by Seller (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed and _provided_ that Seller consents in
advance to the Buyers employment of Ramboll Environ U.S. Corporation and any
of its subcontractors) (the " _Environmental Consultant_ ") to determine the
existence of any Environmental Defects (as defined in _Section_ __ _ 6.4_)
and the Remediation Costs (as defined in _Section_ __ _ 6.4_), if any,
associated therewith.

(b) If the Environmental Consultant identifies, and Buyer claims, one or more
Environmental Defects in the course of its Environmental Inspection or
otherwise, Buyer may, on or before the Environmental Defect Notice Date,
deliver to Seller one or more Environmental Defect Notices (as defined in
_Section_ __ _ 6.4_). Buyer must deliver Environmental Defect Notices by the
Environmental Defect Notice Date. An Environmental Defect Notice must (1) be
in writing and received on or before the Environmental Defect Notice Date, (2)
name the affected Asset, (3) describe in reasonable detail the condition in,
on or under the Asset that constitutes, causes, or contributes to the
Environmental Defect, including to the extent known the approximate date the
Environmental Defect commenced, (4) to the extent available, provide factual
substantiation for the Environmental Defect, (5) state the estimated
Remediation Cost, and (6) contain the Environmental Consultants good faith
written estimates of the 

 



-35-  Remediation Costs which must describe in reasonable detail the Remediation
proposed for the alleged Environmental Defect and identify all material
assumptions used by the Environmental Consultant to support the Remediation
Costs. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, "factual substantiation for
the Environmental Defect" shall include any non-privileged reports prepared
by, or the basis of tests performed by, the Environmental Consultant with
regards to the Environmental Defect. To give Seller an opportunity to commence
reviewing and curing Environmental Defects, Buyer agrees to use reasonable
efforts to give Seller, on or before the end of each calendar week prior to
the Environmental Defect Notice Date, written notice of all alleged
Environmental Defects discovered by Buyer during the preceding calendar week,
which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the
expiration of the Environmental Defect Notice Date, _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall Buyers failure to deliver such preliminary notice be
deemed a waiver of any remedies or adjustments for Environmental
Defects available to Buyer pursuant to this _Article VI_. Seller has the
right, but not the obligation, to cure any claimed Environmental Defect on or
before the Closing Date.

 

(c) _Environmental Defect Treatment_.

 

(i) _Remedies_. If Buyer delivers a valid Environmental Defect Notice to
Seller, and the Remediation Costs, in the aggregate, exceed the Environmental
Deductible (as defined in _Section_ __ _ 6.4_), Seller shall elect one of the
following options with respect to each Environmental Defect so identified: (1)
contest any asserted Environmental Defect and/or Buyers good faith estimate
of the Remediation Cost in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.2_; or (2) adjust
the Purchase Price by an amount equal to Buyers estimate of the Remediation
Cost in excess of the Environmental Deductible. In addition, the Parties may
mutually agree to require Seller to indemnify Buyer and the Buyer Indemnified
Parties against any Losses attributable to or resulting from the relevant
Environmental Defect, which indemnity shall be in the form of (and shall be
for the period of time as set forth in) _Schedule_ __ _ 6.1_ (the "
_Environmental Indemnity_ "). For avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall not be
entitled to any of the foregoing remedies for any Environmental Defects
unless the Remediation Costs for all Environmental Defects exceed the
Environmental Deductible.

 

(ii) _Purchase Price Adjustments for Environmental Defects_. If the aggregate
Remediation Costs as to all Environmental Defects set forth in all valid
Environmental Defect Notices delivered by Buyer exceed the Environmental
Deductible, and subject to each Partys right to terminate this Agreement
under _Section_ __ _ 12.1(f)_ and Sellers right to contest or dispute such
Environmental Defect or Remediation Cost under _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, the
Purchase Price will be reduced at Closing by an amount equal to the aggregate
of all undisputed Remediation Costs in excess of the Environmental
Deductible; _provided_ that there shall be no adjustment to the Purchase Price
in respect of any Environmental Defect that (A) is the subject of an
Environmental Indemnity entered into by the Parties at or prior to
the Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)(i)_, (B) is waived in writing
by Buyer prior to Closing or (C) is subject to a Disputed Environmental Matter
identified in a Rejection Notice.

 



-36- (iii) _Disputed_ _Environmental_ _Matters; Actions to be Taken at Closing_.
If Seller disputes (A) the existence of an Environmental Defect, (B) the
Remediation Costs attributable to any alleged Environmental Defect, or (C) the
adequacy of any Remediation proposed to be taken with respect to an alleged
Environmental Defect (each a " _Disputed Environmental Matter_ "), then Seller
shall notify Buyer of any such Disputed Environmental Matter in writing no
later than one (1) calendar day before Closing (" _Rejection Notice_ "),
which Rejection Notice shall state with reasonable specificity the basis for
the Disputed Environmental Matter. Any Disputed Environmental Matter shall be
resolved pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 6.2_. If Seller fails to timely deliver
a Rejection Notice, Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the validity of
the Environmental Defect and Buyers estimate of the Remediation Cost, and
shall be deemed to have waived its own option to contest the Environmental
Defect pursuant to this Section.

Section 6.2 _Disputed Environmental Matters; Actions to be taken after
Closing_. Within a reasonable time following Buyers receipt of the Rejection
Notice, representatives of Buyer and Seller knowledgeable in environmental
matters shall meet and, either (a) mutually agree to reject the particular
Environmental Defect(s) or (b) agree on the validity of such Environmental

options (a) or (b) in the preceding sentence, the Environmental Defect and/or

such arbitration judgment or award. Following such resolution and payment, if
any, the Parties shall no longer have any rights or obligations under this
_Article VI_ in respect of such Environmental Defect. If the Parties cannot
resolve any matters with respect to Environmental Defects or Remediation Costs
on or before Closing, the Closing will be delayed due to such dispute if, and
only if, either Party seeks to terminate this Agreement under _Section_ __ _

matters under _Section_ __ _ 15.7_ prior to Closing or such termination, as
applicable.

purposes all objections associated with the environmental condition of the
Assets (including Environmental Defects), unless raised in an Environmental

Seller is in compliance in all material respects with all such Permits.

 

Section 7.16 _Non-Default Leases_. Except as set forth on  _Section_ __ _
7.4_ of the Disclosure Schedule, Seller has not received any written notice

Assets in compliance with _Section_ __ _ 9.1(a)_, _(b)_ , and  _(e)_. From

maintained, the books of account and Records relating to the Assets in the
usual, regular and ordinary manner and in accordance with the
usual accounting practices of Seller; (ii) notify Buyer of any operation
proposed by a third party that is reasonably estimated to cost Seller in
excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000); and (iii) give prompt

destruction of any of the Assets, (2) written notice received or given by
Seller of any material violation of Law with respect to the Assets, or (3) any
written notice received or given by Seller alleging any tort or breach of an
Material Agreement with respect to the Assets. Without expanding any
obligations which Seller may have to Buyer, it is expressly agreed that Seller
or its Affiliates shall never have any liability to Buyer for the obligations
under this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(a)_ with respect to Sellers (or its
Affiliates) acting as an operator of an Asset greater

 



-47-  than that which it might have as the operator to a non-operator under the
applicable operating agreement (or, in the absence of such an agreement,
under the AAPL 610 (1989 Version) form Operating Agreement), IT BEING
RECOGNIZED THAT, UNDER SUCH AGREEMENTS AND SUCH FORM, THE OPERATOR IS NOT
RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS OWN NEGLIGENCE, AND HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OTHER THAN FOR
GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.

(b) _Restriction on Operations_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(a)_, unless
Seller obtains the prior written consent of Buyer to act otherwise, which
consent may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned, Seller and
its Affiliates will use commercially reasonable efforts within the constraints
of the applicable operating agreements and other applicable agreements not
to:

(i) except for Capital Projects or AFEs as described on  _Section_ __ _
7.12_ of the Disclosure Schedule, all of which are deemed to be approved,
approve or propose any operations on the Assets anticipated to cost the owner
of the Assets more than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) per activity
net to Sellers interest (excepting emergency operations required under
presently existing contractual obligations and operations necessary to avoid
material monetary penalty or forfeiture provision of any applicable contract
or order of any Governmental Authority, all of which will be deemed to be
approved, provided Seller immediately notifies Buyer of any emergency
operation or operation to avoid monetary penalty or forfeiture excepted
herein);

 

(ii) convey or dispose of any material part of the Assets (other than
replacement of obsolete equipment or sale of Hydrocarbons in the regular
course of business) or enter into any new contracts that would constitute a
Material Agreement;

(iii) enter into any new contracts with obligations in excess of thirty (30)
days;

(iv) let lapse any of Sellers insurance now in force with respect to the
Assets;

(v) modify or terminate any Material Agreement;

 

(vi) enter, or agree to enter, into any agreement that, if in existence as of
the Execution Date, would be a Material Agreement;

(vii) waive, release, assign, settle or compromise any claim, action or
proceeding relating to the Assets, other than waivers, releases, assignments,
settlements or compromises that involve only the payment of monetary damages
not in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) individually or in
the aggregate (excluding amounts to be paid under insurance policies);

 



-48- (viii) increase the base salary, compensation or benefits payable (other than
year-end salary increases in the ordinary course of business and the payment
of bonuses consistent with past practices), grant any severance, retention or
change in control benefits to any Asset Workers ( _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not prevent Seller from creating a severance plan for the
benefit of, or otherwise granting severance to, any Asset Worker that is not
offered employment by Buyer), establish any Benefit Plan or amend, modify or
terminate any employee Benefit Plan (other than any amendments required by
applicable law or with respect to general amendment to any broad based
employee Benefit Plan in the ordinary course of business) or, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, enter into any CBA or other labor contact
applicable to the Assets or any Asset Workers or recognize or certify any
labor union, labor organization or group of Asset Workers as the bargaining
representative for Asset Workers;

 

(ix) abandon any Asset;

 

(x) make any election (or fail to make an election, the result of which is) to
go non-consent with respect to any of the Assets, unless Buyer fails to
provide consent under clause (i); use commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain in full force and effect each Lease, and timely and properly pay all
Lease renewals and extensions that become due after the date of this Agreement
but prior to Closing in accordance with the terms of the applicable Lease (
_provided_ that in no event shall Seller be required to drill a
well, excluding the Charging Eagle Well); or

(xi) fail to pay (or cause to be paid) any and all Asset Taxes that could
result in a Lien (other than a Permitted Encumbrance) with respect to the
Assets that become due and payable prior to the Closing Date.

 

(c) _Successor Operator_. While Buyer acknowledges that it desires to succeed
Seller as operator of those Assets or portions thereof that Seller may
presently operate, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller cannot and does
not covenant or warrant that Buyer shall become successor operator of such
Assets because the Assets or portions thereof may be subject to operating or
other agreements that control the appointment of a successor operator. Seller
agrees, however, that as to the Assets any Seller Party operates, Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to support Buyers efforts to
become successor operator of such Assets (to the extent permitted under any
applicable operating agreement) effective as of the Closing (at Buyers sole
cost and expense) and to designate or appoint, to the extent legally possible
and permitted under any applicable operating agreement, Buyer as successor
operator of such Assets effective as of Closing. Seller will use commercially
reasonable efforts at Buyers expense to assist Buyer to obtain all necessary
Permits in connection with Buyers designation as operator as to the Assets
Seller presently operates as of Closing.

(d) _Affiliate Contracts_. Seller will terminate or cause its respective
Affiliates to terminate, effective as of the Effective Time, any contracts or
agreements between Seller and its Affiliates insofar and only insofar as such
contracts or agreements relate to or bind the Assets.

 



-49- (e) _Seller Insurance_. Seller shall maintain in force during the period from
the Execution Date until the Closing, the coverages provided in _Schedule_ __
_ 9.1(e)_ (the " _Required Insurance Coverages_ "). Such insurance policies
shall, to the extent of the indemnity obligations expressly assumed by Seller
under this Agreement, provide (i) waivers of all rights of subrogation against
the Buyer Indemnified Parties and their insurers, (ii) name the Buyer
Indemnified Parties as additional insureds (except for Workers Compensation,
OEE/COW, Pollution Liability, and First Party Property/Inland Marine policies)
and (iii) be primary and non-contributory to any insurance maintained by the
Buyer Indemnified Parties. Upon Buyers request, Seller shall provide
certificates of insurance that evidence the insurance coverages required under
this Agreement.

 

Section 9.2 _Covenants and Agreements of Buyer_. Buyer covenants and agrees
with Seller as follows:

 

(a) _Entity Status_. Buyer shall maintain its limited liability company status
from the date hereof until the Closing Date and the Final Settlement Date,
and use all reasonable efforts to assure that as of the Closing Date and the
Final Settlement Date it will not be under any material legal or contractual
restriction that would prohibit or delay the timely consummation of the
Transaction.

(b) _Replacement Bonds and Instruments_. At Closing, Buyer shall provide
replacement instruments for each bond or similar contingent obligation given
by Seller securing its, or its contract operators, obligations relating to
the Assets, set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 9.2(b)_ (collectively, the "
_Instruments_ "). As soon as practical after Closing, Buyer (with reasonable
assistance of Seller as requested by Buyer) shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the release of the Assets and/or Seller from
the Instruments.

(c) _Change of Name_. Buyer undertakes and agrees that promptly after the
Closing (but no later than the date that is six (6) months after the Closing
Date), it will take all actions necessary to delete the use of the name
"Whiting" and/or any derivative thereof with respect to any of the Assets.

 

(d) _Buyer Insurance_. After Closing, Buyer shall maintain the coverages
listed in clause ( _i)_  _(iv)_  of _Schedule_ __ _ 9.1(e)_. Such insurance
policies shall, to the extent of the indemnity obligations expressly assumed

subrogation against the Seller Indemnified Parties and their insurers, (ii)
name the Seller Indemnified Parties as additional insureds (except for
Workers Compensation), and (iii) be primary and non-contributory to
any insurance maintained by the Seller Indemnified Parties. Upon Sellers
request, Buyer shall provide certificates of insurance that evidence the
insurance coverages required under this Agreement.

 



-50- Section 9.3 _Covenants and Agreements of the Parties_. The Parties covenant
and agree as follows:

(a) _Confidentiality_. If the Transaction closes on the Closing Date or such
later date as agreed to by the Parties, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
9.3_ supersede and replace the terms and conditions of that certain
Confidentiality Agreement dated October 19, 2016 between WOGC and Buyer
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). All data and information, whether
written, electronic or oral, obtained from Seller in connection with the
Transaction, including the Records, whether obtained by Buyer before or after
the Execution Date and data and information generated by Buyer in connection
with the Transaction (collectively, the " _Information_ "), is deemed by the
Parties to be confidential and proprietary to Seller until the Closing.
Until the Closing, except as required by Laws or stock exchange rule or
regulation, Buyer and its officers, agents and representatives will hold in
strict confidence all Information, except any Information which: (i) at the
time of disclosure to Buyer by Seller is in the public domain; (ii) after
disclosure to Buyer by Seller becomes part of the public domain by publication
or otherwise, except by breach of this commitment by Buyer; (iii) was
rightfully in Buyers possession at the time of disclosure to Buyer by
Seller; (iv) Buyer rightfully receives from third parties free of any
obligation of confidence; (v) is developed independently by Buyer without the

all Information, except any Information which: (1) at the time of disclosure
to Seller by Buyer is in the public domain; (2) after disclosure to Seller by
Buyer becomes part of the public domain by publication or otherwise, except
by breach of this commitment by Seller; (3) Seller rightfully receives from
Third Parties free of any obligation of confidence; or (4) is developed
independently by any Seller without the Information. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer may disclose any Information to Buyers Affiliates,
partners, consultants, contractors, advisors (including, without limitation,
legal, financial and accounting advisors), current or potential debt and
equity financing sources, and representatives of any of the foregoing in
connection with the Transaction to the extent such individuals agree to be
bound to the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_.

 

(b) _Return of Information_. If the Transaction does not close on the
Scheduled Closing Date, or such later date as agreed to by the Parties, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect pursuant to the provisions
thereof, including Paragraph 8 of the Confidentiality Agreement regarding
recovery of the Information in possession of the parties thereto
obtained pursuant to any provision of this Agreement, which Information is at
the time of termination required to be held in confidence pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_. The terms of _Sections_ __ _ 9.3(a)_,  _9.3(b)_ and
_9.3(c)_ shall survive termination of this Agreement.

(c) _Injunctive Relief_. Buyer agrees that Seller may not have an adequate
remedy at Law if Buyer violates any of the terms of _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_
and/or _9.3(b)_. In such event, Seller will have the right, in addition to any
other it may have, to obtain injunctive relief to restrain any breach or
threaten breach of the terms of _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_ and/or _9.3(b)_ , or
to obtain specific enforcement of such terms. Seller agrees that Buyer may not
have an adequate remedy at Law if Seller violates any of the terms of
_Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_. In such event, Buyer will have the right, in addition
to any other it may have, to obtain injunctive relief to restrain any breach
or threaten breach of the terms of _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_, or to obtain
specific enforcement of such terms.

 



-51- (d) _Cure Period for Breach_. Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 9.3(e)_, if any
Party believes any other Party has breached the terms of this Agreement, the
Party who believes the breach has occurred shall give written notice to the
breaching Party of the nature of the breach and give the breaching Party 48
hours to cure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section_ __ _ 9.3(d)_
shall not apply to breach of the Parties obligations at Closing and shall not
operate to delay Closing. Failure to provide such notification shall in no
way serve to modify any of the other rights and obligations of the Parties
under this Agreement.

 

(e) _Notice of Breach_. If either Seller or Buyer has knowledge that the other
Party breached a representation or warranty under this Agreement that Party
shall promptly inform the other Party of such breach so that it may attempt to
remedy or cure such breach prior to Closing.

 

(f) _Governmental Reviews_. Seller and Buyer shall (and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to) use commercially reasonable efforts to make, in a
timely manner, all other required filings (if any) with, prepare applications
to, and conduct negotiations with Governmental Authorities as required to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party shall,
to the extent permitted pursuant to applicable Law, reasonably cooperate with
and use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the other with respect to
such filings, applications and negotiations. Buyer shall bear the cost of
all filing or application fees payable to any Governmental Authority with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, regardless of
whether Buyer, Seller, or any Affiliate of any of them is required to make the
payment.

 

Section 9.4 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Beginning on the day that is five (5) Business Days following the
Execution Date, Seller shall make available to Buyer during normal business
hours on reasonable advance notice all of the Asset Workers to discuss
potential employment with Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer on or after the
Closing Date as provided below (such entity that makes any employment
offers pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)_ is herein referred to as the
" _Buyer Employer_ "). Buyer shall provide Seller, in writing, not later than
sixty (60) days following the Execution Date, a list of those Asset Workers
to whom a Buyer Employer intends to make offers of employment (collectively,
the " _Designated Employees_ "). The date as of which employment with a Buyer
Employer is to begin in accordance with such offers shall be as of the
termination of the TSA. The Buyer Employers determination as to which Asset
Workers shall be Designated Employees shall be within the sole discretion of
the Buyer Employer; _provided_ , _however_ , that its election and
determination shall be made in accordance with all Laws; _provided_ ,
_further_ , each employment offer shall be for a position with Buyer or one of
its Affiliates that provides an aggregate remuneration opportunity (taking
into account the employees base salary, overtime pay and shift rate
differential) that is substantially comparable to the aggregate base salary or
base wages (but excluding annual incentive opportunities,

 



-52-  employee benefits, equity compensation, defined benefit plan benefits and
retiree health and life insurance coverage) provided to such employee by
Seller and its Affiliates. Those Designated Employees who accept the Buyer
Employers employment offers and become active employees of the Buyer Employer
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.4_ are referred to herein as the "
_Transferred Employees_." Seller will pay each Transferred Employee the
remaining balance of such Transferred Employees earned and unused vacation or
paid time off accrued as of the termination of the TSA. All Asset Workers that
do not become Transferred Employees shall remain employees of Seller, unless
terminated by Seller.

(b) On the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Buyer with a list of: (i) the
site(s) of employment of the Assets; (ii) the number of Seller employees at
each site of employment; and (iii) as applicable, the names or identification
numbers for all Seller employees at such sites of employment who have
experienced, or will experience, an employment loss or layoff as defined by
the WARN Act within ninety (90) days prior to the Closing Date. Seller shall
update this list for any terminations of employment from the Closing Date
through the termination of the TSA.

(c) Effective as of the termination of the TSA, Seller shall take all actions
necessary so that each Transferred Employee shall cease active participation
and benefit accrual under each Seller Plan. Except as set forth in the TSA,
Seller or Sellers Affiliates, as applicable, shall retain all liabilities and
obligation under any Seller Plan and, for the avoidance of doubt, such
liabilities and obligations shall be "Retained Liabilities."

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 9.4_ are solely for the benefit of
the Parties and nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 9.4_, express or implied,
shall confer upon any Asset Worker, or legal representative or beneficiary
thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or
continued employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of
any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section_
__ _ 9.4_, express or implied, shall be (i) deemed an amendment of any Seller
Plan, or (ii) construed to prevent or limit Seller or any of its Affiliates
or Buyer or any of its Affiliates from terminating or modifying to any extent
or in any respect any Seller Plan or any other Benefit Plan that Buyer or any
of its Affiliates may establish or maintain. 

Section 9.5 _Vehicles_.

 

(a) At or promptly following the Closing, to the extent permitted under the
applicable contractual and/or leasehold arrangements, Seller or its Affiliate
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to transfer and assign to Buyer
the vehicles used or held primarily in the operation of the Assets ("
_Vehicles_ ") which are leased by Third Parties to Seller or its Affiliate as
of the Closing Date. To the extent allowed under the applicable contractual
and/or leasehold arrangements, Buyer shall assume the existing leases with
respect to such Vehicles and upon such assignment and assumption and consent
by the applicable lessor(s) Buyer shall pay to Seller any remaining positive
equity values in such Vehicles. If the parties are unable to enter into an
assignment and assumption of any such leased Vehicles, then any such Vehicles
shall be excluded from the transaction.

 



-53- (b) At or promptly following the Closing, Seller or its Affiliate shall
execute and deliver to Buyer title transfer forms transferring title to the
owned Vehicles, if any, to Buyer, duly executed by Seller or its Affiliate.
Any taxes or fees incurred as result of the transfer of the vehicles pursuant
to this  _Section_ __ _ 9.5_ shall be paid by Buyer.

Section 9.6 _Hedging_.

 

(a) At any one time prior to Closing, Buyer may deliver a single written
notice to Seller requesting Seller to enter into the hedging transactions
described on _Schedule_ __ _ 9.6_ (collectively, the " _Hedging Transactions_
"), and upon receipt of any such notice on a Business Day during normal
business hours, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly
enter into the requested Hedging Transactions for the benefit and liability of
Buyer with the counterparties identified in such schedule (collectively, the "
_Counterparties_ ").

 

(b) At the Closing, (i) Seller shall assign to and novate in favor of Buyer
all of the trades that are the subject of the Hedging Transactions entered
into by Seller for Buyer pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ __ and Buyer
shall accept such assignment and novation from Seller and assume all
obligations and liabilities attributable thereto pursuant to all
documentation required by the applicable Hedging Counterparties and (ii) if
such trades are assigned to and novated in favor of Buyer at Closing pursuant
to the immediately preceding clause, Seller and Buyer shall deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release the Hedge Deposit
to Seller, and the Hedge Deposit shall be credited to the Purchase Price at
Closing.

 

(c) Within five (5) Business Days after any termination of this Agreement
under _Section_ __ _ 12.1_ (other than a termination under _Section_ __ _
12.1(e)_), Seller shall furnish to Buyer written notice of whether Seller
elects, in its sole discretion, to unwind one or more of the Hedging
Transactions. If Seller notifies Buyer that it does not elect to unwind one
or more of the Hedging Transactions, Buyer shall have no further obligations
to Seller or to the Counterparties with respect to the Hedging Transactions
that Seller does not elect to unwind. If this Agreement is terminated under
_Section_ __ _ 12.1_ (other than a termination under _Section_ __ _
12.1(e)_) and Seller notifies Buyer within five (5) Business Days after such
termination that it elects to unwind one or more of the Hedging Transactions,
Buyer shall be obligated for and shall promptly pay, and shall indemnify,
defend, and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against, any
and all Seller Hedge Losses.

 

(d) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.1(e)_,
Buyer shall have no further obligations to Seller or to the Counterparties
with respect to the Hedging Transactions.

(e) If Seller is entitled to receive payment from Buyer pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 9.6(c)_, (i) Seller shall be entitled to retain the Deposit to the
extent of the Seller Hedge Losses and, unless Seller is otherwise entitled to
retain the full amount of the Deposit under _Section_ __ _ 12.2(a)_, shall
return to Buyer the remaining balance of the Deposit, if any, after deducting
the Seller Hedge Losses, and (ii) if the Seller Hedge Losses exceed the 

 



-54-  amount of the Deposit, the Parties shall within two (2) Business Days of the
termination of this Agreement under _Section_ __ _ 12.1_ (other than a
termination under  _Section_ __ _ 12.1(e)_), execute and deliver to the
Escrow Agent a joint instruction letter directing the Escrow Agent to release
(A) to Seller an amount from the Hedge Deposit equal to the Seller Hedge
Losses in excess of the Deposit retained by Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.6(e)(i)_ in order to satisfy all or a portion of Buyers obligation to pay
the Seller Hedge Losses and (B) to Buyer the remaining balance of the Hedge
Deposit, if any, after deducting the amount distributed to Seller pursuant to
the immediately preceding _clause_ __ _ (A)_. In the event that the Deposit
retained by Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.6(e)(i)_ together with the
Hedge Deposit is not sufficient to satisfy the Seller Hedge Losses, Buyer
shall promptly pay Seller such shortfall. If Buyer or Seller terminates this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.1_ other than in the circumstances
described in _Section_ __ _ 12.1(e)_, and Seller does not elect to unwind any
Hedge Transaction or suffer any Seller Hedge Losses that exceed the Deposit,
then the Parties shall execute joint instructions directing the Escrow Agent
to release the Hedge Deposit to Buyer.

Section 9.7 _Financing_.

 

(a) _Buyer_ __ _s Efforts_. To the extent necessary in order for Buyer to pay
the Closing Amount at Closing, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing on terms and conditions
acceptable to Buyer in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the consummation by Buyer of any financing, including a Debt Financing, is not
a condition precedent to Buyers obligation to pay the Closing Amount or
satisfy any of its other obligations under this Agreement, nor shall the
completion of any Debt Financing result in a delay of the Closing beyond the
Scheduled Closing Date.

(b)  _Assistance with Financing_. At Buyers sole expense, Seller shall
provide, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
Affiliates and its and its Affiliates Representatives to provide, Buyer such
cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Buyer with respect to the Debt
Financing; _provided_ , that such requested cooperation does not materially
and adversely interfere with operations of Seller and the Assets and that any
information requested by Buyer is reasonably available to Seller or any of
its Affiliates or its or their Representatives. Such cooperation shall include
using commercially reasonable efforts (i) to assist Buyer in reviewing the
disclosure schedules prepared by Buyer related to the Assets in connection
with the Debt Financing and (ii) to facilitate Buyers preparation of the
documentation necessary to pledge and mortgage the Assets that will be
collateral under the Debt Financing; _provided_ that Sellers obligations
under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) shall be limited to providing
information and data in its current format in Sellers records and not require
that Seller generate new reports regarding the Assets. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 9.7_, no action shall be
required of Seller or its Affiliates pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.7_, if
any such action would: (A) unreasonably disrupt or interfere with the
business or ongoing operations of Seller, its Affiliates or the Assets; (B)
cause any representation or warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement
to be breached, or require Seller to waive or amend any terms of this
Agreement; (C) involve the entry by Seller or its Affiliates into

 



-55-  any agreement with respect to any financing arrangement that is operative
prior to the Closing; (D) conflict with or violate any Law or subject Seller
or its Affiliates to any liability; (E) require Seller or its Affiliates or
any of its or their Representatives to provide (or to have provided on its
behalf) any certificates or legal opinions; (F) require Seller or its
Affiliates to pay any commitment or other fee prior to the Closing Date for
which it has not received prior reimbursement; (G) require Seller or its
Affiliates or their respective Representatives to prepare pro forma financial
information or projections; or (H) cause any director, officer, or employee
of Seller or its Affiliates to execute any agreement or certificate in his or
her individual, rather than official, capacity.

 

(c) _Costs and Expenses_. Buyer shall promptly, upon request by Seller,
reimburse Seller for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys and accountants fees) incurred by
Seller in connection with its cooperation contemplated by this _Section_ __ _
9.7_. In addition, Buyer shall pay to Seller an hourly rate of $200 for all
work performed by employees or contractors of Seller of its Affiliates in
connection with Sellers performance of its obligations under this _Section_
__ _ 9.7_. All of the information provided by Seller pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 9.7_ is given without any representation or warranty, express
or implied. Except in the case of actual fraud, in no event will Seller or
its Affiliates or Representatives have any liability of any kind or nature to
Buyer, its Financing Sources or any other Person arising or resulting from the
cooperation provided in this  _Section_ __ _ 9.7_ or any use of any
information provided by Seller or its Affiliates or Representatives provided
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.7_. Without affecting Buyers rights under
this Agreement, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnified Parties from and against any and all damages suffered or incurred
by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and
any information provided by Seller to Buyer pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
9.7_; _provided, however,_ that Buyer shall not be required to indemnify and
hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties to the extent that such damages
arise from or are related to actual fraud, intentional misconduct or gross
negligence of any member of the Seller Indemnified Parties.

tax period (or portion thereof) ending prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
the portion of any Straddle Period ending prior to the Effective Time. Buyer
shall be allocated and bear all Asset Taxes attributable to (A) any tax period
(or portion thereof) beginning on or after the Effective Time and (B) the
portion of any Straddle Period beginning on the Effective Time.

 



-57- (b) For purposes of determining the allocations described in  _Section_ __ _
10.2(a)_, (i) Asset Taxes that are attributable to or based upon the severance
or production of Hydrocarbons shall be allocated to the period (or portion
thereof) in which the severance or production giving rise to such Asset Taxes
occurred, (ii) Asset Taxes that are based upon or related to income or
receipts or imposed on a transactional basis (other than such Asset Taxes
described in clause (i)), shall be allocated to the period (or
portion thereof) in which the transaction giving rise to such Asset Taxes
occurred, and (iii) Asset Taxes that are ad valorem, property or similar Asset
Taxes imposed on a periodic basis pertaining to a Straddle Period shall be
allocated between the portion of such Straddle Period ending prior to the
Effective Time and the portion of such Straddle Period beginning on or after
the Effective Time by prorating each such Asset Tax based on the number of
days in the applicable Straddle Period that occur before the day on which the
Effective Time occurs, on the one hand, and the number of days in such
Straddle Period that occur on and after the day on which the Effective Time
occurs, on the other hand. For purposes of clause (iii) of the preceding
sentence, the period for such Asset Taxes shall begin on the date on which
ownership of the applicable Assets gives rise to liability for the particular
Asset Tax and shall end on the day before the next such date.

 

Section 10.3 _Calculation of Adjustments for Asset Tax Liabilities_.
Consistent with _Section_ __ _ 10.2_, and based on the best current
information available as of Closing or the time the Final Settlement Statement
is finalized, as applicable, the proration of applicable Asset Taxes shall be
made between the Parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.4_ and thereafter further adjusted, as applicable, pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 14.1_. If estimates are used for purposes of adjusting the
Purchase Price for an Asset Tax pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.4_ and
_Section_ __ _ 14.1_, upon the later determination of the actual amount of
such Asset Tax, timely payments will be made from Seller to Buyer or from
Buyer to Seller, as applicable, to the extent necessary to cause each of
Sellers and Buyer to bear the amount of such Asset Tax that is allocable to it
under _Section_ __ _ 10.2_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary,  _Section_ __ _ 15.3_ shall not apply with respect to Asset
Taxes, and Asset Taxes shall not be treated as Property Costs for purposes of
_Section_ __ _ 15.3_.

 

Section 10.4 _Tax Reports and Returns; Cooperation_.

 

(a) For the tax period in which the Effective Time occurs, Seller agrees to
immediately forward to Buyer any such tax reports and returns received by
Seller after Closing and provide Buyer with appropriate information in
Sellers possession which is necessary for Buyer to file any required tax
reports and returns related to the Assets. Buyer agrees to file all
Tax Returns and reports for Asset Taxes applicable to the Assets that are
required to be filed after the Closing, and pay all required Asset Taxes
payable with respect to the Assets. If Seller has withheld any monies from
third parties for Taxes with respect to the Assets, Seller shall remit such
monies to Buyer upon the earlier of five days prior to the due date of any
such remittance or within three months of Closing, and Buyer shall then assume
the responsibility and liability for the payment of such Taxes for and on
behalf of such third parties solely up to the amount of monies received by
Buyer from Seller with respect to such Taxes.

 



-58- (b) The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
and any action with respect to Taxes relating to the Assets. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon another Partys request) the provision
of records and information that are relevant to any such Tax Return or action
and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided under this
Agreement. Seller and Buyer agree to retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Assets relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of
limitations of the respective taxable periods and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority.

Section 10.5 _Transfer Taxes_. Buyer shall be liable for, and shall indemnify
Seller for, any sales and use taxes, conveyance, transfer and recording fees
and mortgage stamps, real estate transfer taxes or stamps or similar Taxes
(excluding for the avoidance of doubt Income Taxes) that may be imposed on
the transfer of the Assets pursuant to this Agreement (" _Transfer Taxes_ ").
However, if required by Laws, Buyer shall, in accordance with Laws, calculate
and Seller will remit any Transfer Taxes that are required to be paid as a
result of the transfer of the Assets to Buyer and Buyer shall promptly
reimburse Seller therefor. If Seller receives notice that any Transfer Taxes
are due, Seller shall promptly forward such notice to Buyer for handling or,
if necessary, Buyer shall remit such Transfer Taxes, along with applicable
penalties and interest, to Seller. Buyer shall timely remit all Transfer Taxes
along with applicable penalties and interest to the appropriate Governmental
Authority or to Seller as applicable. Buyer and Seller shall reasonably
cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the extent permissible under Laws, the
amount of any Transfer Taxes. To the extent the Governmental Authority does
not agree and assesses sales or use tax on the Buyer or Seller for the
purchase/sale of the Assets, Buyer shall be responsible for payment of such
sales/use taxes along with penalties and interest either directly to the
Governmental Authority if Buyer is assessed by the Governmental Authority or
to Seller if Seller is assessed by the Governmental Authority.

Section 10.6 _Income Taxes_. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement
to the contrary, no adjustments pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.4_ or _Section_
__ _ 14.1_ shall be made to the Purchase Price with respect to Income Taxes.

 

Section 10.7 _Purchase Price Allocation_. By the date that is thirty (30) days
after the determination of the Final Settlement Statement in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 14.1(a)_, Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to agree, for the purpose of making the requisite filings under
Section 1060 of the Code, and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder, to an allocation of the the Purchase Price and any items that are
treated as consideration for U.S. federal income tax purposes among the
Assets, and to the extent permitted by law, such allocation shall be in a
manner consistent with the Allocated Values, as set forth on _Exhibit B-1_. If
Buyer and Seller agree to such an allocation, Seller and Buyer each agree to
report, and to cause their respective Affiliates to report, the U.S. federal,
state, and local income and other tax consequences of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with

 



-59-  such allocation, as revised to take into account any subsequent adjustments
to the Purchase Price, and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith
except as required by applicable Law;  _provided, however_ , nothing in this
Agreement shall prevent Buyer or Seller from settling any proposed deficiency
or adjustment by any Governmental Authority based upon or arising out of such
allocation and neither Buyer nor Seller shall be required to litigate before
any court with respect to any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any
Governmental Authority challenging the allocation.

Section 14.1 _Post-Closing Adjustments_ _._

 

(a) _Final Settlement Statement_. As soon as practicable after the Closing,
but in no event later than ninety (90) days after the Termination Date (as
defined in the TSA) of the TSA, Seller will prepare and deliver to Buyer, in
accordance with customary industry accounting practices, a settlement
statement (the " _Final Settlement Statement_ ") setting forth each
adjustment or payment pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.4_ that was not finally
determined as of the Closing and showing the calculation of such adjustment
and the resulting final purchase price (the " _Final Purchase Price_ "). As
soon as practicable after receipt of the Final Settlement Statement, but in no
event later than thirty (30) days after receipt of Sellers proposed Final
Settlement Statement, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a written report
containing any changes that Buyer proposes to make to the Final Settlement
Statement. Buyers failure to deliver to Seller a written report detailing
proposed changes to the Final Settlement Statement by that date shall be
deemed an acceptance by Buyer of the Final Settlement Statement as submitted
by Seller. The Parties shall attempt to agree with respect to the changes
proposed by Buyer, if any, no later than thirty (30) days after receipt by
Seller of Buyers proposed changes. The date upon which such agreement is
reached or upon which the Final Purchase Price is established pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 15.7_, shall be herein called the " _Final Settlement Date_."
If the Final Purchase Price is more than the Closing Amount, Buyer shall pay
Seller the amount of such difference. If the Final Purchase Price is less than
the Closing Amount, Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of such difference.
Any payment by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds within five (5) Business Days of the
Final Settlement Date. Any adjustments requiring additional payment by either
Buyer or Seller shall also be made in the same manner.

(b) _Dispute Resolution_. If the Parties are unable to resolve a dispute as

arbitration to be conducted pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 15.7_.

Section 14.2 _Records_. Seller shall deliver the Records to Buyer as soon
as practicable but in no event later than five (5) days after the Closing
Date except to the extent such Records are utilized by Seller in providing
services pursuant to the TSA which in such case Seller shall deliver such
Records to Buyer as soon as practicable but in no event later than ten (10)
days after the termination of the last services under the TSA. Seller may
retain copies of the Records, and Seller shall have the right to review and
copy the Records, during standard business hours and at such Sellers expense
upon reasonable notice for so long as Buyer retains the Records. Buyer agrees

_Retained Liabilities_ ").

 

Section 15.3 _Invoices For Property Costs and Proceeds Received After the
Final Settlement Date_. After the Final Settlement Date, those proceeds
attributable to the Assets received by a Party or invoices received for or
Property Costs paid by one Party for or on behalf of the other Party with

Section 15.4 _Indemnification_. After the Closing, the Parties shall indemnify
each other as follows:

 

(a) _Seller_ __ _s Indemnification of Buyer_. Seller assumes all risk,
liability, obligation and Losses in connection with, and shall defend,
indemnify, and save and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and
against all Losses which arise from or in connection with (i) the Retained
Liabilities, (ii) any matter for which Seller has agreed to indemnify Buyer
under this Agreement, (iii) any breach by Seller of any covenant or obligation
under this Agreement, and (iv) Sellers breach of its representations and
warranties in this Agreement.

 

(b) _Buyer_ __ _s Indemnification of Seller_. Buyer assumes all risk,
liability, obligation and Losses in connection with, and shall defend,
indemnify, and save and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and
against all Losses which arise from or in connection with (i) the Assumed
Liabilities, (ii) any matter for which Buyer has agreed to indemnify Seller
under this Agreement, (iii) any breach by Buyer of any covenant or obligation
under this Agreement, and (iv) Buyers breach of its representations and
warranties in this Agreement.

 

(c) _Release_. Buyer shall be deemed to have released Seller at the Closing
from any Losses for which Buyer has agreed to indemnify Seller hereunder, and
Seller shall be deemed to have released Buyer at the Closing from any Losses
for which Seller has agreed to indemnify Buyer hereunder.

 

(d) _Losses_. The term " _Losses_ " or, in the singular, " _Loss_ ," means any
and all, direct or indirect, demands, claims, notices of violations, notices
of probable violations, filings, investigations, administrative proceedings,
actions, causes of action, suits, other legal proceedings, judgments,
assessments, damages, deficiencies, taxes, penalties, fines, obligations,

legal theory), including penalties and 

 



-70-  interest on any amount payable as a result of any of the foregoing, any
legal or other costs and expenses incurred in connection with investigating or
defending any of the foregoing, and all amounts paid in settlement of any of
the foregoing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the term
"Losses" specifically includes any and all Losses arising from, attributable
to, or incurred in connection with any (i) breach of contract, (ii) loss or
damage to property, injury to, or death of Persons, and other tortious injury,
and (iii) violations of applicable Laws, including Environmental Laws, and any
other legal right or duty actionable at law or equity.

Section 15.5 _Limitation on Seller_ __ _s Indemnity Obligations_.

 

(a) _Time_. Sellers indemnity obligations under this Agreement for breaches
of Sellers representations and warranties under this Agreement shall only
extend to Losses for which claims notices are received by Seller on or before
the expiration of any applicable survival period for such representations and
warranties. Subject to any claims of Buyer under the Special Warranty of
Title in the Conveyance, and without limiting Buyers right to assert Title
Defects and Environmental Defects by the Title Defect Date or Environmental
Defect Notice Date, as applicable, under _Article V_ and  _Article VI_ ,
respectively, Buyers and Sellers sole and exclusive remedy following Closing
for any Claim or Loss relating to or arising from this Agreement shall be the
indemnity provided in _Section_ __ _ 15.4(a)_ and _15.4(b)_ , respectively.
Subject to any Title Indemnity entered into pursuant to _Article V_ , any
Environmental Indemnity entered into pursuant to _Article VI_ , and the
indemnity for Retained Liabilities set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 15.4(a)(i)_
Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify Buyer under this Agreement for,
and Buyer releases Seller from, all indemnity claims not properly and timely
raised as set forth herein, including all environmental matters which if
asserted could have constituted Environmental Defects.

(b) _Thresholds, Deductibles._  Except with respect to the Fundamental
Representations, if the Closing occurs, Seller shall not have any liability
for any indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 15.4(a)(iv)_: (i) for any Losses
with respect to any occurrence, claim, award or judgment that do not
individually exceed Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000) net to Sellers
interest (the " _Individual Claim Threshold_ "); and (ii) unless and until the
aggregate Losses for which claim notices for claims meeting the Individual
Claim Threshold are delivered by Buyer exceed four percent (4%) of the
unadjusted Purchase Price (the " _Indemnity Deductible_ "), and then only to
the extent such Losses exceed four percent (4%) of the unadjusted Purchase
Price. In addition, except for Fundamental Representations, Sellers indemnity
obligations under _Section_ __ _ 15.4(a)(iv)_ shall be limited to an amount
equal to five percent (5%) of the unadjusted Purchase Price (the " _Indemnity
Cap_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, the Individual Claim Threshold, Indemnity
Deductible and Indemnity Cap described in this _Section_ __ _ 15.5(b)_ shall
not apply to any claims or Losses arising out of (1) Sellers breach of
Fundamental Representations, (2) Sellers breach of any of its covenants under
this Agreement, (3) Sellers breach of the Special Warranty of Title in the
Conveyance, and (4) the Retained Liabilities.

 



-71- (c) _Qualifiers_. For the purposes of determining the amount of Losses
for which any Party is obligated to indemnify, or for which any of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties, as applicable, is
entitled to indemnity, under _Section_ __ _ 15.4(a)(iv)_ or  _Section_ __ _
15.4(b)(iv)_ (but not for the purposes of determining whether a representation
or warranty has been breached), qualifiers as to materiality or Material
Adverse Effect set forth in each representation or warranty herein shall be
disregarded.

(d) _Special Warranty of Title_. With respect to Sellers Special Warranty of
Title in the Conveyance, Sellers indemnity obligation shall be limited to
the Allocated Value of the particular Asset.

 

Section 15.6 _Procedure_. The indemnifications contained in _Section_ __ _
15.6_ shall be implemented as follows:

(a) _Coverage_. Such indemnity shall extend to all Losses suffered or incurred
by the indemnified Person. 

(b) _Claim Notice_. The Party seeking indemnification under the terms of this
Agreement (" _Indemnified Party_ ") shall submit a written " _Claim Notice_ "
to the other Party (" _Indemnifying Party_ ") which, to be effective, must
state: (1) the amount of each payment claimed by an Indemnified Party to be
owing, to the extent such information is available, (2) the basis for such
claim, with supporting documentation, if available, and (3) a list identifying
to the extent reasonably possible each separate item of Loss for
which payment is so claimed. The amount claimed shall be paid by the
Indemnifying Party to the extent required herein within thirty (30) days after
receipt of the Claim Notice, or after the amount of such payment has been
finally established, whichever last occurs.

(c) _Information_. Within sixty (60) days after the Indemnified Party receives
notice of a claim or legal action that may result in a Loss for which
indemnification may be sought under this Agreement (a " _Claim_ "), the
Indemnified Party shall give written notice of such Claim to the Indemnifying
Party. The failure of the Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying
Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of liability hereunder except
to the extent that the defense of such Claim is materially prejudiced by the
failure to give such notice. If the Indemnifying Party or its counsel so
requests, the Indemnified Party shall furnish, to the extent practicable, the
Indemnifying Party with copies of all pleadings and other information with
respect to such Claim. At the election of the Indemnifying Party made within
twenty (20) days after receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall
permit the Indemnifying Party to assume control of such Claim (to the extent
only that such Claim, legal action or other matter relates to a Loss
for which the Indemnifying Party is liable) so long as (1) the Indemnifying
Party gives written notice to the Indemnified Party within twenty (20) days
that it will indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such Claim, (2)
the Indemnifying Party conducts such defense diligently with counsels
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and (3) the Claim involves
only money damages and does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief
against the Indemnified Party and does not involve a claim against a
Governmental Authority or a claim alleging criminal conduct. The Indemnified
Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and
participate in the defense

 



-72-  of the Claim. The Indemnified Party is authorized, prior to and during such
20-day period, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall
deem necessary and appropriate to protect its interests or those of the
Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party, all
costs of which shall be included as Losses in respect of such claim for
indemnification. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if counsel for the
Indemnified Party reasonably determines that there is a conflict between the
positions of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in conducting
the defense of such Claim or that there are legal defenses available to such
Indemnified Party different from or in addition to those available to the
Indemnifying Party, then one counsel for the Indemnified Party (the "
_Indemnified Party Counsel_ ") shall be entitled, if the Indemnified Party so
elects, to participate in or conduct the defense to the extent reasonably
determined by such counsel to protect the interests of the Indemnified Party,
at the expense of the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ that in no event shall
the Indemnifying Party be required to pay the fees and expenses of more than
one counsel selected by the Indemnified Party. No settlement of a Claim may be
made by the Indemnifying Party without the written consent of the Indemnified
Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. If the Indemnifying
Party elects to assume control, (i) any expense incurred by the Indemnified
Party thereafter for investigation or defense of the matter shall be borne by
the Indemnified Party (excluding the expense of Indemnified Party Counsel
which shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party), and (ii) the Indemnified
Party shall give all reasonable information and assistance, other than
pecuniary, that the Indemnifying Party shall deem necessary to the proper
defense of such Claim. In the absence of such an election to assume control by
the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party will use its best efforts to
defend, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, any claim, legal action or other
matter to which such other Partys indemnification under this _Article XV_
applies until the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, and, if the
Indemnifying Party fails to assume such defense within the time
period provided above, settle the same in the Indemnified Partys reasonable
discretion at the Indemnifying Partys expense. If the Indemnifying Party
notifies the Indemnified Party that it desires to defend the Claim pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 15.6(c)_, then the Indemnifying Party shall work
diligently to defend the Claim and shall not enter into any compromise or
settlement or discharge with respect to the Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party unless such judgment, compromise settlement
or discharge (w) provides for the payment by the Indemnifying Party of money
as sole relief for the claimant, (x) involves no finding or admission of any
violation of Law or the rights of any Indemnified Party, (y) does not
encumber any of the assets of any Indemnified Party or agree to any
restriction or condition that would apply to or materially adversely affect
any Indemnified Party or the conduct of any Indemnified Partys business, and
(z) includes, as a condition of any entry of judgment, settlement, compromise,
discharge or other resolution, a complete and unconditional release of each
Indemnified Party from any and all liabilities in respect of such Claim.

Section 15.7 _Dispute Resolution_. The Parties agree to resolve all "
_Disputes_ " concerning this Agreement pursuant to the provisions of this
section, such Disputes to include (i) all Disputed Title Matters, (ii) all
Disputed Environmental Matters, (iii) disputes concerning a Claim or amount
to be paid by an Indemnifying Party, (iv) disputes concerning the Preliminary
Settlement Statement or the Final Settlement Statement as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 3.4(a)_ and _Section_

 



-73-   _14.1(a)_ , respectively, or (v) disputes pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.4_
or _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ relating to whether the threshold for termination
has been met under _Section_ __ _ 12.1(f)_. The Parties agree to submit all
Disputes to binding arbitration in Denver, Colorado such arbitration to be
conducted as follows: the arbitration proceeding shall be submitted by
the Parties to a panel of three independent and impartial arbitrators with
knowledge or experience in the oil and gas industry, one selected by each of
the Parties within thirty days after said written notice and a third selected
by the first two arbitrators (each an " _Arbitrator_ ," and collectively the
" _Arbitrators_ "). The third Arbitrator, selected by the first two
Arbitrators, shall be a person having substantial experience and
recognized expertise in oil and gas industry. The arbitration shall be
conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association. At the hearing, the Parties shall present such
evidence and witnesses as they may choose, with or without counsel. Adherence
to formal rules of evidence shall not be required, but the arbitration panel
shall consider any evidence and testimony that it determines to be relevant,
in accordance with procedures that it determines to be appropriate. Any award
entered in the arbitration shall be made by a written opinion stating the
reasons and basis for the award made and any payment due pursuant to the
arbitration shall be made within fifteen (15) days of the Arbitrators
decision. The final decision may be filed in a court of competent jurisdiction
and may be enforced by Buyer or Seller as a final judgment of such court. Each
Party shall bear its own costs and expenses of the arbitration,  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the costs of employing the Arbitrators shall be borne 50% by
the Seller and 50% by the Buyer. IN ENTERING INTO THIS _SECTION_ __ _ 15.7_,
THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY ARE VOLUNTARILY AND KNOWINGLY WAIVING THEIR
RIGHTS TO JURY TRIAL.

Section 15.8 _No Insurance; Subrogation_. The indemnifications provided
in this _Article XV_ shall not be construed as a form of insurance. Buyer and
Seller hereby waive for themselves, their respective successors or assigns,
including any insurers, any rights to subrogation for Losses for which each of
them is respectively liable or against which each respectively indemnifies
the other, and, if required by applicable policies, Buyer and Seller shall
obtain waiver of such subrogation from their respective insurers.

 

Section 15.9 _Reservation as to Non-Parties_. Notwithstanding anything that
may be expressed or implied in this Agreement or any document, agreement, or
instrument delivered contemporaneously herewith, and notwithstanding the fact
that any Party may be a partnership or limited liability company, each Party
hereto, by its acceptance of the benefits of this Agreement, covenants,
agrees and acknowledges that no Persons other than the Parties shall have any
obligation hereunder and that it has no rights of recovery hereunder against,
and no recourse hereunder or under any documents, agreements, or instruments
delivered contemporaneously herewith or in respect of any oral representations
made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith shall be had
against, any former, current or future director, officer, agent, attorney,
Financing Source, Affiliate, manager, assignee, incorporator, controlling
Person, fiduciary, representative or employee of any Party (or any of their
successor or permitted assignees), against any former, current, or
future general or limited partner, manager, stockholder or member of any
Party (or any of their successors or permitted assignees) or any Affiliate
thereof or against any former, current or future director, officer, agent,
attorney, Financing Source, employee, Affiliate, manager, assignee,
incorporator, controlling Person, fiduciary, representative, general or
limited partner, stockholder, manager or member of any of the foregoing, but
in each case not including the Parties (each, but excluding for the avoidance
of

 



-74-  doubt, the Parties, a " _Party Affiliate_ "), whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim (whether in
tort, contract or otherwise) by or on behalf of such party against the Party
Affiliates, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable
proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation or other applicable Law,
or otherwise; it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no personal
liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on, or otherwise be incurred
by any Party Affiliate, as such, for any obligations of the applicable Party
under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, under any
documents or instruments delivered contemporaneously herewith, in respect of
any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on,
in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Except to
the extent otherwise expressly set forth in, and subject in all cases to the
terms and conditions of and limitations herein, this Agreement may only be
enforced against, and any claim or cause of action of any kind based upon,
arising out of, or related to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, may only be brought against the entities that
are expressly named as parties hereto and then only with respect to the
specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such Party. Each Party
Affiliate is expressly intended as a third party beneficiary of this _Section_
__ _ 15.9_.

 

Section 15.10 _Express Negligence_. The defense, indemnification, hold
harmless, release, Assumed Liabilities, waiver, and limitation of liability
provisions provided for in this Agreement will be applicable whether or not
the liabilities, losses, costs, expenses, and damages in question arose or
resulted solely from the gross, sole, active, passive, concurrent,
or comparative negligence, strict liability, or other fault or violation of
Law of or by any Indemnified Party. This statement complies with the express
negligence rule and is conspicuous.

 

Section 15.11 _Insurance_. The amount of any Claim for which an Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement or in connection
with or with respect to the Transaction shall be reduced by any corresponding
insurance proceeds from insurance policies carried by such Indemnified Party
or its Affiliates that are realized by such indemnified Party from non-Party
insurers with respect to such Claims.
