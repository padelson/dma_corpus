among SUMITOMO CHEMICAL CO., LTD., a Japanese corporation (" _Parent_ "),
ROSY FUTURE, INC., a Delaware corporation (" _Sub_ "), and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent, and CAMBRIDGE DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY, INC., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

WHEREAS the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and the Company have
approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and the Company
have approved the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of Sub with and into the Company
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
whereby each issued share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") not beneficially owned by Parent, Sub
or the Company shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (as defined in Section 2.01(c)) as provided herein;

WHEREAS simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
Parent and certain stockholders of the Company (the " _Principal Company
Stockholders_ ") are entering into several support agreements (the " _Support

Agreements_ ") pursuant to which the Principal Company Stockholders will
agree (on the terms and subject to the conditions therein set forth) to
approve, and take other specified actions in furtherance of the Merger;

WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and
also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

_ARTICLE I_

_THE MERGER _

Section 1.01 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate
existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") of the Merger.

Section 1.02 _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger shall
take place at the offices of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, 1540
Broadway, New York, New York 10036 at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the
first business day following the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by
Law, waiver by all parties) of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01, or,
if on such day any condition set forth in Section 7.02 or 7.03 has not been
satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by Law, waived by the party or parties
entitled to the benefits thereof), as soon as practicable after all the
conditions set forth in Article VII have been satisfied (or, to the extent    permitted by Law, waived by the parties entitled to the benefits thereof),
or at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing between
Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to
in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ".

Section 1.03 _Effective Time_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
prepare, and on the Closing Date or as soon as practicable thereafter the
Company shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a
certificate of merger or other appropriate documents (in any such case, the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") executed in accordance with the relevant provisions
of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with such Secretary of State, or at such other time as
Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger
(the date and time the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_
").

Section 1.04 _Effects_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section
259 of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Sub shall be vested in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Sub
shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 1.05  _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws_. (a) The Certificate
of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended at the
Effective Time to be the same as the certificate of incorporation of the Sub,
except that the corporate name of the Company shall remain the corporate name
of the Surviving Corporation, and, as so amended, such Certificate of
Incorporation shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.

(b) The by-laws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

Section 1.06  _Directors_. The directors of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

Section 1.07 _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.



 

2 _ARTICLE II_

_EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE_

_CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES _

Section 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent or Sub, or any
subsidiary of any of the foregoing, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. (1) Subject to Sections 2.01(b) and
2.01(d), each issued share of Company Common Stock shall be converted into
the right to receive $12.00 in cash.

(2) The cash payable upon the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to this Section 2.01(c) is referred to collectively as the " _Merger
Consideration_ ". As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive Merger Consideration
upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.02, without
interest.

(d) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (" _Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any
person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section
262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ ") shall not be converted into Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but rather the holders of
Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair market value of such
Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw
or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, then the right of such
holder to be paid the fair value of such holderÂ’s Appraisal Shares shall cease
and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to
receive, Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). The Company
shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company
for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any
of the foregoing.



 

3 Section 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates_. (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company (which shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Company) to act as paying agent (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of
certificates representing Company Common Stock. Sub shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange
of Company Common Stock for Merger Consideration. Parent shall take all steps
necessary to enable and cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to the
Paying Agent on a timely basis, as and when needed after the Effective Time,
cash necessary to pay for the shares of Company Common Stock converted into
the right to receive cash pursuant to Section 2.01(c) (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

(b) _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
whose shares were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.01, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares of
Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have
been converted pursuant to Section 2.01, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment may be made to a person other than the person in whose name
the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash,
without interest, into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore
represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01.
No interest shall be paid or accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any
Certificate. 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon
conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Common Stock, _subject_ , _however_ , to the Surviving CorporationÂ’s
obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record
date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the
Company on such shares  



 

4  of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or
prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective
Time, and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares
of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any certificates formerly
representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon
demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration.

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior
to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier
date on which Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any
such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto. 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent.

(g)  _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration; _provided_ , _however_ ; that Parent may, in its discretion and
as a condition precedent to the payment of the Merger Consideration, require
such owner of a lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in
such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Section 2.03 _Warrants_. The warrants issued in August 2000 have an adjusted
per share exercise price greater than the per share Merger Consideration and
will expire in accordance with their terms prior to the Effective Time. The
warrants issued in December 2005 (together with the August 2000 warrants, the
" _Warrants_ ") have a per share exercise price equal to the per share Merger
Consideration and will by their terms, upon exercise of such December 2005
warrants, confer upon their holders after the Effective Time the right to
receive the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration payable with respect to
the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock for which said December
2005 warrants are exercisable for immediately prior to the Effective Time. It
is understood and agreed that the aggregate amount of Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to the December 2005 warrants is $0.00.



 

5 Section 2.04 _Withholding Rights_. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Company
Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or under any provision of U.S. Federal, state, local or foreign tax
Law.

_ARTICLE III_

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub that except as set
forth in the letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement, from the Company

Section 3.01 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of the Company and each
of its subsidiaries (the " _Company Subsidiaries_ ") is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing (or as applicable in the appropriate
jurisdiction) under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and
has full corporate power and authority and possesses all governmental
franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals necessary to
enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to
conduct its businesses as presently conducted, other than such franchises,
licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals the lack of which,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is not expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 9.03). The Company and
each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business in each jurisdiction
where the nature of its business or their ownership or leasing of its
properties make such qualification necessary except where the failure to be so
qualified has not had and is not expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of
its Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended to
the date of this Agreement (as so amended, the " _Company Charter_ "), and the
By-laws of the Company, as amended to the date of this Agreement (as so
amended, the " _Company By-laws_ "), and the comparable charter and
organizational documents of each Company Subsidiary, in each case as amended
through the date of this Agreement.

Section 3.02 _Company Subsidiaries; Equity Interests_. (a) The Company
Disclosure Letter lists each Company Subsidiary and its jurisdiction
of organization or incorporation (as applicable). All the outstanding shares
of capital stock of each Company Subsidiary have been validly issued and are
fully paid and nonassessable and, except as set forth in the Company
Disclosure Letter, are owned by the Company, by another Company Subsidiary or
by the Company and another Company Subsidiary, free and clear of all pledges,
liens, charges, mortgages, encumbrances and security interests of any kind or
nature whatsoever (collectively, " _Liens_ ").

(b) Except for its interests in the Company Subsidiaries and except for the
ownership interests set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company
does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock, membership interest,
partnership interest, joint venture interest or other equity interest in any
person.



 

6 Section 3.03 _Capital Structure_. The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 100,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 46,667 shares of
preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Company Preferred Stock_
"). As of the close of business on July 31, 2007, (i) 21,631,703 shares of
Company Common Stock and no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued and
outstanding, (ii) 272,846 shares of Company Common Stock were held by the
Company in its treasury, and (iii) (A) 329,619 shares of Company Common Stock
were subject to outstanding Company Employee Stock Options with an exercise
price less than the per share Merger Consideration, (B) 1,776,662 shares of
Company Common Stock were reserved for issuance in settlement of outstanding
Company RSUs pursuant to the Company Stock Plans, (C) 256,959 shares of
Company Common Stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to existing
contractual commitments and (D) 992,387 shares of Company Common Stock were
subject to the Warrants or to outstanding Company Employee Stock Options with
an exercise price equal to or in excess of the per share Merger Consideration.
Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, as of the close of
business on July 26, 2007, no shares of capital stock or other voting
securities of the Company were issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding.
All outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are, and all such shares that
may be issued prior to the Effective Time will be when issued, duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to
or issued in violation of any purchase option, call option, right of first
refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right under any
provision of the DGCL, the Company Charter, the Company By-laws or any
Contract to which the Company is a party or otherwise bound. There are not any
bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company having the right
to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the
right to vote) on any matters on which holders of Company Common Stock may

requirements of Federal or state securities laws and (b) all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may
reasonably request; provided, however, that the Company may withhold (i) any
document or information that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality
agreement with a third party, (ii) such portions of documents or information
relating to pricing or other matters that are highly sensitive if the exchange
of such documents (or portions thereof) or information, as determined by such
partyÂ’s counsel, might reasonably result in antitrust difficulties for such
party (or any of its affiliates) or (iii) any information which it reasonably
believes it may not provide to Parent by reason of applicable Law. If any
material is withheld by the Company pursuant to the proviso to the preceding
sentence, the Company shall inform Parent as to the general nature of what is
being withheld to the extent the provision of such information will not cause
the Company (or any Company Subsidiary) to violate any agreement with a third
party or any applicable Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Company shall, within two business days of request therefor, provide
Parent with access to the information described in Rule 14a-7(a)(2)(ii) under
the Exchange Act and with access to any information to which a holder of
Company Common Stock would be entitled under Section 220 of the DGCL (assuming
such holder met the requirements of such section). All information exchanged
pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be subject to the confidentiality
agreement dated April 27, 2007 between the Company and Parent (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

Section 6.03 _Best Efforts; Notification_. (a) Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties shall use its
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause
to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in
the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the Transactions,
including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers,
consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all
necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental
Entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary
to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by,
any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents,
approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits
or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, including any
proceeding in connection with Appraisal Shares or lawsuits and proceedings
seeking to have any stay or  



 

39  temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental
Entity vacated or reversed (iv) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully
carry out the purposes of this Agreement. In connection with and without
limiting the foregoing, the Company and the Company Board shall (i) take all
action necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar statute
or regulation is or becomes applicable to any Transaction or this Agreement
and (ii) if any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation
becomes applicable to this Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure
that the Merger and the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger and
the Transactions. The Company shall use its best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with Parent in the obtaining of any employment agreements that
Parent requests.

 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent or Sub shall
give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any representation or warranty made
by it contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality becoming
untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any such representation or warranty
that is not so qualified becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect or (ii) the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement.

Section 6.04 _Stock Options_. (a) As soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee
administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take
such other actions as are required to adjust the terms of all outstanding
Company Employee Stock Options heretofore granted under any Company Stock Plan
to provide that each Company Employee Stock Option outstanding (whether or
not vested) shall be canceled in exchange for a cash payment (Parent shall
cause such cash payment to be provided to the Company by Sub or Paying Agent)
by the Company at the Effective Time of an amount equal to (i) the excess, if
any, of (x) the Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Employee Stock Option, multiplied
by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which such Company
Employee Stock Option shall not theretofore have been exercised.

(b) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock
Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as are required
to adjust the terms of all outstanding Company RSUs heretofore granted under
any Company Stock Plan to provide that each Company RSU outstanding (whether
or not vested) shall be canceled in exchange for a cash payment (Parent shall
cause such cash payment to be provided to the Company by Sub or Paying Agent)
by the Company at the Effective Time of an amount equal to: (i) the Merger
Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
for which such Company RSU shall not theretofore have been settled.

(c) All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall be subject to any
required withholding of Taxes (including any income tax and Employee or
EmployerÂ’s National  



 

40  Insurance Tax where such tax is the responsibility of the recipient) and
shall be paid without interest. The Company shall use its best efforts to
obtain all consents of the holders of the Company Employee Stock Options and
Company RSUs as shall be necessary to effectuate the foregoing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, payment
shall, at ParentÂ’s request, be withheld in respect of any Company Employee
Stock Option or Company RSU until all necessary consents from the affected
individual are obtained.

(d) The Company Stock Plans shall terminate as of the Effective Time, and the
provisions in any other Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement
providing for the issuance, transfer or grant of any capital stock of the
Company or any interest in respect of any capital stock of the Company shall
be deleted as of the Effective Time, and the Company shall ensure that
following the Effective Time no holder of a Company Employee Stock Option or
Company RSU or any participant in any Company Stock Plan or other Company
Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement shall have any right thereunder to
acquire any capital stock of the Company or the Surviving Corporation.

(e) In this Agreement:

" _Company Employee Stock Option_ " means any option to purchase Company
Common Stock granted under any Company Stock Plan.

" _Company RSU_ " means any restricted stock unit granted under any Company
Stock Plan.

" _Company Stock Plans_ " means the Company 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, the
Company Special Bonus Plan and the Company 2000 Stock Incentive Plan.

Section 6.05 _Benefit Plans._ (a) For a period of two years after the
Effective Time, Parent shall either (A) maintain or cause the Surviving
Corporation (or in the case of a transfer of all or substantially all the
assets and business of the Surviving Corporation, its successors and assigns)
to maintain the Company Benefit Plans (other than plans providing for the
issuance of Company Common Stock or based on the value of Company Common
Stock) at the benefit levels in effect on the date of this Agreement or (B)
provide or cause the Surviving Corporation (or, in such case, its
successors or assigns) to provide benefits to employees (other than plans
providing for the issuance of equity securities or based on the value of
equity securities) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that, taken as
a whole, are not materially less favorable in the aggregate on the date
hereof to such employees. For the avoidance of doubt this Section 6.05 shall
only apply to benefits that are available to the employees of the Company in
general as opposed to benefits that are only available to particular
individuals.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor in accordance with their respective terms (as
in effect on the date of this Agreement), all the CompanyÂ’s employment,
severance and termination agreements (including entitlement to pay in lieu of
notice in the event of termination), plans and policies disclosed in the
Company Disclosure Letter.

(c) With respect to any "employee pension benefit plan," as defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA, maintained by Parent or any of its subsidiaries, for
purposes, of  



 

41  determining eligibility to participate and vesting, service with the Company
or any Company Subsidiary shall be treated as service with Parent or any of
its subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication
of benefits.

(d) Parent shall waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition
limitation under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its
affiliates (other than the Company) in which employees of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that
such pre-existing condition limitation would have been applicable under the
comparable Company welfare benefit plan immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Parent shall recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of
all expenses incurred by each Company employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for
purposes of satisfying such yearÂ’s deductible and co-payment limitations under
the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time.

(e) This Section 6.05 shall not create any rights to continued employment in
favor of any Company employee.

Section 6.06 _Indemnification._ (a) Parent and Sub agree that all rights to
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers, employees
or fiduciaries of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (the "
_Indemnified Persons_ ") as provided in their respective certificates of
incorporation or by-laws or other indemnification agreements shall be assumed
by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at
the Effective Time, and survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms. Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, for a period of six years after the Effective Time, cause to
be maintained in effect in its charter or by-laws (or similar governing
documents) provisions regarding the elimination of liability of directors,
indemnification of officers, directors and employees that are no less
advantageous to the Indemnified Persons as those currently contained in the
CompanyÂ’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws. Parent shall cause to be
maintained for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time the
current directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ insurance and indemnification policies of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the extent that it provides
coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO
Insurance_"), so long as the premium therefor would not be in excess of 200%
of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (such 200%
amount, the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If the existing DandO Insurance expires, is
terminated or canceled during such six-year period, Parent shall use all
reasonable efforts to cause to be obtained as much DandO Insurance as can be
obtained for the remainder of such period for an annualized premium not in
excess of the Maximum Premium, on terms and conditions no less advantageous
than the existing DandO Insurance. The Company represents to Parent that the
Maximum Premium is $750,370.

(b) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
Section 6.06 shall not be terminated or modified by such parties in a manner
so as to adversely affect any Indemnified Person, or any other person entitled
to the benefit of this Section 6.06 of  



 

42  this Agreement, as the case may be, to whom this Section 6.06 applies
without the consent of the affected Indemnified Person or such other person,
as the case may be. If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any
other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual,
corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.06.

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.06 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person and each other person
entitled to the benefit of Section 6.06 of this Agreement, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by contract or otherwise. It is the partiesÂ’ intention
that indemnification be available hereunder in accordance with, and subject to
the limitations of, this Section 6.06 for any losses arising out of a breach
of any particular representation, warranty or covenant made to a party
regardless of the claimantÂ’s actual or constructive knowledge of such breach
or such losses or of any effect relating to such breach or such losses.

Section 6.07 _Fees and Expenses_. (a) Except as provided below, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and the Transactions shall be
paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger
is consummated.

(b) The Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $11,245,112 if: (i) the
Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e); (ii) Parent
terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(i) or 8.01(d)(ii); or
(iii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(c) or
8.01(d)(iii) and within one year of such termination the Company enters into
a definitive agreement to consummate, or consummates, a Change of Control
Transaction. Any fee due under this Section 6.07(b) shall be paid by wire
transfer of same-day funds on the date of termination of this Agreement
(except that in the case of termination pursuant to clause (iii) above such
payment shall be made on the date of execution of such definitive agreement
or, if earlier, consummation of such Change of Control Transaction).

(c) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 8.01(c) or
8.01(d)(iii), the Company shall reimburse Parent and Sub for all their out-
of-pocket expenses in the amount of $5,000,000 in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger and the Transactions. $1,000,000 of such reimbursement
shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds on the date of termination
of this Agreement. The remaining balance of $4,000,000 plus simple interest on
such outstanding balance at a rate of five (5) percent per annum shall be paid
no later than fifteen months after such termination. In the event the Company
is required to pay a fee pursuant to Section 6.07(b)(iii), any amounts paid
pursuant to this paragraph (other than interest) shall serve as a credit
against such fee payment.

(d) The Company shall reimburse Parent and Sub for all their expenses actually
incurred not in excess of $8,000,000 (excluding any amount of expenses
incurred after the termination of this Agreement arising out of contingent
obligations to any financial advisor of Parent) for (i) professional services
including accountants, counsel and financial advisors, (ii) 



 

43  actual travel and travel related costs and (iii) costs and expenses
associated with any management presentations and meetings, in connection with
this Agreement, the Merger and the Transactions; if this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Sections 8.01(a), 8.01(b)(i) or 8.01(b)(iii), and, in
each case, within one year of such termination the Company enters into a
definitive agreement to consummate, or consummates, the transactions
contemplated by a Change of Control Transaction. Such reimbursement shall be
made on the date of execution of such definitive agreement or, if earlier,
consummation of such Change of Control Transaction. 

Section 6.08 _Public Announcements._ Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, shall consult with each other before issuing, and
provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press
release or other public statements with respect to the Merger and the
Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by
applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange.

Section 6.09 _Transfer Taxes._ All stock transfer, real estate transfer,
documentary, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes (including
interest, penalties and additions to any such Taxes) (" _Transfer Taxes_ ")
incurred in connection with the Merger or the Transactions shall be paid by
either Sub or the Surviving Corporation, and the Company shall cooperate with
Sub and Parent in preparing, executing and filing any Tax Returns with
respect to such Transfer Taxes.

Section 6.10 _Stockholder Litigation._ The Company shall give Parent the
reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
stockholder litigation against the Company and its directors relating to the
Merger and the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such settlement
shall be agreed to without ParentÂ’s consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

subject to a nonfinal order, decree, ruling or action restraining, enjoining

final and nonappealable; or

(iii) if, upon a vote at a duly held meeting to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company Stockholder Approval is not obtained; 

(c) by Parent, if the Company breaches or fails to perform in any material

Section 3.17, Section 4.06, the last sentence of Section 6.02, Section 6.07,
this Section 8.02 and Article IX, which provisions shall survive such
termination, and except to the extent that such termination results from the
willful and material breach by a party of any representation, warranty
or covenant set forth in this Agreement.

Section 8.03 _Amendment._ This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_

Section 9.04 _Interpretation; Disclosure Letters._ (a) When a reference is
made in this Agreement to a Section, such reference shall be to a Section of
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever
the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". Any
matter disclosed in any section of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be
deemed disclosed only for the purposes of the specific Sections of this
Agreement to which such section relates.

(b) For the purpose of analyzing whether any effect is "material" or
constitutes a "material adverse effect" for any purpose under this Agreement,
the analysis of materiality shall not be limited to a long-term perspective
(and whether any effect is or might be short-term, temporary or cyclical in
nature shall not be dispositive of its materiality).

(c) A reference to any US legal term for any action, remedy, method of
judicial proceeding, legal document, legal status, court, official or any
legal concept or thing shall in respect of any jurisdiction other than the
United States be treated as a reference to the relevant analogous term in that
jurisdiction.

Section 9.05 _Severability._ If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in  



 

55  good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end
that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 9.06 _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

Section 9.07 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries._ This Agreement,
taken together with the Company Disclosure Letter, (a) constitutes the entire
agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the Transactions and (b)
except for Sections 6.04, 6.05 and 6.06, are not intended to confer upon any
person any rights or remedies other than the parties to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding clause (b) of the immediately preceding sentence, following
the Effective Time the provisions of Article II shall be enforceable by
holders of Certificates.

Section 9.08 _Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, regardless
of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of
conflicts of laws thereof.

Section 9.09 _Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties, except that Sub may assign, in
its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under
this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Sub of any of its obligations
under this Agreement. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be
void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their
respective successors and assigns.

Section 9.10 _Enforcement._ The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any New
York state court, any Federal court located in the State of New York or the
State of Delaware or in any Delaware state court, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In addition,
each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the personal
jurisdiction of any New York state court or, any Federal court located in the
State of New York or the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court in the
event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any Transaction, (b) agrees
that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c) agrees that it
will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any Transaction in any
court other than any New York state court or, any Federal court sitting in the
State of New York or the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court and
(d) waives any right to trial by jury with respect to any action related to or
arising out of this Agreement or any Transaction.



 

56 Section 9.11 _Time Zone Convention._ Any reference to any date in this
Agreement, unless specified herein, shall be deemed to refer to Japan Time.
For example, if any event takes place during the afternoon in New York, it
shall be deemed to have taken place on the following day in Japan.
