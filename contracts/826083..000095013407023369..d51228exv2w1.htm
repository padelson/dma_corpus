AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is entered into as of November 4, 2007, by and among DELL INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED, a Delaware corporation (the "Buyer"), DII  ELEPHANT INC., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer (the "Transitory Subsidiary"), and EQUALLOGIC, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). 

  

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Buyer and the Company deem it advisable and in the best interests of each corporation and their respective stockholders that the Buyer acquire the Company in order to advance the long-term business interests of the Buyer and the Company; and 

  

 WHEREAS, the acquisition of the Company shall be effected through a merger (the "Merger") of the Transitory Subsidiary with and into the Company in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), as a result of which the Company shall become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer; and 

  

 WHEREAS, the holders of the requisite number of shares of Company Stock (as hereinafter defined) outstanding on the date of this Agreement shall, immediately after the execution hereof, by written consent, deliver the Company Stockholder Approval (as hereinafter defined) by approving and adopting the Company Voting Proposal (as hereinafter defined); and 

  

 WHEREAS, concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a material inducement to Buyer and Transitory Subsidiary to enter into this Agreement, Paula A. Long has executed and delivered to Buyer a Nondisclosure and Noncompetition Agreement to be effective upon the Closing; 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary and the Company agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

THE MERGER  

  

 1.1 _Effective Time of the Merger_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, prior to the Closing, the Buyer and the Company shall jointly prepare, and immediately following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as is established by the Buyer and the Company and set forth in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time"). 

   ##### 

  

  

 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on a date to be specified by the Buyer and the Company (the "Closing Date"), which shall be no later than the second Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing and other than satisfaction of those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to the delivery of such items and the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), at the offices of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, 60 State Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109, unless another date, place or time is agreed to in writing by the Buyer and the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Business Day" shall be any day other than (a) a Saturday or Sunday or (b) a day on which banking institutions located in Boston, Massachusetts are permitted or required by law, executive order or governmental decree to remain closed. 

  

 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time (a) the separate existence of the Transitory Subsidiary shall cease and the Transitory Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the Company (the Company following the Merger is sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation") and (b) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement shall be amended so that the authorized capital stock provided for by such Certificate of Incorporation consists solely of 1,000 shares of common stock, and, as so amended, such Certificate of Incorporation shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until further amended in accordance with the DGCL. In addition, subject to Section 6.6(b) hereof, the Buyer shall cause the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation to be amended and restated in their entirety so that, immediately following the Effective Time, they are identical to the By-laws of the Transitory Subsidiary as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that all references to the name of the Transitory Subsidiary therein shall be changed to refer to the name of the Company, and, as so amended and restated, such By-laws shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation, until further amended in accordance with the DGCL. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL. 

  

 1.4 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. 

  

 (a) The directors of the Transitory Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

ARTICLE II 

   

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES  

  

 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of the capital stock of the Company or capital stock of the Transitory Subsidiary: 

   ##### 

  

     

 (a) Each share of the common stock of the Transitory Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 (c) Subject to Section 2.2, other than shares of Company Stock to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.4(a) below), (i) each share of Company Common Stock shall be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Common Merger Consideration; (ii) each share of Company Series A Preferred Stock shall be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Series A Preferred Merger Consideration; (iii) each share of Company Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Series A-1 Preferred Merger Consideration; (iv) each share of Company Series B Preferred Stock shall be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Series B Preferred Merger Consideration; (v) each share of Company Series B-1 Preferred Stock shall be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Series B-1 Preferred Merger Consideration; and (vi) each share of Company Series C Preferred Stock shall be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Series C Preferred Merger Consideration. The terms "Common Merger Consideration", "Series A Preferred Merger Consideration", "Series A-1 Preferred Merger Consideration", "Series B Preferred Merger Consideration", "Series B-1 Preferred Merger Consideration" and "Series C Preferred Merger Consideration" are defined on Exhibit A hereto. The aggregate amount of the Common Merger Consideration, the Series A Preferred Merger Consideration, the Series A-1 Preferred Merger Consideration, the Series B Preferred Merger Consideration and the Series B-1 Merger Consideration is called herein the "Merger Consideration". As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1(c), upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest. 

   ##### 

  

    

 (d) The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Stock occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 2.2 _Exchange Fund_. The procedures for exchanging outstanding shares of Company Stock for the consideration to be paid to the holders of such securities in connection with the Merger are as follows: 

  

 (a) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer shall deposit with a bank or trust company mutually acceptable to the Buyer and the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, for payment through the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Section 2.2, cash in an amount sufficient to make payments in exchange for certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Stock (the "Certificates") pursuant to Section 2.1(c) (the "Exchange Fund"). 

   

 (b) Promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto, provided that the Buyer shall assist the Company in developing arrangements for the delivery of such materials at Closing to significant stockholders of the Company to facilitate the payment of Merger Consideration to such stockholders immediately following the Effective Time. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive promptly in exchange therefor the cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II in respect of all Company Stock held by such holder, and the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the applicable Merger Consideration may be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.2. 

   

 (c) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates evidencing shares of Company Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Stock, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Stock for two years after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Buyer (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar law), upon demand, and any holder of Company Stock who has not previously complied with this Section 2.2 shall be entitled to receive only from the Buyer (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar law) payment of its claim for Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger, without interest. 

   

 (e) To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

   

 (f) Each of the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Stock, Company Stock Options and Company Warrants such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any other applicable state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or the Buyer, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such holder of the shares of Company Stock, Company Stock Options and Company Warrants in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or the Buyer, as the case may be. 

   

 (g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 2.3 _Company Stock Plans; Company Warrants_  

  

 (a) The Company shall take such action as shall be required: 

   

 (i) to effectuate the cancellation, as of the Effective Time, of all options to purchase Company Common Stock ("Company Stock Options") granted under the Companys 2001 Stock Plan (the "Company Stock Plan") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (without regard to the exercise price of such Company Stock Options); and 

  

 (ii) to cause, pursuant to the Company Stock Plan, the vested portion of each outstanding Company Stock Option to represent as of the Effective Time solely the right to receive, in accordance with this Section 2.3, a lump sum cash payment in the amount of the Option Consideration, if any, with respect to such vested portion of the Company Stock Option and to no longer represent the right to purchase Company Common Stock or any other equity security of the Company, the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any other person or any other consideration. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Each holder of a Company Stock Option shall receive from the Buyer, in respect and in consideration of each Company Stock Option so cancelled, as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in any event not later than five Business Days), an amount (net of applicable taxes) equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Common Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the total number of vested shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, without any interest thereon (the "Option Consideration"). In the event that the exercise price of any Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Common Merger Consideration, the holder thereof shall receive no Option Consideration and such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled and have no further force or effect. 

  

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, each holder of a warrant to purchase Company Stock (a "Company Warrant") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 4(a) of such Company Warrant, upon exercise of such Company Warrant pursuant to its terms, solely an amount in cash (net of applicable taxes) for each share of Company Stock that may have been purchased pursuant to such Company Warrant equal to (i) the Merger Consideration for such shares of Company Stock under such Company Warrant (without interest) _minus_ (ii) the exercise price per share of Company Stock under such Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Warrant Consideration"). 

   

 (c) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall mail to each person who is a holder of a Company Stock Option and/or Company Warrant a letter describing the treatment of and payment for such Company Stock Option and/or Company Warrant pursuant to this Section 2.3 and providing instructions for use in obtaining payment for such Company Stock Option and/or Company Warrant. The Buyer shall at all times from and after the Effective Time maintain sufficient liquid funds to satisfy its obligations to holders of Company Warrants pursuant to this Section 2.3. 

   

 2.4 _Dissenting Shares_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, shares of Company Stock held by a holder who has made a demand for appraisal of such shares of Company Stock in accordance with the DGCL (any such shares being referred to as "Dissenting Shares" until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1, but shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares. 

   

 (b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into and shall represent only the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1 without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such shares in accordance with Section 2.2. 

   ##### 

  

    

 (c) The Company shall give the Buyer: (i) prompt notice of any written demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relate to such demand; and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument unless the Buyer shall have given its written consent to such payment or settlement offer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

To the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL, each Company Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from each of the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation within five (5) Business Days of receipt by the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation from the Company Indemnified Party of a request therefor. 

  

 (b) The Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and Buyer shall cause the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation to so contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any predecessor thereof than are presently set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Company. 

  

 (c) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain, and the Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time the current or substantially equivalent policies of the directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). 

  

 (d) The Buyer shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by the persons referred to in this Section 6.6 in connection with their enforcement of their rights provided in this Section 6.6. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) The provisions of this Section 6.6 are intended to be in addition to the rights otherwise available to the Company Indemnified Parties by law, charter, statute, by-law or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Company Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their representatives. 

  

 6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Buyer shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to the Buyer, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to occur is reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, in each case at any time from and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, or (b) any material failure of the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary or the Company, as the case may be, or of any officer, director, employee or agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the conditions to such partys obligation to consummate the Merger. 

   

 6.8 _Service Credit_. Following the Effective Time, the Buyer will give each employee of the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries who shall have been an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees") full credit for prior service with the Company or its Subsidiaries for purposes of (a) eligibility under any Buyer Employee Plan, (b) determination of benefit levels under any Buyer Employee Plan or policy relating to vacation or severance and (c) determination of "retiree" status under any Buyer Employee Plan, in each case for which the Continuing Employee is otherwise eligible and in which the Continuing Employee is offered participation, but except where such credit would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, the Buyer shall waive, or cause to be waived, any limitations on benefits relating to pre-existing conditions to the same extent such limitations are waived under any comparable plan of the Buyer and recognize for purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by Continuing Employees in the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Buyer Employee Plan" means any "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), any "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), and any other written or oral plan, agreement or arrangement, including insurance coverage, severance benefits, disability benefits, deferred compensation, bonuses, stock options, stock purchase, phantom stock, stock appreciation or other forms of incentive compensation or post-retirement compensation and all unexpired severance agreements, for the benefit of, or relating to, any current or former employee of the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or any entity which is a member of (A) a controlled group of corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code), (B) a group of trades or businesses under common control (as defined in Section 414(c) of the Code) or (C) an affiliated service group (as defined in Section 414(m) of the Code or the regulations under Section 414(o) of the Code), any of which includes or included the Buyer or a Subsidiary of the Buyer. For a period of at least one year following the Closing Date, Buyer shall (i) provide the Continuing Employees whom the Buyer employs during such period with no less than the same base salary or base wages as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) cause the Continuing Employees whom the Buyer employs during such period to participate in Buyer 

    ##### 

  

    

Employee Plans providing compensation (including bonus compensation) and
employee benefits (other than awards under equity incentive plans) that are
substantially similar in the aggregate to the benefits provided to similarly
situated employees of Buyer; provided, that the foregoing shall in no way
alter the at-will nature of any Continuing Employees employment. 

   

 6.9 _Termination of 401(k) Plan_. The Company shall terminate any and all company benefit plans intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code, effective not later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time; provided, however, that Buyer shall cause a plan intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (the "Buyer 401(k) Plan") to accept rollovers (but not rollover loans) from any 401(k) plan of the Company to the extent provided in such Buyer 401(k) Plan. The Company shall provide Buyer with evidence that such 401(k) plan(s) have been terminated pursuant to resolution of the Companys Board of Directors (the form and substance of which shall be subject to review and approval by Buyer) not later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time.

 9.5 _Severability._ Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term. 

   

 9.6 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by facsimile transmission.
