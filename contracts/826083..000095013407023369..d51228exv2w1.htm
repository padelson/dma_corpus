the case may be, other than that which is specified in the extension or waiver. The failure of any
party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not

the documents and instruments referred to herein that are to be delivered at the Closing)
constitute the entire agreement among the parties to this Agreement and supersede any prior

respect to which holders of Options and Company Warrants shall be third party beneficiaries), and
Section&nbsp;6.6 (with respect to which the Company Indemnified Parties shall be third party

obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of
law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other
parties, and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of,

unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability
of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending
term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or
unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such determination shall have the
power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any
invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable
and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or
provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does
not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace
such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that
will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or
unenforceable term.

by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by

expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other

one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

Delaware in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b)&nbsp;agrees that all claims in respect of such action
or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court, (c)&nbsp;agrees that it shall not attempt
to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, and (d)&nbsp;agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any other court. Each of
the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or
proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be required of any
other party with respect thereto. Any party hereto may make service on another party by sending or
