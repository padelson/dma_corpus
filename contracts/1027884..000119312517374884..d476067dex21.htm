satisfaction (or waiver by the Party or Parties entitled to the benefit of
such Closing Condition as and to the extent contemplated by _Article 8_ ) of
the conditions set forth in _Article 8_ (the "Closing Conditions"); _provided_
, _however_ , that if either Party waives any Closing Condition for purposes
of this _Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)_, such Closing Condition shall be deemed waived
by such Party for all purposes under this Agreement; _provided further_ , for
the sake of clarity, that (x) Moon shall in no event accept shares of Comet
Common Stock in the Exchange Offer without seeking to complete the Core
Transactions promptly thereafter pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.2_ and
otherwise in accordance with this Agreement and (y) if Moon accepts shares in

Parties shall complete the actions contemplated hereby with respect to the
Core Transactions promptly thereafter (and in any event on the Closing Date,
other than the Liquidation Distribution, which shall occur on the Closing Date
or as soon as practicable thereafter) pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.2_ and
otherwise in accordance with this Agreement. The date on which Moon Bidco
commences the Exchange Offer is referred to as the "Exchange Offer
Commencement Date."

(b) In accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and subject
to the satisfaction (or waiver by the Party or Parties entitled to the benefit
of such Closing Condition as and to the extent contemplated by _Article 8_ )
of the Closing Conditions, Moon Bidco shall (and Moon shall cause Moon Bidco
to), at or as promptly as practicable following the Expiration Time (but in
any event within one hour, if the Expiration Time occurs between 9:00 a.m. to
4:00 p.m. New York City time on any Business Day), accept for exchange (the
time of acceptance for exchange, the "Effective Time") and, at or as promptly
as practicable following the Effective Time (but in any event within three (3)
Business Days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under
the Exchange Act) thereafter), deliver the Exchange Offer Consideration (by
delivery by Moon Bidco of shares of Moon Common Stock to the Exchange Agent
appointed by Moon Bidco for the Exchange Offer) for all shares of Comet
Common Stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the
Exchange Offer as of the Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that no
fractional shares of Moon Common Stock shall be issued upon completion of the
Exchange Offer, and in lieu thereof each tendering shareholder of Comet who
would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of Moon Common Stock will be
paid an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the
fractional share interest such holder (after taking into account all shares of
Comet Common Stock validly tendered for exchange and not withdrawn by such
holder) would otherwise be entitled to and (ii) the closing price for a share
of Moon Common Stock as reported on the NYSE Composite Transaction Tape (as

to, or that reasonably could be expected to be adverse to, the holders of
shares of Comet Common Stock (other than Moon or Moon Bidco) or in a manner
that materially and adversely affects the likelihood of consummation of the
Exchange Offer on a timely basis.

 

(d) Unless the Exchange Offer is extended pursuant to this Agreement, the
Offer shall expire at 4:00 p.m. (New York City time), or at such other time
as the Parties may mutually agree in writing, on the date that is 21 Business
Days (calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the
Exchange Act) following the Exchange Offer Commencement Date (such initial
expiration date and time of the Exchange Offer, the "Initial Expiration Time")
or, if the Exchange Offer has been extended pursuant to and in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_, the date and time to which the Exchange Offer has
been so extended (the Initial Expiration Time, or such later expiration date

(e) Unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to _Article 9_ , Moon
Bidco may or shall (in which case Moon shall cause Moon Bidco to), as
applicable, extend the Exchange Offer from time to time as follows:

(i) Moon Bidco shall (and Moon shall cause Moon Bidco to) extend the Exchange
Offer for the minimum period as required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC, the staff thereof or the NYSE
applicable to the Exchange Offer;

 

(ii) Moon Bidco shall extend the Exchange Offer on one or more occasions if,
as of any then-scheduled Expiration Time, (x) any of the conditions in
_Sections 8.1(a)_ - _(f)_ shall not have been satisfied (or waived by Moon and
Comet) for at least five Business Days or (y) any other Closing Conditions
(other than any such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
action taken at or immediately prior to the Closing) shall not be satisfied
(or waived by the Party or Parties entitled to the benefit of such Closing
Condition as and to the extent contemplated by _Article 8_ ) at the then-
scheduled Expiration Time; _provided_ that (A) prior to the date of the later
of the Moon Stockholder Meeting and the Comet Shareholder Meeting, no single
extension shall be for a period ending later than the sooner to occur of (1)
the 20th Business Day after the then scheduled Expiration Time and (2) the

pursuant to _Article_ 9, Moon Bidco shall (and Moon shall cause Moon Bidco to)
promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours following such valid
termination) terminate the Exchange Offer and not acquire any shares of Comet
Common Stock pursuant thereto. If the Exchange Offer is terminated in
accordance with this Agreement by Moon Bidco prior to the acceptance for
payment and payment for shares of Comet Common Stock tendered pursuant to the
Exchange Offer, Moon Bidco shall (and Moon shall cause Moon Bidco to)
promptly return, and shall cause the Exchange Agent to return, in accordance
with applicable Law, all tendered shares of Comet Common Stock to the
registered holders thereof. Nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_ shall
affect any termination rights under _Article_ 9\.

(g) Promptly after satisfaction or waiver to the extent permissible of the
last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in _Sections
8.1(a)_ - _(f)_ , the Parties shall issue a public announcement to such

12  and whereby Comet Newco would allot shares in its capital to each holder of
shares of Comet Common Stock at the time of the merger in accordance with the
Merger Proposal (the "Merger Consideration"), as a consequence of which,
following completion of the merger, each holder of shares of Comet Common

Common Stock immediately prior to the completion of the merger (the "Merger");

 

(ii) prepare, adopt and sign explanatory notes to the Merger Proposal (the
"Merger Notes"), substantially in the form as attached to this Agreement as
_Exhibit B_ , for the Merger;

transfer, immediately following the Merger Effective Time, all issued and
outstanding shares in the capital of Comet Newco Sub to Moon Bidco or its

Sale Agreement with the consideration for such Share Sale being a note that,
other than to the extent any portion of such note is distributed to Moon Bidco
or another beneficial owner of shares of Comet Newco Sub that is a controlled

13  accordance with the Share Sale Agreement at and as of such time and such
transfer will be acknowledged by Comet Newco Sub, in accordance with the Share
Sale Agreement and Moon Bidco will issue the Exchangeable Note to Comet

obligation under _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ to deposit with the Exchange Agent

Distribution prior to transfer of the issued and outstanding shares in the
capital of Comet Newco Sub to Moon Bidco or its nominee designated
in accordance with the Share Sale Agreement. The time of such execution and
acknowledgment, the "Share Sale Effective Time."

 

Section 2.5 _Comet_ _Newco_ Liquidation.

 

(a) As soon as practicable after the Share Sale Effective Time, Comet Newco
will be dissolved ( _ontbonden_ ) and subsequently liquidated ( _vereffend_ )
in accordance with Sections 2:19 and 2:23b of the Dutch Code (the
"Liquidation") with the Liquidator acting as liquidator ( _vereffenaar_ ) of
Comet Newco. In connection with the Liquidation, it is intended that the
Liquidator shall effectuate the distribution of the consideration paid in the
Share Sale (being the Exchangeable Note, which, other than to the extent any
such notes are to be distributed to Moon Bidco or another beneficial owner of
shares of Comet Newco Sub that is a controlled Affiliate of Moon, shall have
been automatically and mandatorily exchanged for shares of Moon Common Stock
prior to the liquidating distribution) and all other assets then held by Comet
Newco (if any) by means of a liquidation distribution (the "Liquidation
Distribution") (which may be an advance liquidation distribution ( _uitkering_
___bij_ ___voorbaat_ ), and which may be made in one or more installments) to
the shareholders of Comet Newco such that each shareholder of Comet Newco
shall receive shares of Moon Common Stock (with respect to shareholders of
Comet Newco other than Moon Bidco) or a portion of the Exchangeable Note (with
respect to Moon Bidco), in each case, subject to any withholding Taxes,
including any withholding taxes under the Dividend Withholding Tax Act 1965 (
_Wet op de_ _dividendbelasting_ _1965_ ) (the "Dutch Dividend Withholding
Tax"), required to be withheld from the Liquidation Distribution. It is
intended that the Liquidation Distribution shall be made as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section_ __ _
2.5_, the Liquidation Distribution shall ultimately result in holders of
shares of Comet Common Stock not tendered during the Offering Period or
tendered but properly withdrawn receiving in such Liquidation Distribution,
for each share of Comet Common Stock held at the Merger Effective Time, the
Exchange Offer Consideration, subject to any Taxes required to be withheld
from such Liquidation Distribution and with cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Moon Common Stock, on the terms and subject to the conditions of the
Share Sale Agreement and the Exchangeable Note, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time.

(c) The board of directors of the Liquidator shall initially consist of
Chicago Bridge and Iron Company B.V., and Moon Bidco (and Moon shall cause Moon
Bidco to) and Comet shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to (i)
procure that the board of directors of the Liquidator shall, as soon as
practicable after the Comet Shareholders Meeting, solely consist of one or
more professional liquidator(s) or similar service provider(s) (natural
person(s) or a professional liquidator service provider(s)) and (ii) reach
agreement with such service provider as soon as practicable after the date of
this Agreement, _provided_ that such reasonable best efforts obligation shall
in any event not require Moon or Moon Bidco to indemnify Comet Newco for any
of its liabilities pursuant to the Liquidation.

 



14 (d) As soon as reasonably practicable after the completion of the sale of Moon
Common Stock by the Exchange Agent as described below, Comet Newco shall
cause the Exchange Agent to effect the Liquidation Distribution in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and the Exchangeable Note. On behalf of Comet
Newco, the Exchange Agent shall (x) deliver to each shareholder of Comet
Newco (other than Moon Bidco or another beneficial owner of shares of Comet
Newco Sub that is a controlled Affiliate of Moon) a number of shares of Moon
Common Stock equal to (a) the product of (i) the Exchange Offer Ratio and
(ii) the number of shares of Comet Newco held by such shareholder at such time
minus (b) the number of shares of Moon Common Stock sold by the Exchange Agent
to satisfy the payment of any Taxes (including the Dutch Dividend Withholding
Tax) required to be withheld from the Liquidation Distribution, if any, with
respect to such shareholder pursuant to Section 6 of the Exchangeable Note,
and (y) pay the aggregate net cash proceeds from such Moon Common Stock Sale
to the Dutch taxing authority in satisfaction of Comet Newcos obligation to
withhold and remit the Dutch Dividend Withholding Tax. To the extent possible,
the Liquidation Distribution shall be imputed to paid-in capital ( _nominaal_
___aandelenkapitaal_ _en_ _agioreserve_ ) recognized for Dutch Dividend
Withholding Tax purposes and not retained earnings ( _winstreserve_ ), as each
such term is defined under applicable accounting principles. Banks may charge
administrative costs to shareholders of Comet Newco in relation to the
transfer of the Liquidation Distribution to their accounts, for which no
compensation will be paid to such shareholders of Comet Newco. For the
avoidance of doubt, each shareholder of Comet Newco that receives the number
of shares of Moon Common Stock that such shareholder is entitled to receive in
accordance with the second sentence of this  _Section_ __ _ 2.5(d)_ and any
cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 8 of the
Exchangeable Note, shall (1) be deemed to have received the number of shares
of Moon Common Stock equal to the product of the Exchange Offer Ratio and the
number of shares of Comet Newco held by such shareholder (including any such
shares of Moon Common Stock sold in respect of Taxes (including the Dutch
Dividend Withholding Tax) required to be withheld from the Liquidation
Distribution) and (2) thereafter have no further right to receive cash, shares
of Moon Common Stock or any other consideration in respect of the Exchangeable
Note.

 

Section 2.6 _Exchange Agent_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Moon shall appoint an exchange agent that is
reasonably acceptable to Comet (the "Exchange Agent") to act as the agent for
the purpose of (i) exchanging the Exchange Offer Consideration and cash in
lieu of any fractional shares of Moon Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.2(b)_ for shares of Comet Common Stock accepted for exchange by Moon Bidco
in the Exchange Offer, (ii) allotting the Merger Consideration to each holder
of shares of Comet Common Stock at the time of the Merger in accordance with
the Merger Proposal, and (iii) giving effect to the Liquidation Distribution
by the Liquidator. At or promptly following the Effective Time, Moon Bidco
shall deposit, with the Exchange Agent, a number of shares of Moon Common
Stock that are deliverable in respect of (1) all of the shares of Comet
Common Stock accepted for exchange by Moon Bidco and the amount of cash
required to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 2.2(b)_ and (2) all 

 



15  shares of Comet NewCo entitled to receive shares of Moon Common Stock in the
Liquidation Distribution (collectively the "Exchange Fund"). If for any reason
the Exchange Fund is inadequate to deliver all shares of Moon Common Stock to
which holders of shares of Comet Common Stock accepted for exchange shall be
entitled or to which holders of shares of Comet Newco shall be entitled in the
Liquidation Distribution, Moon shall take all steps necessary to enable or
cause Moon Bidco to, prior to or concurrently with the Share Sale, deposit in
trust with the Exchange Agent additional shares of Moon Common Stock
sufficient to make all such exchanges. If for any reason the Exchange Fund is
inadequate to deliver all cash to which holders of shares of Comet Common
Stock accepted for exchange shall be entitled, Moon shall take all steps
necessary to enable or cause Moon Bidco promptly to deposit in trust with
the Exchange Agent additional cash sufficient to make all such exchanges. The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Moon Bidco shall pay
all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection
with the exchange of shares of Comet Common Stock for the Exchange Offer
Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Moon Common Stock
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_.

 

(b) All Exchange Offer Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Moon Common Stock pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_ paid upon the
surrender of shares of Comet Common Stock in the Exchange Offer in accordance
with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such shares of Comet Common Stock.

(c) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Comet Common Stock accepted for exchange by Moon Bidco or by the
holders of shares of Comet Newco who were entitled to receive a portion of the
Exchange Fund in the Liquidation Distribution 12 months after the Effective
Time shall be returned to Moon Bidco, upon demand, and any such holder of
Comet who has not exchanged shares of Comet Common Stock for the Exchange
Offer Consideration or any such holder of Comet Newco who has not received its
portion of the Liquidation Distribution (less any Taxes required to
be withheld from such Liquidation Distribution), and, if applicable, any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Moon Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.2(b)_ or the Exchangeable Note in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _
2.6_ prior to that time, shall thereafter look only to Moon Bidco (subject to
abandoned property, escheat, or other similar Laws), as general creditors
thereof, for payment of the Exchange Offer Consideration, the Liquidation
Distribution and, if applicable, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Moon
Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_ or the Exchangeable Note.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Moon Bidco shall not be liable to any holder
of shares of Comet Common Stock or shares of Comet Newco for any amounts paid
to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat, or
similar Laws. Any shares of Moon Common Stock and any cash made available to
the Exchange Agent by Moon Bidco for payment in lieu of fractional shares of
Moon Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_ remaining unclaimed by
holders of shares of Comet Common Stock or shares of Comet Newco two years
after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such
time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Entity) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
the property of Moon Bidco free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 



16 Section 2.7 _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number or type of
outstanding shares of Moon Common Stock or Comet Common Stock shall occur as a
result of a reclassification, recapitalization, exchange, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), combination or readjustment of shares or
any stock dividend, stock distribution or other similar event (other than, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Moon Reverse Stock Split) with a record date
during such period, the Exchange Offer Ratio and any other similarly dependent
items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ shall be construed to permit any
Party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any
other provision of this Agreement.

CONVERSION OF OUTSTANDING COMET EQUITY AWARDS

 

Section 4.1 _Conversion of Outstanding Equity_ _Awards of Comet_.

 

(a) _Comet Options_. At the Merger Effective Time, all options to acquire
shares of Comet Common Stock (each, a "Comet Option") that are outstanding
and unexercised immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time under Comets
equity incentive plans (collectively, the "Comet Stock Plans," which are
identified in  _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_ of the Comet Disclosure Letter)
immediately shall vest (if unvested), shall cease to represent a right to
acquire Comet Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into a vested
option to acquire shares of Moon Common Stock (an "Assumed Comet Option") in
amounts and at an exercise price determined as provided in this _Section_ __ _
4.1(a)_ (and otherwise subject to the terms of the Comet Stock Plans,
as applicable, under which they were issued and the agreements evidencing
grants thereunder except as provided in this _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_). The
number of shares of Moon Common Stock to be subject to an Assumed Comet
Option resulting from the conversion of a Comet Option shall be equal to the
product of the number of shares of Comet Common Stock subject to the Comet
Option immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Offer Ratio,  _provided_ that any fractional shares of Moon Common
Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest
whole share. The exercise price per share of Moon Common Stock under an
Assumed Comet Option resulting from the conversion of a Comet Option shall be
equal to the exercise price per share of Comet Common Stock under the original
Comet Option immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time divided by the
Exchange Offer Ratio, _provided_ that such exercise price shall be rounded up
to the nearest whole cent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exercise price
and/or the number of shares of Moon Common Stock that may be purchased under
each such Assumed Comet Option shall be further adjusted to the extent
required to remain in compliance with, or exempt from, the requirements of
Section 409A of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code") and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and, in the case
of each Comet Option that is intended to qualify as an "incentive stock
option" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, the exercise price and
the number of shares of Moon Common Stock subject to the Assumed Comet
Option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of
Section 424 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.
The duration and other terms of an Assumed Comet Option resulting from the
conversion of a Comet Option shall otherwise remain the same as the original
Comet Option from which it was converted except that all references to "Comet"
in such original Comet Option shall be deemed to be references to Moon.

 

(b) _Comet Performance Shares_. At the Merger Effective Time, each performance
share award granted under any Comet Stock Plan (collectively, the "Comet
Performance Share Awards") (whether or not vested) that is outstanding as of
the date hereof and remains outstanding immediately prior to the Merger
Effective Time, shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
cash, without interest, in an amount equal to (i) (A) the Exchange Offer Ratio
_times_ (B) the target number of shares of Comet Common Stock subject to the
Comet Performance Share Award _times_ (C) the closing price for a share of
Moon Common Stock on the NYSE Composite Transactions Tape on the Business Day
immediately

 



19  preceding the Closing Date _plus_ (ii) cash in an amount equal to any
dividend equivalents associated with such Comet Performance Share Awards as of
the Merger Effective Time, subject to any withholding Taxes required by Law
to be withheld. Any cash payable in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence shall be paid or delivered within five (5) days following the Merger
Effective Time; provided that notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any
payment in respect of a Comet Performance Share Award that, immediately prior
to the Merger Effective Time, was subject to Section 409A of the Code, shall
be made at such time as is required to comply with Section 409A of the Code.
Comet shall make arrangements reasonably satisfactory to Moon to satisfy all
employment and income tax withholding requirements, if applicable, with
respect to the Comet Performance Share Awards as a result of the consummation
of the transactions as contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) _Rollover Comet Restricted Stock Units_. Except as otherwise provided in
_Section_ __ _ 4.1(d)_, at the Merger Effective Time, each restricted stock
unit award granted under any Comet Stock Plan (collectively, the "Comet
Restricted Stock Unit Awards") that is outstanding and unvested immediately
prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be converted into and become a right
to receive a restricted stock unit award with respect to Moon Common Stock
with the same terms as those of the applicable Comet Restricted Stock
Unit Award and the agreement by which such Comet Restricted Stock Unit Award
is evidenced (all outstanding Comet Restricted Stock Unit Awards that are
assumed pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.1(c)_ are hereafter referred to
as "Assumed Comet RSU Awards"). Accordingly, from and after the Merger
Effective Time: (A) each Assumed Comet RSU Award will be settled in shares of
Moon Common Stock; (B) the number of shares of Moon Common Stock subject
to each Assumed Comet RSU Award shall be determined by multiplying the number
of shares of Comet Common Stock that were subject to such Assumed Comet RSU
Award immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time by the Exchange Offer
Ratio, and rounding the resulting number to the nearest whole number of
shares of Moon Common Stock; and (C) any conditions and restrictions on the
receipt of any Assumed Comet RSU Awards shall continue in full force and
effect and the term, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Assumed
Comet RSU Awards (including terms relating to acceleration of vesting upon
termination of employment, in all cases, as in effect immediately prior to the
Merger Effective Time) shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the
assumption of such Assumed Comet RSU Awards.

(d) _Certain Comet Restricted Stock Units and Director Deferred Share Awards._
At the Merger Effective Time, (w) each Comet Restricted Stock Unit Award
(whether vested or unvested) held by a non-employee member of the Comet
Supervisory Board, (x) each vested Comet Restricted Stock Unit Award held by
a Covered Comet Executive that has not yet been settled, (y) each Comet
Restricted Stock Unit Award that vests in accordance with its terms as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (z) each vested share of Comet Common Stock deferred pursuant
to a Comet Stock Plan (each, a "Director Deferred Share Award"), in each case,
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall
be cancelled and converted into the right to receive (i) a number of shares
of Moon Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole number) equal to (A) the
Exchange Offer Ratio _times_ (B) the number of shares of Comet Common
Stock subject to the Comet Restricted Stock Unit Award or Director Deferred
Share Award, as applicable, immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time
_plus_ (ii) cash in an

 



20  amount equal to any dividend equivalents associated with such award
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, subject to any withholding
Taxes required by Law to be withheld. Any shares of Moon Common Stock or cash
payable in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence shall be paid or
delivered within five (5) days following the Merger Effective Time; provided
that notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any payment in respect of a
Comet Restricted Stock Unit Award or Director Deferred share Award that,
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, was subject to Section 409A of
the Code, shall be made at such time as is required to comply with Section
409A of the Code. Comet shall make arrangements reasonably satisfactory to
Moon to satisfy all employment and income tax withholding requirements, if
applicable, with respect to such Comet Restricted Stock Unit Awards, as
applicable as result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Covered Comet Executive"
means any executive officer of Comet who is set forth on Section 4.1(d) of the
Comet Disclosure Letter.

(e) _Post-Signing Equity Awards_. Any Comet Restricted Stock Unit Award
granted after the date hereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)(vii)_,
shall, as of the Merger Effective Time, cease to represent a right to receive
Comet Common Stock and shall be converted into an Assumed Comet RSU Award
with respect to a number of whole shares of Moon Common Stock in the same
manner described in _Section_ __ _ 4.1(c)_ above, as applicable; _provided,
however_ , that the consummation of the transactions as contemplated by this
Agreement shall not be considered a change in control for purposes of such
Comet Restricted Stock Unit Award.

(f)  _Assumed Awards_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) Moon shall assume
all obligations with respect to each Assumed Comet Option and Assumed Comet
RSU Award (collectively, the "Assumed Awards"), (2) each Assumed Award shall,
in accordance with its terms, be subject to further adjustment as appropriate
to reflect any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction with respect to Moon Common
Stock subsequent to the Merger Effective Time; (3) the Moon Board or an
appropriate committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and
responsibility of the Comet Boards or any committee thereof with respect to
each Assumed Award and (4) Moon shall reserve for issuance a number of shares
of Moon Common Stock sufficient to cover the Assumed Awards.

 

(g) _Assumed Plans_. At the Merger Effective Time, Moon will assume the Comet
Stock Plans. Following the Merger Effective Time, under such Comet Stock
Plan, as applicable, Moon will be entitled to grant equity or equity-based
incentive awards with respect to Moon Common Stock, to the extent permissible
under applicable Law, using the share reserves of such Comet Stock Plan as of
the Merger Effective Time (including any shares of Moon Common Stock returned
to such share reserves as a result of the termination or forfeiture of an
Assumed Award granted pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.1_), except
that: (i) shares covered by such awards will be shares of Moon Common Stock;
(ii) all references in such Comet Stock Plan to a number of shares will be
deemed amended to refer instead to that number of shares of Moon Common Stock
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) as adjusted pursuant to the
application of the Exchange Offer Ratio; and (iii) the Moon Board or a
committee thereof will succeed to the authority and responsibility of the
Comet Boards or any applicable committee thereof with respect to the
administration of such Comet Stock Plan.

 



21 (h) _ESPP_. As soon as practicable following the date hereof, Comet shall take
all actions with respect to Comets Employee Stock Purchase Plan and
Supervisory Board of Directors Stock Purchase Plan (collectively, the "ESPPs")
that are necessary to provide that the ESPPs shall be suspended effective
January 1, 2018. Comet shall terminate the ESPPs in their entirety effective
as of, and contingent on the Merger Effective Time.

the preparation of such opinion, the Exchange Offer Ratio is fair, from a

approval at the Moon Stockholders Meeting by the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Moon Common Stock,

affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of the votes cast on the

referred to as the "Moon Stockholder Approval"). "Moon Authorized Capital
Articles Amendment" means an amendment to Moons articles of incorporation to
increase Moons authorized capital to 255,000,000 shares of Moon Common Stock,
an amount sufficient to enable the Moon Stock Issuance, assuming the Moon

Meeting before the vote on the Moon Authorized Capital Articles Amendment;
_provided_ that if the Moon Reverse Stock Split Articles Amendment is not
approved at the Moon Stockholders Meeting before the vote on the Moon
Authorized Capital Articles Amendment, such amendment to Moons articles of
incorporation shall be to increase Moons authorized capital to 765,000,000
shares of Moon Common Stock. "Moon Reverse Stock Split Articles Amendment"
means an amendment to Moons articles of incorporation to effect a 3-to-1
reverse stock split (the "Moon Reverse Stock Split") of the Moon Common Stock
prior to the Effective Time. "Moon Stock Issuance" means the proposed issuance
of shares of Moon Common Stock in the Exchange Offer and in connection with
the Core Transactions (including the issuance of the Exchangeable Note and of
Moon Common Stock issuable upon exchange thereof). Assuming approval of the
Moon Reverse Stock Split Articles Amendment is obtained, such amendment may
be included in the same amendment to Moons articles of incorporation as the
Moon Authorized Capital Articles Amendment.

Statement/Prospectus or any other parts of the Form S-4. Each of Moon and
Comet shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the SEC advise Moon and
Comet as promptly as reasonably practicable that the SEC has no further
comments on the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any other parts of the Form S-4.

 

(c) On the date of commencement of the Exchange Offer, Moon and Moon Bidco
shall prepare and file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule TO") with
respect to the Exchange Offer, which Schedule TO shall contain as an exhibit
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus constituting the offer to purchase and forms
of the letter(s) of transmittal in customary form and other customary
ancillary documents and instruments pursuant to which the Exchange Offer will
be made (together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the "Exchange
Offer Documents"). Moon and Moon Bidco will cause the Exchange Offer Documents
to comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of U.S.
Federal securities laws. Moon and Moon Bidco will take all steps necessary to
cause the Exchange Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of shares of
Comet Common Stock, as and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal
securities laws. Each of Moon and Moon Bidco and Comet shall promptly correct
any information provided by it or on its behalf specifically for inclusion in
the Exchange Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise
required by applicable law, and Moon and Moon Bidco shall take all steps
necessary to amend or supplement the Exchange Offer Documents and to cause the
Exchange Offer Documents as so amended and supplemented to be disseminated to
holders of shares of Comet Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable U.S. federal securities laws.

 



78 (d) On the date of the commencement of the Exchange Offer, concurrently with
the filing of the Schedule TO, Comet shall file with the SEC a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Exchange Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto,
the "Schedule 14D-9") and disseminate the Schedule 14D-9, to the extent
required by Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act and any other
applicable laws, to the holders of shares of Comet Common Stock. Comet shall
cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply as to form in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of U.S. federal securities laws.

(e) Each of Moon and Comet shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt
thereof, provide the other Party copies of any written comments, and advise
the other Party of any oral comments, received from the SEC with respect to
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Form S-4, the Exchange Offer Documents or
the Schedule 14D-9 and shall provide the other Parties with copies of all
correspondence between it and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the SEC, on
the other hand. Each of Moon and Comet, as applicable, shall provide the
other with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Form S-4, the
Exchange Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 or any amendment or
supplement to any of the foregoing and any communications with the SEC prior
to filing such with the SEC, and will promptly provide Comet with a copy of
all such filings and communications made with the SEC.

 

(f) Moon shall take any action required to be taken under any applicable state
securities laws in connection with the issuance of Moon Common Stock in
connection with the Combination, and Comet shall, as applicable, furnish all
information concerning Comet as may be reasonably requested in connection with
any such action. Moon shall advise Comet, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective, the issuance of
any stop order, or the suspension of the qualification of the Moon Common
Stock issuable in connection with the Combination for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, and Moon shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any such
stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated.

 

(g) If at any time prior to the making of the Liquidation Distribution any
information relating to Moon or Comet, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by Moon or Comet which should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4, the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, the Exchange Offer Documents or the Schedule 14D-9 so
that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other Parties and, to the extent required by applicable Law, an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
filed promptly with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders or
shareholders of Moon and Comet.

80 (c) _Coordination Regarding Comet Shareholders Meeting._ Comet shall
coordinate and cooperate with Moon and its Affiliates with respect to the
convening materials and the timing of the Comet Shareholders Meeting and will

Comet Shareholders Meeting to a date that is more than 30 days after the
originally scheduled Comet Shareholders Meeting.

requirements applicable to the Moon Stockholders Meeting. Once the Moon
Stockholders Meeting has been called and noticed, Moon shall not postpone or
adjourn the Moon Stockholders Meeting without the consent of Comet (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), other
than to the extent necessary (i) for the absence of a quorum or (ii) to
solicit additional proxies if, on the date for which the Moon Stockholders

Section 7.5 _No Solicitation_ _by Comet_.

 

(a) Except as permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_, Comet agrees that from
and after the date of this Agreement, it shall (i) immediately cease and
terminate, and cause all of its and its Subsidiaries respective officers,
directors, employees, investment bankers, consultants, attorneys, accountants,
advisors, agents and other representatives (with respect to any Person, the
foregoing Persons are referred to herein as such Persons "Representatives")
to cease and terminate, any discussions or negotiations with any other Person
(other than Moon or its Affiliates) regarding any Comet Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) promptly request, and cause to be requested, that each Person that has
received confidential information in connection with a possible Comet
Acquisition Proposal within the last 12 months return to Comet or destroy all
confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf
of Comet or any of its Subsidiaries and promptly prohibit any access by any
Person (other than Moon and its Representatives) to any physical or electronic
data room relating to a possible Comet Acquisition Proposal and (iii) not
grant any waiver or release under or knowingly fail to enforce any
confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement entered into or amended
during the 12 months immediately preceding the date of this Agreement in
respect of a proposed Comet Acquisition Proposal unless the Comet Boards
conclude in good faith that a failure to take any action described in this
clause (iii) would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary obligations
to Comets shareholders and other stakeholders under applicable Law. From and
after the date of this Agreement, except as otherwise permitted by this
_Section_ __ _ 7.5_ or  _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_, Comet shall not, directly
or indirectly, nor shall Comet authorize or permit its Subsidiaries or its or
their respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) take any
action to solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or facilitate (including
by way of furnishing nonpublic information), or engage in, continue or
otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations regarding, any inquiry,
proposal or offer, or the making, submission or announcement of any inquiry,
proposal or offer (including any inquiry, proposal or offer to its
shareholders) which constitutes or would be reasonably expected to lead to a
Comet Acquisition Proposal (except to notify such Person of the existence of
the provisions of this

 



82   _Section_ __ _ 7.5_), (ii) furnish any nonpublic or confidential
information or afford access to properties, books or records to any Person in
connection with or for the purpose of soliciting, encouraging or facilitating
a Comet Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend, or propose to
approve or recommend, or execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement
in principle, merger agreement, stock purchase agreement, asset purchase
agreement or stock exchange, or option agreement, relating to a Comet
Acquisition Proposal (other than confidentiality agreements contemplated by
this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ or a definitive agreement entered into or to be
entered into concurrently with a termination of this Agreement by Comet
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_), or (iv) propose publicly or agree to do
any of the foregoing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Comet
acknowledges and agrees that, in the event any officer, director or financial
advisor of Comet takes any action that if taken by Comet would be a breach of
this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_, the taking of such action by such officer,
director or financial advisor shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this
_Section_ __ _ 7.5_ by Comet. In furtherance of its obligations hereunder, to
the extent that any of the Comet Parties has knowledge that any
Representative of the Comet Parties has taken an action that, if taken by any
of the Comet Parties, would violate the restrictions set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.5_, then such Comet Party shall promptly instruct
such Representative to cease such action.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.5(a)_, prior to (but
not after) the occurrence of the Comet Shareholder Approval, Comet may,
directly or indirectly through its Representatives, (i) furnish information
and access, but only in response to an unsolicited Comet Acquisition Proposal
that is submitted to Comet by a third Person after the date of this Agreement
(for so long as such Comet Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn) and
(ii) participate in discussions and negotiate with such Person concerning any
such unsolicited Comet Acquisition Proposal, if and only if, (A) the
submission of such Comet Acquisition Proposal did not result from or arise in
connection with a breach of this _Section_ __ 7.5 and (B) the Comet Boards
conclude, after receipt of the advice of a financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, that such Comet Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to
result in a Comet Superior Proposal, and (iii) Comet receives from the Person
making such Comet Acquisition Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement
the material terms of which, as they relate to confidentiality, are (without
regard to the terms of such Comet Acquisition Proposal) in all material
respects (A) no less favorable in the aggregate to Comet and (B) no less
restrictive in the aggregate to the Person making such Comet Acquisition
Proposal than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement dated August
15, 2017 between Moon and Comet (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). Moon shall
be entitled to receive an executed copy of any such confidentiality agreement
and notification of the identity of such Person promptly (and in any event
within 24 hours) after Comets entering into such discussions or negotiations
or furnishing information to the Person making such Comet Acquisition Proposal
or its Representatives. Comet shall promptly provide or make available to Moon
any nonpublic information concerning Comet and any of its Subsidiaries that
is provided to the Person making such Comet Acquisition Proposal or its
Representatives which was not previously provided or made available to Moon.

 

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 7.5(c)_, the Comet
Boards shall make the Comet Recommendation, and unless permitted by this
_Section_ __ _ 7.5(c)_, neither the Comet Boards nor any committee thereof
shall (i) (A) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose to withhold, withdraw,
modify or qualify, in any manner adverse to Moon or its

 



83  Affiliates, the approval of this Agreement or the Comet Recommendation, (B)
recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or
approve any Comet Acquisition Proposal, or (C) resolve, or publicly propose
or agree to do any of the foregoing (any action described in this clause (i)
being referred to as a "Comet Change in Recommendation") or (ii) approve,
endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend,
or allow Comet or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter
of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to,
or that is intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Comet
Acquisition Proposal or that would require Comet to abandon, terminate or
fail to consummate the Combination (other than a confidentiality agreement
entered into in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.5(b)_) (a "Comet Acquisition
Agreement") or (iii) resolve, agree or publicly propose to do any of the
foregoing. For purposes of this Agreement, a Comet Change in Recommendation
shall include any approval, endorsement or recommendation (or public proposal
to approve, endorse or recommend), by the Comet Boards or any committee
thereof of a Comet Acquisition Proposal, but shall not include any notice
provided to Moon with respect to such Comet Acquisition Proposal and Comets
views thereof prior to any definitive Comet Change in
Recommendation. Notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to Comets
compliance with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.5(d)_, if the Comet Boards
have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel, that a Comet Acquisition Proposal made after the
date hereof that did not result from and was not proximately caused by a
breach of any of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ constitutes a
Comet Superior Proposal, (i) the Comet Boards may make a Comet Change in
Recommendation or (ii) Comet may terminate this Agreement, upon payment of the
Comet Termination Fee in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.5(a)_, in order to
enter into any agreement, understanding or arrangement providing for a Comet
Acquisition Proposal if all of the following conditions are met: (x) the Comet
Shareholder Approval has not been obtained; (y) (1) Comet gives Moon written
notice (a "Comet Superior Proposal Notice") at least four Business Days prior
to taking such action, which notice advises Moon of the intention of the Comet
Boards to take such action and such notice specifies the material terms
and conditions of such Comet Acquisition Proposal, identifies the Person
making such Comet Acquisition Proposal and includes a copy of the proposed
Comet Acquisition Agreement (if any) (provided that if there are any
subsequent changes in the financial terms of such proposal, Comet will not
take any such action prior to the second Business Day following a subsequent
notice to Moon of such changes) (it being understood that there may be
multiple extensions), (2) during a period of four Business Days following
Moons receipt of a Comet Superior Proposal Notice (or, in the event of a new
Comet Superior Proposal Notice as a result of any such amendment, an extension
of two additional Business Days), if requested by Moon, Comet and
its Representatives shall have negotiated with Moon and its Representatives
in good faith to make such revisions or adjustments proposed by Moon to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement as would cause such Comet Acquisition
Proposal to no longer be a Comet Superior Proposal; and (z) if applicable, at
the end of such applicable four- or two-Business Day period, the Comet Boards,
after considering in good faith any such revisions or adjustments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement that Moon, prior to the expiration
of such applicable period, shall have offered in writing in a manner that
would form a binding contract if accepted by Comet, continues to determine in
good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and

 



84  financial advisors) that the Comet Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Comet
Superior Proposal and that failure to make such Comet Change in Recommendation
or to terminate this Agreement would be inconsistent with the directors
exercise of their fiduciary obligations to Comets shareholders and other
stakeholders under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that, unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with the terms hereof, Comet shall
nevertheless submit the resolutions subject to the Comet Shareholder Approval
to the shareholders of Comet for the purpose of obtaining the Comet
Shareholder Approval at the Comet Shareholders Meeting, and nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Comet of such obligation, unless
Moon otherwise requests Comet in writing or this Agreement shall have been
terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the Comet Shareholders
Meeting.

 

(d) In the event Comet receives a Comet Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry,
proposal or indication of interest that would reasonably be expected to lead
to a Comet Acquisition Proposal, any request for nonpublic information
relating to Comet or any Comet Subsidiary or for access to the properties,
books or records of Comet or any Comet Subsidiary by any Person that has made
or, to the knowledge of Comet, would reasonably be expected to make, a Comet
Acquisition Proposal, or any request for discussions or negotiations are
sought to be initiated or continued with, Comet in respect of any Comet
Acquisition Proposal, Comet will (i) as promptly as practicable (and in no
event later than 48 hours after receipt of any such Comet Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry, proposal, indication of interest or request) notify (which
notice shall be provided orally and confirmed in writing and shall identify
the Person making such Comet Acquisition Proposal or request and set forth the
material terms thereof (including a copy of such Comet Acquisition Proposal),
to the extent known) Moon thereof and (ii) keep Moon reasonably and promptly
informed of the status and material terms of (including with respect to
changes to the status or material terms of) any such Comet Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry, proposal, indication of interest or request.

 

(e) Subject to Moons rights under _Article 9_ , nothing in this _Section_ __
_ 7.5_ shall prohibit either Comet Board from taking and disclosing to
Comets shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9
(including any "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f)) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange
Act, or other applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that no such disclosure
that would amount to a Comet Change in Recommendation shall be permitted, made
or taken other than in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.5(c)_.

 

(f) Other than in connection with a Comet Acquisition Proposal, Comet may, at
any time prior to, but not after, occurrence of the Comet Shareholder
Approval, make a Comet Change in Recommendation in response to a Comet
Intervening Event (a "Comet Intervening Event Change in Recommendation") if
the Comet Boards determine in good faith, after consulting with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Comet Boards to Comets shareholders and other
stakeholders under applicable Law, _provided_ that: (A) Moon shall have
received written notice from Comet of Comets intention to make a Comet
Intervening Event Change in Recommendation at least four Business Days prior
to the taking of such action by Comet, which notice shall specify the
applicable Comet Intervening Event in reasonable detail, (B) during such
period and prior to making a Comet Intervening Event Change in Recommendation,
if requested by Moon, Comet and its Representatives shall have negotiated

 



85  in good faith with Moon and its Representatives regarding any revisions or
adjustments proposed by Moon to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as
would enable Comet to proceed with its recommendation of this Agreement and
the Combination and not make such Comet Intervening Event Change in
Recommendation and (C) Comet may make a Comet Intervening Event Change in
Recommendation only if the Comet Boards, after considering in good faith any
revisions or adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that
Moon shall have, prior to the expiration of the four-Business Day period,
offered in writing in a manner that would form a binding contract if accepted
by Comet, continue to determine in good faith that failure to make a Comet
Intervening Event Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with their
fiduciary duties to Comets shareholders and other stakeholders under
applicable Law.

 

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

"Comet Acquisition Proposal" means any _bona fide_ written offer or proposal
for, or any _bona fide_ written indication of interest in, any (i) direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase of any business or assets of (A) Comet or any
of its Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, constitutes 15% or
more of the net revenues, net income or assets of Comet and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or (B) all or substantially all of the business or assets of
the CT Entities, (ii) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 15% or
more of any class of equity securities of Comet, (iii) tender offer or
exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person beneficially
owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities of Comet, or (iv) merger,
consolidation, business combination, joint venture, partnership,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
Comet or any of its Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 15% or more of the
net revenue, net income or assets of Comet and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole.

"Comet Intervening Event" means any fact, circumstance, occurrence, event,
development, change or condition or combination thereof that (i) was not
known to the Comet Boards as of the date of this Agreement (or if known, the
consequences or magnitude of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable),
but becomes known to a Comet Board prior to the Comet Shareholder Approval,
and (ii) does not relate to (A) any Comet Acquisition Proposal or (B)
clearance of the Combination under the HSR Act or any other Regulatory Law,
including any action in connection therewith taken pursuant to or required to
be taken pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.8_; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1)
any change in the price or trading volume of Comet Common Stock or Moon Common
Stock shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether a
Comet Intervening Event has occurred (it being acknowledged, however, that any
underlying cause thereof may be taken into account for purposes of determining
whether a Comet Intervening Event has occurred); (2) in no event shall any
fact, circumstance, occurrence, event, development, change or condition or
combination thereof that has had or would reasonably be expected to have an
adverse effect on the business or financial condition of Moon or any of
its Subsidiaries constitute a Comet Intervening Event unless such fact,
circumstance, occurrence, event, development, change or condition or
combination thereof constitutes a Moon Material Adverse Effect; and (3) Comet
or Moon meeting, failing to meet or exceeding projections shall not be taken
into account for purposes of determining whether a Comet Intervening Event has
occurred (it being acknowledged, however, that any underlying cause thereof
may be taken into account for purposes of determining whether a Comet
Intervening Event has occurred).

 



86 "Comet Superior Proposal" means any Comet Acquisition Proposal,
substituting "75%" for "15%," on terms that the Comet Boards determine in
their good faith judgment (after taking into account all financial, legal,
regulatory, timing, risk of consummation and other aspects of such Comet
Acquisition Proposal and after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) are substantially more favorable to Comet and its
shareholders and other stakeholders than the Combination and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (taking into account the likelihood of
consummation on the terms so proposed and all such other factors as the Comet
Boards deem relevant).

 

Section 7.6 _No Solicitation by Moon_.

 

(a) Except as permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_, Moon agrees that from
and after the date of this Agreement, it shall (i) immediately cease and
terminate, and cause all of its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to cease
and terminate, any discussions or negotiations with any other Person (other
than Comet or its Affiliates) regarding any Moon Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
promptly request, and cause to be requested, that each Person that has
received confidential information in connection with a possible Moon
Acquisition Proposal within the last 12 months return to Moon or destroy
all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on
behalf of Moon or any of its Subsidiaries and promptly prohibit any access by
any Person (other than Comet and its Representatives) to any physical or
electronic data room relating to a possible Moon Acquisition Proposal and
(iii) not grant any waiver or release under or knowingly fail to enforce any
confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement entered into or amended
during the 12 months immediately preceding the date of this Agreement in
respect of a proposed Moon Acquisition Proposal unless the Moon Board
concludes in good faith that a failure to take any action described in this
clause (iii) would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary obligations
to Moons stockholders under applicable Law. From and after the date of this
Agreement, except as otherwise permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ and 
_Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_, Moon shall not, directly or indirectly, nor shall
Moon authorize or permit its Subsidiaries or its or their respective
Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) take any action to
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of
furnishing nonpublic information), or engage in, continue or otherwise
participate in discussions or negotiations regarding, any inquiry, proposal or
offer, or the making, submission or announcement of any inquiry, proposal or
offer (including any inquiry, proposal or offer to its stockholders) which
constitutes or would be reasonably expected to lead to a Moon Acquisition
Proposal (except to notify such Person of the existence of the provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_), (ii) furnish any nonpublic or confidential
information or afford access to properties, books or records to any Person in
connection with or for the purpose of soliciting, encouraging or facilitating
a Moon Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve
or recommend, or execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, stock purchase agreement, asset purchase
agreement or stock exchange, or option agreement, relating to a Moon
Acquisition Proposal (other than confidentiality agreements contemplated by
this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ or a definitive agreement entered into or to
be entered into concurrently with a termination of this Agreement by Moon
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.4(b)_), or (iv) propose publicly or agree to do
any of the foregoing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Moon 

 



87  acknowledges and agrees that, in the event any officer, director or
financial advisor of Moon takes any action that if taken by Moon would be a
breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.6_, the taking of such action by such
officer, director or financial advisor shall be deemed to constitute a breach
of this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ by Moon. In furtherance of its
obligations hereunder, to the extent that any of the Moon Parties has
knowledge that any Representative of the Moon Parties has taken an action
that, if taken by any of the Moon Parties, would violate the restrictions set
forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.6_, then such Moon Party shall promptly
instruct such Representative to cease such action.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.6(a)_, prior to (but
not after) the occurrence of the Moon Stockholder Approval, Moon may, directly
or indirectly through its Representatives, (i) furnish information
and access, but only in response to an unsolicited Moon Acquisition Proposal
that is submitted to Moon by a third Person after the date of this Agreement
(for so long as such Moon Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn) and
(ii) participate in discussions and negotiate with such Person concerning any
such unsolicited Moon Acquisition Proposal, if and only if, (A) the submission
of such Moon Acquisition Proposal did not result from or arise in connection
with a breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ and (B) the Moon Board concludes
in good faith, after receipt of the advice of a financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, that such Moon Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to
result in a Moon Superior Proposal, and (iii) Moon receives from the Person
making such Moon Acquisition Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement
the material terms of which, as they relate to confidentiality, are (without
regard to the terms of such Moon Acquisition Proposal) in all material
respects (A) no less favorable in the aggregate to Moon and (B) no less
restrictive in the aggregate to the Person making such Moon Acquisition
Proposal than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement. Comet shall
be entitled to receive an executed copy of any such confidentiality agreement
and notification of the identity of such Person promptly (and in any event
within 24 hours) after Moons entering into such discussions or negotiations
or furnishing information to the Person making such Moon Acquisition Proposal
or its Representatives. Moon shall promptly provide or make available to Comet
any nonpublic information concerning Moon and any of its Subsidiaries that
is provided to the Person making such Moon Acquisition Proposal or its
Representatives which was not previously provided or made available to Comet.

 

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 7.6(c)_, the Moon
Board shall make the Moon Recommendation, and unless permitted by this
_Section_ __ _ 7.6(c)_, neither the Moon Board nor any committee thereof
shall (i) (A) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose to withhold, withdraw,
modify or qualify, in any manner adverse to Comet or its Affiliates, the
approval of this Agreement or the Moon Recommendation, (B) recommend, adopt or
approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve any Moon
Acquisition Proposal, or (C) resolve or publicly propose or agree to do any
of the foregoing (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as
a "Moon Change in Recommendation") or (ii) approve, endorse or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend, or allow Moon or any of
its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to, or that is
intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Moon Acquisition
Proposal or that would require Moon to abandon, terminate or fail to 

 



88  consummate the Combination (other than a confidentiality agreement entered
into in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.6(b)_) (a "Moon Acquisition
Agreement") or (iii) resolve, agree or publicly propose to do any of the
foregoing. For purposes of this Agreement, a Moon Change in Recommendation
shall include any approval, endorsement or recommendation (or public proposal
to approve, endorse or recommend), by the Moon Board or any committee thereof
of a Moon Acquisition Proposal, but shall not include any notice provided to
Comet with respect to such Moon Acquisition Proposal and Moons views thereof
prior to any definitive Moon Change in Recommendation. Notwithstanding the
foregoing but subject to Moons compliance with the provisions of _Section_ __
_ 7.6(d)_, if the Moon Board has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that a Moon
Acquisition Proposal made after the date hereof that did not result from and
was not proximately caused by a breach of any of the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 7.6_ constitutes a Moon Superior Proposal, (i) the Moon Board
may make a Moon Change in Recommendation or (ii) Moon may terminate this
Agreement, upon payment of the Moon Termination Fee in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 9.5(b)_, in order to enter into any agreement, understanding
or arrangement providing for a Moon Acquisition Proposal if all of the
following conditions are met: (x) the Moon Stockholder Approval has not been
obtained; (y) (1) Moon gives Comet written notice (a "Moon Superior Proposal
Notice") at least four Business Days prior to taking such action, which notice
advises Comet of the intention of the Moon Board to take such action and such
notice specifies the material terms and conditions of such Moon Acquisition
Proposal, identifies the Person making such Moon Acquisition Proposal and
includes a copy of the proposed Moon Acquisition Agreement (if any) (provided
that if there are any subsequent changes in the financial terms of such
proposal, Moon will not take any such action prior to the second Business Day
following a subsequent notice to Comet of such changes) (it being understood
that there may be multiple extensions), (2) during a period of four Business
Days following Comets receipt of a Moon Superior Proposal Notice (or, in the
event of a new Moon Superior Proposal Notice as a result of any such
amendment, an extension of two additional Business Days), if requested by
Comet, Moon and its Representatives shall have negotiated with Comet and its
Representatives in good faith to make such revisions or adjustments proposed
by Comet to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would cause such
Moon Acquisition Proposal to no longer be a Moon Superior Proposal; and (z)
if applicable, at the end of such applicable four- or two-Business Day period,
the Moon Board, after considering in good faith any such revisions or
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that Comet, prior
to the expiration of such applicable period, shall have offered in writing in
a manner that would form a binding contract if accepted by Moon, continues to
determine in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and
financial advisors) that the Moon Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Moon
Superior Proposal and that failure to make such Moon Change in Recommendation
or to terminate this Agreement would be inconsistent with the directors
exercise of their fiduciary obligations to Moons Stockholders and other
stakeholders under applicable Law, _provided_ , _however_ , that, unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with the terms hereof, Moon shall
nevertheless submit this Agreement and the Combination to the stockholders of
Moon for the purpose of obtaining the Moon Stockholder Approval at the Moon
Stockholders Meeting, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve
Moon of such obligation, unless Comet otherwise requests Moon in writing or
this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms prior
to the Moon Stockholders Meeting.

 



89 (d) In the event Moon receives a Moon Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry,
proposal or indication of interest that would reasonably be expected to lead
to a Moon Acquisition Proposal, any request for nonpublic information relating
to Moon or any Moon Subsidiary or for access to the properties, books or
records of Moon or any Moon Subsidiary by any Person that has made or, to the
knowledge of Moon, would reasonably be expected to make, a Moon Acquisition
Proposal, or any request for discussions or negotiations are sought to be
initiated or continued with, Moon in respect of any Moon Acquisition
Proposal, Moon will (i) as promptly as practicable (and in no event later than
48 hours after receipt of any such Moon Acquisition Proposal, inquiry,
proposal, indication of interest or request) notify (which notice shall
be provided orally and confirmed in writing and shall identify the Person
making such Moon Acquisition Proposal or request and set forth the material
terms thereof (including a copy of such Moon Acquisition Proposal), to the
extent known) Comet thereof and (ii) keep Comet reasonably and promptly
informed of the status and material terms of (including with respect to
changes to the status or material terms of) any such Moon Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry, proposal, indication of interest or request.

(e) Subject to Comets rights under _Article 9_ , nothing in this _Section_ __
_ 7.6_ shall prohibit the Moon Board from taking and disclosing to Moons
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 (including
any "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)) or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or other
applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that no such disclosure that would
amount to a Moon Change in Recommendation shall be permitted, made or taken
other than in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.6(c)_.

 

(f) Other than in connection with a Moon Acquisition Proposal, Moon may, at
any time prior to, but not after, occurrence of the Moon Stockholder
Approval, make a Moon Change in Recommendation in response to a Moon
Intervening Event (a "Moon Intervening Event Change in Recommendation") if the
Moon Board determines in good faith, after consulting with outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the fiduciary duties of the Moon Board to Moons stockholders under
applicable Law, _provided_ that: (A) Comet shall have received written notice
from Moon of Moons intention to make a Moon Intervening Event Change in
Recommendation at least four Business Days prior to the taking of such action
by Moon, which notice shall specify the applicable Moon Intervening Event in
reasonable detail, (B) during such period and prior to making a Moon
Intervening Event Change in Recommendation, if requested by Comet, Moon and
its Representatives shall have negotiated in good faith with Comet and its
Representatives regarding any revisions or adjustments proposed by Comet to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable Moon to proceed
with its recommendation of this Agreement and the Combination and not make
such Moon Intervening Event Change in Recommendation and (C) Moon may make a
Moon Intervening Event Change in Recommendation only if the Moon Board, after
considering in good faith any revisions or adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement that Comet shall have, prior to the expiration
of the four-Business Day period, offered in writing in a manner that would
form a binding contract if accepted by Moon, continues to determine in good
faith that failure to make a Moon Intervening Event Change in Recommendation
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Moons stockholders under
applicable Law.

 



90 (g) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

"Moon Acquisition Proposal" means any _bona fide_ written offer or proposal
for, or any _bona fide_ written indication of interest in, any (i) direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase of any business or assets of Moon or any of
its Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, constitutes 15% or
more of the net revenues, net income or assets of Moon and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, (ii) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 15% or
more of any class of equity securities of Moon, (iii) tender offer or exchange
offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person beneficially owning
15% or more of any class of equity securities of Moon, or (iv) merger,
consolidation, business combination, joint venture, partnership,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
Moon or any of its Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 15% or more of the
net revenue, net income or assets of Moon and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

 

"Moon Intervening Event" means any fact, circumstance, occurrence, event,
development, change or condition or combination thereof that (i) was not
known to the Moon Board as of the date of this Agreement (or if known, the
consequences or magnitude of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable),
but becomes known to the Moon Board prior to the Moon Stockholder Approval,
and (ii) does not relate to (A) any Moon Acquisition Proposal or (B) clearance
of the Combination under the HSR Act or any other Regulatory Law, including
any action in connection therewith taken pursuant to or required to be taken
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.8_; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) any change
in the price or trading volume of Moon Common Stock or Comet Common Stock
shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether a Moon
Intervening Event has occurred (it being acknowledged, however, that any
underlying cause thereof may be taken into account for purposes of determining
whether a Moon Intervening Event has occurred); (2) in no event shall any
fact, circumstance, occurrence, event, development, change or condition or
combination thereof that has had or would reasonably be expected to have an
adverse effect on the business or financial condition of Comet or any of its
Subsidiaries constitute a Moon Intervening Event unless such fact,
circumstance, occurrence, event, development, change or condition or
combination thereof constitutes a Comet Material Adverse Effect; and (3) Moon
or Comet meeting, failing to meet or exceeding projections shall not be taken
into account for purposes of determining whether a Moon Intervening Event has
occurred (it being acknowledged, however, that any underlying cause thereof
may be taken into account for purposes of determining whether a Moon
Intervening Event has occurred).

"Moon Superior Proposal" means any Moon Acquisition Proposal, substituting
"75%" for "15%," on terms that the Moon Board determines in its good faith
judgment (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel) are more favorable to Moon and its stockholders than the Combination
and the other transactions contemplated (taking into account the likelihood of
consummation on the terms so proposed and all such other factors as the Moon
Board deems relevant).

 

Section 7.7 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ and
_Section_ __ _ 7.8_, each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things
necessary under applicable Law to consummate and make effective the
Combination and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as practicable, including

 



91  (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers,
authorizations, expirations or terminations of waiting periods, clearances,

necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions

additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including
the limitations set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.8(e)_, each of the Parties

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.8(c)_ and the other terms and conditions
herein provided and without limiting the foregoing, Comet and Moon shall (and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to):

(i) make their respective required filings (and, subject to the consent of
the other Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) any filings considered by either Comet or Moon to be advisable) under
the HSR Act and any other Regulatory Laws, which filings shall be made
promptly, but in no event later than 15 Business Days after the date hereof
with respect to the filings under the HSR Act, and thereafter shall promptly
make any other required submissions under the HSR Act or other such laws;
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond to and comply promptly with and
expeditiously achieve substantial compliance with any request for additional
information or documentary material regarding the Combination or any such
filings for any Governmental Entity charged with enforcing, applying,
administering, or investigating any Regulatory Law;

 



92 (ii) use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate with one another in (A)
determining which filings are required (or, subject to the consent of the
other Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), considered by Comet or Moon to be advisable) to be made prior to the
Effective Time with, and which consents, approvals, permits or authorizations
are required to be obtained prior to the Effective Time from, Governmental
Entities in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
the consummation of the Combination and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, (B) promptly furnishing the other Parties, subject in appropriate
cases to appropriate confidentiality agreements to limit disclosure to outside
lawyers and consultants, with such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as such other Parties and their Affiliates may reasonably request
in connection with their preparation of necessary filings, registrations or
submissions of information to any Governmental Entity, including any filings
necessary or appropriate under the provisions of Regulatory Laws, (C) timely
making all such filings and (D) delivering to the other Parties outside
counsel complete copies of all documents furnished to any Governmental Entity
as part of any filing;

(iii) promptly notify each other of any communication concerning
this Agreement, the Combination or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to that Party from any Governmental Entity; it being understood
that correspondence, filings and communications received from any Governmental
Entity shall be immediately provided to the other Parties upon receipt,
subject in appropriate cases to appropriate confidentiality agreements to
limit disclosure to outside lawyers and consultants;

 

(iv) not participate or agree to participate in any meeting or discussion
(other than discussions that cover only administrative and non-substantive
matters) with any Governmental Entity relating to any filings or investigation
concerning this Agreement, the Combination or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with the other Parties and
their Representatives in advance and invites the other Parties
representatives to attend, subject in appropriate cases to appropriate
confidentiality agreements to limit disclosure to outside lawyers and
consultants, unless the Governmental Entity prohibits such attendance; and

(v) promptly furnish the other Parties, subject in appropriate cases to
appropriate confidentiality agreements to limit disclosure to outside lawyers
and consultants, with draft copies prior to submission to a Governmental
Entity, with reasonable time and opportunity to comment and consult, of all
correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the
substance thereof) that they, their Affiliates or their respective
representatives intend to submit to any Governmental Entity.

 

(c) Moon shall be entitled to direct the antitrust defense of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement in any investigation or litigation by, or
negotiations with, any Governmental Entity or any other Person relating to the
Combination or regulatory filings

 



93  under applicable Regulatory Law, subject to and consistent with the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.8(a_), _Section_ __ _ 7.8(b)_ and  _Section_
__ _ 7.8(e)_ and provided that Moon shall consult with, and consider in good
faith the views of, Comet throughout the antitrust defense of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, including by providing Comet with reasonable
opportunity to evaluate, as promptly as practicable, steps to be taken in
pursuit of such defense, and provided further that, subject to _Section_ __ _
7.8(e)_, Moon shall exercise its direction in furtherance of, and not in a
manner inconsistent with, the objective of the Parties to consummate and make
effective the Combination and the other transactions contemplated hereby as
promptly as practicable and Moon shall not be entitled to take any action or
exercise direction in a manner intended to, or that would reasonably be
expected to, delay the consummation of the Combination and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(d) Comet shall not make any offer, acceptance or counter-offer to or
otherwise engage in negotiations or discussions with any Governmental Entity
with respect to any proposed settlement, consent decree, commitment or remedy,
or, in the event of litigation, discovery, admissibility of evidence, timing
or scheduling, except as specifically requested by or agreed with Moon. Comet
shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide full and effective support
of Moon in all material respects in all such investigations, litigation,
negotiations and discussions to the extent requested by Moon.

 

(e) Without limiting the foregoing, the Moon Parties shall take all such
action as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, that the
United States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities or
competition authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction, or any
other Person, may assert under Regulatory Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate, and minimize the
impact of, each and every impediment under Regulatory Laws that may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Combination so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event
no later than the Termination Date); _provided, however_ , that nothing
contained in this Agreement requires any of the Comet Parties or the Moon
Parties to take, or cause to be taken, any action with respect to any of the
assets, businesses or product lines of Comet or any of its Subsidiaries, or of
Moon or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Entities), or any
combination thereof, if such action, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the business,
assets, results of operations or financial condition of Moon, Comet and their
respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. If requested by Moon, Comet will
agree to and take any action contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 7.8(e)_,
_provided_ that the consummation of any divestiture or the effectiveness of
any other remedy is conditioned on the consummation of the Combination. The
foregoing agreement in this _Section_ __ _ 7.8(e)_ is made solely to
facilitate the closing of the Combination and does not constitute a
representation or admission that the Combination, if consummated without any
modification, would violate any Regulatory Law or that agreeing to any
divestitures, hold separate conditions or other restrictions permitted herein
or suggested by any Person or authority acting under any Regulatory Law would
not be harmful to the Parties.

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, "Regulatory Laws" means the U.S.
Sherman Antitrust Act, as amended, the U.S. Clayton Antitrust Act, as
amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all
other applicable Laws or Orders, including any antitrust, competition or trade
regulation laws, that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint
of trade or lessening competition through merger or acquisition.

 



94 (g) The Parties will cooperate and use their respective reasonable efforts to
identify and comply with any so called "transaction triggered" or
"responsible property transfer" requirements under Environmental Laws that
result from the Combination.

 

Section 7.9 _Listing Application_. Moon shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the shares of Moon Common Stock to be issued in the Combination, and
the shares of Moon Common Stock subject to issuance upon exercise or vesting,
as applicable, of the Assumed Awards to be approved for listing on the NYSE,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time. 

Section 7.10 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Comet and Moon
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of
Comet Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Comet
Common Stock) or acquisitions of Moon Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Moon Common Stock) resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
Comet or will become subject to such reporting obligations with respect to
Moon, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 7.11 _Assumed Awards_. As of the Closing Date, to the extent
necessary to provide for registration of shares of Moon Common Stock subject
to Assumed Awards, Moon shall file with the SEC a registration statement on
Form S-8 (or any successor form), a post-effective amendment on Form S-8 (or
any successor form) to the Form S-4 (or any successor form), a post-effective
amendment to Form S-3 (or any successor form), or such other registration
statement or amendment as may be required to effect such registration with
respect to such shares of Moon Common Stock and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to maintain such registration statement, including the current status
of any related prospectus or prospectuses, for so long as such Assumed Awards
remain outstanding.

 

Section 7.12 _Inspection_. From the date of this Agreement to the Effective
Time, each of Comet, on the one hand, and Moon, on the other hand, shall
allow designated officers, attorneys, accountants and other representatives of
the other reasonable access, during normal business hours, upon reasonable
notice, to the records and files, correspondence, audits and properties,
as well as to all information relating to commitments, contracts, titles and
financial position, or otherwise pertaining to its and its Subsidiaries
business and affairs, including inspection of such properties. Each of Comet
and Moon shall use its reasonable best efforts to minimize any disruption to
the business of the other Party that may result from such requests for access
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.12_. No investigation pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.12_ shall affect any representation or warranty given by it
hereunder. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or a Partys
provision of information or investigation pursuant to the preceding
sentence, no Party shall be deemed to make any representation or warranty
except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Comet, on the one hand, nor Moon, on the other hand, shall
be required to provide any information which it reasonably

 



95  believes it may not provide to the other by reason of any applicable Law
(including with respect to privacy of employees), which constitutes
information protected by attorney/client privilege, which would result in the
disclosure of any trade secrets of such Party or which it is required to keep
confidential by reason of contract or agreement with third parties. Each Party
shall use reasonable efforts to make reasonable and appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply. Each Party agrees that it shall not, and shall cause
its representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.12_ for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the
Combination and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All
nonpublic information obtained pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.12_ shall
be governed by the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 7.13 _Publicity_. Moon and Comet shall, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any securities exchange, consult with each other before issuing any
press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public
statement or communication with respect to this Agreement, the Combination or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that, (i)
each of Comet and Moon may make press releases or public announcements
concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby that consist
solely of information previously disclosed in previous press releases or
announcements made by Comet and/or Moon in compliance with this  _Section_ __
_ 7.13_ and (ii) each of Comet and Moon may make any public statements in
response to questions by the press, analysts, investors or analysts or those
participating in investor calls or industry conferences, so long as such
statements consist solely of information previously disclosed in previous
press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by Comet and/or
Moon in compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 7.13_. In addition to the
foregoing, except to the extent disclosed in or consistent with the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus in accordance with the provisions of _Section_ __ _
7.3_, neither Moon nor Comet shall issue any press release or otherwise make
any public statement or disclosure concerning such other Party or such other
Partys business, financial condition or results of operations without the
consent of such other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Comet shall not be required to provide for review or
comment to Moon any statement, release or disclosure in response to or in
connection with the receipt and existence of a Comet Acquisition Proposal, its
consideration of making or its making of a Comet Change in Recommendation or
any matters related thereto, and following any public statement, release or
disclosure by Comet in respect of any of the foregoing matters, Moon shall not
be required to provide for review or comment to Comet any statement, release
or disclosure made by Moon with respect to such matters. Moon shall not be
required to provide for review or comment to Comet any statement, release or
disclosure in response to or in connection with the receipt and existence of
a Moon Acquisition Proposal, its consideration of making or its making of a
Moon Change in Recommendation or any matters related thereto, and following
any public statement, release or disclosure by Moon in respect of any of
the foregoing matters, Comet shall not be required to provide for review or
comment to Moon any statement, release or disclosure made by Comet with
respect to such matters. Moon and Comet agree to issue the previously agreed
upon form of joint press release announcing this Agreement.

Section 7.14 _Expenses_. Whether or not the Combination is consummated, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the
Combination and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by
the Party incurring such expenses, except as otherwise agreed in writing by
the Parties, including the costs of any economists or other experts utilized
by outside counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



96 Section 7.15 _Charter Provisions; Takeover Laws_. If (a) the restrictions
on business combinations set forth in Comets and/or Moons Organizational
Documents or (b) any "fair price," "moratorium," "business combination," or
"control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute or regulation is
or shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Comet and the Comet Boards and/or Moon and the Moon Board shall use all
reasonable efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and shall otherwise
act to minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 7.16 _Creditor Opposition_. In accordance with Dutch law, the one-
month period for any creditors of Comet, holders of bonds ( _obligaties_ )
issued by Comet, whether or not redeemable or convertible, or warrants issued
by Comet (collectively, the "Comet Creditors") to oppose the Merger under
Dutch law shall commence as of the day Comet publishes the filing of the
Merger Proposal in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.3(c)(iii)_. Comet shall
promptly notify Moon and Moon Bidco upon receipt of notice of any actual,
pending or threatened opposition rights proceeding initiated, pending to be
initiated or threatened to be initiated by any Comet Creditor pursuant to
Dutch law (whether during the aforementioned one-month period or otherwise).
Such notice shall describe in reasonable detail the nature of such opposition
rights proceeding. With respect to any such opposition rights proceeding, 
_Section_ __ _ 7.17_ shall apply.

Section 7.17 _Transaction Litigation_. Each Party shall give the
other Parties the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of
any creditor, stockholder or shareholder litigation against it and/or its
directors or officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each Party agrees that it shall not settle or offer to settle any
litigation commenced on or after the date of this Agreement against it or any
of its directors or officers by any of its creditors, stockholders or
shareholders relating to this Agreement, the Combination, any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise, without the prior
written consent of the other Parties (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Regarding any creditor
opposition procedure referred to in _Section_ __ _ 7.16,_ Comet shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause each such procedure to be resolved or
lifted as soon as possible following the initiation thereof.

 

Section 7.18 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Merger Effective Time, Moon (i) shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless each Person who is, or at any time prior to the Effective
Time has been, a director or officer of Comet or a director, officer, member,
trustee or fiduciary of any of its Subsidiaries and each Person who is, or at
any time prior to the Merger Effective Time, served at the request or for the
benefit of Comet as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of
another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans
(individually, an "Indemnified Party" and, collectively, the "Indemnified
Parties") against all cost, expense, liability and

 



97  loss (including reasonable attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise
Taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) incurred or
suffered by such Person in connection with any Proceeding, by reason of the
fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a director or officer of Comet or a
director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of any of its Subsidiaries or
a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation or
of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service
with respect to employee benefit plans at the request or for the benefit of
Comet, to the same extent as provided by Comets Organizational Documents and
applicable Law as of the date hereof, and (ii) without limitation to clause
(i), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, shall also advance
expenses as incurred to the same such extent; _provided_ that the Person to
whom fees and expenses are advanced shall, if required by applicable Law,
provide an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such Person is not entitled to indemnification. In addition, Moon, Comet
and Comet Newco Sub agree that, for a period of six years after the Closing,
neither Comet nor any of its successors (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, Comet Newco Sub, as the acquiring and surviving corporation in the
Merger) shall, and Moon shall cause Comet and its successors not to, amend,
repeal or modify any provision in its Organizational Documents in a manner
that would adversely affect the rights and/or exculpation or indemnification
of present or former supervisory directors, members of the management board,
officers, employees or agents of Comet and its Subsidiaries, or of persons who
are or were serving at the request of Comet or its Subsidiaries as a
supervisory director, member of the management board, officer, director,
employee, trustee or agent of another company, a partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise or entity of Comet, it being the intent of the
Parties that the supervisory directors, members of the management board,
officers, employees or agents of Comet and its Subsidiaries, or of persons
who are or were serving at the request of Comet or its Subsidiaries as a
supervisory director, member of the management board, officer, director,
employee, trustee or agent of another company, a partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise or entity prior to the Closing shall continue
thereafter to be entitled to such rights of exculpation and indemnification to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Laws until at least the
sixth anniversary of the Closing Date.

(b) At or prior to the Merger Effective Time, any of the Moon Parties or Comet
Parties may purchase a "tail" directors and officers liability insurance
policy covering the Indemnified Parties who are, or at any time prior to the
Merger Effective Time were, covered by Comets existing directors and
officers liability insurance policies for at least six years after the
Merger Effective Time and on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the
Indemnified Parties (including as to coverage and amounts) than such existing
insurance, with a substantially comparable insurer to the existing insurer,
_provided_ that, if purchased by Comet, the premium thereof shall not exceed
300% of the greater of the last annual premium paid by Comet prior to the date
of this Agreement (the "Premium Cap"). If such a policy is not purchased by
either Moon or Comet, then for a period of six years after the Merger
Effective Time, Moon shall cause to be maintained the current officers and
directors liability insurance covering the Indemnified Parties who are, or
at any time prior to the Merger Effective Time were, covered by Comets
existing officers and directors liability insurance policies (provided that
Moon may substitute therefor policies on terms and conditions which are no
less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties (including as to coverage and
amounts) than such existing insurance with a substantially comparable insurer)
with respect to claims arising from facts or events, or actions or omissions,
which occurred or are alleged to have

 



98  occurred at or before the Merger Effective Time, _provided_ that Moon shall
not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of the Premium Cap, and if
premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then
Moon shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance coverage which provide
the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap.
In either case, Moon will maintain such policies in full force and effect and
honor the obligations thereunder.

(c) In the event Moon or any of its respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Moon shall assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 7.18_.

 

(d) The rights of any Indemnified Party under this _Section_ __ _ 7.18_ shall
be in addition to any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the
Organizational Documents of Comet or any of its Subsidiaries, indemnification
or employment agreements with Comet or any of its Subsidiaries or under any
applicable Law. The provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.18_ shall survive
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby for a period of six
years and are expressly intended to benefit, and be enforceable by, each of
the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and representatives;
_provided, however,_ that in the event that any claim or claims for
indemnification set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.18_ are asserted or made
within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect to any
such claim or claims will continue until the disposition of all such claims.
In the event of any breach by Moon of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.18_, Moon shall
pay all reasonable expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred
by the Indemnified Parties in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
provided in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.18_ upon the written request of such
Indemnified Party _._

Section 7.19 _Certain Benefits_.

(a) For the period commencing with the Merger Effective Time and ending on
December 31, 2018, Moon shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each
current and former employee of Comet and its Subsidiaries (the "Covered
Employees") (i) base compensation or wages, target bonus opportunities and
severance benefits that are, in each case, at least as favorable on an item
by item basis as the base compensation or wages, target bonus opportunity and
severance benefits provided to such Covered Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits that are no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than the employee benefits provided to each such Covered Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and benefit accrual
(other than for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit
pension plan or retiree welfare eligibility under any retiree welfare plan
sponsored by Moon or its Subsidiaries (other than under plans sponsored by
Comet and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time or a direct
successor plan)) under the employee benefit plans of Moon and its
Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Covered Employees after the Effective
Time (the "New Plans"), each Covered Employee shall be credited with his or
her years of service with Comet

 



99  and its Subsidiaries (and predecessors) prior to the Effective Time, to the
same extent as such Covered Employee was entitled, prior to the Effective
Time, to credit for such service under any similar Comet employee benefit
plan in which such Covered Employee participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time (and to the extent there
is no similar Comet plan, service as recognized for purposes of Comets
401(k) Plan), _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that
its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Covered Employee
shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any
and all New Plans for which the Covered Employee is otherwise made eligible to
the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a Comet Benefit Plan
in which such Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each such plan, an "Old Plan"); and (ii) for purposes of each
New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to
any Covered Employee, the Surviving Entities shall cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be
waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such
conditions would not have been waived under the comparable plans of Comet or
its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately prior to
the Effective Time and the Surviving Entities shall cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the applicable Old Plan ending on the date
such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be
taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(c) With respect to any Covered Employees based outside of the United States,
Moons obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 7.19_ shall be modified to the
extent necessary to comply with applicable Laws of the foreign countries and
political subdivisions thereof in which such Covered Employees are based.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein, whether express
or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any
employee benefit plan, or shall limit the right of Moon or any Subsidiary,
subject to their obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 7.19_, to amend,
terminate or otherwise modify any employee benefit plan following
the Effective Time.

(e) The Parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.19_ with respect to employees are included for the sole
benefit of the Parties to this Agreement, and that nothing in this Agreement,
whether express or implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or other
rights (i) in any other Person, including any employees, former employees,
any participant in any Comet Benefit Plan, or any dependent or beneficiary
thereof, or (ii) to continued employment with Moon or any Subsidiary.

 

Section 7.20 _Financing_.

 

(a) Moon shall not, without the prior written consent of Comet: (i) permit any
amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under,
the Financing Commitments if such amendment, modification, waiver or remedy
(A) adds any

 



100  new (or modifies adversely to Moon or Comet any existing) conditions to the
consummation of all or any portion of the Financings, (B) reduces the
aggregate amount of the Financings such that the aggregate funds that would
be available to Moon on the Closing Date would not be sufficient to pay all
amounts contemplated by this Agreement to be paid by it (including to
refinance the Existing Debt) and to perform its obligations hereunder, (C)
limits or otherwise adversely affects the ability of Moon to enforce its
rights against the other parties to the Financing Commitments or the
Definitive Agreements or (D) would otherwise reasonably be expected to
prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the Combination and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (ii) take any action to
terminate the Financing Commitments. Moon shall promptly deliver to Comet
copies of any amendment, modification or waiver to the Financing Commitments.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.20(a)_, Moon may amend,
replace, supplement or otherwise modify the Financing Commitment Letters to
add or replace Lenders, lead arrangers, agents or similar entities and the
commitments in respect of the Financings that have not executed the Financing
Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement and replace the debt
commitments of the Lenders under the Financing Commitment Letter as of the
date of this Agreement with debt commitments of such new entities.

 

(b) Moon shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions necessary to obtain the proceeds of the Financings on the terms
and conditions described in the Financing Commitments or terms more favorable
to Moon, including by using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in
effect the Financing Commitments, (ii) negotiate, execute and
deliver definitive agreements with respect to the Financings (the "Definitive
Agreements") on the terms and conditions contained in the Financing
Commitments and (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions in the
Financing Commitments and the Definitive Agreements and comply with its
obligations thereunder. In the event that all conditions contained in the
Financing Commitments or the Definitive Agreements have been satisfied, Moon
shall use reasonable best efforts to enforce its rights thereunder and cause
the Lenders thereunder to comply with their respective obligations thereunder
to fund the Financings to the extent required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related fees and expenses on the
Closing Date.

(c) Moon shall keep Comet informed on a reasonably current basis and in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financings. In
the event that any portion of the Financings becomes unavailable (other than
due to the failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_
or  _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ hereof), Moon will use reasonable best efforts to
obtain alternative debt financing (in an amount sufficient, when taken
together with the available portion of the Financings, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related fees and
expenses) from the same or other sources and which do not include any
conditions to the consummation of such alternative debt financing that are
more onerous than the conditions set forth in the Financing Commitment
Letter. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Financing Commitment
Letter" shall be deemed to include any commitment letter (or similar
agreement) with respect to any alternative financing arranged in compliance
herewith (and any Financing Commitment Letter remaining in effect at the time
in question). Moon shall provide Comet with prompt oral and written notice of
any breach or default by any party to the Financing Commitments or any
Definitive Agreement and the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from any Lender or other financing source with respect to any
breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Financing
Commitments or any Definitive Agreement of any provision thereof.

reasonably necessary in connection with the Financings, (vi) assist in

Securities Act in each case by Moon, (x) take all actions reasonably necessary

concurrently with the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , none of Comet
or its Affiliates shall be required to take or permit the taking of any action
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.21_ that would (A) require Comet, its

other hand, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries, shall be required to
provide any information which it reasonably believes it may not provide by
reason of any applicable Law (including with respect to privacy of employees),
which constitutes information protected by attorney/client privilege, or
which it is required to keep confidential by reason of contract or agreement
with third parties.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event
that the Combination and/or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are not consummated due to circumstances arising out of any failure
to obtain the Financings, Moon shall not have any liability to any Comet Party
arising out of such failure; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing

to obtain the Financing to the extent required by  _Section_ __ _ 7.20(b)_.

reasonably practicable following the execution of this Agreement, Comet shall

for Netherlands dividend withholding tax purposes of Comet and Comet Newco

having rendered an unconditional advice or an advice with conditions
acceptable to each of Comet and Moon, permitting the Parties to pursue the
sale and transfer of the CT Entity 3 Equity Interests and the CT Entity 6
Equity Interests and the documents related thereto; or

 

(b) To the extent neither of the situations described in _Section_ __ _

effect ( _uitvoerbaar bij voorrraad_ ).

 



104 (c) The Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to complete the Comet
Works Council Consultation Procedure, it being understood that Comet will
have the primary responsibility for, and take all steps reasonably necessary
to, in consultation with Moon and its advisors, as soon as practicable

Procedure. Comet shall keep Moon informed on a continuing basis on all
material correspondence, communications and consultations in respect
thereof. Comet shall give Moon the opportunity to attend meetings with
representatives of the Comet Works Council if requested by the Comet Works
Council. Comet shall not send the request for advice to or make any other
material communication with the Comet Works Council without Moons prior
written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(d) Prior to Closing, each of the Parties, as applicable, shall fully comply
with all notice, consultation, effects bargaining or other bargaining
obligations (other than the consultation process with the Comet Works Council)
(together the "Other Employee Procedures") to any labor union, labor

Moon Parties (i) in the first three sentences of _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_,
_Section_ __ _ 6.3(c)_, and _Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)_ shall be true and
correct, other than any inaccuracies that are _de_ _minimis_ in the aggregate,
as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though made as
of such date (except to the extent any such representation and warranty
expressly relates to a specified date, in which case only as of such specified
date), (ii) in the first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ shall be true and
correct in all respects, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the

sentences) and  _Section_ __ _ 6.18_ shall be true and correct in all
material respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date
as though made as of such date (except to the extent any such representation

such specified date), and (iv) each of the representations and warranties of
the Moon Parties contained in _Article 6_ (other than in _Section_ __ _
6.1(a)_,  _Section_ __ _ 6.2,_ _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_, _Section_ __ _
6.3(c)_, and _Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)_, the first sentence of _Section_ __ _

by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, _provided_ __ that such

(a) there has been a breach by any of the Moon Parties of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement or any
representation or warranty of the Moon Parties shall have become untrue, in
either case such as would cause the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
8.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ not to be satisfied, and such breach or
failure to be true and correct is not curable by the Termination Date;
_provided, however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_ shall not be available to Comet if it, at such
time, is in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set
forth in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _

(b) at any time prior to obtaining the Comet Shareholder Approval, in order
to enter into any agreement, understanding or arrangement providing for a

(c) at any time prior to obtaining the Moon Stockholder Approval, a Moon
Change in Recommendation or a Moon Intervening Event Change in Recommendation
has occurred.

Section 9.4  _Termination by_ _Moon_. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the CT Effective Time by action of the Moon Board, if:

 

(a) there has been a breach by any of the Comet Parties of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement or any
representation or warranty of the Comet Parties shall have become untrue, in
either case such as would cause the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
8.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_ not to be satisfied and such breach or
failure to be true and correct is not curable by the Termination Date;
_provided, however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)_ shall not be available to Moon if it, at such
time, is in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set

Section 9.5 _Effect of Termination_.

(a) Comet shall pay Moon a fee of $60.0 million (the "Comet Termination Fee"):

 

(i) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_ and
(x) after the date of this Agreement a Comet Acquisition Proposal shall have
been publicly made or announced by any Person, and in each case such Comet
Acquisition Proposal shall not have been withdrawn at least seven days prior
to the Comet Shareholders Meeting, and (y) within one year after such
termination, Comet enters into a definitive agreement with respect to a Comet
Acquisition Proposal or a Comet Acquisition Proposal is consummated;

 

(ii) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_; or

 

(iii) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.4(c)_;

 

which fee shall be payable: in the case of clause (i), upon the first to occur
of such entering into a definitive agreement or consummation referred to
in subclause (y) thereof; and in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), upon
such termination; _provided_ that for purposes of this _Section_ __ _
9.5(a)_, the references to "15%" in the definition of Comet Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "75%".

(b) Moon shall pay Comet a fee of $60.0 million (the "Moon Termination Fee"
and, together with the Comet Termination Fee, each a "Termination Fee"):

 

(i) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(c)_ and
(x) after the date of this Agreement a Moon Acquisition Proposal shall have
been publicly made or announced by any Person, and in each case such Moon
Acquisition Proposal shall not have been withdrawn at least seven days prior
to the Moon Stockholders Meeting, and (y) within one year after such
termination, Moon enters into a definitive agreement with respect to a Moon
Acquisition Proposal or a Moon Acquisition Proposal is consummated;

 

(ii) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.4(b)_; or

 



110 (iii) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.3(c)_;

which fee shall be payable: in the case of clause (i), upon the first to occur
of such entering into a definitive agreement or consummation referred to in
subclause (y) thereof; and in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), upon such
termination; _provided_ that for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 9.5(b)_, the
references to "15%" in the definition of Moon Acquisition Proposal shall be
deemed to be references to "75%".

(c) Each of Comet and Moon agree that in the event that (i) the Comet
Termination Fee is paid or may be payable to Moon pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.5(a_) or (ii) the Moon Termination Fee is paid or may be payable to Comet
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.5(b)_, the payment of such Termination Fee
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the recipient thereof (the
"Receiving Party"), its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
stockholders, shareholders, Affiliates, officers, directors, employees or
Representatives (collectively, "Related Persons") against the Party paying
such Termination Fee (the "Paying Party"), any of its Related Persons or
any Financing Source for, and in no event will the Receiving Party or any of
its Related Persons be entitled to recover any other money damages or any
other remedy based on a claim in law or equity with respect to, (1) any loss
suffered as a result of the failure of the Combination to be consummated, (2)
the termination of this Agreement, (3) any liabilities or obligations arising
under this Agreement, or (4) any other claims or actions arising out of or
relating to any breach, termination or failure of or under this Agreement,
and upon payment to the Receiving Party of such Termination Fee, the Paying
Party, any Related Person of the Paying Party and any Financing Source shall
not have any further liability or obligation of any kind for any reason in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.5(f)_). Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges
that any Termination Fee is not intended to be a penalty, but rather is
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Receiving
Party in circumstances in which any such Termination Fee is due and payable
for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Combination, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In no event shall the
Receiving Party be entitled to more than one payment of a Termination Fee in
connection with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to which a
Termination Fee is payable. For the avoidance of doubt, either party may
pursue both a grant of specific performance and the payment of a Termination
Fee; _provided_ , _however_ , that under no circumstances shall either party
be entitled to receive a Termination Fee if the Combination is consummated.

 

(d) All payments under this _Section_ __ _ 9.5_ shall be made promptly (and,
in any events within five Business Days) upon becoming due by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated by the receiving
Party.

(e) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section_
__ _ 9.5_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if either Comet fails to pay, or Moon fails
to pay, as applicable, any amount due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.5_,
and, in order to obtain such payment, the Party entitled to such payment
commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Party failing to pay
for the fees to which reference is

 



111  made in this _Section_ __ _ 9.5_, then such Party shall pay to the Party
entitled to such payment its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in
connection with such suit, together with interest through the date of payment
on the amount of the fee at the prime lending rate prevailing during such
period as published in _The Wall Street Journal_.

 

(f) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the
Combination pursuant to this _Article 9_ , all obligations of the Parties
shall terminate, except the obligations of the Parties pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 9.5_, the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 7.12_, _Section_ __
_ 7.14_,  _Section_ __ _ 7.21(b)_ and _Article 10_ , _provided_ that
nothing herein shall relieve any Party from any liability for any willful and
material breach by such Party of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, and all rights and
remedies of such nonbreaching Party under this Agreement in the case of such a
willful and material breach, at law or in equity, shall be preserved. For
purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 9.5(f)_, "willful and material breach"
shall mean a material breach that is a consequence of an act or a failure to
take such act by the breaching Party with the knowledge that the taking of
such act (or the failure to take such act) would, or would reasonably be
expected to, cause a material breach of this Agreement. The Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and the provisions
of such Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to all information and material
delivered by any Party.

Article 10

 

GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

Section 10.1 _Nonsurvival_ _of Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Closing.

Section 10.2 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the exhibits to this
Agreement, the Comet Disclosure Letter, the Moon Disclosure Letter and any
documents delivered by the Parties in connection herewith constitute the
entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements, understandings, representations and
warranties, both oral and written, between or among the Parties with respect
thereto, except that the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in effect.

 

Section 10.3 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of
the Parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other Parties, and any attempted assignment of this
Agreement or of any such rights or delegation of obligations without such
consent shall be void and of no effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Comet Parties shall cooperate with respect to and consider in good faith any
request for consent (a) by Moon Bidco to assign (i) all of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement to a wholly owned subsidiary of Moon that
has been organized solely for the purpose of effecting the Exchange Offer and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, has no assets,
liabilities or obligations and has not, since the date of its formation,
carried on any business or conducted any operations that is organized under
the laws of any current or former member state of the European Union or the
European Economic Area and/or (ii) all of its rights and obligations under

 



112  this Agreement with respect to the Comet Technology Acquisition to a wholly

or (ii), a "Moon Bidco Assignee") or (b) by either U.S. Acquiror 1 or U.S.
Acquiror 2 to assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to an
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Moon organized under the laws of any state
within the United States ("U.S. Acquiror Assignee"); _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Comet Parties shall not be required to consent to any assignment
that would be reasonably likely to cause the Closing to be delayed or to
adversely affect the Comet Parties _provided, further_ , that after the
Closing any Moon Party may assign its rights and obligations under this
Agreement, in whole but not in part, for collateral purposes to any Financing
Source. Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and assigns. In the event that the Comet Parties
consent to the assignment of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
10.3_, any Moon Bidco Assignee and/or U.S. Acquiror Assignee, as applicable,
will execute an assignment and assumption agreement, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Comet Parties, agreeing to be bound by all of
the terms, covenants and other provisions of this Agreement and shall assume
all of the applicable rights and obligations of Moon Bidco, U.S. Acquiror 1
or U.S. Acquiror 2, as applicable, with the same force and effect as if Moon
Bidco Assignee and U.S. Acquiror Assignee had been originally named herein.

 

Section 10.4 _Third-Party_ _Beneficiaries_ _; No Recourse_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
except for the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.18_, nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer standing to any Person
other than the Parties or their respective heirs, successors, executors,
administrators and assigns except, (i) the Financing Sources shall be
express third-party beneficiaries of _Section_ __ _ 9.5_, _Section_ __ _
10.3_, this _Section_ __ _ 10.4_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.5(b)_, _Section_ __ _
10.7(b),_  _Section_ __ _ 10.7(c)_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.8_ (the "FS

benefit of such Financing Sources and such Financing Sources shall be
entitled to rely on and enforce the provisions of such Sections, and (ii)
following the Effective Time, for the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 4.1_ and
_Section_ __ _ 7.18_.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Comet Party
nor any controlled Affiliate of Comet shall have any rights or claims against
any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Financing
Commitment Letter or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and no
Financing Source shall have any rights or claims against any Comet Party or
any controlled Affiliate of Comet in connection with this Agreement, the
Financing Commitment Letter or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise;
_provided_ that the foregoing will not limit the rights of the parties to the
Financing under any commitment letter related thereto. No Financing Source
shall be subject to any special, consequential, punitive or indirect damages
or damages of a tortious nature.

 



113 Section 10.5 _Amendments_ _; Extensions; Waivers_.

 

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, any provision of this Agreement may be
amended, extended or waived if, and only if, such amendment, extension or
waiver is in writing and signed on behalf of each of the Parties. Neither any
failure nor any delay by any Party in exercising any right, power, or
privilege under this Agreement or any of the documents referred to in this
Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege and no
single or partial exercise of any such right, power, or privilege will
preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The waiver by any Party
of a breach of any provision hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a
waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any other provision
hereunder.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the FS
Provisions may not be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in
a manner materially adverse to any Financing Source without the prior written
consent of such Financing Source that is party to a commitment letter or
similar agreement with Moon (including pursuant to any joinder or amendment
thereto or thereof) and no other amendment, waiver or other modification to
any other provision of this Agreement that has the substantive effect of
amending, supplementing, waiving or otherwise modifying any of the FS
Provisions in a manner materially adverse to any Financing Source shall be
effective without the consent of such Financing Source that is party to the
Financing Commitment Letter (including pursuant to any joinder or amendment
thereto or thereof).

required or permitted to be given hereunder by any Party to any of the other

Section 10.7 _Governing Law_.

 

(a) Except to the extent that the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of
any Party, or any other jurisdiction, are mandatorily applicable to the

this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any 

 



115  choice or conflicts of law provisions thereof that would result in the
application of the Laws of any other jurisdiction, _provided that_ ,
notwithstanding the foregoing, any matters concerning or implicating any
Partys board of directors or supervisory board will be governed by the laws
that govern such Partys incorporation or organization. Each of the Parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery, or in the event (but only in
the event) that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such
action or proceeding, the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware (in either case, the "Delaware Court"), for any litigation arising

(and agrees not to commence any litigation relating thereto except in the

respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or
for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement
and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by the other Party
or its successors or assigns shall be brought and determined exclusively in
the applicable Delaware Court. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives,
and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or
otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (i) any
claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the applicable
Delaware Court for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 10.7_, (ii) any claim that it or its property is
exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such court (whether through service of notice, attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment
or otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
claim that (A) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts. EACH CONTROLLED AFFILIATE OF COMET AND EACH OF
THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF PROCESS OUT OF THE
APPLICABLE DELAWARE COURT IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING BY THE MAILING OF
COPIES THEREOF BY REGISTERED AIRMAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID, TO IT AT ITS ADDRESS
SET FORTH IN _SECTION_ __ _ 10.6_ OF THIS AGREEMENT, SUCH SERVICE OF PROCESS

NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY
OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EACH OF THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE FOREGOING WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE IRREVOCABLE UNDER THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE AND OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

 

(b) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, EACH COMET

NATURE (WHETHER BASED UPON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) AGAINST ANY AGENT,
ARRANGER, LENDER OR OTHER ENTITY IDENTIFIED IN THE FINANCING COMMITMENT
LETTER THAT HAS COMMITTED TO PROVIDE OR ARRANGE ANY FINANCING, WHETHER BY
JOINDER TO THE FINANCING COMMITMENT LETTER OR OTHERWISE, TO BE CONSUMMATED BY
MOON IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMBINATION, OR ANY OF SUCH PERSONS AFFILIATES OR
ITS OR THEIR 

 



116  RESPECTIVE STOCKHOLDERS, MANAGERS, MEMBERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES,
PARTNERS, TRUSTEES, CONTROLLING PERSONS, AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES OR THEIR
RESPECTIVE SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS (EACH, A "FINANCING SOURCE") THAT IS IN ANY
WAY RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE COMBINATION, INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO ANY FINANCING TO BE CONSUMMATED BY
MOON IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMBINATION, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO
CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS THEREOF THAT WOULD RESULT IN THE APPLICATION OF THE
LAWS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION (OTHER THAN SECTIONS 5-1401 AND 5-1402 OF THE
NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW); PROVIDED THAT (1) THE INTERPRETATION OF THE
DEFINITION OF COMET MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT AND WHETHER OR NOT A COMET
MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT HAS OCCURRED, (2) THE DETERMINATION OF THE ACCURACY OF
ANY BUSINESS COMBINATION AGREEMENT REPRESENTATIONS (AS DEFINED IN ANY
COMMITMENT LETTER RELATED TO SUCH FINANCING) AND WHETHER AS A RESULT OF ANY
INACCURACY THEREOF THE MOON PARTIES OR THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES HAVE THE
RIGHT TO TERMINATE THEIR RESPECTIVE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, OR TO
DECLINE TO CONSUMMATE THE COMBINATION PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT AND (3) THE
DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE COMBINATION HAVE BEEN CONSUMMATED IN ACCORDANCE

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Comet Party, each
other controlled Affiliate of Comet and Moon (on behalf of itself and its
Subsidiaries) agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against any Financing Sources in any way arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the Combination or the other transactions contemplated hereby,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to any financing

Section 10.8 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH
CONTROLLED AFFILIATE OF COMET THAT IS NOT A PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ALL
RIGHTS OF TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER
BASED UPON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE

 



117  COMBINATION OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND ANY
ACTION OR PROCEEDING (WHETHER IN LAW OR IN EQUITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN
TORT OT OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY
WAY TO THE FINANCING COMMITMENT LETTERS, THE TRANSACTIONS AND FINANCING
CONTEMPLATED THEREBY OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF, INCLUDING ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE. EACH
PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (C) IT MAKES
SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
_SECTION 10.8_. 

Section 10.9 _Enforcement of Agreement_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without
posting any bond or other undertaking, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In the event that any
action shall be brought by a Party in equity to enforce the provisions of the
Agreement, no other Party shall allege or assert, and each Party hereby waives
the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law or that the award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason of law or
equity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither
Moon nor Comet shall be entitled to obtain both (i) specific performance of
the others obligations to consummate the Combination under this Agreement
and (ii) payment of the Comet Termination Fee or the Moon Termination Fee, as
the case may be.

 

Section 10.10 _Severability_.

 

Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent
of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or
unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or
affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement
is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be
only so broad as is enforceable.

 

Section 10.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by the Parties in
separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be
an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the
same instrument; it being understood that the Parties need not sign the same
counterpart. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this
Agreement by facsimile or other electronic image scan transmission shall be as
effective as delivery of an original, manually executed counterpart of this
Agreement. If this Agreement is translated into another language, the English
language text shall in any event prevail.

 



118 Section 10.12 _Headings_. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this
Agreement are for the convenience of the Parties only and shall be given no

Parties to determine whether any obligation, item or matter (whether or not
described herein or included in any schedule) is or is not material for
purposes of this Agreement.

RECITALS



   A. | Pursuant to the terms of a Business Combination Agreement entered
into among McDermott International, Inc. ("Moon"), McDermott Technology, B.V.
("Moon Bidco"), the Merging Companies and certain other parties thereto, and
dated December [], 2017 (the "BCA")1, Moon and the Disappearing Company have

to be effected through, among other transaction steps, (i) an offer (the

capital of the Disappearing Company (the "Comet Shares" and each, a "Comet
Share") in exchange for the right to receive from Moon Bidco 2.47221 (or, if

---|--- 

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

 

Reasons for the Merger

Article 1

 

Moon and the Disappearing Company wish Moon to acquire, directly or
indirectly, all of the business of the Disappearing Company. An efficient
manner to transfer all of the business of the Disappearing Company is to
first implement the Merger pursuant to which the Surviving Company will
acquire all of the business of the Disappearing Company followed by a sale and
transfer of all shares in the share capital of the Surviving Company.

Consequences for activities

 

Article 2

The Surviving Company does not intend to discontinue any of its current
activities nor those of the Disappearing Company which it still has
immediately before the Merger becomes effective (the "Effective Time").

 

Economic consequences

Article 3

 

The Merger, in and of itself, is not expected to have material economic
consequences for the Merging Companies, except for (i) the indirect
acquisition by Moon of the entire business of the Disappearing Company
(except for the business of the Disappearing Company that will be transferred
prior to the Merger pursuant to the Comet Technology Acquisition as defined in
and contemplated by the BCA) to the extent that  not all Comet Shares will have been acquired by Moon Bidco pursuant to the
Exchange Offer, (ii) the delisting of the Comet Shares from the New York Stock
Exchange on or after the Effective Time and (iii) the allotment of Parent
Shares pursuant to the Merger to former holders of Comet Shares. It is not
anticipated that the Parent Shares shall be admitted for trading on the New
York Stock Exchange, or any other stock exchange. Holders of record of Parent
Shares shall only be able to transfer their respective Parent Shares in
accordance with Dutch law, pursuant to a Dutch notarial deed.

 

Legal consequences

Article 4

 



   4.1 | The Merger will, _inter alia_ , have the following consequences: 
---|--- 



     | a. | the Disappearing Company, as disappearing company, will merge
with and into the Surviving Company, as surviving company, and the
Disappearing Company will cease to exist upon the Merger becoming effective;  
---|---|--- 



     | b. | in principle, all assets and liabilities of the Disappearing
Company shall transfer to the Surviving Company by operation of law; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | c. | all shares in the capital of the Disappearing Company will
lapse and the Surviving Company Parent shall allot Parent Shares to the
shareholders of the Disappearing Company as described in Article 7 and Article
12 of the Merger Proposal and the other terms stipulated by the Merger
Proposal. 
---|---|--- 



   4.2 | Following the Merger, creditors of the Disappearing Company will
be able to recover their claims from the Surviving Company as they could
recover such claims from the Disappearing Company before the Effective Time. 
---|--- 



   4.3 | Unless a counterparty of the Merging Companies exercises the
right provided for under Section 2:322 DCC, contracts concluded with the
Merging Companies will remain in force unchanged following the
Merger, provided that contracts concluded with the Disappearing Company shall
have the Surviving Company, instead of the Disappearing Company, as the
contracting party with effect from the Effective Time. 
---|--- 
 

Social consequences

Article 5

 

Neither the Surviving Company Parent nor the Surviving Company has any
employees and neither of them shall have any employees immediately prior to
the Effective Time. To the extent that the Disappearing Company will have
employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, the employment or service
contracts concluded with those employees, as well as their other conditions of
employment or service, will remain in force unchanged following the Effective
Time with the Surviving Company as the contracting party, subject to
provisions of applicable law. It is anticipated that the Merger will not have
material adverse implications for the interests of the employees of the
Disappearing Company. No works council has been established or is in the
process of being established which would be entitled to render advice in
respect of the Merger. Exchange ratio

 

Article 6



   6.1 | For each Comet Share not held by or for the account of any of the
Merging Companies immediately before the Effective Time, the Surviving Company
Parent shall allot one Parent Share to the holder of such Comet Share in the
manner described in Article 7.1 of the Merger Proposal (i.e., in a 1:1
exchange ratio) (the "Exchange Ratio"). 
---|--- 



   6.2 | The following method for determining the Exchange Ratio was
applied: 
---|--- 



     | a. | the Surviving Company has no assets and liabilities and is
not expected to have any assets and liabilities until the Effective Time; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | b. | both at the date of this explanatory memorandum and
immediately before the Effective Time, the Surviving Company Parent is, and
shall be, the sole shareholder of the Surviving Company and the only assets of
the Surviving Company Parent are, and shall be, formed by its shareholding in
the Surviving Company; 
---|---|--- 



     | c. | the Surviving Companys assets and liabilities immediately
following the Effective Time shall have the same value [and shall be recorded
in the Surviving Companys annual accounts and other financial reporting at
the same value, subject to applicable accounting methods and accounting
policies,]2 as the Disappearing Companys assets and liabilities immediately
before the Effective Time;  
---|---|--- 



     | d. | consequently, there is no necessity for determining an exact
exchange ratio in relation to the Merger in order to compensate holders of
Comet Shares for the loss of their respective Comet Shares by allotting
a proportionate and equivalent number of Parent Shares in exchange for such
Comet Shares; 
---|---|--- 



     | e. | the above considerations result in the conclusion, that the
Exchange Ratio can be, and therefore has been, determined at the Merging
Companies discretion to be 1:1. 
---|---|--- 
 



   6.3 | Because of the reasons described in Article 6.2, the Exchange
Ratio is considered to be suitable and appropriate. 
---|--- 



   6.4 | The method applied to determine the Exchange Ratio as described
in Article 6.2 does not lead to a specific valuation. As described above, any
valuation would be irrelevant for the above-mentioned method for determining
the Exchange Ratio. 
---|--- 



   6.5 | Because only one method was applied to determine the Exchange
Ratio, the relative weight of multiple methods is not addressed in this
explanatory memorandum. 
---|--- 
 





   2  | Subject to confirmation. described above or the determination of the Exchange Ratio.

passu_ with all other unsubordinated indebtedness of Moon Bidco. Delivery of
the Principal Amount shall be made without any set off or counterclaim. 
---|--- 



   2. | _Assignability_  None of the rights, interests or obligations
under this Exchangeable Note may be assigned, transferred, subdivided or
otherwise negotiated by a Holder without the prior written consent of Moon

pursuant to a liquidation distribution, (B) __ by Comet Newco to Moon or any
of its Subsidiaries, and (C) __ as set forth in Section __ 4 of this
Exchangeable Note, and (ii) __ may be deposited with the Exchange Agent as

---|--- 



   4. | _Exchangeable Note Split_. Immediately following the Share Sale
Effective Time, this Exchangeable Note shall automatically be split into two
Exchangeable Notes, one of which shall be the "Moon Component Note" and the
other of which shall be the "Legacy Comet Component Note." The Moon Component
Note shall give the Holder(s) thereof an entitlement to receive a number of
shares of Moon Common Stock equal to the product of the Principal Amount
multiplied by the percentage of outstanding shares of Comet Newco owned at
such time by Affiliate Shareholders. The Legacy Comet Component Note shall
give the Holder(s) thereof an entitlement to receive a number of shares of
Moon Common Stock equal to the product of the Principal Amount multiplied by
the percentage of outstanding shares of Comet Newco owned at such time by all
Persons who are not Affiliate Shareholders (the "Public Shareholders"). The
Moon Component Note and the Legacy Comet Component Note need not be
represented by separate physical notes, but Moon Bidco shall issue two
separate physical instruments in connection with such split if requested by
Comet Newco. As soon as any of the Affiliate Shareholders becomes the holder
of the Moon Component Note, the Moon Component Note shall immediately
terminate and any right thereunder shall be extinguished and no longer due. 
---|--- 
 



   5. | _Deposit and Exchange._ Immediately following the split of this
Exchangeable Note into two instruments, Comet Newco shall deposit the Legacy
Comet Component Note with the Exchange Agent. Upon receipt by the Exchange
Agent of the Legacy Comet Component Note, the Legacy Comet Component Note
shall automatically and mandatorily, and without further action by any Person,
be exchanged into a number of shares of Moon Common Stock (which shares shall
have been previously deposited with the Exchange Agent by Moon pursuant to
Section __ 10 of this Exchangeable Note) equal to the product of (x) __ the
Exchange Offer Ratio (as defined in the BCA) and (y) __ the number of shares
of Comet Newco held by the Public Shareholders at such time (the "Mandatory
Exchange"). Upon completion of the Mandatory Exchange, the Legacy Comet
Component Note shall, as of such date, be deemed fully paid and the
indebtedness represented thereby shall be deemed fully satisfied. 
---|--- 



   6. |

_Pre-Liquidation Distribution Exchange Agent Actions_. Immediately following
the Share Sale Effective Time, Comet Newco shall advise the Exchange Agent in
writing of (A) __ the number of shares of Moon Common Stock to which each
Public Shareholder is entitled pursuant to the Liquidation Distribution (prior
to giving effect to any tax withholding) (the "Gross Number") and (B) __ the
amount of Dutch dividend withholding tax, if any, required to be withheld in
respect of the delivery of the Gross Number of shares of Moon Common Stock to
each Comet Public Shareholder pursuant to the Liquidation Distribution (such
communicated amount the "Aggregate Withholding Amount" and the amount of Dutch
dividend withholding tax to be withheld per Public Shareholder, the
"Individual Withholding Amount"). Pursuant to, and as further described in,
this Section __ 6 and Section __ 7, as soon as reasonably possible after the
Share Sale Effective Time, 
 Agent shall be authorized, acting as agent of Comet Newco, to sell, in one or
more transactions for the benefit of the Public Shareholders, such number of
shares of Moon Common Stock to which the Public Shareholders would otherwise
be entitled as is necessary to obtain net cash proceeds as close as possible
to, but no less than, the Aggregate Withholding Amount (the "Moon Common
Stock Sale"). In the event that the cash proceeds obtained by the Exchange
Agent pursuant to this Section 6 exceed the Aggregate Withholding Amount, such
surplus cash proceeds shall be paid to the Public Shareholders on a  _pro
rata_ basis consistent with the procedures for payment of cash in lieu of
fractional shares, _provided_ that Moon shall be entitled to any such surplus
if the amount is _de minimis_. 
---|--- 
 



   7. | _Share Delivery and Dutch Dividend Withholding Tax_. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the completion of the Moon Common Stock Sale,
Comet Newco shall (i) __ in respect of all Affiliate Shareholder(s) owning
shares in Comet Newco, __ effect the Liquidation Distribution by __
delivering __ the Moon Component Note to such Affiliate Shareholder(s), and
(ii) __ in respect of Public Shareholders, cause the Exchange Agent to
effect the Liquidation Distribution in accordance with the BCA and the terms
of this Exchangeable Note. On behalf of Comet Newco, the Exchange Agent shall
(x) __ deliver to each Public Shareholder a number of shares of Moon Common
Stock equal to (a) __ the product of (i) __ the Exchange Offer Ratio and
(ii) __ the number of shares of Comet Newco held by such shareholder at such
time (with cash paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Moon Common Stock
pursuant to Section __ 8) _minus_ (b) __ the number of shares of Moon Common
Stock sold pursuant to the Moon Common Stock Sale, if any, in respect of such
Public Shareholders Individual Withholding Amount pursuant to Section __ 6,
and (y) __ pay aggregate net cash proceeds from such Moon Common Stock Sale
in an amount equal to the Aggregate Withholding Amount to the Dutch taxing
authority in satisfaction of Comet Newcos obligation to withhold and remit
Dutch dividend withholding tax in respect of the Liquidating Distribution
under the Dividend Withholding Tax Act 1965 ( _Wet op de dividendbelasting
1965_ ). To the extent possible, the Liquidation Distribution shall be
imputed to paid-in capital ( _nominaal aandelenkapitaal en agioreserve_ )
recognized for Dutch Dividend withholding tax purposes and not retained
earnings ( _winstreserve_ ), as each such term is defined under
applicable accounting principles. Banks may charge administrative costs to
Public Shareholders in relation to the transfer of the Liquidation
Distribution to their accounts, for which no compensation will be paid to such
Public Shareholders. For the avoidance of doubt, each Public Shareholder that
receives the number of shares of Moon Common Stock such Public Shareholder is
entitled to in accordance with the second sentence of this Section __ 7 and
any cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section __ 8 of the
Exchangeable Note, shall (1) __ be deemed to have received the number of
shares of Moon Common Stock equal to the product of the Exchange Offer Ratio
and the number of shares of Comet Newco held by such shareholder (including
any such shares of Moon Common Stock sold in respect of such Public
Shareholders Individual Withholding Amount pursuant to the Moon Common Stock
Sale) and (2) __ thereafter have no further right to receive cash, shares of
Moon Common Stock or any other consideration in respect of this Exchangeable
Note. required to be issued in the Mandatory Exchange shall be rounded up to the
nearest whole share. The Exchange Agent shall aggregate all fractional shares
of Moon Common Stock that any Public Shareholder would, but for this Section
__ 8, be entitled to receive pursuant to Section __ 7 (such aggregated
number of shares, the "Aggregated Fractional Shares") and sell the Aggregated
Fractional Shares in transactions for the benefit of such Public Shareholders.
The quotient obtained by dividing (x) __ the aggregate proceeds received by
the Exchange Agent pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence by (y) __
the number of Aggregated Fractional Shares is referred to as the "Average
Share Price." No fractional shares of Moon Common Stock shall be issued to
Public Shareholders in the Liquidation Distribution, and in lieu
thereof, each Public Shareholder that would otherwise be entitled to a
fractional share of Moon Comet Stock (after aggregating all shares of Comet
Newco of which such Public Shareholder is a record holder) will be paid an
amount in cash, rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to (i) __ the amount
of the fractional share interest in Moon Common Stock to which such Public
Shareholder would, but for this Section __ 8, be entitled and (ii) __ the
Average Per Share Price, net of any applicable tax withholding. Moon shall be
entitled to receive any remaining proceeds of the sale of the Aggregated
Fractional Shares after payment of such proceeds to the Public Shareholders in
accordance with this Section __ 8 and any applicable withholding tax. 
---|--- 



   9. | _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the
Effective Time and the Mandatory Exchange, any change in the number or type of
outstanding shares of Moon Common Stock shall occur as a result of
a reclassification, recapitalization, exchange, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), combination or readjustment of shares or any stock
dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period (other
than the reverse stock split contemplated by the Moon Reverse Stock Split
Articles Amendment, to the extent such stock split is already reflected in the
Exchange Offer Ratio), the Exchange Offer Ratio shall be appropriately
adjusted to provide the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Exchangeable Note prior to such event. 
---|--- 



   10. | _Moon Undertakings._ Moon undertakes, covenants and represents
to Comet Newco, Moon Bidco and the Holders as follows: (1) __ prior to the
execution of this Exchangeable Note, Moon deposited with the Exchange Agent a
number of shares of Moon Common Stock sufficient to permit the completion of

available in order to complete the Mandatory Exchange, (2) __ Moon shall
cause such shares to remain on deposit with the Exchange Agent and available
for use in the Mandatory Exchange, in each case at all times prior to
completion of the Mandatory Exchange, and (3) __ Moon shall take all actions
necessary to cause its Subsidiaries (excluding Comet Newco, to the extent
Comet Newco is a Subsidiary of Moon at such time; _provided_ that Moon shall
not interfere with or impede Comet Newcos actions relating to its
agreements, obligations and responsibilities under this Exchangeable Note) to
fully perform all of their agreements, obligations and responsibilities under
this Exchangeable Note. 
---|---
