_shall be referred to collectively as the " _Purchase Price_."

 

(b) The Initial Purchase Price shall be adjusted prior to Closing as follows:

(ii) If the Estimated Adjusted Closing Net Working Capital is greater than the

(the " _Closing Purchase Price_ ") will be increased by the positive
difference between the Estimated Adjusted Net Working Capital and the Target
Net Working Capital (the " _NWC Amount_ ").

 



2 (iii) If the Estimated Adjusted Closing Net Working Capital is less than
the Target Net Working Capital, the Closing Purchase Price will be decreased
by the absolute value of the NWC Amount.

(iv) The Closing Purchase Price will be increased by an amount equal to the
Estimated Project Capital Expenditure Amount.

(v) If the Estimated Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount is greater than
the Target Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount, the Closing Purchase Price
will be decreased by the absolute value of the difference between the Target
Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount and the Estimated Ferrybridge Capital

(f) As used herein, " _Project Capital Expenditure Amount_ " means the amount

Statement, (iii) the Project Capital Expenditure Statement or (iv) the

so delivered, the Adjusted Closing Net Working Capital Statement, the Closing
Net Debt Statement, the Project Capital Expenditure Statement and/or the
Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Statement, as applicable, shall each be deemed
not final and the Purchaser and the Sellers shall attempt, in good faith, to
resolve the Disputed Items and, if they are unable to resolve all of the
Disputed Items within thirty (30) Business Days of delivery of such notice,
they shall, within five (5) Business Days thereafter (or such earlier date as
mutually agreed), designate PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or if
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is unwilling or unable to so serve, then another
internationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, mutually
agreeable to the Purchaser and the Sellers (the " _Accounting Arbitrator_ "),
to finally determine such Disputed Items. In the event that the Purchaser and
the Sellers are unable to agree on the Accounting Arbitrator within such five-
Business Day period, then the Accounting Arbitrator shall be an accounting
firm of national standing designated by the American

 



4  Arbitration Association; _provided_ that such firm shall not currently be
the independent auditor of (or otherwise serve as a consultant to) the
Sellers, the Company, the Purchaser or their respective Affiliates. The
Accounting Arbitrator shall resolve all remaining Disputed Items in accordance
herewith within twenty (20) Business Days following the date of its
designation. In connection with the foregoing, the Accounting Arbitrator
shall be instructed to and must (i) limit its determination(s) only to the
remaining Disputed Items, (ii) make its determination(s) as to each remaining
Disputed Item in accordance with _Section 1.2(c)_,  _Section 1.2(e)_,
_Section 1.2(f)_ and _Section 1.2(g) _and (iii) not assign a value to any
remaining Disputed Item greater than the highest value for such Disputed Item
claimed by either the Purchaser or the Sellers or less than the lowest value
for such Disputed Item claimed by either the Purchaser or the Sellers. All
determinations by the Accounting Arbitrator shall be final and binding upon
the parties for purposes of this _Section 1.3_, absent fraud or manifest
error. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne by
the party(ies) based on the degree (as determined by the Accounting
Arbitrator) to which the Accounting Arbitrator has accepted the positions of
the Purchaser and the Sellers.

(c) At such time as the Adjusted Closing Net Working Capital shall become
final in accordance with _Section 1.3(b)_ (the " _Final Adjusted Closing Net
Working Capital_ "), the Final Adjusted Closing Net Working Capital shall be
compared to the Estimated Adjusted Closing Net Working Capital. At such time
as the Closing Net Debt shall become final in accordance with _Section
1.3(b)_ (the " _Final Closing Net Debt_ "), the Final Closing Net Debt shall
be compared to the Estimated Closing Net Debt. At such time as the Project
Capital Expenditure Amount shall become final in accordance with _Section
1.3(b)_ (the " _Final Project Capital Expenditure Amount_ "), the Final
Project Capital Expenditure Amount shall be compared to the Estimated Project
Capital Expenditure Amount. At such time as the Ferrybridge Capital
Expenditure Amount shall become final in accordance with _Section 1.3(b)_
(the " _Final Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount_ "), the Final
Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount shall be compared to the Estimated
Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount.

(d) In the event that the Final Adjusted Closing Net Working Capital exceeds
the Estimated Adjusted Closing Net Working Capital, the Purchaser shall be
obligated to pay to the Sellers an amount equal to such excess, in cash in
immediately available funds. In the event that the Estimated Closing Net Debt
exceeds the Final Closing Net Debt, the Purchaser shall be obligated to pay to
the Sellers an amount equal to such excess, in cash in immediately available
funds. In the event that the Final Project Capital Expenditure Amount exceeds
the Estimated Project Capital Expenditure Amount, the Purchaser shall be
obligated to pay to the Sellers an amount equal to such excess, in cash in
immediately available funds.

 

(e) In the event that the Estimated Adjusted Closing Net Working Capital
exceeds the Final Adjusted Closing Net Working Capital, the Sellers shall be
obligated to pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to such excess, in cash in
immediately available funds. In the event that the Final Closing Net Debt
exceeds the Estimated Closing Net Debt, the Sellers shall be obligated to pay
to the Purchaser an amount equal to such excess, in cash in immediately
available funds. In the event that the Estimated Project Capital Expenditure
Amount exceeds the Final Project Capital Expenditure Amount, the Sellers shall
be obligated to pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to such excess, in case
in immediately available funds.

 



5 (f) In the event that the Estimated Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure
Amount exceeded the Target Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount, then:

(i) in the event the Target Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount exceeds
the Final Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount, the Purchaser shall (x) be
obligated to pay the Sellers pursuant to _Section 1.3(h) _an amount equal to
the Ferrybridge Closing Decrease and (y) be obligated to pay the amount by
which the Target Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount exceeds the Final
Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount in equal monthly installments beginning
on the fifth (5th) day after final determination and ending with the monthly
installment payment in June 2015; or

 

(ii) in the event the Final Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount exceeds the
Target Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount and:

(x) the Estimated Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount exceeds the Final
Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount, then the Purchaser shall be obligated
to pay the Sellers pursuant to _Section 1.3(h) _an amount equal to the
difference between the Estimated Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount and
the Final Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount; or

 

(y) the Final Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount exceeds the Estimated
Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount, then the Sellers shall be obligated
to pay the Purchaser pursuant to _Section 1.3(h) _an amount equal to the
difference between the Final Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount and the
Estimated Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount.

 

(g) In the event that the Target Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount
exceeded the Estimated Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount, then:

(i) in the event the Target Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount exceeds the
Final Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount, the Purchaser shall be
obligated to pay the amount by which Target Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure
Amount exceeds the Final Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount in equal
monthly installments beginning on the fifth (5th) day after final
determination and ending with the monthly installment payment in June 2015; or

 

(ii) in the event the Final Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount exceeds the
Target Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount, then the Sellers shall be
obligated to pay the Purchaser pursuant to _Section 1.3(h) _an amount equal
to the difference between the Final Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount and
the Target Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount.

 



6 (h) The payment obligations under _Section 1.3(d)_,  _Section 1.3(e)_,
_Section 1.3(f)_ and _Section 1.3(g) _shall be combined or offset as
applicable to determine the payor, payee and amount of adjustment payment to
be paid. The Sellers and the Purchaser acknowledge and agree that any payment
made pursuant to this _Section 1.3(h) _shall be paid within five (5) days
after final determination (except with respect to any adjustment pursuant to
_Section 1.3(f)(i)(y) _or  _Section 1.3(g)(i)_) and will be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for income tax purposes to the extent
permitted by Law.

 

(i) During the period that the Sellers and their advisors and representatives
are conducting their review of the Purchasers preparation of the Adjusted
Closing Net Working Capital Statement, the Closing Net Debt Statement, the
Project Capital Expenditure Statement and the Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure
Statement, the Sellers and their advisors and representatives will have
reasonable access during normal business hours to the Books and Records of the
Transferred Companies and the work papers (subject, in the case of such work
papers prepared by the Purchasers or Transferred Companies auditors, to the
Sellers entering into such waivers, indemnities and other agreements as
reasonably required by such auditors) prepared by or on behalf of the
Purchaser and its representatives in connection with the
Purchasers preparation of the Adjusted Closing Net Working Capital
Statement, the Closing Net Debt Statement, the Project Capital Expenditure

Net Working Capital, Final Closing Net Debt, Final Project Capital Expenditure
Amount and Final Ferrybridge Capital Expenditure Amount.

delivery hereof and thereof by the WM Parties, this Agreement constitutes, as
of the date hereof, and this Agreement and all documents, instruments and

enforceability (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding at law or in
equity).

 

Section 2.4 No Violation, Litigation or Regulatory Action. As of the date
hereof, there are no Actions or Orders pending or, to the Knowledge of the

or any instrument, certificate or agreement delivered by the Purchaser at
Closing.

 

Section 2.5 Investment Intent. The Purchaser is acquiring the Shares as an
investment for its own account and not with a view to the distribution
thereof. The Purchaser shall not sell, transfer, assign, pledge or hypothecate
any of the Shares in the absence of registration under, or pursuant to an

Section 2.6 Governmental Filings and Approvals. The only approvals by,
notifications to or filings with any Governmental Authority required to be

Section 2.7 Financing.

 

(a) The Purchaser has delivered to the Sellers a true and complete copy of (i)
that certain debt commitment letter dated as of July 25, 2014 (the " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ "), by and between the Purchaser and Deutsche Bank AG New
York Branch, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Barclays Bank PLC (the "
_Lenders_ "), pursuant to which the Lenders have agreed, upon the terms and
subject to the limited conditions thereof, to provide debt financing in the
aggregate amount set forth therein for the purpose of funding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Debt Financing_ ") and (ii) the equity
commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, among the Purchaser, the ECP
Guarantor and the other parties thereto (the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ ,"
and together with Debt Commitment Letter, the " _Commitment Letters_ ") to
invest, subject to the terms and conditions therein, cash in the aggregate
amount set forth therein for the purpose of funding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (being collectively referred to as the "
_Equity Financing_ ," and together with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_
").

 



11 (b) The Purchaser has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees
in connection with the Financing that are payable on or prior to the date
hereof, and as of the date hereof the Commitment Letters are in full force and
effect and are the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of the
Purchaser and, to the Knowledge of the Purchaser, each of the other parties
thereto in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, subject to the
qualifications that such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent
transfer, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors
rights generally and by general principles of equity relating to
enforceability (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding at law or
in equity) and that equitable remedies, including specific performance, are
discretionary and may not be ordered. The Commitment Letters have not been
amended or modified prior to the date of this Agreement and no such amendment
or modification is contemplated by the Purchaser. No commitment contained in
the Commitment Letters has been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect as of
the date hereof. The obligations of the Lenders to fund the commitments under
the Debt Commitment Letter are not subject to any condition or contingency
that is not set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. The obligations of ECP
Guarantor to fund the commitments under the Equity Commitment Letter are not
subject to any condition or contingency that is not set forth in the Equity
Commitment Letter. Other than the Commitment Letters, there are no side
letters, agreements, contracts or other arrangements related to the Financing
that could increase the conditionality or reduce the amount of the
Financing. 

(c) As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the
part of the Purchaser (or to the Purchasers Knowledge, any other party
thereto) under any term of, or a failure of any condition under, the
Commitment Letters or would otherwise be reasonably likely to result in
any portion of the Financing contemplated thereby becoming unavailable. As of
the date of this Agreement, assuming the conditions set forth in _Section
7.2_ hereof are satisfied at Closing, the Purchaser has no reason to believe
that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or that the
full amount of the Financing will not be available to the Purchaser on the
Closing Date.

 

(d) The aggregate proceeds from the Debt Financing and the Equity Financing,
when funded, and the Purchasers unrestricted cash on hand, will be
sufficient to fund all of the amounts required to be provided by the Purchaser
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including to pay the Closing Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 1.2 _and
all other amounts payable by the Purchaser hereunder at Closing and at the
time of any post-Closing adjustment of the Purchase Price (and under the
Commitment Letters and any fee arrangements related thereto), in each case in
accordance with the terms hereof. In no event shall the receipt by, or the
availability of any funds or financing to, the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates or any other financing be a condition to the Purchasers obligation
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder.

(e) Notwithstanding anything contrary contained herein, the Sellers agree that
a breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth in this
_Section 2.7 _shall not result in the failure of a condition precedent to the
Sellers obligations under this Agreement, if (notwithstanding such breach)
the Purchaser is willing and able to consummate the transaction contemplated
herein on the Closing Date.

 



12 Section 2.8 Brokers, Finders or Similar Fees. No broker, finder
or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or
commission in connection with this Agreement, the certificates, instruments
and agreements delivered at the Closing or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby based upon any contract, arrangement or understanding
entered into by or on behalf of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.

 

Section 2.9 Limited Guarantee. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, ECP Guarantor has duly executed and delivered to the Purchaser the
Limited Guarantee. The ECP Guarantor has full organizational power and
authority to execute and deliver the Limited Guarantee and to perform its
obligations thereunder. The execution, delivery and performance by ECP
Guarantor of the Limited Guarantee and the consummation by ECP Guarantor of
the transactions contemplated thereby have been duly and validly authorized by
all necessary limited partnership action. The Limited Guarantee constitutes
the legal, valid and binding obligation of the ECP Guarantor enforceable
against the ECP Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer, moratorium or
similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and by
general principles of equity relating to enforceability (regardless of whether
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity), and no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default on the part of ECP Guarantor under the Limited Guarantee.

 

Section 2.10 Sellers Representations. The Purchaser acknowledges that the
Sellers have not made and are not making any representations or warranties
whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express or implied,
except as provided in _Article III_ (as supplemented by the Sellers

ARTICLE IV

CERTAIN TAX MATTERS

Section 4.1 Allocation of Liability for Taxes. The Sellers shall be liable
for, and pursuant to _Article IX_  shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and against, any and all Indemnified
Amounts with respect to (i) Income Taxes of any Person for which the
Transferred Companies are liable with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
including Income Taxes with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period attributable
to Tax Partnerships, and Subpart F income, recognized in a Pre-Closing Period
as set forth in _Section 4.2(b)_ and (c) and including (for the avoidance of
doubt) Income Taxes resulting from the Spin-Off, (ii) Income Taxes for which
the Transferred Companies are liable with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period
that are (A) the result of an audit adjustment made by a Tax authority, and
(B) attributable to the adjustments to depreciation and amortization expense
(and related adjustments to adjusted tax basis of assets) made by the Sellers
and their Affiliates during the 2009-2013 Tax years, and (iii) Income Taxes
of the Sellers or any of their Affiliates (other than the Transferred
Companies) with respect to any taxable period. For purposes of determining the
Sellers liability under this _Section 4.1_, the parties liability for
a payment of any other amounts with respect to Taxes under _Article IX_ and
the parties liability for the payment of any other Indemnified Amounts with
respect to Taxes under any other provision of this Agreement, if any accrued
Taxes are included as a current asset or liability of the Transferred
Companies for purposes of computing the Final Adjusted Closing Net Working
Capital, the parties will have satisfied their obligation pay such Taxes to
the extent of such accrual. Provided that the Purchaser has complied with the
requirement of _Section 4.3(c)(ii)_, the Sellers shall pay or cause to be
paid to the applicable Transferred Company or Transferred Companies an amount
equal to the Taxes for which the Sellers are liable under this _Section 4.1_
and/or _Article IX_ in connection with any Tax Return (other than a Tax Return
of a Seller Affiliated Group) with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a
Straddle Period that is filed after the Closing Date. Such payment shall be
made no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the date that such Tax
Return that is filed in accordance with _Section 4.3_. The Seller shall pay
all Taxes due in connection with any Tax Return of a Seller Affiliated Group
that is filed after the Closing Date to the appropriate Tax Authority in a
timely manner.

Section 4.2 Straddle Period; Partnerships; Subpart F Income.

(a) In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of all Taxes of the
Transferred Companies attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall (a) in
the case of any Taxes based on or measured by net income or gross receipts of
the Transferred Companies, and any Income Taxes imposed in connection with a
sale or other disposition of property or other specifically identifiable
transaction or event, be determined based on an interim closing of the books
as of the close of business on the Closing Date ( _provided_  

 



33  that any exemptions, allowances, and deductions that are calculated on an
annual basis shall be apportioned between the period ending on the Closing
Date and the period after the Closing Date based on the number of days in
each such period), and (b) in the case of any other Income Taxes (including
but not limited to Income Taxes in the nature of franchise Taxes determined on
the basis of taxable capital or assets), be deemed to be the product of the
amount of such Income Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days in the portion of
the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and
the denominator of which shall be the total number of days in the entire
Straddle Period. The Sellers and the Purchaser each hereby acknowledge and
agree that, to the extent permitted by Law, employee bonus payments associated
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement paid or accrued by the
Transferred Companies on or before the Closing Date, shall be allocated to
(and treated as incurred during) the Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 

(b) In the case of any entity (each such entity, a "Tax Partnership") treated
as a partnership for U.S. federal or state Income Tax purposes that is owned
(directly or indirectly) by a Transferred Company, Income Taxes attributable
to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall include any U.S. federal and state Income
Taxes of a Transferred Company for a tax period (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Closing Date that are attributable to allocations of
taxable income recognized by a Tax Partnership in a Pre-Closing Tax Period.
Where practical, such taxable income shall be determined by using the
"closing of the books" method for the Tax Partnership, and where that is not
practical, the taxable income of the Tax Partnership for the tax year that
includes the Closing Date shall be apportioned between the Pre-Closing Tax
Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period based on the relative number of days
in such period.

(c) If and to the extent that any Transferred Company recognizes in a Post-
Closing Tax Period income that constitutes "subpart F income" within the
meaning of Section 952 of the Code that arose in a Pre-Closing Tax Period, the
U.S. federal and state Income Taxes resulting from such taxable income
inclusion shall be treated as Income Taxes with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period.

Section 4.3 Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns.

(a) _The Sellers  Rights and Responsibilities_. The Sellers shall timely
prepare and file, or cause to be timely prepared and filed, on behalf of the
Transferred Companies (i) all Tax Returns of any Seller Affiliated Group, (ii)
all other Income Tax Returns with respect to Income Taxes for which the
Sellers are liable under _Section 4.1_ hereof (other than Tax Returns for
Straddle Periods and Tax Returns for Post-Closing Tax Periods reporting Income
Taxes described in clause (ii) of Section 4.1 hereof) and (iii) any other Tax
Returns that are due (taking into account extensions) prior to the Closing
Date.

(b) _Purchaser s Rights and Responsibilities_. The Purchaser shall timely
prepare and file, or cause to be timely prepared and filed, on behalf of the
Transferred Companies all Tax Returns other than those described in _Section

_Section 4.3(a)_) all Income Tax Returns for all Straddle Periods and other
Tax Returns that are due (taking into account extensions) on or after the
Closing Date.

 



34 (c) _Preparation of Tax Returns_.

 

(i) The Sellers shall, on the one hand, and the Purchaser and the Transferred
Companies shall, on the other hand, prepare and provide to the other party
such Tax information as is reasonably requested by the other party to enable
the other party to prepare any Tax Return that such other party has the right
and obligation hereunder to prepare and file.

 

(ii) The Sellers shall, on the one hand, and the Purchaser shall, on the other
hand, with respect to any Tax Return (other than a Tax Return of a Seller
Affiliated Group) which such party is responsible hereunder for preparing and
filing, or causing to be prepared and filed, make such Tax Return and related
workpapers available for review by the other party if the Tax Return (i) is
with respect to Taxes for which the other party or one of its Affiliates may
be liable hereunder or under applicable Tax Law, or (ii) claims Tax benefits
which the other party or one of its Affiliates is entitled to
receive hereunder. The filing party shall use reasonable best efforts to make
Tax Returns available for review as required under this _Section 4.3(c)(ii)
_sufficiently in advance of the due date for filing such Tax Returns to
provide the non-filing party with a meaningful opportunity to analyze and
comment on such Tax Returns and have such Tax Returns modified before filing
and shall consider in good faith any comments provided in writing by the non-
filing party before filing.

 

(d) _Consistency of Filing and Accounting Methods_. Any Tax Return that
includes or is based on the operations, ownership, assets or activities of
the Transferred Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than a Tax
Return of a Seller Affiliated Group) shall be prepared in accordance with past
Tax accounting and filing practices used with respect to the Tax Return in
question (unless otherwise required by applicable Tax Law).

Section 4.4 Refunds of Taxes; Amended Returns.

 

(a) _Refunds_. If the Purchaser receives an Income Tax refund with respect to
Taxes that were (i) paid by the Transferred Companies prior to the Closing
Date, (ii) paid or indemnified by the Sellers or (iii) specifically included
as a current liability in Adjusted Closing Net Working Capital, and in each
case, such refund was neither (x) specifically included as a current asset in
Adjusted Closing Net Working Capital nor (y) attributable to losses, credits
or other Tax attributes that were generated after the Closing, then, the
Purchaser shall pay, within thirty (30) days following the receipt of such
Tax refund, the amount of such Tax refund (net of any Taxes or other
reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the receipt of, or
the claiming of, such refund) to the Sellers. If the Sellers receive a Tax
refund that (A) relates to Taxes for which the Purchaser is liable hereunder,
(B) was specifically included as a current asset in Adjusted Closing Net
Working Capital or (C) is attributable to losses, credits or other Tax

 



35  attributes that were generated after the Closing, then the Sellers shall
pay, within thirty (30) days following the receipt of such Tax refund, the
amount of such Tax refund (net of any Taxes or other reasonable costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the receipt of, or the claiming of, such
refund) to the Purchaser. In either case, to the extent that any such Tax
refund is subsequently disallowed or required to be repaid by a Governmental
Authority, then the Sellers or the Purchaser, as applicable, shall promptly
repay to the other the amount of such refund (plus any interest, penalties or
additions to Tax imposed by a Governmental Authority in connection
therewith). 

(b) _Amended Tax Returns_. Any amended Income Tax Return or claim for Income
Tax refund shall be filed, or caused to be filed, only by the party that was
originally responsible for preparing and filing the Tax Return being amended
or on which the Taxes claimed as a refund were originally reported; _provided,
however_ , that such party shall not, without the prior written consent of
the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
make or cause to be made any such filing to the extent that such filing, if
accepted, reasonably might change the Tax liability of the other party for
any Tax period; _provided, further,_ that the party that was not originally
responsible for preparing and filing the relevant Tax Return may file, or
cause to be filed, such an amended Tax Return or claim for Tax refund with the
prior written consent of the party that was so originally responsible (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the Sellers shall control any audits and
proceedings related to all Tax Returns filed by a Seller Affiliated Group,
_provided_ that the Sellers shall keep the Purchaser reasonably informed
regarding the status of any such audit or proceeding to the extent that it
could affect the Taxes or Tax Returns of a Transferred Company for a Post-
Closing Tax Period.

Section 4.5 Tax Controversies; Audit Adjustments; Assistance and
Cooperation. 

(a) _Notice_. In the event any Tax authority informs the Sellers, on the one
hand, or the Purchaser or the Transferred Companies, on the other hand, of
any notice of proposed audit, claim, assessment or other dispute concerning an
amount of Taxes with respect to which the other party may incur liability
hereunder, the party so informed shall promptly notify the other party in
writing of such matter. Such notice shall contain factual information (to the
extent known) describing any asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and
shall be accompanied by copies of any notice or other documents received from
any Tax authority with respect to such matter. The failure by a party to
provide such notice shall not limit any rights or obligations hereunder with
respect to indemnification, except to the extent that the indemnifying party
is actually prejudiced by such failure.

(b) _Control Rights_. The Sellers shall control any audits, disputes,
or administrative, judicial or other proceedings related solely to Income
Taxes for Pre-Closing Tax Periods or other Taxes for Pre-Closing Tax Periods
which the Sellers would be required to indemnify the Purchaser (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any audit, dispute or proceeding related to Income
Taxes of a Seller Affiliated Group), and the Purchaser shall control any other
Tax audits, disputes or administrative, judicial or other proceedings. Subject
to the preceding sentence, in the event an adverse determination

 



36  may result in each party having responsibility for an amount of Taxes under
this _Article IV_ , each party shall be entitled to fully participate in that
portion of the proceedings relating to the Taxes with respect to which it may
incur liability hereunder. For purposes of this _Section 4.5(b)_, the term
"participate" shall include (i) participation in conferences, meetings or
proceedings with any Tax authority, the subject matter of which includes an
item for which such party may have liability hereunder, (ii) participation in
appearances before any court or tribunal, the subject matter of which includes
an item for which such party may have liability hereunder, and (iii) with
respect to matters described in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii),
participation in the determination of the content of the documentation,
protests, memoranda of fact and law, and briefs, and in the content and
conduct of oral arguments and presentations.

(c) _Audit Adjustments_.

 

(i) _The Sellers  Audit Adjustments_. In the event that (i) a final
determination is made by a Governmental Authority which results in an
adjustment to the Tax items reported on a Tax Return filed with respect to a
Pre-Closing Period (including that portion of a Straddle Period for which a
Seller is liable for Taxes hereunder), and (ii) that adjustment creates a
corresponding adjustment (or adjustments) that either reduces the taxable
income or increases the amount of any Tax credit reported on a Tax Return
filed with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period (including that portion of
a Straddle Period for which the Purchaser is liable for Taxes hereunder),
then assuming the Sellers have complied with their obligations pursuant to
this _Article IV_ , the Purchaser shall pay to the Sellers an amount equal to
any Tax Benefit derived by the Purchaser (or any Affiliate thereof) related
to such corresponding adjustment (or adjustments). Such payment shall be made
no later than thirty (30) days after the date of such final determination.

 

(ii) _The Purchaser s Audit Adjustments_. In the event that (i) a final
determination is made by a Governmental Authority which results in an
adjustment to the Tax items reported on a Tax Return filed with respect to a
Post-Closing Tax Period (including that portion of a Straddle Period for which
the Purchaser is liable for Taxes hereunder), and (ii) that adjustment
creates a corresponding adjustment (or adjustments) that either reduces the
taxable income or increases the amount of any Tax credit reported on a Tax
Return filed with respect to a Pre-Closing Period (including that portion of
a Straddle Period for which a Seller is liable for Taxes hereunder), then the
Sellers shall pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to any Tax Benefit derived
by the Sellers (or any Affiliate thereof) related to such corresponding
adjustment (or adjustments). Such payment shall be made no later than thirty
(30) days after the date of such final determination.

 

(d) _Assistance and Cooperation_. The Sellers, on the one hand, and the
Purchaser and the Transferred Companies, on the other hand, shall cooperate
(and cause their employees, agents and Affiliates to cooperate) with each
other and each others agents, including accounting firms and legal counsel,
as reasonably requested in 

 



37  connection with Tax matters relating to the Transferred Companies. The
parties shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and workpapers, and all
material records and other documents relating thereto, until the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations (including, to the extent notified by
any party, any extension thereof) of the Tax period to which such Tax Returns
and other documents and information relate. Any information or documents
provided under this _Section 4.5(d) _shall be kept confidential by the party
receiving such information or documents, except as may otherwise be reasonably
necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or in connection with
administrative or judicial proceedings relating to Taxes.

Section 4.6 Certain Taxes. One half of all transfer, documentary, sales,
stamp, registration and other similar Taxes and fees (including any penalties
and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be borne by the
Purchaser and one half of all such Taxes, fees, penalties and interest shall
be borne by the Sellers; except for any transfer, documentary, sales, stamp,
registration and other similar Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with the Spin-Off or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by _Section 6.19_, which shall be borne by the
Sellers.

Section 4.7 Relationship to Section 3.8 and Article IX. Any indemnification
obligations described in this _Article IV_ shall be subject to, and made in
the manner described in, _Article IX_ of this Agreement; _provided, however_ ,
that the procedures set forth in this  _Article IV_ shall apply
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 9.3_ hereof.
In the case of any indemnity claim for Taxes that arises out of both the
obligations set forth in this _Article IV_ and a breach of the
representations and warranties described in _Section 3.8_, the rights and
obligations of the parties hereto shall be governed by this _Article IV_ ;
_provided, however_ , that this _Section 4.7 _shall not limit an Indemnified
Partys right to also recover amounts representing Indemnified Amounts
(including reasonable attorneys fees and court costs), subject to the
limitations described in _Article IX_.

 

ARTICLE V

CERTAIN UNDERSTANDINGS AND AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES

Section 5.1 Consents. The Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts
to procure, and the Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist
the Sellers in procuring, all consents, novations, approvals or waivers, in a
form reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser, which are required under
applicable Law or the terms of any Material Agreement to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Spin-Off);
_provided_ that neither party shall be obligated to make any payments to third
parties or undertake any obligations in connection with the procurement of
such consents (other than as expressly provided pursuant to _Section 6.19_
and _Section 6.20_) and the Sellers and the Purchaser acknowledge and agree
that, other than those consents and approvals set forth on _Schedule 7.1(g)_

or waivers is not a condition to its obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.2 Notice of Environmental Claims. The Sellers shall give prompt
written notice to the Purchaser of the commencement after the date hereof of
any material Environmental Claim, or inspection of any Transferred Company or
any assets or property of

regarding such Environmental Claim, any developments in connection therewith,
and, as applicable, any responses thereto.

other prior to issuing any press release or any written public statement with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall
not issue any such press release or written public statement without the other

conditioned or delayed), except for any public disclosure which the Purchaser
or the Sellers in good faith believe is required by Law (in which case the
disclosing party will consult with the other party prior to making such
disclosure);  _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser and its Affiliates may,
without the prior consent of the Sellers, issue any non-public release or

notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers and their Affiliates may, without
the prior consent of the Purchaser, disclose information with respect to this
Agreement, other transaction documents or the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Purchase Price and other terms of the Agreement or
other transaction documents) to any of its or their respective Affiliates,
accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives, in each
case, which are subject to confidentiality obligations with respect to the
information disclosed to them.

Section 5.4 Compliance with WARN Act. The Purchaser agrees that it will not,
and will cause its Affiliates not to, cause any of the employees of the
Transferred Companies to suffer an "employment loss" for purposes of the WARN
Act if such employment loss would create, or would reasonably be expected to
create, any liability for the Sellers under the WARN Act or any similar state
or local applicable law. The Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be responsible
for all liabilities under the WARN Act and any similar state or local Legal
Requirement solely resulting from (a) the Closing and/or (b) from the actions
of the Purchaser and its Affiliates following the Closing. Upon the

shall, and the Sellers and the Company shall cause their Affiliates,
including the WM Parent, and representatives not to, directly or indirectly,
encourage, solicit, participate in or initiate discussions or negotiations

for the sale, merger, combination, joint venture or other transaction
involving all or any part of the Business and properties of the Transferred
Companies.

Section 6.4 Financing.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, prior to the Closing,
the Purchaser shall take, and cause its Affiliates to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
and advisable to consummate the Equity Financing pursuant to the terms of the
Equity Commitment Letter. Subject to the terms and conditions herein
provided, prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall use reasonable best
efforts to take, and cause its Affiliates to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper and
advisable to consummate and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, such actions and things shall include using its
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letters in
accordance with their respective terms and subject to their respective
conditions, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions and covenants
applicable to the Purchaser in the Commitment Letters, and otherwise
complying on a timely basis with its material obligations under the Commitment
Letters, (iii) negotiate and entering into all definitive agreements with

43  conditions contained in the Commitment Letters (including any flex
provisions related thereto) so that such agreements are effective no later
than the date intended for Closing, and (iv) enforce its rights under the
Debt Commitment Letter in the event of a breach thereof by any of the other
parties thereto to fully satisfy such breaching partys obligations (and the
rights of the Purchaser) thereunder.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall give the Sellers prompt (and in
any event, within three (3) Business Days) written notice: (i) of any default
or breach (or any event that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would reasonably be expected to give rise to any default or breach) by any
party to the Commitment Letters or definitive documents related to the
Financing of which the Purchaser or its Affiliates becomes aware, (ii) of the
receipt of any written notice or other communication from any party (other
than the Purchaser) to a Commitment Letter with respect to any (A) actual or
potential default, breach, termination or repudiation by any party to a
Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Financing or any
provisions of a Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to
the Financing or (B) significant dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to a Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the
Financing, (iii) if for any reason the Purchaser has reasonably determined in
good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the
Commitment Letters (including the flex provisions), and (iv) subject to
_Section 6.4(c) _and  _6.4(d)_ below, of any amendment, modification or
replacement of any Commitment Letter with copies thereof. As soon as
reasonably practicable, but in any event, within three (3) Business Days
following delivery by the Sellers to the Purchaser of written request
therefor, the Purchaser shall provide any information reasonably requested by
the Sellers relating to any circumstance referred to in the immediately
preceding sentence.

 

(c) Except as permitted by _Section 6.4(d)_, prior to the Closing, the
Purchaser shall not, without the prior written consent of the Sellers, permit
any amendment or modification to be made to, or consent to any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letters, if such amendment,
modification or waiver (i) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing
contemplated in the Commitment Letters below the amount that, together with
any other equity contributions or alternative financings effected and
Purchasers cash on hand, is sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including by changing the amount of fees to
be paid or the original issue discount of the Debt Financing), (ii) imposes
new or additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of
the conditions to the receipt of the Financing in a manner materially adverse
to the Purchaser or the Transferred Companies, or (iii) amends or modifies any
other term of a Commitment Letter in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to (x) delay in any material respect or prevent the Closing (
_provided_ that no delay, regardless of materiality, shall be permitted if it
would extend the Closing beyond the Termination Date) or (y) materially
adversely impact the ability of the Purchaser to enforce its rights against
the other parties to the Commitment Letters. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Purchaser may, at any time prior to Closing terminate the
Debt Commitment Letter and enter into arrangements for any Alternate
Debt Financing (as defined below), so long as such Alternate Debt Financing
and any New Debt Commitment Letter in respect thereof meets

 



44  the conditions set forth in _Section 6.4(d) _with respect to any Alternate
Debt Financing. Any reference in this Agreement to (x) "Debt Financing" shall
include the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as amended
or modified in compliance with this _Section 6.4(c)_, and (y) "Debt
Commitment Letter" shall include such document as amended or modified in
compliance with this _Section 6.4(c)_.

(d) Prior to the Closing, other than as permitted in _Section 6.4(c)_, if
any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, the Purchaser shall use
its reasonable best efforts to arrange promptly to obtain alternative
financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on any terms and conditions,
_provided_ that such terms and conditions taken as a whole would not be
reasonably expected to materially delay or prevent the Closing ( _provided_
that no delay, regardless of materiality, shall be permitted if it would
extend the Closing beyond the Termination Date) (the " _Alternate Debt
Financing_ "), and to obtain a new financing commitment letter with respect
to such Alternate Debt Financing (together with any related fee letter, the "
_New Debt Commitment Letter_ ") which shall replace the existing Debt
Commitment Letter, a true, complete and correct copy of which shall be
provided by the Purchaser to the Sellers promptly and in any event, within two
(2) Business Days after the execution thereof by the parties to the New Debt
Commitment Letter. If any New Debt Commitment Letter is obtained by the
Purchaser, any reference in this Agreement to (i) Debt Financing shall mean
the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as modified,
amended, supplemented, restated or replaced by the New Debt Commitment Letter,
and shall include any Alternate Debt Financing, (ii) "Debt Commitment Letter"
shall include the Debt Commitment Letter as modified, amended, supplemented,
restated or replaced by the New Debt Commitment Letter, and (iii) "Lenders"
shall mean the lenders and other financing sources providing the Debt
Financing (as modified by clause (i) above), including the parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter or the New Debt Commitment Letter, as applicable, and any
definitive agreements related thereto.

(e) The Purchaser shall refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any
action that would reasonably be expected to result in the failure of any of
the conditions contained in the Commitment Letters or any definitive agreement
relating to the Financing. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the
obtaining of the Financing or any Alternate Debt Financing is not a condition
to the Closing and reaffirms its obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of the receipt
of the Financing or the availability of the Financing or any Alternate
Debt Financing, or the completion of any such borrowing, subject to the
applicable conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_.

 

(f) The Company and the Sellers shall and shall cause the other Transferred
Companies (and its and their respective applicable senior management,
personnel and advisors) to cooperate and provide such information reasonably
requested by the Purchaser or the Lenders in connection with the arrangement,
placement or completion of the Debt Financing, including (i) providing the
Purchaser, any Lender, or any Affiliates of any such Person or any of their
respective stockholders, members, partners, managers,

 



45  officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors, representatives,
successors or permitted assigns who have a need to know such information in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, with financial and
other information in the Companys or the Sellers possession, including all
financial statements, financial data, audit reports and other information of
the type reasonably requested by the Purchaser, (ii) reasonable participation
in meetings, presentations, and sessions with rating agencies, (iii) providing
reasonable assistance with respect to the preparation of materials for ratings
agency presentations, bank information memoranda and similar documents, in
each case, including public and private versions of such documents (to the
extent applicable) and in connection with the marketing, syndication and
arrangement of, and/or satisfying the conditions to, the Debt Financing, and
(iv) providing all documentation and other information about the Transferred
Companies as is reasonably requested in writing at least 3 Business Days prior
to the Closing Date in connection with the Debt Financing and relating to
applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act.

(g) The Company shall deliver to the Purchaser the interim financial
statements consisting of an unaudited combined balance sheet of the
Transferred Companies as at the end of, and related statement of income of the
Transferred Companies for, each fiscal quarter (other than the fourth fiscal
quarter of any fiscal year) of the Transferred Companies subsequent to March
31, 2014 no later than forty-five (45) days following the conclusion of such
quarterly reporting period, in each case prepared in accordance with GAAP and
accompanied by a certification from an officer of the Transferred Companies
reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser that such financial statements fairly
present, in all material respects, the financial condition of the Transferred
Companies as of the dates thereof and the results of such Transferred
Companies operations for the periods covered thereby except for the absence
of footnotes disclosures and year-end adjustments (such information, the "
_Requested Information_ "). Upon request from the Purchaser, the Sellers shall
provide the Purchaser with monthly internal financial information of the
Company (which, for clarity of purpose, will not necessarily represent
the Transferred Companies on a combined basis) as soon as available following
the conclusion of each calendar month, which financial information shall be in
the form regularly prepared by the Company.

 

Section 6.5 Notification of Certain Matters. The Sellers and the Purchaser
agree to give prompt notice to each other of, and to use their respective
reasonable best efforts to prevent or promptly remedy, (a) the occurrence or
failure to occur or the impending or threatened occurrence or failure to
occur, of any event which occurrence or failure to occur would be likely to
cause any of its representations or warranties in this Agreement to be untrue
or inaccurate in any material respect such that (i) in the case of
notification by the Purchaser to the Sellers, the Sellers condition to
Closing set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_, and (ii) in the case of notification
by the Sellers to the Purchaser, the Purchasers condition to Closing set
forth in _Section 7.2(b)_, could reasonably be expected not to be satisfied
as of the Closing Date, and (b) any material failure (or any failure in the
case of any covenant, condition or agreement containing any materiality
qualification) on its part to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder such that (A)
in the case of notification by the Purchaser to the Sellers, the Sellers
condition to Closing set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_, and (B) in 

 



46  the case of notification by the Sellers to the Purchaser, the Purchasers
condition to Closing set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_, could reasonably be
expected not to be satisfied as of the Closing Date; _provided, however_ ,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice. Further, the Sellers and the Purchaser agree to give prompt notice to
each other once all their conditions to close set forth in _Section 7.1_ and
_Section 7.2_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be

in any event prior to fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof, an

Section 6.7 Transferred Company Indemnification.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser and the Company shall,
jointly and severally, and shall cause the other Transferred Companies to,
jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless, and advance expenses as
incurred to, in each case to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, each Person who from and after the Closing is a director,
officer, employee, member, manager or representative of any Transferred
Company (collectively, the " _Transferred Company Indemnified Parties_ ") in a
manner consistent with the terms and conditions on which indemnification is
provided for as of the date hereof against any costs, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement (collectively, " _Costs_ ")
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or related to such Transferred Company Indemnified Parties
service as a director, officer, member or manager of the Transferred
Companies or services performed by such Persons at the request of the
Transferred Companies at or prior to the Closing Date, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Closing Date, including, for the avoidance
of doubt, in connection with actions to enforce this provision; _provided_
that the Person to whom Costs are advanced provides a reasonable and customary
undertaking to repay such Costs if it is ultimately determined that such
Person is not entitled to indemnification.

 



48 (b) From and after the Closing Date, the Company shall maintain, and
the Purchaser and Company shall cause the other Transferred Companies to
maintain in effect the provisions in their Organizational Documents to the
extent they provide for indemnification, advancement and reimbursement of
expenses and exculpation of Transferred Company Indemnified Parties, as
applicable, with respect to facts or circumstances occurring at or prior to
the Closing Date, on the same basis as set forth in the Organizational
Documents of the Company and the other Transferred Companies in effect on the
date of this Agreement (true and complete copies of which have been provided
or made available to the Purchaser), to the fullest extent permitted from time
to time by applicable Law, which provisions shall not be amended except as
required by applicable Law or to make changes permitted by applicable Law that
would enlarge the scope of the Transferred Company Indemnified Parties
indemnification rights thereunder.

 

(c) The covenants contained in this _Section 6.7 _are intended to be for the
irrevocable benefit of and to grant third-party rights to, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Transferred Company Indemnified Parties and their
respective heirs and legal representatives and shall not be deemed exclusive
of any other rights to which a Transferred Company Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise and shall be binding
on all successors and assigns of the Purchaser and, subsequent to the Closing,
the Company. The obligations of Purchaser under this  _Section 6.7 _shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Transferred Company Indemnified Party unless the affected Transferred Company
Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to such termination or
modification. It is expressly agreed that each Transferred Company Indemnified
Party shall be a third-party beneficiary of this _Section 6.7_, and entitled
to enforce the covenants contained in this _Section 6.7_. If any Transferred
Company Indemnified Party makes any claim for indemnification or advancement
of expenses under this _Section 6.7 _that is denied by the Purchaser and/or
any Transferred Company, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines
that the Transferred Company Indemnified Party is entitled to such
indemnification, then the Purchaser shall or shall cause the applicable
Transferred Company to pay such Transferred Company Indemnified Partys
reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses,
incurred in connection with pursuing such claim against the Purchaser and/or
applicable Transferred Company. The rights of the Transferred Company
Indemnified Parties under this  _Section 6.7 _shall be in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any rights such Transferred Company Indemnified
Parties may have under the Organizational Documents of any of Transferred
Companies or under any applicable contracts, insurance policies or Laws. In
addition to the indemnification obligations under the Organizational Documents
of the Transferred Companies, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the
Transferred Companies to, honor and perform under all indemnification
agreements entered into by Transferred Companies that are set forth on
_Schedule 6.7_ hereto or otherwise are not material and were entered into in
the Ordinary Course of Business prior to the date hereof.

 

Section 6.8 Resignations. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall
cause to be delivered to the Purchaser duly executed resignations and
releases, in the forms attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ , effective as of the
Closing, of those officers and directors of the Transferred Companies set
forth on _Schedule 6.8_.

 



49 Section 6.9 Replacement of Seller Credit Enhancements; Bridged Seller
Guarantees.  

(a) Subject to the Purchasers requirement to obtain the return or release of
the Material WM Guarantees at Closing pursuant to _Section 1.5(b)(iv)_, and
except for those guarantees set forth on _Schedule 6.9(a)(i)_ (the " _Bridged
Seller Guarantees_ ") which shall be permitted to remain outstanding after the
Closing (subject to and in accordance with _Section 6.9(d)_), the Purchaser
shall provide no later than thirty (30) days after Closing substitute Credit
Support to the beneficiaries of the Credit Support provided by any WM Company
of the obligations of the Transferred Companies described in _Schedule
6.9(a)(ii)_ (the " _Scheduled Seller Credit Enhancements_ "), in order to
facilitate the release and return of such Scheduled Seller Credit Enhancements
on or within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date. In addition, in the
event that following the date hereof the parties discover, or any WM Company
provides, any Credit Support of the obligations of the Transferred Companies
in addition to (i) the Bridged Seller Guarantees or (ii) the Scheduled Seller
Credit Enhancements (such additional Credit Support collectively, the "
_Unscheduled Seller Credit Enhancements_ " and, together with the Scheduled
Seller Credit Enhancements, the " _Seller Credit Enhancements_ "), the
Sellers shall provide the Purchaser with notice thereof. The Purchaser will
use its reasonable best efforts to have all such Seller Credit Enhancements
released and returned to the Sellers by the date that is thirty (30) days
following the Closing Date or, with respect to an Unscheduled Seller Credit
Enhancement, a date that is thirty (30) days following the delivery by the
Sellers of notice of an Unscheduled Seller Credit Enhancement, if such date
is later than thirty (30) days following the Closing Date (the " _Return Date_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) after the date hereof and prior to
Closing, the WM Companies shall not provide Credit Support for the
obligations of the Transferred Companies in addition to the Bridged Seller
Guarantees or the Scheduled Seller Credit Enhancements in excess of $5,000,000
in the aggregate and (y) the Purchaser shall have no obligation to replace
any Unscheduled Seller Credit Enhancements in an aggregate amount in excess of
$5,000,000, in the case of (x) and (y), unless the Purchaser otherwise agrees
in writing.

 

(b) The Purchaser shall provide information to the Sellers regarding the
status of such replacement and return efforts either (x) upon the Sellers
reasonable request or (y) upon the date that is fifteen (15) days prior to the
Return Date to the extent that certain Seller Credit Enhancements have not yet
been released and returned to the Sellers.

 

(c) If any Seller Credit Enhancement that is not a guarantee has not been
returned to the Sellers by the Return Date (an " _Unreturned Seller Credit
Enhancement_ "), the Purchaser and the Company shall promptly (but in no event
more than five (5) Business Days after the Return Date) cause a "back-to-back"
letter of credit and/or bond, as applicable, to be issued in favor of, and
naming as beneficiary, the WM Companies providing the Unreturned Seller Credit
Enhancement in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of each applicable
Unreturned Seller Credit Enhancement. Such amount of such back-to-back letter
of credit or bond may be reduced upon and to the extent the obligations
covered by such Seller Credit Enhancement have been terminated or reduced as
acknowledged by the counterparty.

 



50 (d) The Purchaser shall (i) from and after the Closing Date, provide
audited financial statements of the Company and the other Transferred
Companies, (ii) from and after the date hereof, coordinate with the Sellers
and the Company to offer a guaranty or guarantees from the Company and the
other Transferred Companies to the beneficiaries of the Bridged Seller
Guarantees in replacement, or for the return, of such Bridged Seller
Guaranties, and (iii) from and after the date hereof, otherwise use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the return of the Seller Credit
Enhancements and Bridged Seller Guarantees from the beneficiaries thereof
until such time that the underlying obligations secured by such Seller Credit
Enhancements and Bridged Seller Guarantees are terminated or otherwise expire.
From and after the date hereof (including after the Closing) the Sellers
shall reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser with respect to the replacement
or return of the Seller Credit Enhancements and Bridged Seller Guaranties
(provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, Sellers shall not be required to
make any payment, incur any out-of-pocket cost or otherwise increase its
exposure in connection with this cooperation). If any Bridged Seller Guarantee
set forth on _Schedule 6.9(d)_ (the " _Material Bridged Guarantees_ ")
remains outstanding six (6) months after the Closing Date (the " _Grace
Period_ "), the Purchaser and the Company shall pay the Sellers a credit
support fee for each day that any such Material Bridged Guarantee is
outstanding after such six (6) month period in an amount equal to (1) the
Bridged Guarantee Amount for such Material Bridged Guarantee multiplied by (2)
the Credit Factor relating to such Material Bridged Guaranty multiplied by
(3) the greater of (x) 2.5 % per annum or (y) with respect to any portion of
the Bridged Guarantee Amounts, a per annum rate equal to WM Parents per annum
Letter of Credit Cost under its credit facility with the lowest Letter of
Credit Cost then in effect for such portion of the Material Bridged Guarantees
for which there is no remaining capacity under a credit facility with a lower
Letter of Credit Cost (in the case of this clause (y), only from and after
the date on which the Sellers have provided to Purchaser reasonable
documentation evidencing such Letter of Credit Cost and only for the period
during which such Letter of Credit Cost are in excess of 2.5% per annum),
which credit support fee will be payable quarterly in arrears, beginning with
the first full quarterly period after the Grace Period until the Material
Bridged Guarantee is returned or released back to the Sellers and with each
quarterly payment due on or before the fifth (5th) business day after the end
of the applicable quarterly period (the " _Bridged Guarantee Support Payment_
"). To the extent WM Parents per annum Letter of Credit Cost is then in
excess of 2.5% per annum, the Sellers shall provide Purchasers with prompt
notice of any decrease in WM Parents per annum Letter of Credit Cost below
2.5% per annum.

 

(e) Without limiting the foregoing, (i) the Scheduled Seller Credit
Enhancements, Bridged Seller Guarantees and any Unscheduled Seller Credit
Enhancements (other than Unscheduled Seller Credit Enhancements in excess of
$5,000,000 in the aggregate without the approval of the Purchaser) related to
any Transferred Company shall be returned to the Sellers upon the earlier to
occur of (A) six (6) years after the Closing Date or (B) a Change of Control
of such Transferred Company (whether directly or as a result of the Change of
Control of the Purchaser or the 

 



51  Company), and (ii) from and after the Closing, the Purchaser and the Company
shall not amend, extend or otherwise modify, or allow any of the Transferred
Companies to amend, extend or otherwise modify, the terms of the underlying
obligations of the Company or such Transferred Companies under agreements
secured by any Seller Credit Enhancements or Bridged Seller Guarantees (other
than the exercise by a counterparty of its extension rights under any
Specified Extension Agreement pursuant to the terms of such Specified
Extension Agreement), until such Seller Credit Enhancement or Bridged Seller
Guarantee, as applicable, is returned and replaced to the Sellers.
The Purchaser and the Company shall (x) bear all costs and expenses incurred
in connection with the replacement and return, or providing back-up Credit
Support to a WM Company, of the Seller Credit Enhancements or Bridged Seller
Guarantees; (y) reimburse the Sellers for all costs, premiums, fees and other
expenses paid or incurred by any WM Company with respect to issuing, providing
or maintaining any Unreturned Seller Credit Enhancement; and (z) reimburse,
indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties for all
Indemnified Amounts resulting from any draw or claim with respect to the
Seller Credit Enhancements or the Bridged Seller Guarantees.

 

(f) In the event that six (6) years after the Closing Date any Material
Bridged Guaranty remains outstanding, then the Bridged Guarantee Support
Payment applicable to such Material Bridged Guarantee payable by the Purchaser
and the Company (including any successor or assigns) following such time shall
be increased by a multiple of three times.

 

Section 6.10 Payoff Letters. At least six (6) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Sellers shall deliver to the Purchaser (A) copies of
instructions provided by, or on behalf of, the Sellers in accordance with the
terms of the instruments, documents and agreements governing the applicable
Terminated Debt for purposes of either terminating, redeeming or defeasing
and redeeming, as the case may be, such applicable Terminated Debt and (B)
copies of executed payoff or instruction letters, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser (such instructions and payoff letters
are collectively referred to in this _Section 6.10_ as the " _Payoff
Letters_ "), from the applicable debt providers (or agents or trustees
therefor) in respect of the Terminated Debt that (W) confirm the
aggregate outstanding amount required to be paid or irrevocably deposited to
fully satisfy, redeem, defease or discharge such applicable Terminated Debt in
accordance with the terms of the applicable indenture, agreement and related
documents governing such Terminated Debt as of the anticipated Closing Date
(and the daily per diem accrual of interest and premium, if applicable,
thereafter) (the " _Payoff Amount_ "), (X) provide that upon receipt or
(pursuant to the terms of any applicable Terminated Debt) deposit in
irrevocable escrow of the applicable Payoff Amount, such Terminated Debt shall
be terminated, defeased or redeemed, as the case may be, except for (aa)
contingent indemnification obligations (to the extent no claims thereon have
been made as of the Closing Date) which by their terms survive the termination
of such Terminated Debt or (bb) any applicable defeasance or escrow provisions
(to the extent provided for in the applicable indentures as of the
date hereof) with respect to the Terminated Debt, _provided_ that the
Terminated Debt shall have been defeased and the liens of the Terminated Debt
discharged as of the Closing, and (Y) provide that (i) all liens and any
applicable guarantees or letters of credit granted in connection with such
Terminated Debt shall be, upon the payment or deposit in escrow of the Payoff
Amount at the Closing, automatically released, terminated and discharged and
(ii) the Transferred Companies,

 



52  the Purchaser or their designees are authorized from and after the Closing
to file all Uniform Commercial Code termination statements as are necessary to
effectuate, or reflect of public record, the release and discharge of such
liens. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall (1) have paid or
irrevocably deposited with the applicable issuer or indenture trustee, the
applicable Payoff Amount with respect to all Terminated Debt, (2) have taken
all actions and delivered, or caused to be delivered, all documents required
under the agreements or indentures governing the Terminated Debt to terminate
or defease and discharge the Terminated Debt and release the liens of the
applicable agreements and indentures with respect thereto and (3) obtain all
documents, terminations and releases (including with respect to outstanding
mortgages), as are reasonably necessary to release such liens, in each case
in customary form and substance. The Sellers shall be responsible for all
costs, expenses, fees and other amounts payable in connection with the Payoff
Amount and shall provide confirmations that all Terminated Debt has been
either fully paid and settled or defeased and discharged prior to or upon
Closing.

Section 6.11 Employment Matters.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 6.11(b) _or as otherwise agreed
with any employee, immediately following the Closing, the Purchaser shall
cause the Transferred Companies to continue the employment of each individual
who is, immediately prior to the Closing, employed by any of the Transferred
Companies, at the same seniority and in substantially the same positions and
functions as such employee held immediately prior to the Closing Date (the "
_Continued Employees"_ ). Subject to any WARN Act liabilities allocated
pursuant to _Section 5.4_, neither the foregoing nor any other provision of
this Agreement shall constitute a commitment, undertaking or other obligation
on behalf of Purchaser or the Company to continue the employment of such
Continued Employee for any period of time, and all Continued Employees shall
be "at will" employees of the Company (unless applicable law determines
otherwise) whose employment may be terminated at any time subject to
applicable agreements, if any, of particular Continued Employees with respect
to severance or other rights in connection with termination of employment.

(b) From and after the Closing, the Sellers and their Affiliates (other than
the Transferred Companies) shall retain or assume sponsorship of (i) all the
Benefit Plans that are not Company Benefit Plans, (ii) payments required under
the Wheelabrator Metals Recovery Incentive Bonus Program for Plant Employees
and the Wheelabrator Performance Incentive Program for performance from
January 1 through the Closing Date and (iii) each United States based Company
Benefit Plan that provides for retiree health or life insurance

Swanson Retirees Medical Benefits; Program of Group Health Care Benefits for
Hourly Retirees Post 1986 (Plan 1 and Disabled Under 65 and Plan II), and
Wheelabrator Corporation Retirees Age 65 and Over Group Health Benefits)) or
nonqualified pension or United States based deferred compensation benefits
(including the Retirement Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Wheelabrator
Technologies, Inc.), and in each case shall retain or assume all commitments,
liabilities and obligations thereunder, whether arising before, on or after
the Closing. From and after the Closing, the Transferred Companies shall
retain and assume sponsorship for all Company Benefit Plans other than the
ones described in clause (ii) and (iii) of the previous sentence and shall
retain and assume all commitments, liabilities and obligations thereunder,
whether arising before, on or after the Closing.

 



53 (c) The Sellers shall pay to each eligible employee of any Transferred Company
a prorated payment in accordance with WM Parents Annual Incentive Program
for the period from January 1 through the Closing Date for the year in which
the Closing occurs based on the terms of the program as previously
announced;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if actual results are not available
target results of the applicable performance measures for that year may be
used.

 

(d) With respect to Continuing Employees and their dependents and
beneficiaries, (a) the Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the
Transferred Companies) shall be solely responsible for (i) claims for welfare
benefits that are incurred under the Benefits Plans (other than the Company
Benefit Plans) on or prior to the Closing, (ii) claims for workers
compensation benefits that are incurred on or prior to the Closing and (iii)
COBRA claims attributable to "qualifying events" that occur on or prior to the
Closing and (b) the Purchaser shall be solely responsible for (i) claims for
welfare benefits that are incurred following the Closing or under the Company
Benefit Plans at any time, (ii) claims for workers compensation benefits that
are incurred following the Closing and (iii) COBRA claims attributable to
"qualifying events" that occur following the Closing. For purposes of the
foregoing, (A) a claim for welfare benefits shall be considered incurred as
follows: (x) long-term disability, life, accidental death and dismemberment,
and business travel accident insurance benefits, upon the death, accident or
other event giving rise to such benefits, and (y) short-term disability,
health, dental and prescription drug benefits, upon provision of
such compensation, services, materials or supplies, and (B) a claim for
workers compensation benefits shall be considered incurred when the injury or
condition giving rise to the claim occurs. In the case of a workers
compensation claim relating to an injury or condition that occurred over a
period both preceding and following the Closing, the claim shall be the joint
responsibility of the Sellers and the Purchaser and be equitably apportioned
between them based upon the relative periods of time that the condition or
injury transpired preceding and following the Closing.

(e) Sellers and Purchaser shall take any action necessary to allow any
Continued Employee who so elects to roll over his or her account balance
(including outstanding loans, other than any loans with respect to which there
have been any missed or late payments or that are in default) from any
Benefit Plan that is a qualified defined contribution plan that includes a
qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of
the Code into an applicable benefit plan of the Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates.

(f) The Closing shall not be deemed to be a "separation from service" (as such
term is defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(a)(1)) for any
Continuing Employee who is a Participant in the WM 409A Deferral Plan as of
the Closing, however, each such Continuing Employees active participation
under the WM 409A Deferral Plan shall cease at Closing. For purposes of the
Sellers complying with the

 



54  requirement to distribute Participant account balances in accordance with
the terms of the WM 409A Deferral Plan and the requirements of Section 409A of
the Code, the Purchaser shall notify the Sellers any time that a Continuing
Employee has a distribution event under the WM 409A Deferral Plan. Such
notification shall contain the identity, the type and date of distribution
event (the event triggering the distribution including, but not limited to,
separation from service, death, or disability), and address of such Continuing
Employee and shall be provided within thirty (30) days following the
occurrence of the distribution event.

 

(g) The provisions of this _Section 6.11 _are for the sole benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended
or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any person (including any
Participant), other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted
successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies
under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement. Nothing contained
herein, express or implied, (i) shall be construed to establish, amend, or
modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement; or (ii) shall
alter or limit the Sellers or the Purchasers ability to amend, modify or
terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement; or (iii) is
intended to confer upon any person (including any Participant) any right to
any particular term or condition of employment.

Section 6.12 Further Assurances. The Sellers and the Purchaser each agree
that from time to time after the Closing Date and at the prior written request
of the other party and without further consideration, they will execute and
deliver such further instruments, provide such materials and information and
take such other action, as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the
purpose and intent of this Agreement with respect to the Closing.

 

Section 6.13 Termination of Certain Agreements. All contracts or agreements
between any Transferred Company, on the one hand, and any WM Company, on the
other hand (the " _Affiliate Contracts_ ") (other than the Transition Services
Agreement, the Waste Supply Agreements and the Continuing Agreements), shall
be terminated immediately prior to the Closing such that there will be no
remaining liabilities, obligations, restrictions or payments from, to or
between any Transferred Company and any WM Company with respect to such
terminated Affiliate Contracts as of the Closing.

 

Section 6.14 Intercompany Accounts. At or prior to the Closing, the Sellers
shall cause to be settled, repaid or cancelled all intercompany accounts
between any Transferred Company, on the one hand, and any WM Company, on the
other hand, without any post-Closing liability (except for those accounts
related to Affiliate Contracts to the extent included in the calculation
of Adjusted Closing Net Working Capital or Closing Net Debt).

Section 6.15 Insurance.

 

(a) The Purchaser shall be solely responsible for providing insurance to each
Transferred Company and the Business after the Closing. The Sellers shall
maintain or cause to be maintained in full force and effect the material
insurance policies (or renewals thereof) covering each Transferred Company and
the Business until the Closing. Without limiting the rights of the Purchaser
set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, if any claims

 



55  may reasonably be made relating to acts, omissions, events or circumstances
that have occurred or are existing prior to the Closing Date that relate to
any of the Transferred Companies or the Business, and such claims may be made
against occurrence based insurance policies of any WM Company, then the
Sellers (on behalf of themselves and each other WM Company) shall, at the
Purchasers request and at the Purchasers sole cost and expense, including
any deductibles and self-retention amounts (which costs and expenses shall be
reimbursed to the Sellers, as incurred), use their reasonable best efforts to
permit the Purchaser (after the Closing Date and in cooperation with the
Sellers) to file, notice and otherwise continue to pursue such claims under
the terms of such policies, and, subject to all of the foregoing, the Sellers
(on behalf of themselves and each other WM Company) agree (at the Purchasers
sole cost and expense, including any deductibles and self-retention amounts)
to otherwise reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser or any applicable
Transferred Company to make the benefits of any such insurance policies
available to the Purchaser or any applicable Transferred Company. Nothing
herein shall alter the right of a party to control a Third Party Claim
pursuant to _Section 9.3_.

 

(b) Subject to any applicable legal restrictions, for a period of five (5)
years from and after the Closing Date, the Sellers shall cooperate (and shall
cause its employees, agents and the WM Companies to cooperate) with the
Purchaser and the Transferred Companies with all loss history or other
reasonably necessary insurance underwriting information that the Purchaser
may need associated with each Transferred Company or the Business. Such
cooperation shall include making information and documents in its possession
available to the Purchaser and assisting, at the Purchasers sole cost and
expense, the Purchaser in compiling the information necessary to fulfill such
insurance underwriting request.

Section 6.16 Risk of Loss. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section
6.16_, during the period between the date hereof and the Closing (the "
_Interim Period_ ") all risk of loss or damage to the property or assets of
the Transferred Companies shall, as between the Purchaser and the Sellers, be
borne by the Sellers. If during the Interim Period the property or assets of
the Transferred Companies are damaged by fire or other casualty (each such
event, an " _Event of Loss_ "), or are taken by a Governmental Authority by
exercise of the power of eminent domain (each, a " _Taking_ "), then the
following provisions of this _Section 6.16_ shall apply:

 

(a) Following the occurrence of (i) any one or more Events of Loss, if the
aggregate costs to restore, repair or replace the property or assets of the
Transferred Companies subject to such Event of Loss to a condition reasonably
comparable to their prior condition, plus the net present value calculated at
the Discount Rate of any lost profits reasonably expected to accrue after
Closing as a direct result of such Event of Loss, such amount pursuant to this
clause (i) to be determined by an independent third party appraiser mutually
selected by the Parties (collectively, " _Restoration Costs_ ") and/or (ii)
any one or more Takings, if the value of the property subject to such Taking
plus the net present value calculated at the Discount Rate of any lost profits
reasonably expected to accrue after Closing as a direct result of such Event
of Loss, less any condemnation award received by the Purchaser ( _provided_
that any such condemnation award is made available to the Purchaser), such
amount pursuant to this clause (ii) to be determined by 

 



56  an independent third party appraiser mutually selected by the Parties
(collectively, the " _Condemnation Value_ "), is, in the aggregate, less than
or equal to 1.5% of the Initial Purchase Price, there shall be no effect on
the transactions contemplated hereby, including any reduction in the Purchase
Price, or the parties respective obligations to consummate the purchase and
sale contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) Subject to the termination right of the Purchaser and the Sellers set
forth in clause (c) below, upon the occurrence of any one or more Events of
Loss and/or Takings involving aggregate Restoration Costs and Condemnation
Value in excess of 1.5% of the Initial Purchase Price (a " _Major Loss_ "),
the Sellers shall have, in the case of a Major Loss relating solely to one or
more Events of Loss, the option, exercised by notice to the Purchaser, to
restore, repair or replace the damaged assets or properties prior to Closing
to a condition reasonably comparable to their prior condition. If the Sellers
elect to so restore, repair or replace the assets or properties relating to a
Major Loss, which election shall be made by notice to the Purchaser prior to
the Closing Date and as soon as practicable following the occurrence of such
Major Loss, the Sellers will complete or cause to be completed the repair,
replacement or restoration of the damaged assets or property prior to the
Closing and the Closing Date shall be postponed for the amount of time
reasonably necessary to complete the restoration, repair or replacement of
such property or assets as reasonably agreed among the Purchaser and the
Sellers (including, if necessary, the extension of the Termination Date
contemplated by _Section 8.1 _to allow for the restoration, repair or
replacement of such assets or properties). If the Sellers elect not to cause
the restoration, repair or replacement of the property or assets affected by a
Major Loss, or such Major Loss is the result in whole or in part of one or
more Takings or is otherwise not capable of being restored, repaired or
replaced, then the provisions of _Section 6.16(c)_ will apply.

 

(c) Subject to the termination right of the Purchaser and the Sellers set
forth in clause (d) below, in the event that the Sellers elect not to cause
the restoration, repair or replacement of a Major Loss, or in the event that
the Sellers, having elected to cause repair, replacement or restoration of the
Major Loss, fail to cause its completion within the period of time agreed
upon by the Parties pursuant to _Section 6.16(b) _(subject to extension for
up to 90 days for causes beyond the Sellers control), or in the event that a
Major Loss is the result in whole or in part of one or more Takings or is
otherwise not capable of being restored, repaired or replaced, then the
Parties shall, within 30 days following the Sellers election not to cause the
restoration, repair or replacement, failure to complete, or the occurrence of
such Major Loss, as the case may be, adjust the Initial Purchase Price by the
aggregate Restoration Cost and/or Condemnation Value related thereto, as
mitigated by any repair, replacement or restoration work actually completed by
the Sellers on the assets or properties being sold to the Purchaser, and
proceed to Closing in which case the Sellers shall be entitled to the proceeds
of any insurance or condemnation payments received in connection with such
Major Loss (and, if paid to the Purchaser or the Companies, such proceeds
shall be promptly remitted to the Sellers). To assist the Purchaser in its
evaluation of any and all Events of Loss, the Sellers shall provide the
Purchaser such access to the properties and assets and such information as
the Purchaser may reasonably request in connection therewith.

 



57 (d) In the event that the aggregate Restoration Costs and/or Condemnation
Value with respect to one or more Events of Loss and/or Takings equals an
amount in excess of 10% of the Initial Purchase Price, then either the
Purchaser or the Sellers shall have the right to terminate this Agreement.

 

(e) The occurrence of an Event of Loss (including a Major Loss) during the
Interim Period shall not, in and of itself, be deemed a breach of the
Sellers representations and warranties, covenants or other obligations under
this Agreement absent some other breach of the Sellers representations and
warranties, covenants or other obligations under this Agreement. The Sellers
election pursuant to _Section 6.16(b) _or the decision to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.16(c)_ shall not, in and of itself, result
in any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of this Agreement.

Section 6.17 Consultation. From the date hereof until the Closing, the Sellers
shall provide the Purchaser with regular updates as to any developments
regarding any Development Project of the Transferred Companies on a reasonably
prompt basis and shall cause the Transferred Companies not to enter into any
material contract regarding such Development Projects without the prior
written approval of the Purchaser, such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld.

 

Section 6.18 Post-Closing Cooperation. For a period of three (3) years from
and after the Closing Date, the Sellers shall reasonably cooperate (and shall
cause their employees, agents and Affiliates to reasonably cooperate) with the
Purchaser and its Affiliates in connection with any prospective Securities Act
of 1933, as amended, filing relating to the Company and the other Transferred
Companies on a consolidated basis. Such cooperation shall include making all
relevant information and documents in its possession available to the
Purchaser and providing assistance to the Purchaser in its compiling of
the information necessary to fulfill the requirements of such filing and
providing assistance to the Purchaser in its preparation of financial
statements for the Company and the other Transferred Companies on a
consolidated basis for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2014, December
31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, presented in accordance with SEC accounting
presentation principles for public companies and as set forth by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board. The Purchaser shall pay to the Sellers
the Internal Costs and external costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the
Sellers or their Affiliates in providing such cooperation and assistance. For
the purpose hereof, " _Internal Costs_ " shall mean the base salary and 100%
of any projected bonus of employees providing services under the applicable
covenant, on an hourly basis, plus a benefit load and overhead allocation
equal to 30% of base salary.

their respective obligations under the SPE Leases, including payment and
performance obligations;

 

(ii) use reasonable best efforts to, as soon as reasonably possible, commence
and complete the appraisal procedures for the Fair Market Sales Value (as
defined in the SPE Leases) of each SPE Facility in connection with the
Purchase Options in order to permit each of the SPE Lessees to validly
exercise the Purchase Options no later than the earlier to occur of December
31, 2014 or the Closing Date;

(iii) cause each of the SPE Lessees to validly exercise the Purchase
Options no later than the earlier to occur of December 31, 2014 or the

in the name of the SPEs or the owner trustees (as lessors under the SPE
Leases), and all other parts, equipment or assets relating to the SPE
Facilities pursuant to applicable transfer, deed and assignment agreements in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser (collectively,
the " _Facility Purchases_ " and the date(s) on which the Facility Purchases
shall be consummated, the " _Facility Purchase Closing_ "). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the Sellers and Purchaser agree
that the occurrence of the Facility Purchase Closing prior to the Closing is
not a condition to Closing, if and to the extent the appraisal process for the
Fair Market Sales Value required in connection with the Purchase Option has
commenced prior to Closing.

(c) From the date of this Agreement until the Facility Purchase Closing, the
Sellers shall (i) cause each SPE to continue to operate in the Ordinary
Course of Business, except as necessary to pursue the Buyout or the Facility
Purchases, as applicable, and the appraisals required in connection with the
Facility Purchases and renewals of the SPE Leases; and (ii) cause the SPEs
(as Lessors or "Owner Participants" under the SPE Leases) to cooperate, and

Purchaser, to expeditiously complete the appraisal process under the Purchase
Options required under the SPE Leases and take such other steps as are
reasonably necessary to cause the Facility Purchase Closing to occur.

 



61 (d) If the Buyouts do not occur prior to, and the equity interest in WTE
Holdings is not transferred to the Purchaser on, the Closing Date, from the
Closing Date until the occurrence of the Facility Purchase Closing associated
with each SPE Lease or the Buyouts and the transfer of the equity interests in
WTE Holdings to the Purchaser in accordance with _Section 6.19(g)_:



     | (i) | The Sellers shall: 
---|---|--- 

A. (x) pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to all reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by SPE Lessees after the Closing in connection with
exercising the Purchase Options, including costs incurred in connection with
the appraisal procedure, and (y) upon the Facility Purchase Closing, pay,
or cause to be paid, to the Purchaser the purchase price associated with each
Facility Purchase determined pursuant to the appraisal process set forth in
each SPE Lease associated with each Facility Purchase as and to the extent
necessary to cause the occurrence of the Facility Purchase Closing;

B. timely pay, or cause to be paid, to the Purchaser, amounts equal to: (i)
all rental payments that the SPE Lessees are required to make under each SPE
Lease (including Article 3 thereof), (ii) all payments required to be made by
any SPE Lessee or the Purchaser pursuant to the Tax Indemnification
Agreements, (iii) any rental payments required to be made by any SPE Lessee
or the Purchaser following an "Event of Loss" (as defined in the SPE Leases)
pursuant to Article 11 of any SPE Lease, (iv) all payments (including costs of
repair, reconstruction or replacement of the Bridgeport Facility) required to
be made by the SPE Lessee of the Bridgeport Facility pursuant to Sections 11.1
and 11.2 of the Bridgeport Lease, and (v) all other payments that any SPE
Lessee or the Purchaser is required to make pursuant to any of the SPE Leases
or any other documents set forth on _Schedule 6.19(a)(iv)_ (collectively, the
" _SPE Lease Documents_ "); _provided_ that (x) in the case of
subsections (iii) and (iv), only to the extent the costs incurred exceed any
insurance proceeds received by the SPE Lessee, the Purchaser or their
Affiliates in respect thereof and unless the SPEs have waived the requirements
to comply with Article 11 of any SPE Lease or any portion thereof, and (y) in
the case of subsections (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v), except to the extent such
payments are required to be made as a result of any SPE Lessees failure after
the Closing Date to operate and maintain the SPE Facilities in accordance
with prudent industry practices or as a result of any breach of any Purchaser
SPE Obligations by the applicable SPE Lessee; and

 

C. except as otherwise permitted under this _Section 6.19_, cause WTE
Holdings not to take any material action under the SPE limited liability
company agreements without Purchasers consent and to use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Minority Owners to approve all requests made by the SPE
Lessees under the SPE Leases that require the consent of the Minority Owners
under the SPE limited liability company agreements.

(ii) The Sellers agree not to terminate, and to use reasonable best efforts
to prevent the SPEs and the lessors under the SPE Leases from terminating, the
SPE Leases prior to the Facility Purchase Closing, other than as a result of
material breaches of the Purchaser SPE Obligations.

 



62 (iii) The Purchaser shall:

 

A. cause SPE Lessees not to terminate the SPE Leases and to comply in all
material respects with respect to the Purchaser SPE Obligations;

B. maintain or cause to be maintained, at its cost and expense, at a minimum,
such insurance in such coverage amounts and on substantially similar terms
and conditions as are required under and with respect to each SPE Lease as of
the Closing, but in no event on terms less favorable than the insurance
maintained by the SPE Lessees immediately prior to the Closing (the " _SPE
Policies_ ");

C. promptly forward any payments, or portion thereof, made to the
Purchaser under _Section 6.19(d)_, to the appropriate recipient pursuant to
the terms of the SPE Lease Documents, to the extent any such payments would,
but for this Agreement, have been made to a Person other than the Sellers, SPE
Lessees or WTE Holdings.

(e) All payments made to the Purchaser by the Sellers under _Section 6.19(d)_
shall be treated as adjustments to the Closing Purchase Price paid by the
Purchaser to the Sellers under this Agreement, and the parties shall, and
shall cause their Affiliates to, file all Tax Returns consistently with such
position, unless otherwise required by a Governmental Authority pursuant to a
determination or other proceeding. The Purchaser and the Sellers shall use
reasonable best efforts to defend such position in any Tax audit or other
proceeding, and shall allow the other party to fully participate (as such term
is defined in _Section 4.5(b)_ hereof) in any such defense.

(f) Unless and until the parties thereto mutually agree to a replacement
guaranty or other credit support, WM Parent covenants and agrees that it shall
cause the SPE Guaranty to remain in full force and effect until the earlier to
occur of the Buyouts or the Facility Purchase Closings.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, WTE Holdings
and its Affiliates are not prohibited from continuing to pursue the buyout of
the Minority Owners equity interests in the SPEs at or prior to the Facility
Purchase Closing (the " _Buyouts_ "). If the Buyouts are consummated prior to
the Closing Date and if WTE Holdings then owns (directly or, in the case of
WTE-II, through WTE-Is ownership of WTE-II) 100% of the issued and
outstanding capital stock, membership interests or other outstanding equity
interests of the SPEs, the remainder of this _Section 6.19_ (other than 
_Section 6.19(a)_) shall be void and of no force or effect and the Sellers
shall cause to be transferred, subject to regulatory approvals, if any, the
capital stock of WTE Holdings (which shall then own (directly or, in the case
of WTE-II, through WTE-Is ownership of WTE-II) 100% of the issued and
outstanding capital stock, membership interests or other outstanding equity
interests of the SPEs) to the Company prior to

 



63  or contemporaneous with the Closing. The parties acknowledge and agree that
the Purchase Price paid by the Purchaser at Closing includes the value of the
SPE Facilities. Therefore, if the Buyouts are consummated after the Closing
Date but prior to the Facility Purchase Closing, as soon as reasonably
practicable thereafter, but in any event within 10 days after consummation of
the Buyouts, the Sellers shall (i) cause to be transferred, for no additional
consideration, subject to regulatory approvals, if any, the capital stock of
WTE Holdings (which shall then own (directly or, in the case of WTE-II,
through WTE-Is ownership of WTE-II) 100% of the issued and
outstanding capital stock, membership interests or other outstanding equity
interests of the SPEs) to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, pursuant to
an assignment and transfer of the stock certificate of WTE Holdings and (ii)
provide to the Purchaser a certificate executed on behalf of the Sellers by
an officer of each Seller stating that the representations and warranties set
forth in _Section 6.19(a)_ are true and correct in all material respects as
of such date.

 

Section 6.20 Spin-Off of Excluded Entities. The Sellers shall, effective prior
to the Closing, cause the distribution or assignment of the equity interests
of the Excluded Entities such that after such transaction, no Transferred
Company owns, directly or indirectly, any equity interests of any Excluded
Entity (the " _Spin-Off_ ").

 

Section 6.21 Certain Joint Ventures.

 

(a) The Sellers shall have the right to pursue and receive the Norfolk
Termination Payment or any monetary recovery, judgment, award or settlement
related thereto. The Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Transferred
Companies to, promptly pay to the Sellers the Norfolk Termination Payment (to
the extent received by the Purchaser or the Transferred Companies) or
any monetary recovery, judgment, award or settlement related thereto received
by the Purchaser or any of the Transferred Companies. Purchaser shall not, and
shall cause the Transferred Companies not to, take any action that would
reasonably be expected to interfere with or be materially disruptive or
detrimental to the Sellers pursuit of the Norfolk Termination Payment or any
monetary recovery, judgment, award or settlement related thereto.

 

(b) From and after Closing, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall reasonably
cooperate (and the Purchaser shall cause the Transferred Companies and their
employees, agents and Affiliates to reasonably cooperate) to enter into a
consulting, operation and maintenance agreement with respect to the existing
transfer stations of Swire HK Joint Venture located in Hong Kong and to
restructure the Swire HK Joint Venture in a manner reasonably acceptable to
the Sellers and the Purchaser that, among other things, would transfer to the
Transferred Companies the right to pursue waste-to-energy projects in China
with Swire Pacific Ltd.

Section 6.22 Employee Non-Solicitation/Non-Hire. For a period of two (2) years
following the Closing Date, none of the Sellers, the Purchaser or their
respective Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly, solicit for hire or
employment, or employ or engage the services of, any employee of the other
party or its Affiliates involved in the procurement or sourcing of waste for
the other party or its Affiliates pursuant to the Waste Supply Agreements (the
" _Covered Persons_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not
preclude (i) the solicitation (or 

 



64  employment as a result of the solicitation) of Covered Persons whose
employment with a party or its Affiliates, as applicable, has been terminated
or (ii) the solicitation (or employment as a result of the solicitation) of
Covered Persons through public advertisements or general solicitations that
are not specifically targeted at such Covered Persons.

 

Section 6.23 Tax-Exempt Financed Assets.

 

(a) WM Parent is and, upon Closing, will remain financially obligated on the
Tax-Exempt WM Parent Debt that financed certain facilities of the Company
(the " _Applicable Facilities_ "). The Purchaser acknowledges that (i) prior
to Closing, neither the Sellers nor WM Parent intend to defease or redeem the
Tax-Exempt WM Parent Debt and (ii) upon Closing, use and ownership of the
Applicable Facilities will reside with the Purchaser. The Sellers hereby
represent, and the Purchaser acknowledges that, upon Closing: (xi) interest
paid or accrued on the Tax-Exempt WM Parent Debt is excludable from the gross
income of the holders thereof for purposes of federal income taxation; (xii)
pursuant to the Code, the basis of such federal income tax exclusion for
interest payable to such holders is the use of the Applicable Facilities for
certain qualified purposes, including "solid waste disposal facilities" (as
such term is used in Section 142(a)(6) of the Code) as and to the extent the
Applicable Facilities are so-currently used by the Company (or its applicable
Subsidiary); (xiii) the use of all or part of the Applicable Facilities for a
purpose other than a qualifying purpose or purposes may cause (A) the interest
payable on all or part of the Tax-Exempt WM Parent Debt to not be excludable
from the federal gross income of the holders thereof possibly with retroactive
effect, and/or (B) the deductibility of the interest payable by WM Parent on
all or part of the Tax-Exempt WM Parent Debt to be disallowed by Section
150(b) of the Code; and (xiv) the Purchaser, the Company and the Transferred
Companies shall not have any obligation with respect to the Tax-Exempt WM
Parent Debt, except for the obligations set forth in  _Section 6.23(b)_.

(b) On and after Closing and until December 1, 2017, Purchaser agrees to
provide at least ninety (90) days prior written notice to each of WM Parent
and the Sellers of a change in the use of the Applicable Facilities for a
purpose other than so-currently used (as currently operating in the Ordinary
Course of Business). 

(c) For avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Purchaser, the Company or
the Transferred Companies be liable for any of the tax liabilities or
obligations of WM Parent or its affiliates under the Tax-Exempt WM Parent
Debt.

Section 6.24 Certain Broward Matters. The parties shall take the actions
described on _Schedule 6.24_.

Section 8.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated by either

agents or representatives; _provided_ , _however_ , that _Section 5.3_
(Public Statements), _Section 8.2_ (Effect of Termination), _Section 8.3_
(Termination Fees), _Section 10.2_ (Notices), _Section 10.5_ (Governing
Law; Venue), _Section 10.9_ (Remedies, Specific Performance), _Section
10.10_ (Validity) and _Section 10.12_ (Confidentiality) and the Limited
Guarantee (to the extent set forth therein), shall survive the termination of
this Agreement and remain in full force and effect; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that, subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of this _Section 8.2_
and _Section 8.3_, no such termination shall relieve any party from
liability for any Willful Breach of this Agreement by that party prior to the
termination hereof. If this Agreement is terminated by either the Purchaser or
the Sellers pursuant to the provisions of  _Section 8.1_, in no event shall
the liability of any party for damages incurred by the other party or its
Affiliates for any breach of this Agreement (whether under this Agreement or
arising under Law) or any certificate or document delivered pursuant hereto

Breach_ " means a material breach of any material representation, warranty or
covenant or other agreement set forth in this Agreement that is a consequence
of an intentional act or failure to act by the other party with the actual
knowledge that the taking of such act or failure to take such act would cause
a breach of this Agreement.

 

Section 8.3 Termination Fees.

 

(a) In the event that

 

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Sellers in accordance with the terms
hereof as contemplated pursuant to (x) _Section 8.1(a)(iv) _or (y)
_Sections 8.1(a)(i)_ and _(iii)_ , then within two (2) Business Days of such
termination, the Purchaser shall pay to the Sellers the Purchaser Termination
Fee as liquidated damages and not as a penalty by wire transfer to an account
specified in writing by the Sellers; or

 



70 (ii) (A) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and  _Section
7.2_ have been satisfied or waived by the party or parties entitled to waive
such conditions (other than (x) those conditions in _Sections 7.1(e)_ and
_7.2(f)_ and (y) those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, each of which conditions in this clause (y) shall be capable of
being satisfied if the Closing Date were the date that notice of termination
is delivered), (B) the Purchaser shall have failed to consummate the Closing
on or before the Termination Date, and (C) this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with the terms hereof by either the Sellers pursuant to _Section
8.1(a)(ii)_ or the Purchaser pursuant to  _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_, in each case
due to the failure to satisfy the conditions in _Sections 7.1(e)_ and _7.2(f)_
, then within two (2) Business Days of such termination, the Purchaser shall
pay to the Sellers an amount equal to the Special Purchaser Termination Fee
as liquidated damages and not as a penalty by wire transfer to an account
specified in writing by the Sellers;

 

it being understood that in no event shall the Purchaser be required to pay a
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

(b) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that without these agreements, the other parties would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Purchaser fails to timely pay
any amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_, and, in order to obtain the
payment, the Sellers commence an action which results in a judgment against
the Purchaser for the payment of a Termination Fee, the Purchaser shall also
be liable to the Sellers for their reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on such Termination Fee at the rate of eight percent
(8.0%) through the date such payment was actually received.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the
Purchaser pays a Termination Fee pursuant to this  _Section 8.3_, except for
claims by the Sellers that the Purchaser Termination Fee should be paid
instead of the Special Purchaser Termination Fee, the Sellers agree that their
receipt of such Termination Fee as set forth in  _Section 8.3(a)_ shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Sellers and their Affiliates (whether at
law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the Purchaser, the
ECP Guarantor, the Lenders and any of their respective former, current or
future directors, officers, employees, agents, general or limited partners,
managers, members, stockholders, Affiliates or assignees or any former,
current or future director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited
partner, manager, member, stockholder, Affiliate or assignee of any of the
foregoing (collectively, the " _Purchaser Related Parties_ ") for any loss or
damage suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the failure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated; and upon payment of such
fee, the Purchaser Related Parties shall have no further liability or
obligation relating to or arising 

 



71  out of this Agreement, any certificate, instrument or agreement delivered in
connection with this Agreement (including the Commitment Letters and the
Limited Guarantee) or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(except, for the avoidance of doubt, for the ECP Guarantors obligations under
the Limited Guarantee, subject to the limitations contained therein) or
thereby or any other document or written or oral representation made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, through the Purchaser
or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate (or
limited liability company or limited partnership) veil, by or through a claim
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) by or on behalf
of the Purchaser against the ECP Guarantor or any other Purchaser Related
Party, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable
proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or other applicable Law, or
otherwise.

Section 8.4 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of all of the parties hereto.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, _Section 8.3(c)_, _Section
8.4_, _Section 9.7_, _Section 10.5_ and  _Section 10.6_ (and any provision
of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, modification or supplementation
of such provision would modify the substance of such Sections) may not be
amended, modified or supplemented in a manner that adversely affects the
rights of the Lenders without the prior written consent of the Lenders.

Section 8.5 Extensions; Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing Date, the
parties hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant thereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by all of the parties to this Agreement.

72  for which a Purchaser Indemnified Party bears responsibility directly or
indirectly, resulting from, caused by, arising out of, or in any way relating
or with respect to any of the following: 

(a) any breach or misrepresentation in any of the representations and

occurred), all representations and warranties of the Sellers in this Agreement
shall be construed as if the terms "material" and "in all material respects"
(and variations thereof) and any reference to "Material Adverse Effect" (and
all variations thereof) used therein were omitted from such representations
and warranties (including the use of such terms in definitions of the defined
terms used therein), other than in (i) references to "Material Agreements,"
and (ii) references to "material" in _Section 3.13_ (Contracts, Agreements,
Plans and Commitments).

 

Section 9.2 Purchaser Indemnity Obligations. The Purchaser, and if the Closing
occurs, the Company, on a joint and several basis with the Purchaser, shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers and the Sellers Affiliates and each
of their respective officers, directors, stockholders, members, managers,
employees, agents and representatives (each a " _Seller Indemnified Party_ ")
from and against, and shall reimburse the Seller Indemnified Parties for, any
and all Indemnified Amounts paid, imposed on or incurred by a Seller
Indemnified Party or for which a Seller Indemnified Party
bears responsibility directly or indirectly, resulting from, caused by,

allegation by any third party of, the following:

 

(a) any breach or misrepresentation in any of the representations and

Effect" (and all variations thereof) used therein were omitted from such
representations and warranties (including the use of such terms in definitions
of the defined terms used therein). 

Section 9.3 Indemnification Procedures. All claims for indemnification under
this Agreement shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) Subject to the additional obligations set forth in _Section 9.3(b)_ below
and the limitations set forth in _Section 10.1_, a party claiming
indemnification under this Agreement (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall
promptly (i) notify the party from whom indemnification is sought (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") of any third-party claim or claims asserted against
the Indemnified Party (" _Third Party Claim_ ") for which indemnification is
sought and (ii) transmit to the Indemnifying Party a copy of all papers served
with respect to such claim (if any) and a written notice (" _Claim Notice_ ")
containing a description in reasonable detail of the nature of the Third Party
Claim, an estimate of the amount of damages attributable to the Third Party
Claim to the extent feasible (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the
final amount of such claim) and the basis of the Indemnified Partys request
for indemnification under this Agreement. The failure by an Indemnified Party
to promptly notify an Indemnifying Party of an indemnity claim shall not
relieve an Indemnifying Party of its indemnity obligations under this
Agreement except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such
delay.

 



74 Within fifteen (15) days after receipt of any Claim Notice (the "
_Election Period_ "), the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified
Party (i) whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its potential liability to
the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim and (ii) whether
the Indemnifying Party desires, at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party
Claim.

 

If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the Election
Period that the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of the Third
Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend, at
its sole cost and expense and with counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party, such Third Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings,
which proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently by the Indemnifying Party to
a final conclusion or settled at the reasonable discretion of the Indemnifying
Party in accordance with this _Section 9.3_. The Indemnifying Party shall
have full control of such defense and proceedings. The Indemnified Party is
hereby authorized, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to
file, during the Election Period, any motion, answer or other pleadings that
the Indemnified Party shall reasonably deem necessary or appropriate to
protect its interests. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party agrees to reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its
counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party
elects to contest, including without limitation the making of any related
counterclaim against the person asserting the Third Party Claim or any cross-
complaint against any Person. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement of any Third Party claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this _Section 9.3_ and shall bear its own costs and expenses with
respect to such participation.

 

If the Indemnifying Party fails to notify the Indemnified Party within the
Election Period that the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified
Party pursuant to the preceding paragraph, or if the Indemnifying Party elects
to defend the Indemnified Party but fails to prosecute or settle the Third
Party Claim as herein provided, or if the Indemnified Party reasonably objects
to such election on the grounds that counsel for such Indemnifying Party
cannot represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Parties
because such representation would be reasonably likely to result in a conflict
of interest, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Third Party Claim by
all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be prosecuted by the
Indemnified Party to a final conclusion or settled. If requested by the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party agrees to reasonably cooperate with
the Indemnified Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim. The
Indemnified Party shall have full control of such defense and proceedings.
The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section
9.3_, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and expenses
with respect to such participation.

The Indemnifying Party shall not settle or compromise any Third Party Claim
unless (i) the terms of such compromise or settlement require no more than
the payment of money (i.e., such compromise or settlement does not require the
Indemnified Party to

 



75  admit any wrongdoing or take or refrain from taking any action), (ii) the
full amount of such monetary compromise or settlement will be paid by the
Indemnifying Party and (iii) the Indemnified Party receives as part of such
settlement a legal, binding and enforceable unconditional satisfaction and/or
release, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to it, providing that
such Third Party Claim and any claimed liability of the Indemnified Party
with respect thereto is being fully satisfied by reason of such compromise or
settlement and that the Indemnified Party is being released from any and all
obligations or liabilities it may have with respect thereto. The Indemnified
Party shall not settle or admit liability to any Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party unless (x) the Indemnifying
Party has disputed its potential liability to the Indemnified Party, and
such dispute either has not been resolved or has been resolved in favor of
the Indemnifying Party or (y) the Indemnifying Party has failed to respond to
the Indemnified Partys Claim Notice. Notwithstanding anything in the
foregoing and for the purpose of clarity, the Sellers shall the full right to
control and direct any litigation regarding the Excluded Entities.

 

(b) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall transmit to the Indemnifying Party a written notice
describing in reasonable detail the nature of the claim, an estimate of the
amount of damages attributable to such claim to the extent feasible
(which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such claim)
and the basis of the Indemnified Partys request for indemnification under
this Agreement.

 

Section 9.4 Determination of Indemnified Amounts. The Indemnified Amounts
payable by an Indemnifying Party hereunder shall be determined (i) by the
written agreement of the parties, (ii) by a judgment or decree of any court of
competent jurisdiction, or (iii) by any other means agreed to in writing by
the parties. The amount of any Indemnified Amounts for which indemnification
is provided under this _Article IX_ shall be net (x) of any amounts actually
recovered by the Indemnified Party from third parties under insurance policies
with respect to such Indemnified Amounts and (y) net of any Tax Benefit
derived by an Indemnified Party (or any Affiliate thereof) with respect to
such Damages or any of the circumstances giving rise thereto. All parties
shall use commercially reasonably efforts to mitigate the amount of
Indemnified Amounts for which they may be entitled to indemnification
hereunder, including, without limitation, in the case of the Purchaser, by
using reasonable best efforts to recover against the Transferred Companies
insurance policies. If an indemnification payment is received by a Purchaser
Indemnified Party, and any Purchaser Indemnified Party or Transferred Company
later receives insurance proceeds from third parties in respect of the related
Indemnified Amounts, the Purchaser shall immediately pay to the Sellers a sum
equal to the lesser of (a) the amount of such insurance proceeds received (net
of any costs and expenses and/or increased premiums paid or incurred by the
Purchaser or the Transferred Companies to recover such proceeds) or (b) the
actual amount of the indemnification payment previously paid by the Sellers
with respect to such Indemnified Amounts.

 



76 Section 9.5 Limitation of the Sellers Liability.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Article IX_ ,
the aggregate liability of the Sellers for any event or occurrence giving
rise to the Sellers being required to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties pursuant to _Section 9.1(a) _and _Section 9.1(b)_ of this Agreement
shall be limited to $125,000,000 (the " _General Cap_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the General Cap shall not apply to any claims relating to a
breach of any Fundamental Representation.

 

(b) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to be indemnified
pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_ and  _Section 9.1(b) _unless and until: (i)
the amount of any Indemnified Amount (or a series of related or similar
Indemnified Amounts) exceeds $250,000 (a " _Non-De Minimis Claim_ ") and (ii)
the aggregate amount of all Non-De Minimis Claims exceeds one percent (1.0%)
of the Initial Purchase Price (the " _Deductible Amount_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing limitations shall not apply to (x) any claims
relating to a breach of any Fundamental Representation or (y) in the case of
_Section 9.1(b)_, any Willful Breach of a covenant, agreement or undertaking
(other than _Section 6.1_), and any amounts recovered with respect to such
matters shall not count in determining whether any of the limitations in this
_Section 9.5(b)_ have been met or exceeded. After the Deductible Amount is
exceeded, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to seek
indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_ and _Section 9.1(b)_ for the
entire amount (including the first $250,000) of all Non-De Minimis claims in
excess of (but not including) the Deductible Amount, subject to the General
Cap as set forth in  _Section 9.5(a)_.

(c) Without limiting the limitations on indemnity set forth in _Sections
9.5(a)_ and  _(b)_ above, in no event shall the Sellers aggregate
indemnification obligations under this Agreement exceed 100% of the Initial
Purchase Price.

 

Section 9.6 Limitation of the Purchasers Liability. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this _Article IX_ , the aggregate liability of
the Purchaser for any event or occurrence giving rise to the Purchaser being
required to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be limited to the
Initial Purchase Price, except for indemnification obligations under _Section
9.2(b)_, _Section 9.2(c)_, _Section 9.2(d)_ and _Section 9.2(e)_.

 

Section 9.7 Exclusive Remedy.

 

(a) Except for claims for Fraud, specific performance and injunctive relief,
the payment of a Termination Fee pursuant to  _Section 8.3_ and the
indemnification provided in this _Article IX_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedies for any breach of this Agreement (whether under this Agreement or
arising under Law) or any certificate or document delivered pursuant hereto.
Any liability for indemnification hereunder shall be determined without
duplication of recovery for liabilities by reason of the same state of facts
giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than
one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or by reason of a party
to this Agreement receiving an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to
_Article I_ in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of
indemnification. In no event shall the Sellers have any liability to the

 



77  Purchaser with respect to any losses based upon, arising out of or otherwise
in respect of, any fact, matter, event or circumstance which was specifically
disclosed in any Phase I investigation (or update thereof) of the Real
Property conducted by or on the behalf of the Purchaser prior to the date
hereof. Except for the foregoing, an Indemnifying Partys liability for any
breach of the representations and warranties set forth herein shall not be
impacted or limited by any knowledge that the Indemnified Party had of any
event, action or circumstance giving rise to such breach prior to the Closing.

 

(b) The parties to this Agreement have voluntarily agreed to define their
rights, liabilities and obligations respecting the subject matter of this
Agreement exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and provisions
of this Agreement; and the parties to this Agreement expressly disclaim that
they are owed any duties or are entitled to any remedies not expressly set
forth in this Agreement except in the case of Fraud. The parties to this
Agreement acknowledge and agree that all representations and warranties set
forth in this Agreement and closing certificates related thereto are
contractual in nature only and subject to the sole and exclusive remedies set
forth herein, except in the case of Fraud. The parties to this Agreement have
agreed that should any representations and warranties of any party to this
Agreement prove untrue, the other party to this Agreement shall have the
specific rights and remedies herein specified as the exclusive remedy
therefor, but that, except in the case of Fraud, no other rights, remedies or
causes of action (whether in law or in equity or whether in contract or in
tort) are permitted to any party to this Agreement hereto as a result of the
untruth of any such representation and warranty. Furthermore, the parties to
this Agreement each hereby acknowledge that this Agreement embodies the
justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties derived from arms length
negotiations; all parties to this Agreement specifically acknowledge that
neither party to this Agreement has any special relationship with the other
party to this Agreement that would justify any expectation beyond that of an
ordinary buyer and an ordinary seller in an arms length transaction. Except
for Fraud or as otherwise explicitly set forth herein, including provisions
providing for specific performance in  _Section 10.9_, the sole and
exclusive remedies for any breach or failure to perform this Agreement shall
be those remedies set forth herein (including _Article VIII_ and this _Article
IX_ ); and the parties to this Agreement hereby waive and release any and all
tort claims and causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or
relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement (including any tort claim or cause of action based upon, arising
out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection
with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter this Agreement).

 

ARTICLE X

GENERAL PROVISIONS

Section 10.1 Survival. The representations and warranties set forth in
_Article II_ and _Article III_ of this Agreement and in any closing
certificate delivered in connection with the Closing shall survive the Closing
for a period of twelve (12) months, except that (i) the representations
contained in _Sections 3.1(a)_ ,  _(b)_ and _(c)_ (Organization and
Qualification), _Sections 3.2(a)_ , _(d)_ , _(f)_ and _(g)_ (Capitalization;
Options; Shareholder Rights) and _Section 3.3(a)_ (Authority; Non-
Contravention; Approvals) (collectively, the " _Fundamental Representations_
")

 



78  and indemnification obligations under _Section 9.1(a)_ (with respect to
breaches of the Fundamental Representations) shall survive the Closing for
five (5) years; (ii) the representations and warranties set forth in _Section
3.8_ (Taxes) and the indemnity obligations set forth in _Sections 9.1(c)_ and
_9.1(d)_ shall survive until thirty (30) days after the expiration of the
statutory survival period (including any extensions thereof) of the
underlying claim; (iii) the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 3.11_ (Environmental Matters) shall survive the Closing for three
(3) years and (iv) the representations and warranties set forth in _Section
6.19(a)_ (SPE Buyouts) shall survive the Closing until twelve (12) months
following the earlier of (x) closing of the Buyouts and the transfer of the
capital stock of WTE Holdings to the Purchaser or (y) closing of the Facility
Purchases. The covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement and in any
closing certificate delivered in connection herewith shall be continuing and
survive the Closing without limitation (unless provided otherwise therein);
_provided, however_ , that the indemnification obligations of the parties
hereto set forth in _Section 9.1(a)_ and _Section 9.2(a)_ with respect to a
breach of a representation or warranty in _Section 6.19(a)_, _Article II_
and _Article III_ hereof shall terminate at the time such particular
representation or warranty shall no longer survive. The indemnification
obligations of the Sellers set forth in  _Section 9.1(b)_, _Section 9.1(e)_
and _Section 9.1(f)_ and the indemnification obligations of the Purchaser and
the Company in _Section 9.2(b)_, _Section 9.2(c)_, _Section 9.2(d)_ and 
_Section 9.2(e)_, shall survive the Closing without time limitation (unless
provided otherwise therein). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentences of this
_Section 10.1_, if the Purchaser or the Sellers, as applicable,
deliver written notice to the other party of a bona fide claim for
indemnification within the applicable time periods set forth above, such claim
shall survive until finally resolved or judicially determined.

Section 10.3 Interpretation. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the interpretation of
this Agreement. In this Agreement, unless a contrary intention appears, (i)
the words "herein," "hereof" and "hereunder" and other words of similar import
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular Article, Section
or other subdivision, (ii) the words "including," "including without
limitation," and "including but not limited to" and other words of similar
import do not imply any limitation on (but may expand) the antecedent
reference, (iii) reference to any Article or Section means such Article or
Section hereof, (iv) the singular shall include the plural, the plural shall
include the singular, and the masculine gender shall include the feminine and
neutral genders and vice versa. (v) the word "or" will have the inclusive
meaning represented by the phrase "and/or;" and "shall" and "will"
mean "must," and shall have equal force and effect and express an obligation,
(vi) the term "day" shall mean a calendar day, commencing at 12:00 a.m. (local
time) and the term "month" shall mean a calendar month;  _provided_ that when
a period measured in months commences on a date other than the first day of a
month, the period shall run from the date on which it starts to the
corresponding date in the next month and, as appropriate, to
succeeding months thereafter, (vii) all references to a particular entity
shall include such entitys permitted successors and permitted assigns unless
otherwise specifically provided herein, (viii) all references herein to any
Law or to any contract shall be to such Law as of the date hereof or contract
as amended, supplemented or modified (in accordance with the terms hereof)
from time to time unless otherwise specifically provided herein and (ix) all
monetary amounts contained in this Agreement refer to currency of the United
States. Whenever an event is to be performed or a payment is to be made by a
particular date and the date in question falls on a day which is not a
Business Day, the event shall be performed, or the payment

 



80  shall be made, on the next succeeding Business Day; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that all calculations shall be made regardless of whether any given day is a
Business Day and whether or not any given period ends on a Business Day. Time
is of the essence in this Agreement. No provision of this Agreement shall be
interpreted or construed against any party hereto solely because such party or
its legal representative drafted such provision. The parties intend that each
representation, warranty, and covenant contained herein shall have independent
significance. If any party has breached any representation, warranty, or
covenant contained herein in any respect, the fact that there exists another
representation, warranty or covenant relating to the same subject matter
(regardless of the relative levels of specificity) which the party has not
breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that the party is in
breach of the first representation, warranty or covenant.

Section 10.4 Miscellaneous. This Agreement (including the
documents, instruments and agreements delivered in connection herewith) (i)
constitute the entire agreement and supersedes all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties and their Affiliates,
or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof, including, without
limitation, that certain No-Shop Agreement dated November 20, 2013, as
amended, between Waste Management, Inc. and Energy Capital Partners II,
LLC; that certain Indicative Proposal Letter dated November 6, 2013 from
Energy Capital Partners to Waste Management, Inc.; and that certain Proposal
Confirmation Letter dated January 15, 2014 from Energy Capital Partners to
Waste Management, Inc. (all of which are hereby terminated by this
reference), and (ii) shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser may assign (x) this Agreement (in
whole but not in part) to one or more Affiliates or (y) their rights under
this Agreement on or after the Closing, to any Lender or any other party
providing debt financing to the Purchaser (or any agent or collateral trustee
for any such Person) as collateral in connection with any such debt
financing; _provided_ that in each case the Purchaser remains liable
hereunder.

Section 10.5 Governing Law; Venue.

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED IN ALL RESPECTS, INCLUDING VALIDITY,
INTERPRETATION AND EFFECT, BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO
CONTRACTS EXECUTED AND TO BE PERFORMED WHOLLY WITHIN SUCH STATE. Each of the
parties hereto agrees that any action or proceeding brought to enforce the
rights or obligations of any party hereto under this Agreement shall be
commenced and maintained in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County
of New York (or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in
the Federal courts, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York sitting in New York County), as well as all
courts from which an appeal may be taken from such courts (each, a " _Court_
"). Each party hereto (i) expressly and irrevocably consents and submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of each Court in connection with any action or
proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or the enforcement of any rights under this
Agreement; (ii) agrees that each Court shall be deemed to be a convenient
forum; and (iii) agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or
otherwise, in any such proceeding commenced in any Court, any claim that such
party is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of such Court, that such
proceeding has been

 



81  brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such proceeding is
improper or that this Agreement or the subject matter of this Agreement may
not be enforced in or by such Court. Each of the Purchaser and ECP Guarantor
hereby appoints the person identified under such partys name in _Section
10.2_ as such partys agent for service of process, and agrees that service of
process in any such proceeding may be made by certified mail, return receipt
requested, addressed to such agent. Each Seller irrevocably appoints the
person identified under such parties name in _Section 10.2_ as its agent for
the sole purpose of receiving service of process or other legal summons in
connection with any Action. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees
that service of process on such party as provided in this _Section 10.5_
shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

 

(b) Each of the parties agrees that it will not bring or support any suit,
action or legal proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Lenders and
their respective Affiliates and representatives in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way
to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum other
than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if
under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts,
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York sitting
in New York County (and appellate courts thereof), and makes the agreements,
waivers and consents set forth in _Section 10.5(a)_ with respect thereto.

Section 10.6 Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE COMMITMENT
LETTERS OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (INCLUDING
THE FINANCING) OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION,
PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR
HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE
PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY
COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED FOR
AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY AND THAT ANY
ACTION OR PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
COMMITMENT LETTERS OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY SHALL
INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING
WITHOUT A JURY.

 

Section 10.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of
which shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 



82 Section 10.8 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and, other than _Section
6.7_, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer
upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) _Section
8.3(c)_ shall be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, the Purchaser Related
Parties, (y) _Section 10.14_ shall be for the benefit of, and enforceable by,
the Nonparty Affiliates of the parties and (z) _Section 8.3(c)_ , _8.4_ ,
_9.7_ , _10.3_ , _10.5(b)_ , _10.6_ , _10.8_ and _10.14_ shall be for the
benefit of, and enforceable by, the Lenders and their respective Affiliates
and representatives.

Section 10.9 Remedies; Specific Performance.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The
parties acknowledge and agree that, prior to the valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ , the non-breaching party shall be
entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which it is entitled as
contemplated in _Section 9.7_, to an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement by any other
party and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof except that
any such claims against the Purchaser shall be limited as provided in _Section
10.9(b)_. Each of the parties hereto (i) agrees that it shall not oppose the
granting of any such relief; (ii) hereby irrevocably waives any requirement
for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with any such relief (it
is understood that clause (i) of this sentence is not intended to, and shall
not, preclude any party hereto from litigating on the merits the substantive
claim to which such remedy relates); and (iii) agrees that the prevailing
party shall be entitled to reimbursement of all reasonable costs and expenses
including without limitation, all reasonable attorneys fees.

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 10.9(a)_, it is acknowledged and agreed that
the Sellers shall be entitled to seek specific performance (x) to enforce
Purchasers obligation to send a drawdown notice under the Debt Commitment
Letter, and (y) solely in its capacity as third party beneficiary of the
Equity Commitment Letter to seek specific performance of the Purchasers
obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to cause the Purchaser to consummate the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement, in each case, only in the event
that each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (i) all of the
conditions in _Section 7.2_ shall have been satisfied or waived by the
Purchaser (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, each of which conditions shall be capable of being
satisfied if the Closing Date were the date such specific performance is
sought or the failure of which to be satisfied, is caused by breach by
Purchaser of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement) and shall remain satisfied as of the time when
Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 1.4_, (ii) in the
case of clause (y), the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at
the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded, (iii) the Purchaser fails
to complete the Closing in accordance with _Section 1.4_, and (iv) the
Sellers have confirmed by irrevocable written notice to the Purchaser that if
specific performance is granted and the Debt Financing and Equity Financing is
funded, then the Closing will occur, and that the Sellers are willing to
waive any unsatisfied conditions in _Section 7.1_ (but solely for purposes of
consummating the transactions contemplated by

  



83  this Agreement). For the avoidance of doubt, while the Sellers may pursue
both a grant of specific performance of the Purchasers obligations as, and
only to the extent, expressly permitted by this _Section 10.9(b)_, and the
payment of a Termination Fee as provided by _Section 8.3_, under no
circumstances shall the Sellers be permitted or entitled to receive both such
grant of specific performance (and the subsequent successful effecting of the
Closing) and payment of a Termination Fee.

Section 10.10 Validity. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision
of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.

 

Section 10.11 Time is of the Essence. Time is of the essence with respect to
the time periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement.

Section 10.12 Confidentiality. Subject to _Section 5.3_, each of the parties
hereto agrees that neither it, its Affiliates nor its nor its Affiliates
officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors, counsel or representatives
shall reveal to any other Person other than its auditors and lenders (a) the
terms of this Agreement or any of the terms of the documents executed or to
be executed pursuant hereto and (b) any financial, commercial, technical or
other confidential information relating to the Purchaser, the Sellers, the
Transferred Companies or the Business; _provided_ ,  _however_ , the
Purchasers obligations under this clause (b) shall terminate at the Closing
except with respect to confidential information related to the Sellers or the
WM Companies for a period of three (3) years after the Closing Date. The
obligations set forth in the immediately preceding sentence shall not apply to
the disclosure of any information (i) as may be hereafter mutually agreed to
in writing, (ii) as ordered by a judicial tribunal, (iii) with respect to
clause (a) above, to any of such parties directors, officers, employees or
attorneys and directors, officers and employees of affiliated companies and
representatives thereof or their advisors who need to know such information
for the purpose of consummating the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the documents executed or to be executed pursuant hereto, (iv)
with respect to clause (b) above, to any of such parties
directors, officers, employees or attorneys who need to know such information
for the purpose of consummating the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the documents executed or to be executed pursuant hereto, (v) to
the extent required to be disclosed by applicable Legal Requirements or legal
process; _provided_ that the disclosing party notifies the non-disclosing
party promptly (unless prohibited by Law) and provides the non-disclosing
party with a reasonable opportunity to seek an appropriate protective order
or other appropriate remedy (unless prohibited by Law) for non-disclosure of
such confidential information, (vi) that is available in the public domain
through no breach by a party hereto of its obligations hereunder or (vii) in
connection with (A) any action or proceeding by a party to enforce its rights
under this Agreement or any of the documents to be executed pursuant hereto or
(B) the defense of any action or proceeding against a party, any of its
Affiliates or any representatives of any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Purchaser and its Affiliates may, without the prior consent of
the Sellers, issue any non-public release or statement or otherwise disclose
information with respect to this Agreement, other transaction documents or the
transactions (including the Purchase Price and other terms of the Agreement or
other transaction documents) to any of its or their respective
Affiliates, Purchaser Representatives, Lenders and current and potential
investors, in each case, which are subject to contractual confidentiality
obligations with respect to the information disclosed to them (whether
pursuant to such release or statement or otherwise). Each of the parties
hereto will use at least the same standard of care in protecting such
confidential information as it uses in protecting its own confidential
information.

 



84 Section 10.13 Severability. If any condition, term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any Law or
public policy, all other conditions, terms or provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties intend that the provisions of
_Article VIII_ and _Article IX_ , including the remedies (and limitations
thereon) and the limitations on representations, warranties and covenants,
be construed as integral provisions of this Agreement and that such
provisions, remedies and limitations shall not be severable in any manner that
diminishes a partys rights hereunder or increases a partys liability or
obligations hereunder.

Section 10.14 Non-Recourse. Except to the extent otherwise set forth in the
Limited Guarantee, the WM Guarantee and the Equity Commitment Letter, all
claims, obligations, liabilities, or causes of action (whether in contract or
in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute) that may be based upon,
in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate
in any manner to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, or performance
of this Agreement (including any representation or warranty made in, in
connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement), may be made only
against (and such representations and warranties are those solely of) the
Persons that are expressly identified as parties in the preamble to this
Agreement (the " _Contracting Parties_ "). No Person who is not a Contracting
Party, including any current, former or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney, representative or assignee of, and any financial advisor or lender
(including the Lenders) to, any Contracting Party, or any current, former or
future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, representative or assignee of, and
any financial advisor or lender to, any of the foregoing (collectively, the "
_Nonparty Affiliates_ "), shall have any liability (whether in contract or in
tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute) for any claims, causes of
action, obligations, or liabilities arising under, out of, in connection
with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of,
or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance, or
breach (other than as set forth in the Limited Guarantee, the WM Guarantee
and the Equity Commitment Letter), and, to the maximum extent permitted by
Law, each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases all such liabilities,
claims, causes of action, and obligations against any such Nonparty
Affiliates. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted
by Law, except to the extent otherwise set forth in the Limited Guarantee, the
WM Guarantee and the Equity Commitment Letter, (a) each Contracting Party
hereby waives and releases any and all rights, claims, demands, or causes of
action that may otherwise be available at law or in equity, or granted by
statute, to avoid or disregard the entity form of a Contracting Party or
otherwise impose liability of a Contracting Party on any Nonparty Affiliate,
whether granted by statute or based on theories of equity, agency, control,

 



85  instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single business enterprise,
piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization, or otherwise; and (b) each
Contracting Party disclaims any reliance upon any Nonparty Affiliates with
respect to the performance of this Agreement or any representation or warranty
made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to this Agreement.

 

Section 10.15 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each
of the parties shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and each other agreement, document
and instrument contemplated by this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
all Company Transaction Expenses shall be paid by the Sellers.
