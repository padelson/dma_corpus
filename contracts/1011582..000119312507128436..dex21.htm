iii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), made and entered into
June 3, 2007 by and among QIAGEN N.V., a public limited liability company (
_Naamloze Vennootschap_ ) organized in the Kingdom of The Netherlands ("

and wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _NAH_ "), QIAGEN MERGER SUB, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned Subsidiary of NAH ("
_Merger Sub_ ") and DIGENE CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ "). Parent, NAH, Merger Sub and the Company are sometimes referred
to herein each individually as a " _Party_ " and, collectively, as the "
_Parties_." Certain capitalized terms used herein shall have the respective
meanings ascribed thereto in Section 9.13.

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the Supervisory Board and Managing Board of Parent, the sole member
of Merger Sub and the Boards of Directors of NAH and the Company have
each declared it to be advisable and in the best interests of their
respective entities and their respective equity holders that Parent acquire
the Company in order to advance each of their long-term business interests;
and

WHEREAS, the Supervisory Board and Managing Board of Parent, the sole member
of Merger Sub and the Boards of Directors of NAH and the Company have
each approved this Agreement and the merger of the Company with and into

Liability Company Act (" _DLLCA_ ") and the terms and conditions set forth
herein; and

WHEREAS, in furtherance of such transaction, it is proposed that Parent, NAH
or Merger Sub shall make an offer in the United States (as such offer may be
amended from time to time, the " _Offer_ " and together with the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the " _Transactions_
") to acquire each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock in
exchange for, at the election of the holder thereof, cash or Parent Common
Shares or a combination of cash and Parent Common Shares, all in accordance
with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that (a) the
exchange of Company Common Stock for cash and Parent Common Shares pursuant to
the Offer and the Merger shall be treated as an integrated transaction and
shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (" _Code_ ") and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, (b) the exchange of Company Common Stock
for Parent Common Shares shall result in no gain recognition to the Companys
stockholders pursuant to Section 367 of the Code and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, (c) this Agreement constitute a plan of
reorganization, and (d) Parent, NAH and the Company will each be a party to
such reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows.

 

1\. THE OFFER

1.1 _The Offer_.

(a) Provided that (i) this Agreement shall not have been terminated in
accordance with Section 8, (ii) none of the events set forth in clauses
(i)(v) of Annex I hereto shall have occurred and be continuing (and shall not
have been waived by Parent) and (iii) the Company shall have complied with its
applicable obligations under Section 1.2, unless otherwise agreed by Parent
and the Company, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the public
announcement of the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall or shall cause
Merger Sub or NAH to commence (as defined in Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase each share of the Companys common stock,
par value $0.01 per share  



 

1  (" _Company Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding on the Acceptance Date,
in exchange for, at the election of the holder thereof, and subject to
Section 1.5(b)(iv), (i) for each share of Company Common Stock with respect to
which an election to receive cash has been effectively made and not revoked (a
" _Cash Election_ "), the right to receive in cash from Parent, NAH or Merger
Sub, as applicable, without interest, an amount equal to $61.25 (the " _Per
Share Cash Consideration_ ") or (ii) for each share of Company Common Stock
with respect to which an election to receive common shares of Parent, 0.01
par value per share (" _Parent Common Shares_ "), has been effectively made
and not revoked (a " _Stock Election_ "), the right to receive from Parent,
NAH or Merger Sub, as applicable, 3.545 Parent Common Shares, and any cash to
be paid in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement
(the " _Per Share Stock Consideration_ " and, together with the Per Share Cash
Consideration, as determined in accordance with Section 1.5, the "
_Consideration_ "); and (iii) for each share of Company Common Stock other
than shares as to which a Cash Election or a Stock Election has been
effectively made and not revoked (" _Non-Election Shares_ "), the right to
receive from Parent such Per Share Stock Consideration and/or Per Share Cash
Consideration as is determined in accordance with Section 1.5.

(b) The Offer shall be subject only to (1) the condition that there shall be
validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer, prior to the
expiration of the Offer, and not withdrawn, a number of shares of Company
Common Stock that, together with the shares of Company Common Stock owned by
Parent, NAH and Merger Sub, represents, at the expiration of the Offer,
at least the Minimum Condition and (2) the other conditions set forth in
Annex I hereto. Upon termination of this Agreement, if the Offer has not then
been consummated, the Offer shall immediately expire and terminate without any
shares of Company Common Stock being purchased thereunder. Parent, NAH and
Merger Sub, as applicable, expressly reserve the right to waive any of the
conditions to the Offer and to make any change in the terms of or conditions
to the Offer; provided, however, that, without the prior written consent of
the Company, no change may be made that: (i) decreases the consideration
payable in the Offer; (ii) changes the form of consideration payable in the
Offer to a form other than cash or Parent Common Shares; (iii) decreases the
aggregate amount of Cash Consideration available in the Offer or decreases the
relative amount of Cash Consideration available in the Offer; (iv) reduces the
number of shares of Company Common Stock sought in the Offer; (v) imposes
conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth above or in Annex I;
(vi) modifies or waives the Minimum Condition; (vii) except as provided below,
changes the date on which the Offer is scheduled to expire; or (viii) makes
any other change that is adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock or to
holders that have elected a particular form of Consideration. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent, NAH and Merger Sub, as applicable, shall (or in the
case of clause (iii) below, shall at their option) extend the Offer for one or
more periods (i) beyond the scheduled expiration date, which shall initially
be 25 Business Days following the commencement of the Offer, up to
the Termination Date, if, at the scheduled or extended expiration date of the
Offer, any of the conditions to the Offer shall not have been satisfied or, to
the extent permitted, waived, until such conditions are satisfied or, to the
extent permitted, waived, (ii) for any period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof
applicable to the Offer or any period required by applicable Law, or (iii) for
an aggregate period of not more than 10 Business Days beyond the latest
applicable date that would otherwise be permitted under clause (i) or (ii) of
this sentence, if, as of such date, all of the conditions to the Offer have
been satisfied or waived, but the number of shares of Company Common Stock
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer equals more than 80%,
but less than 90% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock on a fully
diluted basis; provided, however, that (x) Parent, NAH and Merger Sub, as
applicable, shall not be obligated to extend the Offer pursuant to clause (i)
of this sentence (but may elect to do so in accordance with this Section
1.1(b), provided that no such extension or series of extensions pursuant to
this parenthetical that would extend the offer by more than 10 Business Days
in the aggregate may be made without the prior written consent of the Company)
if the Minimum Condition is not satisfied at the time such extension would
otherwise be required, so long as the conditions set forth in Annex I have
been satisfied, and Parent has publicly announced such fact and its intention
not to extend the Offer at least two Business Days prior to the date such
extension would, but for this proviso, otherwise have been required, (y) in
the event Parent, NAH or Merger Sub, as applicable, elects to extend the
expiration date pursuant to  



 

2  clause (iii), Parent, NAH and Merger Sub shall be deemed to have irrevocably
waived all of the conditions to the Offer set forth in Annex I, and (z)
Parents, NAHs and Merger Subs, as applicable, obligation to extend the
Offer pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) of this sentence is subject to such
Parties respective rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8\. Except (A) as provided in clause (iii) of the previous sentence and (B) as
elected by Parent in its sole discretion to extend the Offer for a period not
to exceed 10 Business Days, Parent, NAH and Merger Sub, as applicable, shall
not be permitted to extend the Offer without the prior written consent of the
Company at the time that all conditions to the Offer have been satisfied or,
to the extent permitted, waived. Parent, NAH or Merger Sub, as applicable,
shall deliver a written notice to the Company (the " _Acceptance Notice_ ") of
its intention to accept for payment shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
the Offer one Business Day in advance of the proposed Acceptance Date.
Subject to the foregoing and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
the Offer, Parent shall or shall cause NAH or Merger Sub to accept for payment
or exchange, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the expiration of the
Offer, all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer.

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable on the date of commencement of the
Offer, Parent shall, or Parent shall cause NAH or Merger Sub to, (i) file with
the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO relating to the Offer, which
shall include an offer to purchase and letter of transmittal/election form
and such other ancillary documents as shall be required by applicable Law
(together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ";
and, together with the Offer Registration Statement and such other documents
pursuant to which the Offer will be made, the " _Offer Documents_ "), (ii)
file with the SEC a registration statement on Form F-4 to register the offer
and sale of Parent Common Shares pursuant to the Offer (the " _Offer
Registration Statement_ ") and (iii) disseminate the Offer Documents to
holders of Company Common Stock. Each of the Company, Parent, NAH and Merger
Sub shall use their reasonable efforts to have the Offer Registration
Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the filing thereof with the SEC and to keep the
Offer Registration Statement effective as long as necessary to complete the
Offer. Each of Parent, NAH and Merger Sub and the Company agree promptly to
correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and
to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect. Parent shall, and Parent shall cause NAH or Merger Sub
to, take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO and the Offer
Registration Statement as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and the other
Offer Documents as so corrected to be, at such time as reasonably agreed by
Parent and the Company, disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities Laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given an opportunity
to review and comment on the Offer Documents prior to their being filed with
the SEC or disseminated to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock.
Parent shall, and Parent shall cause NAH or Merger Sub to, provide the Company
and its counsel with any comments Parent, NAH and Merger Sub or their counsel
may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents
promptly after the receipt of such comments and shall provide the Company and
its counsel an opportunity to participate in the response of Parent, NAH or
Merger Sub to such comments.

1.2 _Company Action_.

(a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer and represents that the Board of
Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ "), at a meeting duly called
and held, has (i) determined that this Agreement and the Transactions are fair
to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii)
approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Transactions in
accordance with the DGCL, and (iii) resolved to recommend acceptance of the
Offer and, as applicable, adoption of this Agreement by the Companys
stockholders (the " _Recommendation_ "); provided, however, that the Company
Board may withdraw, qualify, modify or amend the Recommendation as and only to
the extent permitted by Section 5.2. The Company further represents that the
Company Board has received the opinion of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. to the
effect that, as of the date of this Agreement, the consideration to be
received by the holders of Company Common Stock (other than Parent, NAH,
Merger Sub and their respective affiliates) in the Offer and the Merger is,
taken  



 

3  together, fair from a financial point of view to such holders, and a copy of
such opinion, promptly upon receipt thereof, will be delivered to Parent.
The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the
Recommendation and the Company shall not withdraw, qualify, modify or amend
the Recommendation in any manner adverse to Parent, NAH or Merger Sub except
as and only to the extent permitted by Section 5.2.

(b) The Company hereby agrees to file with the SEC contemporaneously with the
commencement of the Offer and disseminate to holders of shares of Company
Common Stock a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
(together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule
14D-9_") that, subject to Section 5.2, shall include the Recommendation.
Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to its being filed with the SEC or
disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock. The Company agrees
to provide Parent and its counsel with any comments that the Company or its
counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule
14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments and shall provide Parent
and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to participate in the response
of the Company to such comments. Each of the Company and Parent agrees
promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule
14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect. The Company agrees to take all steps necessary to cause
the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be, at such
time as reasonably agreed by Parent and the Company, disseminated to holders
of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable federal securities Laws.

(c) The Company shall promptly furnish Parent with mailing labels containing
the names and addresses of all record holders of shares of Company Common
Stock and with security position listings of shares of Company Common Stock
held in stock depositories, each as of a recent date, together with all other
available listings and computer files containing names, addresses and
security position listings of record holders and beneficial owners of shares
of Company Common Stock. The Company shall promptly furnish Parent with such
additional information, including, without limitation, updated listings and
computer files of stockholders, mailing labels and security position
listings, and such other assistance in disseminating the Offer Documents to
holders of shares of Company Common Stock as Parent may reasonably request.
Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as
are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents
necessary to consummate the Offer or the Merger, Parent, NAH and Merger Sub
shall hold in confidence the information contained in such labels, listings
and files, shall use such information only in connection with the
Transactions, and, if this Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with
Section 8, shall deliver to the Company all copies of such information then in
their possession.

1.3 _Top-Up Option_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein, the Company hereby grants to
Parent an irrevocable, assignable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ ") to purchase
up to that number of shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option
Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of shares of Company Common Stock that,
when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock collectively owned
by Parent, NAH and Merger Sub and any of their respective affiliates
immediately following consummation of the Offer, shall constitute at least 90%
of the Fully-Diluted Shares (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option
Shares), at a purchase price per Top-Up Option Share equal to
the Consideration, payable in Parent Common Shares, cash or a demand note at
the sole discretion of Parent.

(b) Parent may, at its election, exercise the Top-Up Option, whether in whole
or in part, at any one time after the occurrence of a Top-Up Exercise Event
and prior to the Top-Up Termination Date. For the purposes hereof, a " _Top-Up
Exercise Event_ " shall occur upon Parents acceptance for payment pursuant
to the Offer (including, without limitation, any subsequent offering that
Parent may elect to extend pursuant to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement) of shares of Company Common Stock constituting, together with
shares of Company Common Stock owned directly or indirectly by any other
affiliates of Parent, less  



 

4  than 90% of the Fully-Diluted Shares, but only if (i) the issuance of the
Top-Up Option Shares pursuant thereto would not require the approval of
the stockholders of the Company under NASDAQ rules and regulations, or NASDAQ
has granted a waiver from any such rule or regulation that is reasonably
acceptable to the parties hereto, (ii) there is no other applicable law, rule
or regulation that would require the approval of the Companys stockholders
for the issuance of the Top-Up Shares, or any such approval shall have been
waived, (iii) there are sufficient shares of Company Common Stock available
for issuance under the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or available in
the treasury of the Company, and (iv) any Parent Common Stock to be issued in
connection with the exercise of the Top-Up Option may be issued pursuant to a
valid exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act or
any state securities laws. Upon and after the request of Parent, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any waiver contemplated by
clause (i) of the preceding sentence from NASDAQ as promptly as possible
after any such request. For the purposes hereof, the " _Top-Up Termination
Date_ " shall occur upon the earliest to occur of (A) the Effective Time, (B)
the termination of this Agreement, (C) the date that is ten (10) Business
Days after the occurrence of a Top-Up Exercise Event, unless the Top-Up Option
has been previously exercised in accordance with the terms and conditions
hereof and (D) the date that is ten Business Days after the Top-Up Notice
Date, unless the Top-Up Closing shall have previously occurred.

(c) If Parent wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Parent shall send to the
Company a written notice (a " _Top-Up Exercise Notice_ ," and the date of
receipt of which notice is referred to herein as the " _Top-Up Notice Date_
"), specifying the place for the closing of the purchase and sale of shares
of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Top-Up Option (the " _Top-Up Closing_
") and a date not earlier than one Business Day nor later than ten Business
Days after the Top-Up Notice Date for the Top-Up Closing. The Company shall,
promptly after receipt of the Top-Up Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice
to Parent confirming the number of Top-Up Option Shares and the aggregate
purchase price therefor.

(d) At the Top-Up Closing, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, (i) the Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate or
certificates evidencing the applicable number of Top-Up Option Shares;
_provided_ that the obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up Option Shares
upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the condition that
no provision of any applicable law or regulation and no judgment, injunction,
order or decree shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the
delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of any such exercise and (ii)
Parent shall purchase each Top-Up Option Share from the Company for the
Consideration described above. Payment by Parent of the Consideration for the
Top-Up Option Shares may be made, at Parents option, by delivery of (A)
immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account designated by the
Company, (B) a demand note issued by Parent in customary form and in a
principal face amount equal to the purchase price for the Top-Up Option Shares
or (C) Parent Common Shares.

 

(e) Upon the delivery by Parent to the Company of the Top-Up Exercise Notice,
and the tender of the Consideration described in Section 1.3(d), Parent shall
be deemed to be the holder of record of the Top-Up Option Shares issuable upon
that exercise, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of the Company
shall then be closed or that certificates representing those Top-Up Option
Shares shall not then be actually delivered to Parent or the Company shall
have failed or refused to designate the bank account described in Section
1.3(d).

(f) Parent shall pay all expenses, and any and all federal, state and local
stock transfer taxes and other related charges, that may be payable in
connection with the preparation, issuance and delivery of stock certificates
under this Section 1.3.

(g) Certificates evidencing Top-Up Option Shares delivered hereunder may
include legends legally required, including a legend in substantially the
following form:

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND MAY BE REOFFERED OR SOLD ONLY IF
SO REGISTERED OR IF AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION IS AVAILABLE.



 

5 1.4 _Directors_.

(a) Effective upon the Acceptance Date, Parent shall be entitled to designate
the number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company
Board that equals the product of the (i) total number of directors on the
Company Board (giving effect to the election of any additional directors
pursuant to this Section 1.4) and (ii) the percentage that the number of
shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent, NAH or Merger Sub
(including shares of Company Common Stock accepted for payment or exchange)
bears to the total number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding, and
the Company shall take all action necessary to cause Parents designees to be
elected or appointed to the Company Board, including increasing the number of
directors, and seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent directors. At
such time, the Company will also use its best efforts to cause individuals
designated by Parent to constitute the number of members, rounded up to the
next whole number, on (i) each committee of the Company Board and (ii) each
board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company identified by Parent
(and each committee thereof) that represents the same percentage as such
individuals represent on the Company Board, in each case only to the extent
permitted by applicable Law. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section
1.4, the parties hereto shall use their respective best efforts (including by
reducing the number of directors that Parent may designate pursuant to the
first sentence of this paragraph (a), but in no event to less than a majority
of the directors on the Company Board) to ensure that at least two of the
members of the Company Board shall, at all times prior to the Effective Time,
be directors of the Company who were directors of the Company on the date
hereof (the " _Continuing Directors_ "); provided that if there shall be in
office fewer than two Continuing Directors for any reason, the Company Board
shall cause a person designated by the remaining Continuing Director to fill
such vacancy who shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for all purposes
of this Agreement, or if no Continuing Directors then remain, the other
directors of the Company then in office shall designate two persons to fill
such vacancies who will not be officers or employees or affiliates of the
Company, Parent, NAH or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries and
such persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for all purposes of
this Agreement.

(b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the Company
Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions, and shall
include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and
its officers and directors, as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 require in order
to fulfill its obligations under this Section, so long as Parent shall have
provided to the Company on a timely basis in writing and be solely responsible
for any information with respect to itself, NAH, Merger Sub and
their respective nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

(c) Following the election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to
Section 1.4(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the
Continuing Directors shall be required to authorize any termination of this
Agreement by the Company, any amendment of this Agreement requiring action by
the Company Board, any extension of time for performance of any obligation or
action hereunder by Parent, NAH or Merger Sub, any waiver of compliance with
any of the agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the
Company, any amendment of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the
Company, and any other action of the Company hereunder which adversely affects
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Parent, NAH or
Merger Sub).

1.5 _Allocation of Consideration; Election Procedures_.

(a) _Allocation_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Cash Election
Number_ ") to be exchanged for Per Share Cash Consideration pursuant to the
Offer shall be 55% of the number of whole shares of Company Common Stock that
are tendered and accepted for payment or exchange pursuant to the Offer. The
number of shares of Company Common Stock to be exchanged for Per Share Stock
Consideration pursuant to the Offer (the " _Stock Election Number_ ") shall be
equal to the number of whole shares of Company Common Stock that are tendered
and accepted for payment or exchange pursuant to the Offer less the Cash
Election Number.



 

6 (b) _Election Procedures._

(i) Subject to allocation and proration in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 1.5, each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Election Deadline (A) may specify in
a request made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.5(b) (1)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such holder with
respect to which such holder desires to make a Cash Election and (2) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to
which such Holder desires to make a Stock Election or (B) may indicate that
such holder has no preference as to the receipt of Per Share Cash
Consideration or Per Share Stock Consideration for such shares of Company
Common Stock (a " _Non-Election_ "). Shares of Company Common Stock in respect
of which a Non-Election is made (" _Non-Election Shares_ ") shall be deemed
by Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion, subject to Section
1.5(b)(iv)-(vii), to be, in whole or in part, shares of Company Common Stock
in respect of which Cash Elections or Stock Elections have been made.

(ii) Elections pursuant to Section 1.5(b)(i) shall be made on a form and with
such other provisions to be reasonably agreed upon by the Company and Parent
(a " _Form of Election_ ") to be provided by the Exchange Agent for that
purpose to holders of record of shares of Company Common Stock, together with
appropriate transmittal materials, at the time of mailing to holders of record
of shares of Company Common Stock of the Offer Documents. Elections shall be
made by mailing to the Exchange Agent a duly completed Form of Election. To
be effective, a Form of Election must be (x) properly completed, signed and
submitted to the Exchange Agent at its designated office, by 5:00 p.m., on the
Acceptance Date, (which date shall be publicly announced by Parent as soon as
reasonably practicable but in no event less than five trading days prior to
the Acceptance Date (the " _Election Deadline_ "). The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to make a Form of Election available to all
persons who become holders of record of shares of Company Common Stock
between the date of mailing described in the first sentence of this Section
1.5(b)(ii) and the Election Deadline. Parent shall determine, in its
reasonable discretion, which authority it may delegate in whole or in part to
the Exchange Agent, whether Forms of Election have been properly completed,
signed and submitted or revoked. Neither Parent nor the Exchange Agent will be
under any obligation to notify any person of any defect in a Form of Election
submitted to the Exchange Agent. A holder of shares of Company Common Stock
that tenders shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer and does not submit
an effective Form of Election prior to the Election Deadline shall be deemed
to have made a Non-Election.

(iii) An election may be revoked with respect to any shares of Company Common
Stock, but only by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the
Election Deadline. Upon any such revocation, unless a duly completed Form of
Election is thereafter submitted in accordance with Section 1.5(b)(i), such
shares of Company Common Stock shall be Non-Election Shares.

(iv) In the event that the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
in respect of which Cash Elections have been made (collectively, the " _Cash
Election Shares_ ") exceeds the Cash Election Number (such excess the "
_Excess Cash Election Shares_ "), then:

1\. all shares in respect of which Stock Elections have been made (the "
_Stock Election Shares_ ") shall be exchanged for Per Share Stock
Consideration,

2\. all Non-Election Shares shall be deemed converted into Stock Election
Shares and exchanged for Per Share Stock Consideration,

3\. all Excess Cash Election Shares shall be deemed converted into
Stock Election Shares, on a pro-rata basis for each record holder of Cash
Election Shares so that the number of Excess Cash Election Shares so
converted, when added to the other Stock Election Shares, shall equal as
closely as reasonably practicable the Stock Election Number, and all such
Excess Cash Election Shares so converted shall be exchanged for Per Share
Stock Consideration; and



 

7 4\. all Cash Election Shares not deemed converted into Stock Election Shares
pursuant to 3 above shall be exchanged for Per Share Cash Consideration.

(v) In the event that the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares exceeds
the Stock Election Number (such excess the " _Excess Stock Election Shares_
"), then:

1\. all Cash Election Shares shall be exchanged for Per Share Cash
Consideration,

2\. all Non-Election Shares shall be deemed converted into Cash Election
Shares and exchanged for Per Share Cash Consideration,

3\. all Excess Stock Election Shares shall be deemed converted into Cash
Election Shares, on a pro-rata basis for each record holder of Stock Election
Shares, so that the number of Excess Stock Election Shares so converted, when
added to the other Cash Election Shares, shall equal as closely as reasonably
practicable the Cash Election Number, and all such Excess Stock Election
Shares so converted shall be exchanged for Per Share Cash Consideration, and

4\. all Stock Election Shares not deemed converted into Cash Election Shares
pursuant to 3 above shall be exchanged for Per Share Stock Consideration.

(vi) In the event that neither clause (iv) nor clause (v) of this Section
1.5(b) is applicable, Non-Election Shares shall be deemed converted into
Stock Election Shares on a pro rata basis for each record holder of Non-
Election Shares such that the total number of Stock Election Shares equals the
Stock Election Number and any remaining Non-Election Shares shall be deemed
converted into Cash Election Shares, and (x) all Cash Election Shares and all
Non-Election Shares which are deemed converted into Cash Election Shares shall
be exchanged for Per Share Cash Consideration, and (y) all Stock Election
Shares and all Non-Election Shares which are deemed converted into Stock
Election Shares shall be exchanged for Per Share Stock Consideration.

(vii) The Exchange Agent, in consultation with Parent and the Company, shall
make all computations to give effect to this Section 1.5(b).

1.6 _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging Company
Certificates representing outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for the
Consideration pursuant to the Offer are set forth below.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Acceptance Date, Parent shall designate a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as Exchange
Agent in connection with the Offer (the " _Exchange Agent_ ").

(b) _Exchange Fund_. No later than the Acceptance Date, as a condition to
acceptance of the shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer,
Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent,
for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with the terms of the Offer, (i) the Offer Cash Pool plus
an estimate of any cash to be paid in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares
pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) certificates representing the Parent
Common Shares issuable to holders of Company Common Stock in the Offer (such
cash and certificates for Parent Common Shares, together with any dividends
or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as, the "
_Exchange Fund_ ") and shall give irrevocable instructions to the Exchange
Agent to make cash payments and deliver the Parent Common Shares in exchange
for the shares of Company Common Stock. The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to
such irrevocable instructions, make cash payments and deliver the Parent
Common Shares contemplated to be issued pursuant to this Agreement out of the
Exchange Fund.

(c) _Distributions on Parent Common Shares_. For purposes of determining
entitlement to dividends or other distributions declared on Parent Common
Shares, holders of Company Common Stock who have validly tendered and not
withdrawn such shares pursuant to the Offer shall be deemed to be record
holders of Parent Common Shares as of the Acceptance Date, notwithstanding
the fact that certificates representing such shares have not yet been issued
or delivered to tendering stockholders (or, if applicable, appropriate book-
entries have not yet been made). 



 

8 2\. THE MERGER

2.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the consummation of the Offer, in accordance with
the DGCL, the DLLCA and the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the

Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, NAH, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holder thereof, be converted into and shall become the right
to receive the Consideration in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 2, and each holder of a Company Certificate shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto other than, at the election of the holder thereof,

to receive cash has been effectively made and not revoked (a " _Merger Cash
Election_ "), the right to receive in cash, without interest, an amount equal
to the Per Share Cash Consideration, (ii) for each share of Company Common
Stock with respect to which an election to receive Parent Common Shares has
been effectively made and not revoked (a " _Merger Stock Election_ "), the

Consideration pursuant to the Merger shall be equal to 55% of the number of
shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting
Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. The
number of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted

in whole or in part to the Exchange Agent, whether Merger Forms of Election
have been properly completed, signed and submitted or revoked. Neither Parent
nor the Exchange Agent will be under any obligation to notify any person of
any defect in a Merger Form of Election submitted to the Exchange Agent. A
holder of shares of Company Common Stock that does not submit an effective
Merger Form of Election prior to the Merger Election Deadline shall be deemed
to have made a Merger Non-Election.

Merger Non-Election for such shares of Company Common Stock. Merger Non-

Merger Stock Elections have been made.

(iii) In the event that the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
in respect of which Merger Cash Elections have been made (collectively, the "
_Merger Cash Election Shares_ ") exceeds the Merger Cash Election Number (such

1\. all shares in respect of which Merger Stock Elections have been made (the
" _Merger Stock Election Shares_ ") shall be converted into the right to
receive Per Share Stock Consideration,

2\. all Merger Non-Election Shares shall be deemed converted into Merger
Stock Election Shares and shall be converted into the right to receive Per

Merger Cash Election Shares, so that the number of Excess Merger Cash Election
Shares so converted, when added to the other Merger Stock Election Shares,
shall equal as closely as reasonably practicable the Merger Stock Election
Number, and all such Excess Merger Cash Election Shares so converted shall be
converted into the right to receive Per Share Stock Consideration, and

4\. all Merger Cash Election Shares not deemed converted into Merger
Stock Election Shares pursuant to 3 above shall be converted into the right
to receive Per Share Cash Consideration.



 

10 (iv) In the event that the aggregate number of Merger Stock Election Shares
exceeds the Merger Stock Election Number (such excess, the " _Excess Merger
Stock Election Shares_ "), then:

1\. all Merger Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive Per Share Cash Consideration,

2\. all Merger Non-Election Shares shall be deemed converted into Merger Cash
Election Shares and shall be converted into the right to receive Per Share

Merger Stock Election Shares, so that the number of Excess Merger Stock
Election Shares so converted, when added to the other Merger Cash Election
Shares, shall equal as closely as reasonably practicable the Merger Cash
Election Number, and all such shares of Excess Company Common Stock so
converted shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash
Consideration, and

Election Shares pursuant to 3 above shall be converted into the right to
receive Per Share Stock Consideration.

(v) In the event that neither clause (iii) nor clause (iv) of this Section 2.5
is applicable, Merger Non-Election Shares shall be deemed Merger Stock
Election Shares on a pro rata basis for each record holder of Merger Non-
Election Shares such that the total number of Merger Stock Election Shares
equals the Merger Stock Election Number and any remaining Merger Non-Election
Shares shall be deemed Merger Cash Election Shares, and (x) all Merger Cash
Election Shares and all Merger Non-Election Shares in respect of which Merger
Cash Elections are deemed to have been made shall be converted into the
right to receive Per Share Cash Consideration, and (y) all Merger Stock
Election Shares and all Merger Non-Election Shares in respect of which Merger

Certificates representing outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for the
Consideration pursuant to the Merger are set forth below.

(a) _Merger Exchange Fund_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for

Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions,
make cash payments and deliver the Parent Common Shares contemplated to be
issued pursuant to this Agreement out of the Merger Exchange Fund.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Upon surrender of a Company Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto and such other documents as may reasonably be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Company Certificate shall be entitled to
receive promptly in exchange therefor (A) a certificate representing the
number of whole Parent Common Shares that such holder has the right to receive
as part of the Consideration and (B) a check for the cash that such holder is
entitled to receive as part of the Consideration, including the Per Share
Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares. Until so
surrendered, each outstanding Company Certificate shall be deemed from and

receive upon such surrender the Consideration. Any portion of the Parent
Common Shares and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this
Agreement, which remains undistributed to the holders of the shares of

2.6 shall thereafter be entitled to receive from Parent payment of the
Consideration to be issued in exchange therefor and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares, dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common
Shares to which such holders may be then entitled.

2.7 _Payment for Parent Common Shares_. The Parent Common Shares issued as Per
Share Stock Consideration shall, for purposes of the Laws of The Netherlands,
be paid for by the holder of the Company Common Stock through the subscription
described below. By virtue of the Merger or the tendering of Company Common
Stock in the Offer, as applicable, and without any further action on the part
of the holders of Company Common Stock, each holder of Company Common Stock
shall be deemed to have subscribed under this Agreement for the Parent Common
Shares that are to be issued to such holder in accordance with this
Agreement. In accordance with the Laws of The Netherlands, each holder of
Company Common Stock who receives Parent Common Shares as part of such
holders Consideration shall be obligated to pay up the Parent Common Shares
so issued to such holder in accordance with this Agreement. This payment
obligation on the part of such holders of Company Common Stock (which, solely
for the purpose of satisfying this obligation to pay up the Parent Common
Shares, shall be equal to the par value of such Parent Common Shares) shall
be fully satisfied and paid by such holders of Company Common Stock by
Parents assumption of such holders right to receive compensation (which,
solely for the purpose of satisfying this obligation to compensate the
holders of Company Common Stock, shall also be equal to the par value of such
Parent Common Shares) from NAH for the cancellation of the Company Common
Stock, or exchange of such Company Common Stock in connection with the
consummation of the Offer, followed by a set off of this right to receive
compensation against the obligation to pay up the Parent Common Shares. It is
understood that, if the Merger or the Offer is consummated, the
stockholders of the Company are entitled to receive the Parent Common Shares
directly from Parent, NAH or Merger Sub and that, if the Merger or the Offer
is consummated, such stockholders will thereupon become third party
beneficiaries of this Agreement solely for this purpose. For the avoidance of
doubt, (x) in no event shall the amount of the Consideration to be received by
each holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement be reduced by
the obligation to pay up the Parent Common Shares and (y) NAH shall be
obligated to deliver the Consideration to holders of Company Common Stock in
accordance with, and subject to the terms of, this Agreement; provided,
however, that the obligations of NAH to deliver the Consideration under this
Agreement may be assigned, in whole or in part, to Parent or any of Parents
wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiaries.

2.8  _Certificate of Formation and Operating Agreement of the Surviving
Company_. At the Effective Time, (a) the Certificate of Formation of Merger
Sub (the " _Certificate of Formation_ ") immediately prior to the Closing
shall continue in its then current form until amended as provided therein and
under the DLLCA and (b) the Operating Agreement of Merger Sub (the "
_Operating Agreement_ ") immediately prior to the Closing shall continue in
its then current form until amended as provided therein and under the DLLCA.

2.9 _Directors and Officers_. Subject to the requirements of Law, the persons
listed on Schedule 2.9 shall be the officers of the Surviving Company
immediately after the Closing, each to hold office in accordance with the
Certificate of Formation and the Operating Agreement, in each case until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Certificate
of Formation and the Operating Agreement.

2.10 _Cancellation of Shares._ At the Effective Time, each share of Company
Common Stock owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ "), shall be canceled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof or payment therefor.

2.11 _No Liability._ To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of the
Exchange Agent, Parent, NAH, Merger Sub or the Surviving Company shall be
liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any Parent Common
Shares or any amount of cash properly paid to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law or retained by
Parent.



 

12 2.12 _Dissenting Shares._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and held by a person who has not voted in favor of the
Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such
shares in accordance with the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into a right to receive the Consideration, unless such holder fails
to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses its rights to appraisal or it is
determined that such holder does not have appraisal rights in accordance with
the DGCL. If, after the Closing, such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or
loses its right to appraisal, or if it is determined that such holder does not
have appraisal rights, such shares shall be treated as if they had been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Consideration. The Company shall give Parent, NAH and Merger Sub prompt notice
of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares, and Parent,
NAH and Merger Sub shall have the right to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands except as required by applicable
Law. The Company shall not, except with prior written consent of Parent, make
any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands,
unless and to the extent required to do so under applicable Law.

2.13 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action._ If, at any time and from
time to time after the Closing, any further action is necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest in the Surviving
Company full right, title, interest and possession of all properties, assets,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Company shall be and are fully
authorized, in the name of and on behalf of any of the Company, Merger Sub or
the Surviving Company, to take, or cause to be taken, all such lawful and
necessary action as is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

2.14 _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares._ No dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the Closing with respect to Parent Common
Shares with a record date after the Closing will be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered shares of Company Common Stock with respect to the Parent Common
Shares represented thereby, and no cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common
Shares shall be paid to any such holder, until the holder of record of the
Company Certificate representing such Company Common Stock shall surrender
such Company Certificate. Subject to Law, following surrender of any such
Company Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of record of such
Company Certificate Parent Common Shares representing the whole number of
Parent Common Shares to be issued in exchange therefor, the applicable Per
Share Cash Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares
and any dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Closing
theretofore paid with respect to such whole number of Parent Common Shares.

2.15 _Transfers of Ownership._ If any certificate for Parent Common Shares or
check is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Company
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the Company Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer,
accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such
transfer, and that the stockholder requesting such exchange shall have paid
to Parent, or any agent designated by Parent, any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for Parent Common Shares
or a check in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
certificate surrendered, or established to the reasonable satisfaction of
Parent or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is
otherwise not payable.

2.16 _Withholding of Tax._ Parent, Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent
will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock such amounts as Parent (or any Affiliate, including the Surviving
Company) or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
federal, state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by Parent, Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent, such withheld
amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent, the Surviving Company or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be, to the applicable Governmental Authority and (ii)
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding were made by Parent. 



 

13 2.17 _Lost Certificates._ If any Company Certificate is lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and an
indemnification against loss in customary form, the Exchange Agent shall issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate the
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

2.18 _Company Equity Awards._  

(a) At the Effective Time, all outstanding Company Equity Awards under the
Amended and Restated Directors Equity Compensation Plan (the " _Cancelled
Equity Awards_ ") will be terminated or cancelled, as the case may be, in
accordance with the terms of such plan and the agreements entered into
thereunder. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall give any notice
required by the Amended and Restated Directors Equity Compensation Plan,
which notice shall have been provided to Parent for its review prior to
delivery, to holders of Cancelled Equity Awards thereunder of (i)
the acceleration in full of the vesting of such Cancelled Equity Awards,
effective as of a date determined by the Company on or prior to the date of
the Effective Time and (ii) the termination or cancellation, as the case may
be, upon the Closing of any unexercised Cancelled Equity Awards.

(b) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Equity Award described
in Section 3.3(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule other than Cancelled
Equity Awards (the " _Assumed Equity Awards_ "), whether vested or unvested,
shall be assumed by Parent and shall become an award with respect to, on the
same terms and conditions as were applicable under the applicable Company
Equity Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, the number of Parent
Common Shares determined as follows:

(i) the number of Parent Common Shares subject to each Assumed Equity Award
shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common
Stock that were subject to such Assumed Equity Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Option Conversion Ratio (as defined below), and rounding
the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of Parent
Common Shares; and

(ii) the per share exercise price for the Parent Common Shares issuable upon
exercise of each Assumed Equity Award shall be determined by dividing the per
share exercise price of Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed Equity
Award, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Option
Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest
whole cent;

provided, however, that the exercise price and the number of Parent Common
Shares subject to each Company Equity Award shall be determined in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code to the extent
applicable; and provided, further, that in the case of any Company Equity
Award to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the option price, the number
of shares subject to such Company Equity Award and the terms and conditions of
exercise of such Company Equity Award shall be determined in accordance with
the foregoing, subject to such adjustments as are necessary in order to
satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code.

(c) Any restriction on the exercise of any Assumed Equity Awards assumed by
Parent shall continue in full force and effect and the term, exercisability,
vesting schedule and other provisions of such Assumed Equity Awards shall
otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the assumption of such Assumed
Equity Awards, in each case except to the extent otherwise provided in any
stock option, change in control or in any retention agreement in effect on the
date of this Agreement. The " _Option Conversion Ratio_ " shall be equal to
3.545.

(d) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the participants in
the Company Equity Plans holding Assumed Equity Awards an appropriate notice
setting forth such participants rights pursuant to the Assumed Equity Awards,
as provided in this Section 2.18.

(e) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of Parent Common Shares for delivery upon exercise of the
Assumed Equity Awards assumed in accordance with this Section 2.18. Within
five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) with respect
to the Parent Common Shares subject to such  



 

14  Assumed Equity Awards held by persons who become employees or consultants of
the Surviving Company and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements
(and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such Assumed Equity Awards remain outstanding.

(f) The Company and Parent shall each take all corporate and other action
reasonably necessary to cause all dispositions of equity securities of the
Company (including Assumed Equity Awards) or acquisitions of equity securities
of Parent (including any Assumed Equity Awards to acquire Parent Common Shares
that may be granted by Parent) by each individual who (i) is a director or
officer of the Company or (ii) at the Effective Time will become a director or
officer of Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act.

2.19 _Adjustments to Per Share Stock Consideration._ The number of Parent
Common Shares issuable in connection with the Offer and the Merger and the
Option Conversion Ratio (and, in the case of any of the matters described in
this Section 2.19 with respect to Company Common Stock, the Per Share Cash
Consideration) shall each be appropriately adjusted, at any time and from time
to time, to fully reflect the effect of any stock split or combination (
_splitsing van aandelen, samenvoeging van_ ( _verschillende klassen van_ )
_aandelen_ ), recapitalization ( _omzetting reserves in aandelenkapitaal_ ),
stock dividend, reclassification, redenomination, adjustment of par
value, exchange of shares, reorganization, recapitalization or other like
change with respect to Parent Common Shares or, if permitted by the terms of
Section 5.1(f), Company Common Stock, as the case may be, occurring (or for
which a record date occurs) during the Interim Period.

2.20 _No Fractional Shares._ No certificate or scrip representing fractional
Parent Common Shares shall be issued in connection with the Offer or the
Merger, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof
to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Offer or the Merger
who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Shares (after taking into account all Company Certificates delivered by
such holder) shall receive from Parent, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a Parent Common Share
multiplied by the Closing Average. For purposes of this Agreement, the "
_Closing Average_ " shall be the average closing sale price per share of
Parent Common Shares (rounded up to the nearest cent) on the NASDAQ Global
Select Market (" _NGSM_ ") for the ten (10) consecutive trading days ending on
the second-to-last trading day immediately prior to the Acceptance Date, in
the case of the Offer or the Effective Time, in the case of the Merger.

when filed, as the case may be) as to  



 

19  form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and/or the Exchange Act, as the case may be and (ii) did not at
the time they were filed (or, if later filed, amended or superseded, then on

or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements contained therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

any related notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Reports (collectively,
the " _Company Financial Statements_ "), at the time filed and amended, (i)
complied or will comply, as the case may be, as to form in all material
respects with the applicable published rules and regulations of the SEC with

Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to Companys management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Company required
under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. As of March 31, 2007,

process, summarize and report financial information and has identified for
the Companys auditors and audit committee of the Company Board any material
weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting and (b) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
Since the date of the Companys most recent evaluation of internal control
over financial reporting, to the knowledge of the Company, no facts or
circumstances have arisen or occurred that would be required to be disclosed
to the Companys auditors or the Companys audit committee regarding (x) a
significant deficiency in the design or operation of its internal control
over financial reporting, (y) a material weakness in its internal control over
financial reporting or (z) fraud, whether or not material, that involves

made, not misleading.

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any related notes thereto) contained in the Parent SEC Reports (collectively,
the " _Parent Financial Statements_ "), at the time filed and amended, (i)

(c) The management of Parent has established and maintains "disclosure
controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the

information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by
Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to Parents management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Parent required
under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. As of December 31, 2006,
there were no "material weaknesses" in Parents or any of Parent
Subsidiaries internal controls as contemplated under SOX. Parent has
disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of its internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) by its

employees who have a significant role in Parents internal control over
financial reporting. Since the date of Parents most recent evaluation of
internal control over financial reporting, to the knowledge of Parent, no

conduct, adopted pursuant to NASDAQ Rule 4350(n). Parent has delivered
to Parent complete and correct copies of any written complaints, reports or

_Representative_ ") to, immediately cease any discussions, negotiations or
written communications (other than communications solely directed at informing
other parties of the restrictions contained in this Section 5.2 and only in
response to an inquiry from such other parties) with any party or parties that
commenced prior to the execution of this Agreement with respect to any
Competing Proposal. As used in this Agreement, a " _Competing Proposal_
" means any proposal, offer or indication of interest (other than this
Agreement, the Offer and the Merger), whether in writing or otherwise, from
any Person or group (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) other
than Parent, NAH,  



 

46  Merger Sub or any affiliates thereof (a " _Third Party_ "), relating to (i)
any acquisition or purchase, directly or indirectly, of more than 20% of the
consolidated total assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or more than 20%
of any class of equity or voting securities of the Company; (ii) any tender
offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated,
would result in any Third Party beneficially owning more than 10% of any class
of equity or voting securities of the Company or (iii) a merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, sale of substantially all
the assets, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
other similar transaction involving the Company.

(b) During the Interim Period, the Company shall not, nor shall it authorize
or permit any Representative of the Company or its Subsidiaries to (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or otherwise knowingly facilitate,
directly or indirectly, any inquiries relating to, any Competing Proposal;
(ii) directly or indirectly initiate or participate in any discussions,
negotiations or communications (other than communications solely directed at
informing other parties of the restrictions contained in this Section 5.2 and
only in response to an inquiry from such other parties) regarding any
Competing Proposal; (iii) furnish to any Third Party any nonpublic information
or data for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, or, except where
failure to do so would cause the Company Board to breach its fiduciary
obligations under applicable Laws, provide access to the properties, offices,
books, records, officers, directors or employees of the Company for the
purpose of encouraging or facilitating, any Competing Proposal; or (iv)
release any party from or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or
standstill agreement to which it is a party. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of any of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 5.2 by any Representative of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be and be deemed to be a breach by
the Company of this Section 5.2 by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing
and anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if, prior to the
closing of the polls at the Company Special Meeting on the proposal to adopt
this Agreement, the Company Board determines (after consultation with outside
counsel and its financial advisor) that a Competing Proposal (other than one
made following a breach by the Company of this Section 5.2) constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Competing Proposal, then the
Company may, but only to the extent that the Company Board determines in good
faith after consultation with the Companys outside counsel that failure to do
so would cause the Company Board to breach its fiduciary obligations under
applicable Laws and subject to the Company providing prompt (but in any event
within 12 hours) written notice to Parent of its decision to take such action
and compliance by the Company with Section 5.2(d), (A) furnish information or
data with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Third Party
(and the Representatives of such Third Party); (B) participate in discussions
and negotiations directly or through its Representatives with such Third
Party, subject to, in the case of clause (A) and, to the extent such
discussions or negotiations include the disclosure by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of their Representatives of any material nonpublic
information, clause (B), a confidentiality agreement not less favorable to
the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement, provided, that all such
material nonpublic information not already provided or made available to
Parent is provided to Parent as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any
event within 12 hours) after it is provided to such Third Party and (C)
amend, or grant a waiver or release under, any standstill or similar agreement
with respect to any Company Common Stock, but only to the extent necessary to
permit the making and subsequent consummation of a Superior Competing
Proposal by a Third Party. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior
Competing Proposal_ " shall mean a bona fide written proposal or offer made by
a Third Party to acquire, directly or indirectly, including pursuant to a
tender offer, exchange offer, sale of shares of stock, sale of assets, merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction, more than 50% of the capital stock of the
Company then outstanding or more than 50% of the consolidated total assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (i) on terms the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consulting the Companys outside legal counsel
and financial advisor) are more favorable to the holders of Company Common
Stock than the Transactions, taking into account, among other things, relevant
legal, financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects of the offer and the
Third Party making the offer and the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and (ii) which is reasonably capable of being consummated.



 

47 (c) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw
or modify, or publicly propose or publicly resolve to withdraw or modify, in
a manner adverse to Parent, NAH or Merger Sub, the Recommendation; (ii)
approve or recommend, or publicly propose or publicly resolve to approve or
recommend, any Competing Proposal; (iii) approve or recommend, or execute or
enter into, or publicly propose or publicly resolve to approve or recommend or
execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, stock purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement or similar agreement relating to a Competing
Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 5.2(b)
entered into in the circumstances referred to in Section 5.2(b)) (an "
_Acquisition Agreement_ "); (iv) approve or recommend, or execute or enter
into, or publicly propose or publicly resolve to approve or recommend or
execute or enter into, any agreement requiring it to terminate this Agreement
or abandon or fail to consummate the Offer, the Merger or the other
Transactions contemplated hereby or (v) take any action necessary to render
the provisions of any "moratorium", "control share", "fair price", "affiliate
transaction", "business combination", or other anti-takeover Laws and
regulations of any state or other jurisdiction, including the provisions of
Section 203 of the DGCL, inapplicable to any Competing Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Stockholder Approval, the
Company Board may, in response to a Superior Competing Proposal (other than
one made following a breach by the Company of this Section 5.2), (1) withdraw
or modify the Recommendation or (2) approve or recommend the Superior
Competing Proposal, but in the case of any action described in clause (1)
or any recommendation described in clause (2), only (x) if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside
counsel, that failure to do so would violate its fiduciary obligations under
applicable Laws, and in each case, only (y) at a time that is after 3
Business Days following Parents receipt of written notice advising Parent
that the Company Board intends to take such action (during which period the
Company shall make its chief executive officer, chief financial officer and
its counsel available to Parent to meet on at least two separate occasions for
a total of at least 12 hours, and shall consider in good faith any amendment
of the terms of the Offer and/or the Merger proposed by Parent, NAH or Merger
Sub or any proposal by Parent, NAH or Merger Sub to amend the terms of this
Agreement, the Offer or the Merger), specifying therein the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Competing Proposal and identifying the Person or
group making such Superior Competing Proposal, provided that such 3 Business
Day period shall be extended for an additional 3 Business Days following each
material modification of such Competing Proposal occurring after the receipt
of Parents proposal, and (z) if, after the end of such 3 Business Day period
(plus each applicable extension), the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and
its financial advisor) that such proposed transaction continues to be a
Superior Competing Proposal, after taking into account any bona fide proposal
by Parent, NAH or Merger Sub to amend the terms of this Agreement and the
Merger. The Company shall not during the term of this Agreement release any
Third Party from, or agree to amend or waive any provision of, any
confidentiality agreement with any Third Party with respect to a Competing
Proposal entered into pursuant to this Section 5.2 other than the standstill
provision as provided above, and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to enforce, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, each
confidentiality agreement entered into pursuant to this Section 5.2. In
addition, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Stockholder
Approval, the Company Board may withdraw or modify the Recommendation if the
Company Board determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that
failure to do so would violate its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law,
but only at a time that is after 3 Business Days following Parents receipt of
written notice advising Parent that the Company Board is prepared to take
such action, specifying the reasons therefor.

(d) In addition to the obligations set forth in Sections 5.2(a), (b) and (c),
the Company shall notify Parent orally and, if requested by Parent, in
writing, within 12 hours of the receipt by the Company of any Competing
Proposal, which notification shall include the material terms and conditions
of such Competing Proposal and the identity of the person or group making or
sending the Competing Proposal. The Company shall promptly (but in any event
within 12 hours) advise Parent of any material change in the terms or
conditions of a Competing Proposal or any other material development with
respect thereto.



 

48 (e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 or any other provision hereof
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and
disclosing to the Companys stockholders pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act a position with respect to a tender or
exchange offer by a Third Party or (ii) making any disclosure to the
Companys stockholders, if the Company Board determines, after consultation
with its outside counsel, that failure to so disclose would cause it to
violate its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law.

(f) Nothing in this Section 5.2 shall permit the Company to terminate this
Agreement (except as expressly provided in Section 8).

5.3 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement is intended to give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries operations prior to the
Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to give
the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct Parents
or its Subsidiaries operations.

and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to Parents stockholders.

(c)  _Preparation of Merger Registration Statement and Proxy Statement_.

(i) If required by applicable Laws, promptly after the acceptance for
exchange or payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer,
Parent and the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, the Merger
Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement. Parent shall provide the
Company and its counsel with any comments it may receive from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Merger Registration Statement as promptly as
reasonably practicable after receipt of such comments and the parties shall
cooperate to prepare appropriate responses to the SEC to such comments and
make such modifications to the Merger Registration Statement as shall be
reasonably appropriate. The Company shall provide the Parent and its counsel
with any comments it may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Proxy Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt of
such comments and the parties shall cooperate to prepare appropriate responses
to the SEC to such comments and make such modifications to the
Proxy Statement as shall be reasonably appropriate. Each of the Company and
Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to have the Merger Registration
Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the acceptance for payment or exchange of shares
of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and to keep the Merger
Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the
Merger. The Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company as
Parent may reasonably request in connection with the preparation of the Merger
Registration Statement. The Parent shall furnish all information concerning
the Parent and the Company may reasonably request in connection with
the preparation of the Proxy Statement. If required by applicable Laws, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to mail the Proxy Statement to
its stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Merger
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act and, if
necessary, after the Proxy Statement shall have been so mailed, promptly
circulate amended, supplemental or supplemented proxy material, and, if
required in connection therewith, resolicit proxies. No amendment or
supplement to the Merger Registration Statement or Proxy Statement will be
made by Parent or the Company without the approval of the other party, which
will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each party will advise the
other party promptly, after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the
Merger Registration Statement is declared effective or any supplement or
amendment thereto has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order, of the
suspension or qualification of Parent Common Shares issued in connection with
the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of any request by the
SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments thereon and responses
thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. If, at any time
prior to the Effective Time, the Company or Parent discovers any information
relating to either party, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or
directors, that should be set forth in an amendment to either the Merger
Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement so that such document would not
contain any misstatement of material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party that discovers that information shall promptly notify
the other party and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
by law or regulation, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parent or Merger Sub shall acquire at
least 90% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer or otherwise, the parties hereto  



 

50  agree, subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted hereunder)
waiver of all conditions to the Merger, to take, or cause to be taken,
all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to be effective as
soon as reasonably practicable after the acceptance for payment or exchange of
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer without the Company
Stockholder Meeting. 

(d) Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent Circular
and the European Prospectus to be made publicly available as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Offer Registration Statement is declared
effective.

the Parties shall prepare and file any other filings required under the
Exchange Act, the Securities Act or any other federal or state securities Laws
relating to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (collectively, the " _Other Filings_ ").

(f) The Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause
the Schedule TO, the Schedule 14D-9, the Offer Registration Statement, the
Parent Circular, the European Prospectus, the Merger Registration Statement,
the Proxy Statement and the Other Filings to comply in all material respects
with all requirements of Laws. Whenever any event or circumstance occurs which
is required under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other Laws to be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Schedule TO, the Schedule 14D-9,
the Offer Registration Statement, the Parent Circular, the European
Prospectus, the Merger Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement or any
Other Filing, each Party shall promptly upon becoming aware thereof
inform the other of such occurrence and the relevant Party shall promptly
prepare an amendment, supplement or filing, as appropriate, accurately
describing such event or circumstance and provide the other Party reasonable
opportunity under the circumstances to review and comment, and cooperate in
filing with the SEC, its staff or any other Governmental Authority, and/or
mailing to stockholders of the Company, such amendment or supplement.

(g) Subject to Section 5.2(c), the Proxy Statement shall include the
Recommendation.

(a) If required by applicable Laws, the Company, acting through the Company
Board, shall, in accordance with applicable Laws, duly call, convene and hold
the Company Special Meeting, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
acceptance for payment or exchange of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant
to the Offer, for the purpose of voting upon this Agreement and the Merger,
and the Company agrees that this Agreement shall be submitted at such meeting.
The Company shall (i) take all action necessary to duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Special Meeting, (ii) subject to Section 5.2(c),
include in the Company Proxy Statement the Recommendation and (iii) use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Requisite Stockholder Approval.
The Company shall solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement and shall take all other action reasonably
necessary or advisable to secure the Company Requisite Stockholder Approval.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
the effectiveness of the Offer Registration Statement and the approval of the
European Prospectus by the AFM, Parent, acting through its Supervisory and/or
Managing Boards, shall (i) take all action necessary to duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a general meeting of its stockholders (such meeting,
including any adjournments or postponements, the " _Parent Stockholders
Meeting_ ") for the purposes of, among other things, obtaining the Parent
Requisite Stockholder Approval and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Parent Requisite Stockholder Approval.

6.3 _Access to Information; Confidentiality._

(a) Upon reasonable notice, during normal business hours and in a manner that
does not disrupt or interfere with business operations, Parent and the
Company shall (and shall cause each of their respective  



 

51  Subsidiaries to) afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and
other representatives of the other Party reasonable access, during the
Interim Period, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and
records and, during such period, furnish promptly to the other Party such
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other
Party may reasonably request. Parent and the Company shall make available to
the other, upon reasonable notice, during normal business hours and in a

6.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Assurances_.

(a) Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to satisfy
or cause to be satisfied all of the conditions precedent that are set forth in
Section 7, as applicable to each of them. Each Party, at the reasonable
request of the other, shall execute and deliver such other instruments and do
and perform such other acts and things as may be reasonably necessary and
consistent with this Agreement to effect the consummation of the Merger
and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Company and Parent agree
to use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to promptly consummate and make effective the Merger and other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using their respective
reasonable best efforts: (i) to effect all necessary registrations and filings
required by any Governmental Authority (in connection with which Parent and
the Company shall cooperate with each other in connection with the making of
all such registrations and filings, including providing copies of all such
documents to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to the time of such
filing and, if requested, will consider in good faith reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith) and (ii) to furnish to
each other such information and assistance as reasonably may be requested in
connection with the foregoing.

 

(c) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain all
consents, approvals, authorizations, and waivers of, and to give all notices
to, each third party that may be necessary for the performance of its
obligations under this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including obtaining all consents, approvals,
authorizations and waivers, and giving all notices listed in Section 3.4(c)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule; provided, however, that the Company shall
not amend or agree to amend, or waive any material right or material economic
benefit under, any Company Material Contract in connection with obtaining
such consents, approvals, authorizations and waivers without Parents prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed);
and provided, further, that, in connection with obtaining such consents,
approvals, authorizations and waivers, or the giving of such notices, the
Company shall not incur any out of pocket costs or any other obligation or
liability without Parents prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), unless such costs, obligation or liability
is _de minimis_ in nature.

(d) Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, in
connection with the efforts referenced in Section 6.4(b) to obtain all
requisite approvals and authorizations for the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement under the HSR Act, ECMR or any other applicable Antitrust Law,
use its reasonable best efforts to: (i) cooperate in all respects with each
other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party; (ii) keep the other Party reasonably informed of the status of
matters related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
furnishing the other with any written notices or other communications
received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the Federal Trade
Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the European Commission or any other Governmental
Authority and of any notices or other communications received or  



 

52  given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case
regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) permit
the other Party to review any communication given by it to, and consult with
each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or

private party, with any other person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC,
DOJ or such other applicable Governmental Authority or other person, give the
other Party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences in accordance with Antitrust Law. For purposes of this Agreement,
" _Antitrust Law_ " means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, the ECMR,
and all other federal, state and foreign, if any, statutes, rules,
regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines and other
Laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions
having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in Sections 6.4(b) and (d), each Party hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
applicable Antitrust Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in connection with any filing or submission required or action to
be taken by either Parent or the Company to consummate the Merger, in no event
shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates be obligated to propose
or agree to accept any material undertaking or condition, to enter into any
consent decree, to make any material divestiture or to accept any material
operational restriction.

(f) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Authority or a
private party challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, each
of the parties (i) shall cooperate with the others and use its respective
reasonable best efforts to defend, contest and resist any such action
or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any order
that is in effect (until all appeals are exhausted, if necessary) that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (ii) shall defend, at their costs and expense, any
action or actions, whether administrative or judicial, in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Section 6.4 shall limit a Partys right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 so long as such Party has up to then
complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section 6.4.

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
the Company shall not take any action, agree to take any action or consent to
the taking of any action pursuant to this Section 6.4 (including with respect
to selling, holding separate or otherwise disposing of assets or conducting
its business in a specified manner) without the prior written consent of
Parent.

(i) Parent has advised the Company that Parent intends to seek financing of a
portion of the aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration (" _Financing_ "). The
Parties agree that such Financing is not a condition to any Partys obligation
to effect the Merger and consummate the other transactions contemplated hereby
in accordance with this Agreement, and that Parent, NAH and Merger Sub shall
be required to proceed with the Closing notwithstanding Parents inability or
failure to obtain such Financing. The Company agrees that it will use its
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent in connection with Parents
preparation of offering materials in connection with the Financing (provided
that the Company shall not be required to assume any liability therefor).
Subject to consent by the Companys independent accountants, Parent may use
the Companys financial statements in connection with the Financing. In
connection therewith, in each case at Parents expense, the Company shall (i)
provide any source of Financing with access to the Companys books and
records and provide such party with such other information reasonably
requested for purposes of verifying the Companys financial statements
(subject to a confidentiality undertaking reasonably acceptable to
the Company, and upon reasonable notice, during normal business hours and in
a manner that does not disrupt or interfere with the Companys business
operations) and (ii) do such other acts and things, as shall be reasonably
requested by Parent or any source of Financing in connection with the  



 

53  same. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and each person
who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes
prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer or Representative of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, against all claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including
attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or relating to the Financing.

6.5 _IFRS Financials._ As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
hereof, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent such
financial information as may be required by the AFM, BaFin, Frankfurt Stock
Exchange and/or as reasonably requested by Parents German counsel, including

Reporting Standards ("IFRS"), in the form required by the AFM, BaFin,
Frankfurt Stock Exchange and/or as reasonably requested by Parents German

2003/71/EC (as further supplemented in the FMSA, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder).

their respective Subsidiaries upon and after the Effective Time ("
_Continuing Employees_ ") receive compensation and benefits that, in the
aggregate, are substantially similar to the compensation and benefits received
by such individuals immediately prior to the date hereof under applicable
Company Employee Plans or other applicable compensation arrangements provided
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The provisions of this Section
6.6(a) shall not create in any current or former employee of the Company or
its Subsidiaries any rights to employment or continued employment with the
Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

(b) Parent shall provide each Continuing Employee full credit for prior
service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or predecessors for
purposes of eligibility and vesting under any benefit plans, policies and
arrangements maintained by Parent or Surviving Company or their respective
Subsidiaries (" _Parent Plans_ ") to the same extent recognized under similar
plans or arrangements of the Company or such Subsidiary in which any such
Continuing Employee participated prior to and, to the extent applicable,
following, the Effective Time. Further, Parent shall provide each Continuing
Employee full credit for prior service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or predecessors for purposes of benefit accruals under Parent
Plan providing for vacation or severance benefits. Parent shall maintain the
group health plan (providing for group medical, vision and dental benefits)
currently maintained by the Company through December 31, 2008. In addition,
with respect to any group health plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, Parent shall waive, or cause
to be waived, any waiting periods and pre-existing condition limitations for
a Continuing Employee or a dependent of a Continuing Employee who is covered
under the Companys group health plan, but only to the extent such waiting
periods or pre-existing condition limitations were not otherwise
applicable under the Companys group health plan. Parent shall give
Continuing Employees credit towards any lifetime deductibles or limitations on
out of pocket expenses to the extent a Continuing Employee incurred the same
with respect to a Company Employee Plan and such deductibles or limitations
are applicable under the Parent Plan.

(c) The Company and Parent shall provide each other with such information as
may be reasonably requested and take such action as may be necessary or
appropriate to effect the matters set forth in this Section 6.6. All such
information and notices and schedules to be provided hereunder shall be true,
correct and complete as of the date provided.

(d) Parent shall take all reasonable actions to effectuate the terms and
conditions of this Section 6.6 including, without limitation, amending or
causing to be amended the Parent Plans.

Continuing Employees any rights or remedies (including, without limitation,
any right to employment or continued employment for any specified period) of
any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of the Agreement, or (ii)
obligate Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to maintain any particular employee benefit plan or limit the
ability of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to terminate or amend any of such employee benefit plan to the
extent permitted thereunder in accordance with their terms. None of the
provisions of this Agreement are intended to constitute an amendment to any
employee benefit plan and no Continuing Employee (or other party or person
which is not a signatory to this Agreement) shall have the right to enforce
or compel the enforcement of any provisions of this Section 6.6 or this
Agreement.

6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters._ The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, upon becoming
aware of (i) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which
occurrence or failure to occur would reasonably be expected to result in any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate such that the condition in Section 7.2(a) or 7.3(a) would not
be satisfied and (ii) any failure of the Company, Parent, NAH or Merger Sub,
as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder such that the
condition in Section 7.2(b) or 7.3(b) would not be satisfied; provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall
not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the Party
receiving such notice.

of the NGSM, or as provided elsewhere herein, prior to the Closing or the

representative) and purchase "tail" insurance coverage from the Companys
existing directors and officers liability insurers, or from other insurers,
that provides for a period of six (6) years that is substantially equivalent
to the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance program,
or if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is not available, the best
available coverage (" _D andO Tail Coverage_"); provided however that the
aggregate cost for the purchase of such DandO Tail Coverage (for the entire six
(6) year tail coverage period) shall not exceed more than 200% of the
aggregate premium paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries for the existing
directors and officers liability insurance program, provided, further,
that should the cost of DandO Tail Coverage exceed the 200% cap, Parent shall
instead purchase the best available coverage for 200% of the aggregate premium
paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries for the existing directors and
officers liability insurance program.



 

55 (b) Parent and the Surviving Company shall, until the sixth (6th) anniversary
of the Effective Time, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless,

of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "),
against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and
reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or by reason of the fact that the Indemnified
Party is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time, to the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL for officers and
directors of Delaware corporations.

Parent shall cause the Certificate of Formation and Operating Agreement to so
contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in
the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company, and such
commitments will be included and maintained in the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Company upon its conversion to a
corporation.

6.11 _Stockholder Litigation._ The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any
stockholder litigation brought, or threatened in writing, against the Company

The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense of

Company hereafter determines to be an Affiliate of the Company regarding

exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

6.15 _Tax Compliance._ Neither Parent nor NAH nor Company shall take or fail
to take (and, following the Merger, Parent shall cause NAH and Surviving
Company to take or not to fail to take) any action which action (or failure to

fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code or (ii) cause the Merger to fail to satisfy the requirements of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(i), (ii) or (iv) following the

(d) _Federal Tax Opinion._ Parent shall have received the opinion of its
counsel, Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C., in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, dated as of the Closing Date,
substantially to the effect that, on the basis of facts, representations and
assumptions set forth in such opinion that are consistent with the state of
facts existing at the Effective Time, the Offer and the Merger together will
be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. In rendering such opinion, counsel may require and rely upon customary
representations contained in certificates of the Company, NAH and Parent and
of their officers, directors and principal stockholders as are customary for
such opinions.

7.3 _Additional Conditions to Obligations of the Company._ The obligation of
the Company to effect the Merger is also subject to the following conditions,
any and all of which may be waived in writing by the Company, in whole or in
part:

(a) _Representations and Warranties._ Each of the representations and
warranties of Parent set forth in Section 4.3 shall be true and correct in all
material respects and (ii) each of the other representations and warranties of
Parent contained in this Agreement (disregarding all qualifications and
exceptions contained therein regarding materiality or a Parent Material
Adverse Effect or any similar standard or qualification) shall be true and
correct except to the extent that all failures of such representations and
warranties to be so true and correct (disregarding all qualifications and
exceptions contained therein regarding materiality or a Parent Material
Adverse Effect or any similar standard or qualification), individually or in
the aggregate, have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, in each case of clauses (i) through (ii) above
as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as if made at and
as of such time (except for representations and warranties made only as of a
specified date, which shall be true and correct only as of the specified
date). Company shall have received a certificate to such effect signed on
behalf of Parent by the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer of
Parent.

(b) _Agreements and Covenants._ Parent, NAH and Merger Sub shall have
performed or complied in all material respects with all agreements and
covenants required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by them
on or prior to the Closing Date, and the Company shall have received a
certificate to such effect signed on behalf of Parent by the Chief Executive
Officer or Chief Financial Officer of Parent.

(c) _Federal Tax Opinion._ The Company shall have received the opinion of its
counsel, Ballard Spahr Andrews and Ingersoll, LLP, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, dated as of the Closing Date, substantially
to the effect that, on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions
set forth in such opinion that are consistent with the state of facts existing
at the Effective Time, (i) the Offer and the Merger together will be treated
as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii)
the exchange of Company Common Stock for Parent Common Shares will not result
in gain recognition to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to Section
367(a) of the Code. In rendering such opinion, counsel may require and rely
upon such representations contained in certificates of officers of the
Company, NAH and Parent and of their officers, directors and principal
stockholders as are customary for such opinions. Such opinion of counsel may
assume that any shareholder of the Company that is a U.S. person and a "five
percent transferee shareholder" as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii) will enter into a five-year gain recognition agreement
described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-8T.

(d) _Directors and Officers Insurance._ Parent shall have purchased the DandO
Tail Coverage in accordance with Section 6.10.



 

58 8\. TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

8.1 _Termination._ This Agreement may be terminated and the Offer, the Merger
and other Transactions may be abandoned prior to the Effective Time upon
written notice to the other Party, notwithstanding approval thereof by the
stockholders of the Company:

(a) by mutual written consent of the Parties;

(b) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the date that is 270 days from the date hereof (the
" _Termination Date_ "); provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 8.1(b) shall not be available to a Party whose
failure to fulfill any material obligation under this Agreement has been the
principal cause of, or resulted in, the failure of any condition of the Offer
or the Merger to have been satisfied on or before such date;

(c) by either Parent or the Company, if a Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued an order or taken any other action, in each
case, which has become final and non-appealable and which permanently
restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the acceptance for payment or
exchange of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer or the Merger;

(d) by either Parent or the Company, if, (i) the Offer shall have expired or
been terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement without Parent,
NAH or Merger Sub having accepted for payment or exchange any shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer or (ii) at the Parent Stockholders
Meeting the Parent Requisite Stockholder Approval shall not have been
obtained;

(e) by Parent if, at any time prior to the Acceptance Date (i) the Company
Board (or a duly authorized committee of the Company Board) shall have
withdrawn or modified the Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or
fails to include its recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger in the
Schedule 14D-9, (ii) the Company Board has failed to reaffirm
the Recommendation within 3 Business Days after Parent has requested in
writing that it do so at any time when a Competing Proposal shall have been
publicly proposed and not rejected by the Company Board, provided that such 3
Business Day period shall be extended for 3 Business Days following any
material modification of such Competing Proposal occurring after the receipt
of Parents written request, (iii) the Company Board (or a duly authorized
committee of the Company Board) shall have recommended to the Company
stockholders that they approve or accept a Competing Proposal or (iv) the
Company shall have breached any of its obligations under Section 5.2(b), (c)
or (d), or Section 6.2;

(f) by Parent, if neither Parent, NAH nor Merger Sub is in material breach of
its obligations under this Agreement, and if, at any time prior to the
Acceptance Date, (i) there has been a breach of any of the representations and
warranties of the Company herein, which breach would cause the condition set
forth in Section 7.2(a) not to be satisfied, or (ii) there has been a breach
on the part of the Company of any of its covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement, which breach would cause the condition in Section 7.2(b) not
to be satisfied, and, in both case (i) and case (ii), such breach
(if curable) has not been cured within 30 days after notice thereof to the
Company by Parent, provided such cure period shall not extend beyond the
period set forth in Section 8.1(b);

(g) by the Company, if it is not in material breach of its obligations under
this Agreement, and if, at any time prior to the Acceptance Date, (i) there
has been a breach of any of the representations and warranties of Parent, NAH
or Merger Sub herein, which breach would cause the condition set forth in
Section 7.3(a) not to be satisfied, or (ii) there has been a breach on the
part of Parent, NAH or Merger Sub of any of their respective covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach would cause the condition
in Section 7.3(b) not to be satisfied, and, in both case (i) and case (ii),
such breach (if curable) has not been cured within thirty (30) days after
notice thereof to Parent from the Company, provided such cure period shall not
extend beyond the period set forth in Section 8.1(b);

(h) by the Company, if, at any time prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company
Board shall have approved or recommended a Competing Proposal; provided,
however, that this Agreement may not be so  



 

59  terminated unless (i) the Company Board shall have complied in all material
respects with the procedures set forth in Sections 5.2(c) and (d) and (ii)
all of the payments required by Section 8.3 as a result of the operation of
this paragraph (h) have been made in full to Parent; or

(i) by Parent or the Company, if with respect to antitrust matters, HSR
approval has not been obtained before the expiration of 120 days after the
date of the HSR filing; provided, however, that such 120 day period shall be
extended for an additional 120 day period in the event that facts and
circumstances existing at such time indicate that there is a reasonable
possibility that HSR approval will be obtained within such additional 120 day
period with the cooperation in good faith of both Parent and the Company in
pursuing such approval.

8.2 _Effect of Termination._ Except as provided in this Section 8.2, in the
event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this
Agreement (other than this Section 8.2 and Sections 6.3(b), 6.8, and 8.3, each
of which shall survive such termination) will forthwith become void, and
there will be no liability on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or
any of their respective officers or directors to the other, and all rights and
obligations of any Party will cease, except that nothing herein will relieve
any Party from liability for any willful breach, prior to termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement.

8.3 _Fees and Expenses._

(a) Except as set forth in this Section 8.3 and in Sections 6.4(i) and 6.5,
all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such
fees and expenses, whether or not the Offer or the Merger is consummated;
provided, however, that Parent shall pay all fees and expenses, other than
accountants and attorneys fees, incurred in relation to the printing,
mailing and filing of the Proxy Statement (including financial statements and
exhibits) and any amendments or supplements thereto and all filing fees
payable in connection with filings made under any Antitrust Laws or any other
Law.

(b) In the event that Parent or the Company, as the case may be, terminates
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(d) following the
public announcement of a Competing Proposal and within 12 months after the
date of such termination the Company enters into an agreement with respect to
any Competing Proposal or such Competing Proposal is consummated, then the
Company shall pay the Termination Fee to Parent, simultaneously with the
execution of the agreement with respect to such Competing Proposal, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by Parent. 

(c) In the event that Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(e) or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h),
then the Company shall pay to Parent, simultaneously with such termination of
this Agreement, the Termination Fee, which Termination Fee shall be payable by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by
Parent.

(d) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(g), then Parent
shall pay to the Company the Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account specified by the Company not later than two
Business Days after the effective date of such termination.

(e) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(f), then the
Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account specified by Parent not later than
two Business Days after the effective date of such termination.

(f) Payment of the fees and expenses described in this Section 8.3 shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties in connection with any
termination of this Agreement, other than as a result of any willful breach
by any Party.

9\. GENERAL PROVISIONS

9.1 _Amendment._ This Agreement may be amended by the Parties by action taken
by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to
the Closing; provided, however, that, after approval of the Merger by the
stockholders of the Company, no amendment may be made which would require
stockholder approval unless such approval is obtained. This Agreement may not
be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by all of the Parties. 



 

60 9.2 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, Parent, NAH and Merger Sub, on
the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may extend the time for the
performance of any of the others obligations or other acts required
hereunder, waive any inaccuracies in the others representations and
warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and
waive compliance with any of the others agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument signed by the Party to be bound thereby. 

9.3 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement shall terminate at the Closing; provided,
however, this Section 9.3 shall in no way limit any covenant or agreement of
the Parties which by its terms contemplates performance after the Closing.

9.4 _Notices_. All notices or other communications which are required or
permitted hereunder shall be in writing and sufficient if
delivered personally or sent by nationally-recognized overnight courier or by

9.5  _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections, subsections, Schedules or Exhibits, such reference shall be to a
Section, subsection, Schedule or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein
shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation."
The word "herein" and similar references mean, except where a specific
Section or Section reference is expressly indicated, the entire Agreement
rather than any specific Section or Section. The table of contents and the
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
References in this Agreement to a contract or agreement mean such contract or
agreement as amended or otherwise modified from time to time. References in
this Agreement to a Law include any rules, regulations and delegated
legislation issued thereunder.

9.6 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

9.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including all exhibits and schedules
hereto), and other documents and instruments delivered in connection herewith
constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
undertakings (other than the Confidentiality Agreement), both written and
oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

9.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned by operation of Law or
otherwise, except that Merger Sub may assign all or any of its rights
hereunder to another wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, provided that no such
assignment shall relieve Parent, NAH or Merger Sub of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon, and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by, the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns. 

9.9 _Parties in Interest_. Except as set forth in Section 6.10(a) and Section
6.10(b), this Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer
upon any person who is not a Party hereto any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

9.10 _Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. No failure or
delay on the part of any Party in the exercise of any right hereunder will
impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any
breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor will any
single or partial exercise of any such right preclude other or further
exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and remedies existing under
this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive to, and not exclusive of,
any rights or remedies otherwise available.

9.11 _Governing Law; Enforcement_. This Agreement and the rights and duties
of the Parties hereunder shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the law of the State of New York (except to the extent to which, under
the internal affairs doctrine as applied under New York law, the DGCL applies
by reason of being the Law of the Companys and/or Merger Subs state of
organization). The Parties agree that irreparable damage  



 

62  would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
In addition, each of the Parties: (a) consents to submit itself to the
exclusive personal jurisdiction of the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York, in the event of any dispute related to or arising out
of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby; (b) agrees not to
commence any action, suit or proceeding related to or arising out of this
Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby except in such courts; (c)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court; (d) waives any right
to trial by jury with respect to any action related to or arising out of this
Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby and (e) consents to service
of process by delivery pursuant to Section 9.4 hereof.

9.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different Parties in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

9.13 _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement, unless the context
otherwise requires, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

(a) _Acceptance Date_. "Acceptance Date" means the date on which Parent, NAH

applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under
the Exchange Act (relating to Parents, NAHs or Merger Subs, as applicable,

withdrawal of the Offer), pay for, and may delay the acceptance for payment
of or, subject to the restriction referred to above, the payment for, any

recognized tax counsel reasonably acceptable to the Company) to the effect
that the Offer and the Merger together will constitute a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (the " _Company 368 Opinion_ ")
(which opinion may rely on such assumptions and representations as such
counsel reasonably deems appropriate), such Company 368 Opinion shall have
been withdrawn or an event shall have occurred that prevents Company from

waived by the Company in its sole discretion, (f) Parent shall not have

meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (the " _Parent 368 Opinion_ ") (which
opinion may rely on such assumptions and representations as such counsel
reasonably deems appropriate), such Parent 368 Opinion shall have been
withdrawn or an event shall have occurred that prevents Parent from relying on

effectively to exercise full rights of ownership of one hundred
percent (100%) of the Shares, including, without limitation, the right to
vote the Shares purchased by them on all matters properly presented to the
Companys stockholders on an equal basis with all other stockholders
(including, without limitation, the adoption of the Agreement and approval of
the Merger), (C) restrains, enjoins, prevents, prohibits or makes illegal, or

(i) above;

(iii)(A) there shall have occurred any events or changes that, individually or

Material Adverse Effect or (B) (1) the Company shall have breached or failed
to perform in any material respect its obligations, covenants or agreements
under the Agreement, (2) the representations and warranties of the Company

contained in the Agreement shall not have been true and correct (disregarding
all qualifications and exceptions contained therein regarding materiality or a
Company Material Adverse Effect or any similar standard or qualification) when
made or as of the Acceptance Date as if made at or as of such time (other
than representations and warranties which by their terms address matters only
as of another specified date, which shall be true and correct only as of such
date) except in the case of this clause (3) only, for such inaccuracies as
have not resulted, or are not reasonably likely to result, individually or in
the aggregate, in a Company Material Adverse Effect;

(iv) the Company Board shall have withdrawn or modified, in any manner (other
than non-substantive modifications), its approval or recommendation of the

circumstances giving rise to such conditions or may be waived by Parent, NAH
or Merger Sub, in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in the
sole discretion (except as provided in Section 1.1(b)(y) of the Agreement) of
Parent, NAH and Merger Sub. The failure by Parent, NAH or Merger Sub at
any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights will not be deemed a waiver
of any right, the waiver of such right with respect to any particular facts or
circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts or
circumstances, and each right will be deemed an ongoing right which may be
asserted at any time and from time to time prior to the expiration of the
Offer.

If the Offer is terminated, all tendered Shares not theretofore accepted for
payment shall forthwith be promptly returned to the tendering stockholders.
