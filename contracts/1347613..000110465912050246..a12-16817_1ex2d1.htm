Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are
subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under

to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, Synergy is entitled to
exercise any such repurchase option or other right set forth in any such
restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement.

 



 

(b) _Assumption of Callisto Preferred Stock_. Each share of Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Callisto ("
_Callisto Preferred Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the

purchase Callisto Common Stock then outstanding under (A) any stock option
plan of Callisto, all of which are identified in _Section 2.3(a)_ (the "

into Synergy Common Stock or Callisto Common Stock), extraordinary cash
dividends, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Synergy Common Stock

be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof, each holder of shares
of Callisto Common Stock and Callisto Preferred Stock who would otherwise be
entitled to a fraction of a share of Synergy Common Stock (after aggregating
all fractional shares of Synergy Common Stock that otherwise would be received
by such holder) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive one
full additional share of Synergy Common Stock.

 



 

1.7 _Share Issuance Process_.

 



 

(a) _Synergy to Provide Common Stock_. Promptly following the Effective Time,
Synergy shall make available for delivery in accordance with this _Article
I_, the shares of Synergy Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 1.6_
hereof. Such shares shall be issuable in accordance with stock register of
Callisto as of the Effective Time, to each holder of record as of such time
(other than holders of Dissenting Shares). Physical stock certificates of
Callisto Common Stock and Callisto Preferred Stock shall not be required to be
exchanged for Synergy Common Stock certificates and shall be deemed to be
automatically issuable in exchange for outstanding shares of Callisto Common
Stock and Callisto Preferred Stock. All shares of Callisto Common Stock and
Callisto Preferred Stock shall be deemed to no longer be issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time, subject to rights of holders of
Dissenting Shares as set forth below.

 



 

(b) _Transfers of Ownership_. If certificates representing shares of Synergy
Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that reflected on
CallistoÂ’s stock register, it will be a condition of the issuance thereof that
the persons requesting such exchange will have paid to Synergy or any agent
designated by it, any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of certificates representing shares of Synergy Common Stock in any
name other than that of the registered holder of Callisto Common Stock,
Callisto Preferred Stock, or established to the satisfaction of Synergy or any
agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
1.7_, neither Synergy nor any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder
of shares of Synergy Common Stock, Callisto Common Stock or Callisto Preferred
Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 



 

1.8 _No Further Ownership Rights in Callisto Common Stock_. All shares of
Synergy Common Stock issued in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Callisto Common Stock and Callisto Preferred Stock, and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Callisto Common Stock and Callisto Preferred Stock
which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, at any
time following the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this _Article I_.

 



 

1.9 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Synergy shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, certificates representing the
shares of Synergy Common Stock into which the shares of Callisto Common Stock
or Callisto Preferred Stock represented by such Certificates were converted
pursuant to _Section 1.6_ hereof.

 



 

1.10 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger
shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the
Code. The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization"
within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States
Income Tax Regulations. None of the parties hereto shall take any action that
would be reasonably expected to cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 



 

1.11 _Dissenting Shares_ **.** Notwithstanding anything contained herein,
the shares of Callisto Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by Callisto
Stockholders who did not vote in favor of the Merger and who comply with all
of the relevant provisions of Section 262 of Delaware Law (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into Synergy Common Stock, unless and until
such Callisto Common Stockholders shall have waived in writing or failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal
under Section 262 of Delaware Law; and any such Callisto Common Stockholder
shall have only such rights in respect of the Dissenting Shares owned by them
as are provided by Delaware Law. If any such Callisto Common Stockholder shall
have waived in writing or failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such right, such Callisto Common StockholderÂ’s Dissenting
Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have
become exchangeable, as of the Effective Time, for Synergy Common Stock
without any interest thereon. Callisto will promptly comply with its
obligations under Section 262 of the Delaware Law and will give Synergy prompt
notice of any demands and withdrawals of such demands received by Callisto for
appraisals of Dissenting Shares.

 



      
 

 



 

1.12 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time following
the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes and intent of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Callisto, the officers and
directors of Callisto shall take all such lawful and necessary action.

 



 

1.13 _Callisto Statements Regarding Synergy_. The parties acknowledge that
Callisto filed consolidated financial statements that include the financial
results of Synergy; however the intent of this Agreement is for Callisto to
provide representations and warranties on all information in its possession
other than information specific to Synergy that it would obtain from Synergy.
Therefore, all references throughout this Agreement to "Callisto," "Callisto
and it subsidiaries," "Callisto or its subsidiaries" and/or "Callisto nor any
of its subsidiaries" shall be references to Callisto and all of its
subsidiaries other than Synergy and any references to predecessor shall be

as promptly as practicable after such filing. Callisto and Synergy shall cause

officials and of any request by the SEC or its staff or any other government
officials for amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any Other Filing, or for additional information
and shall supply the other with copies of all correspondence between such
party or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff

Offer in accordance with _Section 5.2(c)_ hereof.

 



 

5.2 _Meeting of Callisto Stockholders_.

 



 

(a) Promptly after the date hereof, Callisto shall take all action necessary
in accordance with Delaware Law and its Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws to convene a meeting of the stockholders of Callisto (the " _Callisto
Stockholders Â’ Meeting_") to be held as promptly as practicable, and in any
event (to the extent permissible under Delaware Law and the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of Callisto) within forty-five (45) calendar days,
following the declaration of effectiveness of the Registration Statement, for
the purpose of voting upon this Agreement and the Merger. Subject to the terms
of _Section 5.2(c)_ hereof, Callisto shall use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption and approval of
this Agreement and the approval of the Merger, and shall take all other action
necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of its stockholders
required by Delaware Law to obtain such approvals. Callisto may adjourn or
postpone Callisto StockholdersÂ’ Meeting (i) if and to the extent necessary to
ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is provided to CallistoÂ’s stockholders in advance of a
vote on this Agreement and the Merger, or (ii) if, as of the time for which
Callisto StockholdersÂ’ Meeting is

 



      
 

 



 

originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus), there
are insufficient shares of Callisto Common Stock represented (either in person
or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of
Callisto StockholdersÂ’ Meeting. Callisto shall ensure that Callisto
StockholdersÂ’ Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and
that all proxies solicited by Callisto in connection with Callisto
StockholdersÂ’ Meeting are solicited, in compliance with Delaware Law, and the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Callisto, and all other applicable
legal requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, CallistoÂ’s obligation to call, give notice of, convene and hold
Callisto StockholdersÂ’ Meeting in accordance with this _Section 5.2(a)_ shall
not be limited to or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure,
announcement or submission to Callisto of any Acquisition Proposal (as defined
below), or by any withholding, withdrawal, amendment, modification or change
of the recommendation of the Board of Directors of Callisto with respect to
this Agreement and/or the Merger.

 



 

(b) Unless the Board of Directors of Callisto shall have withheld, withdrawn,
amended, modified or changed its recommendation of this Agreement and the
Merger in compliance with _Section 5.2(c)_ hereof, (i) the Board of Directors
of Callisto shall recommend that CallistoÂ’s stockholders vote in favor of and
adopt and approve this Agreement and approve the Merger at Callisto
StockholdersÂ’ Meeting; (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include a
statement to the effect that the Board of Directors of Callisto has
recommended that CallistoÂ’s stockholders vote in favor of and adopt and
approve this Agreement and approve the Merger at Callisto StockholdersÂ’
Meeting; and (iii) neither the Board of Directors of Callisto nor any
committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw, amend, modify, change or propose
or resolve to withhold, withdraw, amend, modify or change in a manner adverse
to Synergy, the recommendation of the Board of Directors of Callisto that
CallistoÂ’s stockholders vote in favor of and adopt and approve this Agreement
and approve the Merger.

 



 

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors of Callisto
from withholding, withdrawing, amending, modifying or changing its
recommendation in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement or in
favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement and approval of the
Merger if (i) a Superior Offer (as defined below) is made to Callisto and is
not withdrawn, (ii) neither Callisto nor any of its representatives shall have
violated the terms of _Section 5.7_ hereof and Callisto is not then in
material breach of this Agreement and (iii) the Board of Directors of Callisto
reasonably concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside
counsel, that, in light of such Superior Offer, the withholding, withdrawal,
amendment, modification or changing of such recommendation is required in
order for the Board of Directors of Callisto to comply with its fiduciary
obligations to CallistoÂ’s stockholders under Delaware Law with respect to such
Superior Offer; _provided, however_ , that prior to publicly withholding,
withdrawing, amending, modifying or changing its recommendation in favor of
the adoption and approval of this Agreement and approval of the Merger,
Callisto shall have given Synergy at least five (5) business days prior
written notice (or such lesser prior notice as provided to the members of
CallistoÂ’s Board of Directors) thereof and the opportunity to meet with
Callisto and its counsel. Nothing contained in this _Section 5.2_ shall limit
CallistoÂ’s obligation to hold and convene Callisto StockholdersÂ’ Meeting
(regardless of whether the recommendation of the Board of Directors of
Callisto shall have been withheld, withdrawn, amended, modified or changed
pursuant hereto). For all purposes of and under this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement, the term " _Superior Offer_ " shall mean any bona fide, unsolicited
written Acquisition Proposal (as defined in _Section 5.5(b)_ hereof) on terms
that the Board of Directors of Callisto determines in the good faith exercise
of its reasonable judgment, on the basis of the advice of a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation and taking into account all the terms and
conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, are more favorable and provide greater
value to CallistoÂ’s stockholders from a financial point of view than the terms
of the Merger; _provided, however_ , that any such offer shall not be deemed
to be a "Superior Offer" pursuant hereto if any financing required to
consummate the transaction contemplated by such offer is not committed and is
not likely, in the judgment of the Board of Directors of Callisto, to be
obtained by such third party on a timely basis.

 



 

5.3 _Meeting of Synergy Stockholders_.

 



 

(a) Promptly after the date hereof, Synergy shall take all action necessary in
accordance with Delaware Law and its Second and Amended Restated Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws of Synergy to convene a meeting of the
stockholders of Synergy (the " _Synergy Stockholders Â’ Meeting_") to be held
as promptly as practicable, and in any event (to the extent permissible under
Delaware Law and the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Synergy)
within forty-five (45) calendar days, following the declaration of
effectiveness of the Registration Statement, for the purpose of voting upon
this Agreement and the Merger. Synergy shall use its reasonable best efforts
to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption and approval
of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger, and shall take all other
action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of its
stockholders required by Delaware Law to obtain such approvals. Synergy may
adjourn or postpone Synergy StockholdersÂ’ Meeting (i) if and to the extent
necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is provided to SynergyÂ’s stockholders in advance of a
vote on this Agreement and the Merger, or (ii) if, as of the time for which
Synergy StockholdersÂ’ Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus), there are insufficient shares of Synergy Common
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of Synergy StockholdersÂ’ Meeting. Synergy
shall ensure that Synergy StockholdersÂ’ Meeting is called, noticed, convened,
held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited by Synergy in connection
with Synergy StockholdersÂ’ Meeting are solicited, in compliance with Delaware
Law, and the Second and Amended Restated Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of Synergy, and all other applicable legal requirements.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
SynergyÂ’s obligation to call, give notice of, convene and hold SynergyÂ’s
StockholdersÂ’ Meeting in accordance with this _Section 5.3(a)_ shall not be
limited to or otherwise affected by any withholding, withdrawal, amendment,
modification or change of the recommendation of the Board of Directors of
Synergy with respect to this Agreement and/or the Merger.

 



 

(b) The Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include a statement to the effect
that the Board of Directors of Synergy has recommended that SynergyÂ’s
stockholders vote in favor of and adopt and approve this Agreement and approve
the Merger at Synergy StockholdersÂ’ Meeting; and (ii) neither the Board of
Directors of Synergy nor any committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw,
amend, modify, change or propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, amend,
modify or change in a manner adverse to Synergy, the recommendation of the
Board of Directors of

 



      
 

 



 

Synergy that SynergyÂ’s stockholders vote in favor of and adopt and approve
this Agreement and approve the Merger.

applicable, to obtain all information concerning the business of such company,
including, without limitation, the status of its product development efforts,
properties, results of operations and personnel, as Synergy or Callisto may
reasonably request. ** **No information or knowledge obtained by Synergy or
Callisto during the course of any investigation conducted pursuant to this

representation or warranty contained herein or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger contained herein.

 



 

5.5 _No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) During the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to its terms and the Effective Time, Callisto and its subsidiaries

respect to any Acquisition Proposal, except as to the existence of these
provisions, (iv) subject to the terms of _Section 5.2(c)_ hereof, approve,
endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, or (v) enter into any letter of
intent or similar document or any contract agreement or commitment
contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Proposal; _provided,
however_ , that prior to the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the
approval of the Merger by the requisite vote of the stockholders of Callisto,
the terms of this _Section 5.5(a)_ shall not prohibit Callisto from
furnishing information regarding Callisto or any of its subsidiaries to, or
entering into a confidentiality agreement or discussions or negotiations with,
any person or group in response to a Superior Offer submitted by such person
or group (and not withdrawn) if (1) neither Callisto nor any representative of
Callisto and its subsidiaries shall have violated any of the restrictions set
forth in this _Section 5.5_, (2) the Board of Directors of Callisto concludes
in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that such
action is required in order for the Board of Directors of Callisto to comply

to any Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the parties hereto understood and agree that any violation of the restrictions
set forth in this _Section 5.6(a)_ by any officer, director or employee of
Callisto or any of its subsidiaries or any investment banker, attorney or
other advisor or representative of Callisto or any of its subsidiaries shall
be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.5_(a) by Callisto. In addition to
the foregoing, Callisto shall (i) provide Synergy with at least forty-eight
(48) hours prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as provided to the
members of the Board of Directors of Callisto, but in no event less than

any person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder) beneficially owning five percent (5%) or
more of the total outstanding voting securities of Callisto or any of its
subsidiaries, or any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar

necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, using
reasonable efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all
reasonable actions necessary to cause the conditions precedent set forth in
_Article VI_ hereof to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary
actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations
from Governmental Entities, and the making of all necessary registrations,

material limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their businesses
or to own or exercise control of such assets, properties and stock.

any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
under this Agreement, in each case, such that the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.3(a)_ or _Section 6.3(b)_ hereof would not be satisfied,
_provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of Callisto, or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

satisfied, _provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of Synergy, or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

Synergy and Callisto shall each use its respective commercially reasonable
best efforts to obtain any consents, waivers and approvals under any of its or
its subsidiariesÂ’ respective agreements, contracts, licenses or leases
required to be obtained in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

as would be issuable pursuant to the Exchange Ratio, with a pro rata
