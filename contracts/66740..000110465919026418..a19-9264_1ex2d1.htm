This STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of May 1, 2019,
is by and among Acelity L.P. Inc., a limited partnership registered in
Guernsey (registered number: 1545) with its registered office at PO Box 656,
East Wing, Trafalgar Court, Les Banques, St Peter Port, Guernsey GY1 3PP,
acting by its general partner Chiron Guernsey GP Co. Limited, a non-cellular
company limited by shares incorporated in Guernsey (registered number: 54155)
with its registered office at PO Box 656, East Wing, Trafalgar Court, Les
Banques, St Peter Port, Guernsey GY1 3PP (" _Seller_ "), Acelity, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Seller (the " _Company_
"), and 3M Company, a Delaware corporation (" _Buyer_ "). Each of Seller and
Buyer are collectively referred to from time to time herein as the " _Parties_
," and each, individually, as a " _Party_." Certain capitalized terms used
herein have the respective meanings set forth in _Annex A_ attached hereto.

 



 

 **RECITALS:**

 



 

WHEREAS, Seller owns 100% of the outstanding shares of the capital stock (the
" _Common Stock_ ") of the Company;

 



 

WHEREAS, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, Seller
desires to sell to Buyer, and Buyer desires to acquire, all of the shares of
Common Stock owned by Seller;

 



 

WHEREAS, in connection with such sale and acquisition, Seller and the Company
desire for Seller to assign certain contractual rights and obligations to the
Company and for the Company and Seller to settle certain obligations of Seller
to the Company, and for such assignments and settlement to be made by way of
an exchange of such rights and obligations in redemption of Common Stock held
by Seller prior to such sale; and

 



 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement, each of
the Selling Sponsors has executed and delivered to Buyer a letter agreement
pursuant to which such Selling Sponsor has agreed to, among other things,
certain confidentiality restrictions, in furtherance of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Letter Agreements_ ").

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, intending to be legally
bound, the parties hereby agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I**

 



 

 **PURCHASE AND SALE; CLOSING**

 



 

 **SECTION 1.1** **_Purchase and Sale_**.

 



 

(a) _Purchase and Sale of the Transferred Shares_. Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller will
sell, assign, transfer and convey to Buyer, and Buyer will purchase and
acquire, all of the Common Stock owned by Seller (the " _Transferred Shares_
"), free and clear of all Liens (other than Liens imposed under applicable
securities Laws or Liens created by or resulting from actions of Buyer).

     

 

 



 

(b) _Purchase Price_. In consideration for the sale and transfer of the
Transferred Shares, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, Buyer will pay the Purchase Price in the manner described
herein.

 



 

(c) _Closing S_ _t_ _atement_. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a statement (the " _Closing
Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail (i) Sellers good faith
estimates of, as of the Closing, (A) the amount of Leakage and (B) the
Transaction Expense Amount (setting forth (x) the amount of each Transaction
Expense and (y) with respect to each non-compensatory Transaction Expense, the
corresponding wiring information for the account of each relevant Person for
payment of such non-compensatory Transaction Expense at Closing pursuant to
_Section_ _ _ _1.4(d)_ ), together with reasonable supporting documentation
with respect to the calculation of such amounts, and (ii) a schedule of (A)
each Company SAR Award Holder and (B) the amount of consideration that each
Company SAR Award Holder would be entitled to receive upon the exercise of
such holders SAR Award as of immediately prior to the Closing, based on, for
purposes of calculating the amounts in this _clause_ ___(ii)(B)_ , the
Purchase Price and taking into account dilution from the payment pursuant to
this _Section 1.1(c)_ of all outstanding SAR Awards as of such time, but
without taking into account _Section 1.6_ (such amount with respect to each
Company SAR Award Holder, the " _Closing Date SAR Consideration_ ", and the
sum of (x) the aggregate Closing Date SAR Consideration with respect to all
Company SAR Award Holders, collectively, plus (y) the employer portion of any
Taxes payable in connection therewith, being referred to herein as the "
_Aggregate Closing Date SAR Payment_ "). The Closing Statement shall be
accompanied by a schedule showing Sellers method of calculating the items set
forth thereon. During the period between Sellers delivery of the Closing
Statement and the end of the Holdback Period, Seller shall (A) afford Buyer
through its Representatives (including its legal advisors and accountants)
reasonable access, upon reasonable advance notice during normal business
hours, to the books and records of Seller, the Company and its Subsidiaries as
and to the extent reasonably necessary for Buyer to confirm Sellers estimates
of the amount of Leakage and the Transaction Expense Amount, (B) make
available to Buyer, upon reasonable advance notice during normal business
hours, any employee of Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who was
involved in the preparation of the Closing Statement, and (C) provide Buyer
with any other documentation or information that is reasonably requested by
Buyer from Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to confirm the
Closing Statement, in each case at Buyers expense. If, during such five (5)
Business Day period prior to the Closing, Buyer disagrees with any portion of
the Closing Statement, Buyer may deliver notice of such disagreement to
Seller, and if any such notice is delivered, no later than two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, and Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in good
faith to resolve Buyers disagreements set forth in such notice and the
Closing Statement shall be updated for any items resolved by the Parties. If
Buyer and Seller fail to resolve any of Buyers disagreements, the Closing
Statement and the calculations therein as originally delivered by Seller (as
updated to reflect any items resolved by the Parties) shall be conclusive and
binding upon Buyer solely for purposes of determining the amounts payable by
Buyer at the Closing pursuant to _Section 1.4_. For the avoidance of doubt,
any failure by Buyer to deliver any notice of its disagreement with any
portion of the Closing Statement, or failure by Buyer to include in any such
notice a portion of the Closing Statement with which Buyer disagrees, shall
not affect, modify or otherwise prejudice in any way Buyers rights and
remedies under this Agreement, including pursuant to _Section 1.6_.

 



 

 **SECTION 1.2** **_Closing_**. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing
between Seller and Buyer, the closing

 



     

 

 



 

of the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place
at (a) the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue,
New York, New York, at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the fifth (5th) Business
Day following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ (such fifth (5th) Business Day, the " _Satisfaction Date_ ")
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions at the
Closing) or (b) such other date, time or place as agreed to in writing by
Seller and Buyer; _provided_ , that if the date that the Closing would
otherwise be required to occur pursuant to this _Section 1.2_ is either (i)
within five (5) Business Days before the last day of a calendar month or (ii)
in the last month of any fiscal quarter of Buyer, Buyer may elect (in its sole
discretion), following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth
in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing) but no later than three (3) Business Days prior to
the Satisfaction Date, to defer the Closing to the first Business Day of the
immediately following calendar month (such Business Day, the " _Deferred Date_
"), it being understood that if Buyer elects to so defer the Closing to the
Deferred Date, (x) Buyer shall be deemed to have irrevocably and
unconditionally waived each, and shall not assert the failure to be satisfied
or waived with respect to any, of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_
and _Section 7.2_ (other than (A) _Section 7.2(d)_, which condition by its
nature is to be satisfied at the Closing; provided that the certificate to be
delivered pursuant to clause (ii) of _Section 1.5(a)_ shall be delivered as
of the Satisfaction Date as if the Closing had been required to occur on the
Satisfaction Date (with references to the "Closing Date" therein deemed to be,
and replaced with references to, the " _Satisfaction Date_ ") and (B) as a
result of a Willful Breach by Seller or the Company, the condition in _Section
7.2(b)_) and Buyer shall be obligated to consummate the Closing on or prior to
such Deferred Date irrespective of, such conditions and (y) Buyer shall be
deemed to have irrevocably and unconditionally waived and Buyer shall not be
entitled to exercise, any right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)_, _Section 8.1(c)_ and, except as a result of a Willful
Breach by Seller or the Company, _Section 8.1(e)_. The date on which the
Closing actually occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

 



 

 **SECTION 1.3** **_Effect of the Closing on SAR Awards_**.

 



 

(a) At the Closing, each SAR Award that is outstanding and held by a Company
Employee or Company Independent Contractor as of immediately prior to the
Closing shall be automatically cancelled without any action on the part of any
holder thereof in consideration for the right of the holder to receive payment
of such holders Closing Date SAR Consideration (if any) pursuant to _Section
1.3(b)_; _provided_ , that if, pursuant to _Section 1.3(b)_, a Company SAR
Award Holder is not entitled to receive any Closing Date SAR Consideration
with respect to a SAR Award, then such SAR Award shall be cancelled without
any right to receive payment therefor.

 



 

(b) Within thirty (30) days following the delivery by Buyer to the Company of
an amount equal to the Aggregate Closing Date SAR Payment pursuant to _Section
1.4(b)_, the Company shall (or shall cause the applicable Subsidiary of the
Company to) pay to each Company SAR Award Holder such holders Closing Date
SAR Consideration as set forth in the Closing Statement, through its payroll
(or the payroll of the applicable Subsidiary).

 



 

 **SECTION 1.4** **_Payments at Closing_**. At the Closing, Buyer will pay
(or cause to be paid) by wire transfer of immediately available funds:

 



 

(a) to Seller, an amount equal to (i) the excess of (A) the Purchase Price
over (B) the Holdback Amount (such excess amount, the " _Closing Purchase
Price_ "), minus (ii) the

 



     

 

 



 

Aggregate Closing Date SAR Payment, to the account(s) designated by Seller in
writing at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date;

 



 

(b) to the Company, an amount equal to the Aggregate Closing Date SAR Payment,
to the account(s) designated by the Company in writing at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date;

 



 

(c) to those Persons that are holders of Funded Indebtedness, on behalf of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, all amounts necessary to discharge fully the
then outstanding balance (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any accrued
and unpaid interest and premium thereon) of the Funded Indebtedness of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the account(s) set forth in the Payoff Letter
or, with respect to the Notes Redemption Amount, to the account(s) designated
by the Trustee in writing at least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date (such amount, the " _Funded Indebtedness Amount_ ");

 



 

(d) to each Person, in each case to the account or accounts designated by such
Person, the amount of non-compensatory Transaction Expenses due and payable to
such person, as specified in writing by the Company at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date; and

 



 

(e) to the Company, an amount equal to the compensatory Transaction Expenses
due and payable to the Company Independent Contractors and Company Employees,
to the account(s) designated by the Company in writing at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, for the Company to pay (or to cause
the applicable Subsidiary of the Company to pay) to the Company Independent
Contractors and, through the Companys payroll (or the payroll of the
applicable Subsidiary), to the Company Employees.

shall be accompanied by a schedule showing Buyers method of calculating the
items set forth thereon.

 



 

(b) If, and only if, the Initial Holdback Payment Amount is a positive amount

each item or amount in dispute, along with reasonable detail of the basis
therefor, supporting documentation, schedules and calculations enabling Buyer
to calculate and review Sellers calculations, as well as Sellers proposed
calculation of the Holdback Payment Amount). Any determination set forth on
the Holdback Statement that is not objected to in the Objection Notice shall
be deemed acceptable and shall be conclusive and binding upon Buyer and Seller
upon delivery of the Objection Notice. If Seller does not deliver to Buyer the
Objection Notice within the Review Period, then Seller shall be deemed to have
irrevocably accepted the Holdback Statement and the Holdback Statement will be
conclusive and binding upon Buyer and Seller and (x) the Initial Holdback
Payment Amount set forth in the Holdback Statement shall become the Holdback
Payment Amount and (y) the date on which the Review Period expires shall
become the Settlement Date, in each case for purposes of this _Section 1.6_
and all other purposes under this Agreement. During the Review Period, Buyer
shall (A) afford Seller through its Representatives (including its legal
advisors and accountants) reasonable access, upon reasonable

 



     

 

 



 

advance notice during normal business hours, to the books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as and to the extent reasonably necessary for
Seller to confirm Buyers estimates of Recoverable Leakage, Recoverable
Transaction Expenses and the Initial Holdback Payment Amount, (B) make
available to Seller, upon reasonable advance notice during normal business
hours, any employee of Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who was
involved in the preparation of the Holdback Statement, and (C) provide Seller
with any other documentation or information that is reasonably requested by
Seller from Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to confirm the
Holdback Statement, in each case at Sellers expense.

 



 

(d) Following Buyers receipt of the Objection Notice, if any, Seller and
Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve Sellers objections therein. In
the event that Seller and Buyer fail to agree with respect to any of Sellers
objections set forth in the Objection Notice within thirty (30) days (or such
longer period as the Parties may mutually agree) after Buyer receives the
Objection Notice (the " _Resolution Period_ "), then Seller and Buyer shall
promptly (and, in any event no later than five (5) Business Days after the
final day of the Resolution Period) retain the Accounting Arbitrator
(including by executing a customary agreement with the Accounting Arbitrator
in connection with its engagement), who shall act as an expert (and not as an
arbitrator), and submit any unresolved objections covered by the Objection
Notice (the " _Disputed Items_ ") for resolution in accordance with this
_Section 1.6(d)_. The Accounting Arbitrator will be instructed to (A) make a
final determination on an expedited basis (and in any event within thirty (30)
days after submission of the Disputed Items (or such other time as the Parties
may mutually agree in writing)) with respect to each of the Disputed Items
(and only the Disputed Items) that is (1) consistent with the terms of this
Agreement, (2) within the range of the respective positions taken by each of
Seller and Buyer and (3) based solely on written submissions by Buyer and
Seller (i.e., not on the basis of an independent review) with respect to the
Disputed Items (and only the Disputed Items) to the Accounting Arbitrator no
later than fifteen (15) days (or such other time as the Parties may mutually
agree in writing) after submission of the Disputed Items to the Accounting
Arbitrator, and a presentation made by Buyer and Seller to the Accounting
Arbitrator no later than twenty (20) days after submission of the Disputed
Items (or such other time as the Parties may mutually agree in writing) to the
Accounting Arbitrator; and (B) prepare and deliver to Seller and Buyer a
written statement setting forth its final determination (and a reasonably
detailed description of the basis therefor) with respect to each Disputed Item
(the " _Accounting Arbitrator s Report_"). Seller and Buyer shall provide the
Accounting Arbitrator with such financial and other relevant information of
Seller and Buyer as the Accounting Arbitrator shall reasonably request for
purposes of making its final determination with respect to the Disputed Items,
and Seller and Buyer shall otherwise reasonably cooperate with the Accounting
Arbitrator in connection therewith. The Accounting Arbitrator shall not
conduct any additional discovery in any form, and the Accounting Arbitrator
shall be bound by a mutually agreeable confidentiality agreement, which shall
preserve the confidentiality of any proceeding before the Accounting
Arbitrator. All information (including answers to questions from the
Accounting Arbitrator) submitted by a Party to the Accounting Arbitrator must
be concurrently delivered to the other Party. Neither Buyer nor Seller, nor
any of their respective Representatives, will meet or discuss any substantive
matters with the Accounting Arbitrator without Buyer and Seller and their
respective Representatives present or having the opportunity following at
least three (3) Business Days advance written notice to be present, either in
person or by telephone. Each of Seller and Buyer agrees that (1) the
Accounting Arbitrators determination with respect to each Disputed Item as
reflected in the Accounting Arbitrators Report shall be deemed to be final,
conclusive, binding and non-appealable, (2) the Holdback Statement, as
modified by any changes thereto in accordance with the Accounting Arbitrators
Report, shall be deemed to be the Holdback

 



     

 

 



 

Statement for purposes of the payment (if any) contemplated by this _Section
1.6_, (3) the procedures set forth in this _Section 1.6_ shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy with respect to the final determination of the Holdback
Statement and (4) the Accounting Arbitrators determination under this
_Section 1.6_ shall be enforceable as an arbitral award, and judgment may be
entered thereupon in any court having jurisdiction over the Party against
which such determination is to be enforced, including pursuant to Article 76
of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules. The only defense of either
Seller or Buyer to such a request for enforcement or other legal action shall
be fraud by or upon the Accounting Arbitrator or manifest error. The date on
which the Holdback Payment Amount is finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 1.6_ (including in case of a failure by Seller to provide any
Objection Notice during the Review Period pursuant to _Section 1.6(c)_) shall
hereinafter be referred to as the " _Settlement Date_ ". All negotiations
pursuant to this _Section 1.6(d)_ through the end of the Resolution Period
shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of
Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and comparable state rules of
evidence. Except as may be required by applicable Law or court order, the
Parties agree to maintain confidentiality as to all aspects of any proceeding
before the Accounting Arbitrator, including its existence and results, except
that nothing herein shall prevent any Party from disclosing information
regarding such proceeding to a court of competent jurisdiction for purposes of
enforcing this _Section 1.6(d)_ or the Accounting Arbitrators final
determination.

 



 

(e) Each of Seller and Buyer shall (A) pay its own respective costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this _Section 1.6_ and (B) be
responsible for the fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator in
connection with this _Section 1.6_ on a pro rata basis based upon the inverse
of the degree (measured in dollars) to which the Accounting Arbitrator has
accepted the respective positions of Seller and Buyer (which shall be
determined by the Accounting Arbitrator and set forth in the Accounting
Arbitrators Report). For purposes of clarity, if the Accounting Arbitrator
determines that it accepted seventy percent (70%) of the respective position
of one Party, that Party shall pay thirty percent (30%) of the fees and
expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator and the other Party shall pay the
remaining seventy percent (70%) of such fees and expenses.

 



 

(f) If the Holdback Payment Amount as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 1.6_ is greater than the Initial Holdback Payment Amount:

 



 

(i) and the Initial Holdback Payment Amount was a positive amount (other than
zero), within five (5) Business Days following the Settlement Date, Buyer
shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to Seller an amount equal to the
excess of (X) Holdback Payment Amount as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 1.6_ over (Y) the Initial Holdback Payment Amount, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by Seller in
writing at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Settlement Date;

 



 

(ii) and the Initial Holdback Payment Amount was a negative amount (or equal
to zero) and the Holdback Payment Amount as finally determined pursuant to
this _Section 1.6_ is a positive amount (other than zero), within five (5)
Business Days following the Settlement Date, Buyer shall deliver (or cause to
be delivered) to Seller an amount equal to the Holdback Payment Amount as
finally determined pursuant to this _Section 1.6_ to the account(s)
designated by Seller in writing at least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Settlement Date; and

 



 

(iii) and the Initial Holdback Payment Amount was a negative amount (or equal
to zero) and the Holdback Payment Amount as finally determined pursuant to
this

 



     

 

 



 

 _Section 1.6_ is a negative amount, within five (5) Business Days following
the Settlement Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer, an amount equal to the
absolute value of the Holdback Payment Amount as finally determined pursuant
to this _Section 1.6_, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account(s) designated by Buyer in writing at least five (5) Business Days
prior to the Settlement Date.

 



 

(g) All payments pursuant to this _Section 1.6_ shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds. The Parties agree to treat any
payment made pursuant to this _Section 1.6_ as an adjustment to the Closing
Purchase Price for Tax purposes, and, except to the extent required by
applicable Law, the Parties agree not to take any position inconsistent with
such treatment on any Tax Return.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller shall
remain in existence from the Closing, and shall not take any action to cause
Seller to be dissolved, liquidated, terminated, canceled or otherwise cease to
exist prior to the later of (i) the fifth (5th) Business Day following Buyers
delivery of the Initial Holdback Payment Amount, and (ii) the payment in full
of all amounts required to be paid pursuant to this _Section 1.6_, including
_Section 1.6(e)_ and _Section 1.6(f)(iii)_.

 



 

 **SECTION 1.7** **_Withholding_**. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, and for the avoidance of doubt, (a) each payment made pursuant
to this Agreement may be made net of any Taxes required by applicable Law to
be deducted or withheld from such payment (and any compensatory payment shall
be subject to such netting), (b) any amounts deducted or withheld from any
such payment shall be properly remitted to the applicable Taxing Authority,
and (c) any amounts so deducted and withheld and properly remitted to the
applicable Taxing Authority shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such
withholding or deduction was made. Before any Person makes any deduction or
withholding pursuant to this _Section 1.7_, such Person shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (x) give reasonable advance notice to the
Person in respect of whom such deduction or withholding is made, (y) provide
such Person sufficient opportunity to provide any forms or other documentation
or take such other steps in order to avoid such deduction or withholding, and
(z) reasonably cooperate with such Person in good faith to attempt to reduce
any amounts that would otherwise be deducted or withheld pursuant to this
_Section 1.7_; provided, that the obligations described in (x), (y) and (z)
of this sentence shall not apply with respect to any deduction or withholding
from any compensatory payment.

 **SECTION 2.5** **_Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities_**.

 



 

(a) Set forth in _Section 2.5(a) of the Disclosure Schedules_ are correct and
complete copies of the audited consolidated balance sheets of Seller and its
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018 (the audited
consolidated balance sheet of Seller and its Subsidiaries as of December 31,
2018, the " _Latest Audited Balance Sheet_ "), and the related audited
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity,
and cash flows for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017
and December 31, 2018, respectively, and the condensed consolidating balance
sheets as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018 and the related condensed
consolidating statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), and cash
flows for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017, and
December 31, 2018, respectively, together with the notes thereto and the
auditors reports thereon (collectively, the " _Financial Statements_ ").

 



 

(b) The Financial Statements (A) have been prepared in all material respects
in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
covered thereby, except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and (B)
fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows of Seller and its Subsidiaries
as of the dates and for the periods referred to therein. Since December 31,
2018, there has been no material change in Sellers accounting methods or
principles that would be required to be disclosed in Sellers financial
statements in accordance with GAAP, except as described in the notes thereto.
There are no unconsolidated subsidiaries of Seller within the meaning of GAAP.
Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, an "off balance sheet arrangement" within the

their respective assets and liabilities that are accurate in all material
respects and (ii) systems of internal accounting controls that are designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the accurate recording of transactions
in the correct period in all material respects, the reliability of financial

external purposes in accordance with GAAP in all material respects and that
receipts and expenditures of Seller and its Subsidiaries are being made only
in accordance with authorization of management and directors of Seller and its
Subsidiaries and that are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized transactions, acquisition, use
or disposition of Sellers (or such Subsidiaries) assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements of Seller. There are no
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses (as defined by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board) in the design or operation of the internal
controls over financial reporting of Seller and its Subsidiaries, which
reasonably could adversely affect the ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial information of Seller and its Subsidiaries. Since January
1, 2013, Seller has not been, and to the Companys Knowledge, no director or
officer of Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has identified or
has been advised by any employee, the auditors or accountants of Seller, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any (i) material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective internal accounting controls, including any material
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Seller, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices
or (ii) fraud or allegation of fraud, whether or not material, by Seller, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Seller, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls.

 



 

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any Liability which
would be required to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (including any notes) prepared in accordance with
GAAP and the practices and methodologies used in the preparation of the Latest
Audited Balance Sheet, other than Liabilities (A) reflected on, reserved
against or otherwise described in the Latest Audited Balance Sheet, (B) that
have arisen since the date of the Latest Audited Balance Sheet in the ordinary
course of business of the Company and its Subsidiaries consistent with past
practice, (C) that arise out of or in connection with this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, (D) that do not relate to any breach of Contract, breach of warranty,
tort, infringement, misappropriation or violation of Law or (E) that would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect.

 



 

(e) The Financial Statements fairly present, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the dates and for the periods referred to therein
except as set forth in _Section 2.5(e) of the Disclosure Schedules_.

 



 

(f) _Section 2.5(f) _ _of the Disclosure Schedules_ sets forth a correct and
complete list of the individual and aggregate amounts of all Indebtedness of
the Company and its Subsidiaries including the outstanding principal and
accrued interest amounts, in each case, as of the date of the Latest Audited
Balance Sheet and as of March 31, 2019.

 



 

 **SECTION 2.6** **_Absence of Certain Changes_**.

 



 

(a) Since the date of the Latest Audited Balance Sheet through the date of
this Agreement, except as contemplated by this Agreement, the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries has been conducted in the ordinary course of

have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action that, if taken after the date
hereof without the consent of Buyer, would be prohibited from being taken by
clauses (ii), (iii), (vi), (vii), (x), (xi), (xii), (xiii), (xiv) (other than,
in the case of clause (xiv), (i) the making of any Tax election in a regularly
filed Tax Return which is the same as an election made in the same Tax Return
filed for the immediately prior Tax period or (ii) the filing of any amended
Tax Return, the entry into any closing agreement, or the agreement to any
extension or waiver of the statute of limitations, in each case that relates
to Taxes that are not income, profit or franchise Taxes), (xv), (xvi)(2),
(xvii), (xviii), (xx), (xxii) or, to the extent related to the foregoing
clauses, (xxvi) of _Section 5.1(a)_ without the consent of Buyer if such
action had been taken prior to the date hereof.

 



 

(d) Except as set forth in _Section 2.6_ _of the Disclosure Schedules_ ,
since the date of the Latest Audited Balance Sheet neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has incurred or experienced (nor has there been any
agreement or understanding to cause) any Leakage (other than Permitted
Leakage).

(a) There are no civil, criminal or administrative actions, claims, audits,
suits, hearings, arbitrations or mediations or other proceedings by or before
any Governmental Entity, arbitor or mediator (" _Proceedings_ ") or, to the
Companys Knowledge, investigations by or before any Governmental Entity,
arbitor or mediator (such investigations, together with any Proceedings, "
_Actions_ "), in each case, that are pending or, to the Companys Knowledge,
threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affecting any of
their respective properties, rights or assets that (x) seek material
equitable, declaratory or injunctive relief or (y) which, if adversely
determined against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) Since January 1, 2013, there have not been any Proceedings against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affecting any of their respective
properties, rights or assets which are no longer pending or being asserted
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that (x) seek material
equitable, declaratory or injunctive relief or (y) which, if adversely
determined against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (nor any of their
respective assets, rights or properties) is subject to any Order, and to the
Companys Knowledge, no such Order is threatened, except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



     

 

 



 

 **SECTION 2.8** **_Employee and Employee Benefits Matters_**.

this Agreement, including _Section 5.2(d)_, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate
with each other and use (and shall cause their respective controlled
Affiliates to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause
to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws to consummate
and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
reasonably practicable and no later than the Outside Date (it being understood
that, notwithstanding this _Section 5.2(a)_, the obligations of Buyer
pursuant to _Section 5.2(d)_ shall be subject to the timing specified
therein), including (i) preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all
documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and

Outside Date) all consents, registrations, approvals, permits and
authorizations necessary to be obtained from any Governmental Entity or other
third parties in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) giving all notices to all Persons required under any Company
Material Contract with respect to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) using their reasonable best efforts

Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that
would prevent the consummation of any such transaction by the Outside Date.
Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, Buyer and
Seller shall discuss with and permit the other Party (and its counsel) to
review in advance, and consider in good faith the views and comments of the
other in connection with any proposed filing, written materials or
communication to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the
foregoing rights, each of Seller and Buyer shall act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable.

 



 

(b) _Information_. Subject to applicable Laws, Seller and Buyer each shall,
upon request by the other, furnish the other as promptly as reasonably
practicable with all information concerning itself, its Affiliates, directors,
officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable in connection with any statement, filing,
notice or application made (or to be made) by or on behalf of Seller, Buyer or
any of their respective Affiliates to any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including under the HSR Act and any other applicable Antitrust

 



     

 

 



 

Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with the performance of each
Partys respective obligations pursuant to _Section 5.2(a)_ and _Section
5.2(d)_, Seller and Buyer may, as each determines is reasonably necessary,

this _Section 5.2(b)_ as "Legal Counsel Only"; _provided_ , _however_ , that
materials may also be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the
valuation of the Company, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or
other privilege or confidentiality concerns. Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the legal counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such legal counsel to directors,
officers or employees of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials (Seller or Buyer, as the case may
be) or its legal counsel.

 



 

(c) _Status_. Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, Seller and Buyer each shall keep the other apprised of
the status of matters relating to approvals of or investigations by any
Governmental Entity of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the

its controlled Affiliates, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity, on
the other hand, and (ii) furnishing the other with copies of all notices,

compliance with the HSR Act for each of Buyer and/or Seller and its
Affiliates, in each case, requesting early termination of the waiting period
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and (2) as promptly as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, any notification or other
form necessary to obtain any consents, clearances or approvals required under
or in connection with any other Antitrust Law listed in _Section 5.2(d)(i)(A)
of the Disclosure Schedules_; and

 



 

(B) as promptly as reasonably practicable or advisable respond to any
inquiries received from, and provide to each and every federal, state, local
or foreign court or Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over enforcement of
any applicable Antitrust Law (a " _Governmental Antitrust Entity_ ") any
additional non-privileged information and documents requested by any such
Governmental Antitrust Entity in connection with obtaining any such approval
of such Governmental Antitrust Entity that is necessary, proper or advisable
to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including as
promptly as reasonably practicable or advisable complying with or modifying
any requests for additional information (including any "second request" or
equivalent) by any Governmental Entity.

 



     

 

 



 

(ii) In addition to the foregoing, Buyer shall take, and cause its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates to take, any and all actions necessary to (A) make
any filings or obtain any consents, clearances or approvals required under or

under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity, and

hereby, in each case, to allow the Parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby prior to the Outside Date, including, without limiting the
foregoing, (1) proposing, offering, negotiating, committing to and effecting,
by consent decree, a hold separate Order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture,
license or other disposition of any and all of the capital stock, assets,
properties, rights, products, leases, businesses, services or other operations
or interests therein of the Company or Buyer or eithers respective
Subsidiaries, (2) otherwise taking or committing to take actions that after
the Closing Date would limit Buyers or the Companys freedom of action with
respect to, or its or their ability to retain, one or more of the assets,
properties, rights, products, leases, businesses, services or other operations
of the Company or Buyer or eithers respective Subsidiaries or any interest or
interests therein, and (3) contesting, defending and appealing any threatened
or pending preliminary or permanent injunction or other Order, decree or
ruling or statute, rule, regulation or executive Order that would adversely
affect the ability of any Party to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and taking any and all other actions to prevent the entry, enactment or
promulgation thereof (the actions contemplated by clauses (1) and (2) above, a
" _Remedy_ "), it being understood that, Seller shall, at Buyers written
request upon reasonable advance notice to Seller, use its reasonable best
efforts to cooperate with, and to take any action in support of, the actions
contemplated by _clauses (1)_ , _(2)_ and _(3)_ above, _provided_ , that
subject to Sellers other obligations under this _Section 5.2_, Seller shall
be under no obligation to agree to, or effect, any Remedy with respect to
itself or any of its Affiliates and that the absence of such obligations on
Seller in no way limits Buyers obligations hereunder.

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Buyer shall, on behalf
of the parties hereto, have control over and lead all communications and
strategy related to obtaining any consents, clearances or approvals required
under or in connection with the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law listed in
_Section 5.2(d)(i) of the Disclosure Schedules_ and in furtherance of the
foregoing, Buyer may, in its sole discretion, withdraw its initial filing
under the Antitrust Act or any other Antitrust Law, as the case may be, and
refile it, or extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Law or enter into any interim timing agreement with any Governmental
Entity not to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (but in no event
shall Buyer enter into any such interim timing agreement the expiration date
of which is later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Outside Date);
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall consult with and cooperate with
Seller, and permit Seller (and its counsel) to review in advance and consider
in good faith the views of Seller, relating to any written or substantive oral
communication made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party in connection
with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law, and shall furnish
Seller with the copy of any such written or substantive oral communication. To
the extent practicable, no Party will (and each Party will cause its
controlled Affiliates to not) participate in any substantive meeting,
telephone call, or discussion with any Governmental Antitrust Entity relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except for those related
to a Remedy) unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Antitrust Entity, gives the other Party
the opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

 



     

 

 



 

(iv) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing or the earlier
termination of this Agreement, each of Seller and Buyer shall not, and shall
not permit any of their respective Subsidiaries or controlled Affiliates to,
directly or indirectly, enter or agree to enter into any agreement to acquire,
whether by merger, consolidation, business combination, the purchase of assets
or equity or otherwise, any business or Person if such transaction could
reasonably be expected to (i) delay the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period in any material respect or delay in any material
respect the obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining, any
authorization, consent, clearance, approval or order of a Governmental Entity
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including any
approvals and expiration of waiting periods pursuant to the HSR Act or any
other applicable Law, (ii) increase the risk of any Governmental Entity
entering, or increase the risk of not being able to remove or successfully
challenge, any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other order,
decree, decision, determination or judgment that would delay in any material
respect or restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or (iii) otherwise delay or impede the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in any material respect.

 



 

(v) Nothing in this _Section 5.2_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
require any Party to take or agree to take any action with respect to their
business or operations or their Subsidiaries and their respective business or
operations prior to the Closing unless the effectiveness of such agreement or
action is conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing.

 



 

 **SECTION 5.3** **_Further Assurances_**. From time to time following the
Closing and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the Parties shall, and shall cause their respective controlled
Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and deliver all reasonable further
conveyances, notices (including any change of control notifications to any
Governmental Entity and revised information packages required by any
Governmental Entity), assumptions, releases and acquittances and such
instruments, and shall take such reasonable actions as may be necessary or
appropriate to make effective the transactions contemplated hereby as may be
reasonably requested by the other Party.

 



 

 **SECTION 5.4** **_Pre-Closing Access and Reports_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable advance written notice, the
Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Buyers and Buyers

the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement, to the Companys and
its Subsidiaries employees, properties, Contracts, data and information and
records to the extent relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries; _provided_
, that Buyer and its Representatives shall conduct any such activities at
their sole cost and expense (excluding for the avoidance of doubt the cost of
the compensation and benefits of the Company Employees) and in such a manner
as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries and in no event will the foregoing include any
sampling or analysis of soil, groundwater, building materials or other
environmental media. All requests for information made pursuant to this
_Section 5.4_ shall be directed to the executive officer or other Persons

officer or agent of Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who has not
been so designated without the prior written consent of Seller or its
designee.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) This _Section 5.4_ shall not require Seller, the Company or its
Subsidiaries to permit any access to or to disclose (i) any information that,
in the reasonable judgment of Seller, is reasonably likely to result in any
violation of any Law, fiduciary duty or any Contract to which Seller, the
Company or its Affiliates is a party or cause any privilege (including
attorney-client privilege) that Seller, the Company or their respective
Affiliates would be entitled to assert to be undermined with respect to such
information; or (ii) any information that in the reasonable judgment of Seller
would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets, competitively sensitive
information or information concerning the valuation of Seller or its
Affiliates; _provided_ , that, in the case of _clause (i)_ above, Seller
shall provide written notice to Buyer of the fact that Seller, the Company or
any of its Affiliates are withholding such information and the parties hereto
shall cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such
information to the extent doing so would not (in the good faith belief of
Seller (after consultation with counsel)) be reasonably likely to result in
the violation of any such Law or Contract or be reasonably likely to cause
such privilege to be undermined with respect to such information. The access
or information provided pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ shall not (x) affect
or be deemed to affect or modify any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein, the conditions to the obligations of the Parties
to consummate the Closing in _Article VII_ or otherwise prejudice in any way

affect or modify any Partys reliance on any other Partys representations,

third party and/or any Governmental Entity (including any national securities
exchange or interdealer quotation service) will be made, in each case of

Agreement, by either Party or its controlled Affiliates without the prior
written consent of the other Party, except (i) as may be required by Law (upon
the reasonable advice of counsel) or by the request of any Governmental
Entity, in which case the Party required to issue such public release or
announcement or make any filing with any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity (or whose controlled Affiliate is required to issue such public release
or announcement or make any filing with any third party or any Governmental
Entity) shall, to the extent practicable, provide the other Party a reasonable
opportunity to comment on and take into account in good faith the other
Partys comments on such public release, announcement or filing prior to its
issuance, distribution or publication, in each case to the extent permitted by
Law, (ii) solely with respect to Seller or the Company, to the extent required
under the Indenture to the holders of the Senior Notes, provided that, the
Company shall provide Buyer a reasonable opportunity to comment on and take

Agreement or any other relevant information that is already publicly available

Agreement and until

 



     

 

 



 

the Closing Date, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall send,
distribute or otherwise make available written communications or other
material communications to any Company Employee or Company Independent
Contractor regarding any post-Closing employment, compensation or benefits
except (A) with the prior written consent of Buyer (provided that subsequent
distributions or communications substantively the same as those communications
previously approved by Buyer in writing shall not require prior written
consent for distributions or communications following such approval), (B) as
expressly required by the terms of this Agreement or (C) as necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, (x) this _Section 5.5_ shall not
apply to filings or other communications to be made to Governmental Entities
pursuant to _Section 5.2_, and (y) in no event will the Company or Buyer or
any of their Affiliates have any right to use the Selling Sponsors names or
marks, or any abbreviation, variation or derivative thereof, in any press
release, public announcement or other public document or communication without
the express written consent of the applicable Selling Sponsor.

 



 

 **SECTION 5.6** **_Employee Benefits_**.

 



 

(a) Consistent with its customary practices and based on assumptions
concerning the general compensation philosophy and approach of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, Buyer intends to transition the compensation and benefits
packages for employees who are employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Closing and who continue employment with Buyer, the
Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries following the Closing
(collectively, the " _Affected Employees_ ") generally (subject to limited
exceptions to reflect specific individual circumstances) as follows: (i)
annual base salary or base wages immediately after the Closing would be at a
level not less than what it was immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) planned
total cash compensation (base salary or base wages, as applicable, plus target
cash incentives) immediately after the Closing would be at a level that is not
less than what it was immediately prior to the Closing, (iii) immediately
following a human resources integration transition, equity compensation
incentives would be at a level consistent with that provided to other
similarly situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates, and (iv) immediately
following a human resources integration transition after the Closing, employee
benefits that are intended to be substantially similar, in the aggregate, to
the benefits provided to Affected Employees immediately prior to the Closing
or to the benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer and its
Affiliates.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing, for purposes of eligibility, vesting and level
of benefits under the benefit and compensation plans, programs, policies,
agreements or other arrangements of Buyer, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in which Affected Employees are eligible to
participate following the Closing (collectively, the " _Buyer Plans_ "), Buyer
shall, and shall cause the Company or the applicable respective Subsidiary to,
credit each Affected Employee with his or her years of service with the
Company, its Subsidiaries, and any predecessor, to the same extent as such
Affected Employee was entitled immediately prior to the Closing to credit for
such service under any similar Company Plan; _provided_ , that (i) no such
service shall be credited (x) to the extent that it would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service, (y) for
purposes of any Buyer Plan, other than any Company Plan, that provides defined
benefit pension benefits, retiree medical benefits or other post-employment
benefits or (z) for purposes of any Buyer Plan that is grandfathered or
frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or eligibility for
participation, and (ii) for purposes of any Buyer Plan that is not a Company
Plan, such service credit with respect to the level of benefits

 



     

 

 



 

shall be applicable solely in respect of vacation, disability, severance and
medical (other than retiree medical) benefits. In addition, Buyer shall (and
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to) use commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) waive for each Affected Employee and his or her covered
dependents, any waiting period provision under any Buyer Plan and any pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements under any
Buyer Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to
the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived in the ordinary course
and consistent with past practices under the comparable Company Plans in which
such Affected Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii)
for the plan year in which the Closing occurs, credit each Affected Employee
with any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid prior to the
Closing in satisfying any applicable copayments, deductibles or out-of-pocket
requirements for the plan year under any Buyer Plan that provides for medical,
dental or vision insurance benefits (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
any benefit plan that provides pharmaceutical benefits that does not provide
credit for such co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses).

 



 

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to take
such actions as may be necessary (including soliciting any necessary customary
employee waivers) to cause a stockholder vote that, if approved (and if any
necessary waivers were obtained), would cause all payments to "disqualified
individuals" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) which would
otherwise constitute "excess parachute payments" under Section 280G of the
Code as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to satisfy
the stockholder approval exemption under Section 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) of the
Code. The Company shall provide Buyer and its Representatives with a copy of
any disclosure statement and related calculations prepared in connection with
this _Section 5.6(c)_ not less than seven (7) calendar days prior to delivery
to the Companys stockholders and shall consider in good faith any comments
made by Buyer or its Representatives regarding the content of such disclosure
statement. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Buyer
notification and evidence that a vote of the stockholders was solicited in
conformance with Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder with respect to payments or benefits that would constitute "excess
parachute payments" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code) and whether
or not the requisite stockholder approval was obtained with respect to any
payments or benefits that were subject to the stockholder vote.

 



 

(d) The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this _Section 5.6_ with respect to employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries are included for the sole benefit of Seller and Buyer and shall
not create any right (i) in any other Person, including any employees, former
employees, any participant or any beneficiary thereof in any Company Plan or
Buyer Plan, or (ii) to continued employment with the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or Buyer. Nothing herein shall, or shall be deemed to, amend any
benefit plan, including any Buyer Plan or any Company Plan. After the Closing,
nothing contained in this _Section 5.6_ shall interfere with the right of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Buyer to amend, modify or terminate any
Company Plan or Buyer Plan or to terminate the employment of any employee of
the Company or its Subsidiaries for any reason.

 



 

(e) If requested by Buyer in a written notice delivered to the Company not
less than ten (10) Business Days before the Closing Date, the Company shall
cause the board of directors (or the appropriate committee thereof) of the
Company or the applicable Subsidiary of the Company to adopt resolutions and
take such corporate actions as are necessary to terminate the Company 401(k)
Plan, effective as of immediately prior to the Closing Date. If the Company

 



     

 

 



 

401(k) Plan shall be terminated as set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence, at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Buyer (i) executed resolutions of the board of
directors of the Company (or the appropriate committee thereof) authorizing
the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan effective as of immediately prior
to the Closing Date, and (ii) an executed copy of the amendment made to the
Company 401(k) Plan in connection with the termination of the plan. In the
event that the Company 401(k) Plan is terminated as set forth in this _Section
5.6(e)_, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause a Buyer Plan
that includes a cash or deferred arrangement qualified under Section 401(k) of
the Code (the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_") to permit and accept rollover
contributions of the account balances of any Affected Employee who
participated in the Company 401(k) Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, with
respect to each Affected Employee who participated in the Company 401(k) Plan
that is terminated pursuant to this _Section 5.6(e)_, Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause a Buyer 401(k) Plan to permit and
accept as rollover contributions a maximum of two (2) outstanding loan notes
made by such Affected Employee that are held as assets of the Company 401(k)
Plan immediately prior to the Closing, and if a Buyer 401(k) Plan permits and
accepts as a rollover contribution such loan notes, Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to permit the Affected Employee who made such
loan note to continue to repay the underlying loan in accordance with its
terms in effect immediately prior to the Closing.

 



 

(f) Seller shall take all necessary action to cause all outstanding SAR Awards
held by a Company SAR Award Holder to be cancelled at the Closing in exchange
for the right to receive the consideration specified in _Section 1.3_ (if
any) in accordance with the terms of _Section 1.3_.

 



 

(g) No later than ten (10) Business Days following the date hereof, the
Company shall use its reasonable efforts to provide Buyer with human resources
contact information with respect to each country in which a Company Employee
is employed (which, with respect to any country in which a Company Employee is
employed but for which the Company and its Subsidiaries do not maintain a
separate human resources contact, may be the human resources contact for the
applicable region within which such country is located) and, following the
date hereof, the Company shall cooperate with the reasonable requests of Buyer
in good faith for the purpose of gathering Company Employee census data and
preparing for on-boarding Company Employees. If Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries would be prohibited by applicable Law or any Contract from
providing any information or data requested by Buyer pursuant to this _Section
5.6(g)_, the Company shall (or shall cause the applicable Subsidiary to)
exercise commercially reasonable efforts to provide appropriate notification,
obtain consent or take such other similar actions in order to provide such
information consistent with applicable Law and such Contract, provided that
Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take the actions and
execute the documents, reasonably requested by Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries, as are required to render the provision of such information
consistent with applicable Laws and such Contracts. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this _Section 5.6(g)_, any good faith failure of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to perform, or comply with, its obligations
under this _Section 5.6(g)_ shall not constitute the failure of any condition
set forth in _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_ to be satisfied, or otherwise
constitute a material breach of this Agreement by the Company.

 



 

(h) The Company and Buyer shall (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
to) cooperate to take all reasonably necessary or appropriate actions to
comply with any requirement under applicable Law or any applicable Contract or
Company Plan to notify the collective bargaining or other labor
representatives about the transactions contemplated by this

 



     

 

 



 

Agreement, including any applicable works council of the Company, Buyer or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, and to provide such information and engage
in such discussions or negotiations with such representatives as may be
required by applicable Law or any applicable Contract or Company Plan, in each
case, to the extent reasonably requested by Buyer.

 



 

 **SECTION 5.7** **_Expenses_**. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement (including _Section 1.6_), whether or not the Closing is
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
hereto incurring such expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall be
solely responsible for the filing fees paid in connection with the obligations
set forth in _Section 5.2(d)(i)(A)_, the cost of DandO Insurance to be obtained
pursuant to _Section 5.8_, expenses incurred pursuant to _Section 5.15_, and
any Transfer Taxes and similar Taxes required to be paid pursuant to _Section
6.3_. In the event of termination of this Agreement, the obligation of each
Party to pay its own expenses will be subject to any rights of such Party
arising from a Willful Breach of this Agreement by any other Party.

 



 

 **SECTION 5.8** **_Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_**.

 



 

(a) For six (6) years after the Closing Date, the Company will, and will cause
its Subsidiaries to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses
as incurred to, in each case to the same extent such Persons are indemnified
or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the Closing by the Company
and the applicable Companys Subsidiary pursuant to and subject to the
limitations of, the Companys and such Subsidiarys certificate of
incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational documents and
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence as of the date hereof and
provided to Buyer prior to the date hereof, each present and former manager,
director and officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a " _D
andO Indemnified Party_") against any costs, expenses (including attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, Losses, claims, damages, Liabilities and amounts paid
in settlement (collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in connection with any
threatened, pending or completed Action, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, based on, arising out of or related to such
DandO Indemnified Parties service as a manager, director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or services performed by such Persons at
the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at or prior to the
Closing, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing (a " _D
andO Indemnifiable Claim_"), including, for the avoidance of doubt, in
connection with (i) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)
actions to enforce this provision or any other indemnification or advancement
right of any DandO Indemnified Party. In addition, for six (6) years after the
Closing Date, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, advance to
each DandO Indemnified Party all DandO Expenses incurred in connection with any
DandO Indemnifiable Claim (including in circumstances where Buyer or the Company
has assumed the defense of such claim) prior to the final disposition of any
such DandO Indemnifiable Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Person to whom
DandO Expenses are to be advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances
if it is ultimately determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification. For the purposes of this _Section 5.8(a)_, " _D andO
Expenses_" will include attorneys fees and all other costs, charges and
expenses paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a
witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to defend,
to be a witness in or participate in any DandO Indemnifiable Claim, but will
exclude Losses, judgments and amounts paid in settlement (which items are
included in the definition of Costs).

 



      

 

 



 

(b) At or prior to the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company to
obtain and fully pay the premium for "tail" insurance policies for the
extension of the coverage under (i) the Company or its Subsidiaries existing
directors and officers liability insurance policies, and (ii) the Companys
or its Subsidiaries existing fiduciary and employment practices liability
insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of
at least six (6) years from and after the Closing from insurance carriers with
the same or better credit rating as the Companys insurance carriers as of the
date of this Agreement with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary and employment practices liability insurance
(collectively, " _D andO Insurance_"), for all insured persons under the
Companys or its Subsidiarys existing DandO Insurance, with benefits, terms,
conditions, retentions and levels of coverage that are at least as favorable
as the Companys or its Subsidiaries existing policies with respect to any
matters that existed or occurred at or prior to the Closing (including in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions or actions contemplated
hereby); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Buyer be required to
expend for such "tail" insurance policies pursuant to this sentence, together
with any amounts expended pursuant to the immediately following sentence, an
aggregate premium in excess of $1,700,000, which represents approximately 300%
of the annual premium currently paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries for
such insurance. If Buyer for any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries
to (at Buyers expense), continue to maintain in effect for a period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Closing, the DandO Insurance in place as
of the date of this Agreement with benefits, terms, conditions, retentions and
levels of coverage that are at least as favorable to the insureds as provided
in the Companys or its Subsidiaries existing policies as of the date of this
Agreement, or Buyer shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to (at
Buyers expense), use reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable DandO
Insurance for such six-year period with benefits, terms, conditions,
retentions and levels of coverage that are at least as favorable to the
insureds as provided in the Companys or its Subsidiaries existing policies
as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall the Company and its Subsidiaries (at Buyers expense) be required to
expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence, together with any amounts
expended pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, an annual premium
amount in excess of $1,700,000, which represents approximately 300% of the
annual premiums currently paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries for such
insurance; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, Buyer shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to (at Buyers expense) obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 



 

(c) If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Company or such Subsidiary shall
assume all of the obligations of the Company or such Subsidiary, respectively,
set forth in this _Section 5.8_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, this _Section 5.8_ shall survive the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with its terms and shall
be binding on all successors and assigns of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.8_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the DandO Indemnified Parties and other
insured persons under the

 



     

 

 



 

Companys or its Subsidiarys existing DandO Insurance, who are third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 5.8_.

 



 

(e) The rights of the DandO Indemnified Parties under this _Section 5.8_ shall
be in addition to any rights such DandO Indemnified Parties may have under the
Governing Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any
applicable Contracts or Laws. All rights to indemnification and exculpation
from Liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing
and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor
of any DandO Indemnified Party as provided in the Governing Documents of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall
survive the Closing and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such DandO
Indemnified Party without the consent of such DandO Indemnified Party and each
Person entitled to insurance coverage under this _Section 5.8_, respectively,
and his or her heirs and legal representatives.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.8_, with
respect to any right to indemnification or advancement for acts or omissions
occurring prior to or at the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, shall be the indemnitors of first resort, responsible for all such
indemnification and advancement, without regard to any rights that any DandO
Indemnified Party may have against any direct or indirect shareholder or
equity holder of any of the Company or its Subsidiaries (or any Affiliate of
such shareholder or equity holder) (collectively, the " _Other Indemnitors_ ")
and without right to seek subrogation, indemnity or contribution from such
Other Indemnitors. Each of the Company, its Subsidiaries and Buyer further
agrees that no advance or payment by any Other Indemnitor with respect to any
claim for which any DandO Indemnified Party has sought advancement or
indemnification from the Company or its Subsidiaries shall affect the
foregoing and that any Other Indemnitor shall have a right of contribution
and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all the
rights of recovery of the DandO Indemnified Party against the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and the Company and its Subsidiaries hereby irrevocably waive,
relinquish and release the Other Indemnitors from any and all claims against
the Other Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of
any kind in respect thereof. Buyer and the DandO Indemnified Parties agree that
the Other Indemnitors are express third party beneficiaries of the terms of
this _Section 5.8(f)_.

amend, refile or otherwise modify any Tax Return, or take any other action

any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives makes any
representations or warranties whatsoever with respect to such estimates,
projections and other forecasts and plans (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts), and Buyer
has not relied thereon, and (iv) Buyer will have no claim against Seller or
any other Person with respect thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this _Section 10.1_ or elsewhere in
this Agreement shall limit the Liability of any Person in the case of
intentional fraud.

 



 

 **SECTION 10.2** **_Modification or Amendment_**. This Agreement may be
modified or amended only by written agreement of Seller and Buyer.

 



 

 **SECTION 10.3** **_Waiver_**. Any waiver of any provision of this Agreement
by a Party shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
by the Party or Parties to be bound thereby. No such waiver shall constitute a
waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other breach or
failure to strictly comply with the provisions of this Agreement. The

 



     

 

 



 

failure of any Party to assert any rights or remedies shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights or remedies.

 



 

 **SECTION 10.4** **_Counterparts_**. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original
instrument, and all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the
same agreement having the same effect as if the signatures thereto were upon
the same instrument, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts
have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered (by telecopy,
electronic delivery or otherwise) to the other parties hereto. Signatures to
this Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in
"portable document format" (".pdf") form, or by any other electronic means
intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a
document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document
bearing the original signature.

 



 

 **SECTION 10.5** **_Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial; Specific
Performance_**.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be deemed to be made in and in all respects shall be
interpreted, construed and governed by and in accordance with the Law of the
State of Delaware without regard to the conflicts of law principles thereof to
the extent that such principles would direct a matter to another jurisdiction.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereto submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court lacks subject
matter jurisdiction, any state or federal court in the State of Delaware, and
in each case any appellate courts therefrom, in any Action arising out of, or
relating to, this Agreement, agrees that all claims in respect of the Action
may be heard and determined in any such court and agrees not to bring any
action or proceeding arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement in any
other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of any Action so brought and waives any bond, surety
or other security that might be required of any other party with respect
thereto. Each party agrees that service of summons and complaint or any other
process that might be served in any action or proceeding may be made on such
party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served
at the address of the party and in the manner provided for the giving of
notices in _Section 10.6_. Nothing in this _Section 10.5_, however, shall
affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by Law. Each party agrees that a final judgment in any Action so
brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in
any other manner provided by Law. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section
10.5_ shall not limit the jurisdiction of the Accounting Arbitrator as set
forth in _Section 1.6_ and shall include any Action brought for the purpose
of enforcing the jurisdiction and judgments of the Accounting Arbitrator.

 



 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER OR
THEREUNDER. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS

 



     

 

 



 

REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) EACH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER TRANSACTION
DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 10.5_.

 



 

(d) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in
the event that the parties do not perform their obligations under the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take all such actions as
are necessary or required of them hereunder to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that prior to the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article VIII_, (i) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement
or at Law or in equity and (ii) the right of specific enforcement is an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without
that right, none of the parties would have entered into this Agreement. Each
of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that (x) the
other parties have an adequate remedy at Law or (y) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. The
parties acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section
10.5(d)_ shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such Order or injunction. Any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise at any time of any other remedy.

 



 

 **SECTION 10.6** **_Notices_**. Any notice, request, instruction or other
document to be given hereunder by any party hereto to the others shall be in
writing and delivered personally or sent by registered or certified mail,

annexes, schedules and exhibits hereto, including the Disclosure Schedules)
and the other Transaction Documents constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and
warranties both written and oral, among the Parties, with respect to the
subject matter hereof.

 



 

 **SECTION 10.8** **_No Third Party Beneficiaries_**. Except (i) as provided
in _Section 5.8_ (Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance), (ii)
as provided in _Section 10.13_ (Waiver of Conflicts) and (iii) with respect
to the Released Parties as provided in _Section 10.15_, each party hereby
agrees that their respective representations, warranties, agreements and
covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other parties, in
accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement
is not intended to, and do not, confer upon any Person other than the parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth herein. Each of the Persons described
in _clauses (i)_ , _(ii)_ and _(iii)_ of the immediately preceding sentence
is and shall be an express third party beneficiary with respect to the
applicable Section(s) specified in _clauses (i)_ , _(ii)_ and _(iii)_ of the
immediately preceding sentence, and may enforce this Agreement with respect to
such Section(s).

 



 

 **SECTION 10.9** **_Obligations of Buyer and of Seller_**. Whenever this
Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Buyer to take any action, such requirement
shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Buyer to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of Seller to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an
undertaking on the part of Seller to cause such Subsidiary to take such
action.

 



 

 **SECTION 10.10** **_Severability_**. Whenever possible, each provision of
this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
prohibited by or invalid under applicable Law, such provision will be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Agreement, and the parties will amend or otherwise modify this Agreement
to replace any prohibited or invalid provision with an effective and valid
provision that gives effect to the intent of the parties to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

 **SECTION 10.11** **_Interpretation; Construction; Disclosure Letter_**.

 



 

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit, affect the meaning or interpretation or otherwise affect any of the
provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or
Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without

 



     

 

 



 

limitation." All pronouns and all variations thereof shall be deemed to refer
to the masculine, feminine or neuter, singular or plural, as the identity of
the Person may require. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to any
agreement (including this Agreement), contract, statute or regulation, such
references are to, except as context may otherwise require, the agreement,
contract, statute or regulation as amended, modified, supplemented, restated
or replaced from time to time (in the case of an agreement or contract, to the
extent permitted by the terms thereof); and to any section of any statute or
regulation including any successor to the section and, in the case of any
statute, any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder. All references to
"dollars" or "$" in this Agreement are to United States dollars. All
references to "days" shall be to calendar days unless otherwise indicated as a
"Business Day." All references to "made available", "provided" (or any phrase
of similar import) shall include all documentation that has been posted to the
online data room (including any "clean room") for Project Gopher by a
Representative of the Company as of 2:30 p.m. Eastern time on the date hereof,
except to the extent such documentation is not then accessible by Buyer or its
Representatives (other than as a result of (A) applicable "clean team"
restrictions or (B) conditions and circumstances outside the control of
Seller, the Company or their respective Representatives). Buyer acknowledges
that the SAR Plan and forms of SAR Award disclosed to Buyers counsel on
October 2, 2018, as amended (as applicable) by the compensation committee of
the board of directors of Chiron Holdings GP, Inc. on October 5, 2018 pursuant
to resolutions disclosed to Buyers counsel on November 1, 2018 shall be
deemed to have been made available to Buyer for all purposes hereunder. The
word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a
subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if".

 



 

(b) The parties hereto have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting
this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) Any information disclosed in any section of the Disclosure Schedules
relating to any representation or warranty shall be deemed to be disclosed
only with respect to (i) the correspondingly numbered Section of this
Agreement and (ii) any other representation or warranty in _Article II_ or
_Article III_ to the extent the relevance of such information to such other
representation or warranty is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure. The mere inclusion of any item in any section or subsection of the
Disclosure Schedules as an exception to any representation or warranty or
otherwise shall not be deemed to constitute an admission or suggestion by the
applicable party, or to otherwise imply, that any such item is or would
reasonably be expected to be material or has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, is required to be disclosed, or
otherwise represents a violation of, breach of or default under any Contract
or Law or otherwise or an exception or material fact, event or circumstance
for the purposes of this Agreement, or that such item meets or exceeds a
monetary or other threshold specified for disclosure in this Agreement. Such
disclosure shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the term "material,"
"materially," "materiality," "Material Adverse Effect" or any similar
qualification. Matters disclosed in any section or subsection of the
Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters that are required
by this Agreement to be disclosed therein. Such additional matters are set
forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other
matters of a similar nature or impose any duty or obligation to disclose any
information beyond what is required by this Agreement, and disclosure of such
additional matters shall not affect, directly or indirectly, the
interpretation of this Agreement or the scope of the disclosure

 



      

 

 



 

obligations hereunder. Headings inserted in the sections or subsections of the
Disclosure Schedules are for convenience of reference only and shall not have
the effect of amending or changing the express terms of the sections or
subsections as set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

 **SECTION 10.12** **_Assignment_**. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors,
legal representatives and permitted assigns. No party to this Agreement may
assign or transfer, directly or indirectly, any of its rights or delegate any
of its obligations under this Agreement, by operation of Law or otherwise,
without the prior written consent of the other Parties (other than pursuant to
a sale, transfer or other business combination transaction involving Seller or
Buyer, or a sale of all or substantially all of the respective assets of
Seller or Buyer); _provided_ , that a Party may assign any of or all of its
rights, interest and obligations to any of its Affiliates, but no such
assignment shall release the assigning Party of any of its obligations under
this Agreement. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is
null and void _ab initio_ ; provided, further that, subject to _Section
1.6(h)_, nothing herein shall prevent or prohibit Seller to be dissolved,
liquidated, terminated or cancelled following the Closing.

 



 

 **SECTION 10.13** **_Waiver of Conflicts_**.

 



 

(a) Buyer (on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries) covenants and agrees
that, following the Closing, Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP and any other
internal or external legal counsel currently representing Seller and its
Affiliates (each a " _Prior Company Counsel_ ") may serve as counsel to Seller
and its Affiliates, including a Selling Sponsor, in connection with any
matters arising under or related to this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including with
respect to any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or related to
this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, notwithstanding any representation by the
Prior Company Counsel prior to the Closing Date of Seller and its Affiliates
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries). Buyer (on behalf of itself and
its Subsidiaries) hereby irrevocably (i) waives any claim it has or may have
that a Prior Company Counsel has a conflict of interest or is otherwise
prohibited from engaging in such representation and (ii) covenants and agrees
that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing between Buyer, the
Company or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its
Affiliates, on the other hand, Prior Company Counsel may represent Seller or
any of its Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of such
Person(s) may be directly adverse to Buyer, the Company or its Subsidiaries
and even though Prior Company Counsel may have represented the Company or its
Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute.

 



 

(b) All communications prior to the Closing between direct and indirect
holders of Common Stock (but in the case of indirect holders, solely in their
capacity as indirect holders of Common Stock and not in any other capacity
(including any other capacity as a manager, director, officer or employee of
the Company or its Subsidiaries)), the Company or its Subsidiaries and their
respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and Prior Company Counsel, on the
other hand, to the extent related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely
to such direct and indirect holders of Common Stock and their respective
Affiliates (excluding the Company and its Subsidiaries) (the " _Seller Pre-
Closing Communications_ "). Accordingly, Buyer, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not have access to any such Seller Pre-Closing
Communications or to the files of Prior Company Counsel relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement from and after the Closing, and
all books, records and other materials of the Company and its Subsidiaries in
any medium

 



     

 

 



 

(including electronic copies) containing or reflecting any of the Seller Pre-
Closing Communications or the work product of legal counsel with respect
thereto, including any related summaries, drafts or analyses, and all rights
with respect to any of the foregoing, are hereby assigned and transferred to
Seller effective as of the Closing (collectively, the " _Seller Privileged
Materials_ "). The Seller Privileged Materials shall be excluded from the
transfer contemplated by this Agreement and Seller shall cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to distribute the Seller Privileged Materials to Seller
immediately prior to the Closing with no copies thereof retained by the
Company or its Subsidiaries, or their respective representatives. To the
extent that any Seller Privileged Materials are not delivered to Seller, Buyer
(on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries) agrees not to assert a waiver of
any applicable privilege or protection, and will use commercially reasonable
efforts to deliver all such Seller Privileged Materials to Seller promptly
upon discovery thereof, without retaining copies thereof, it being understood
that nothing herein shall prevent Buyer from complying with this obligation.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the Closing,
(a) the direct and indirect holders of Common Stock (but in the case of
indirect holders, solely in their capacity as indirect holders of Common Stock
and not in any other capacity (including any other capacity as a manager,
director, officer or employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries)) and their
respective Affiliates (excluding the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall be
the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to the Seller
Privileged Materials, and none of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be a
holder thereof, (b) to the extent that files of Prior Company Counsel in
respect of Seller Privileged Materials constitute property of the client, only
the direct and indirect holders of Common Stock and their respective
Affiliates (excluding the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall hold such
property rights and (c) Prior Company Counsel shall have no duty whatsoever to
reveal or disclose any Seller Privileged Materials to the Company or its
Subsidiaries by reason of any attorney-client relationship between Prior
Company Counsel and the Company or its Subsidiaries, or otherwise. For
avoidance of doubt, all communications between direct and indirect holders of
Common Stock (but in the case of indirect holders, solely in their capacity as
indirect holders of Common Stock and not in any other capacity (including any
other capacity as a manager, director, officer or employee of the Company or
its Subsidiaries)), the Company or its Subsidiaries and their respective
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Prior Company Counsel, on the other hand, to
the extent such communications do not constitute Seller Pre-Closing
Communications or such communications are not related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, shall be transferred to Buyer at time of the
Closing. For further avoidance of doubt, nothing in the foregoing shall
prevent Buyer from complying with any court order, subpoena or any type of
compulsory process. Buyer hereby acknowledges and confirms that it has had the
opportunity to review and obtain adequate information regarding the
significance and risks of the waivers and other terms and conditions of this
_Section 10.13_, including the opportunity to discuss with counsel such
matters and reasonable alternatives to such terms.

 



 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 10.13_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, Seller, each direct and indirect holder of
Common Stock in their capacity as such and each Prior Company Counsel, who are
third party beneficiaries of this _Section 10.13_.

 



 

 **SECTION 10.14** **_Limitation on Recourse_**.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or otherwise,
no claim arising in whole or in part out of or related to this Agreement, the
negotiation, interpretation, construction, validity or enforcement of this
Agreement or the transactions

 



     

 

 



 

contemplated by this Agreement (whether sounding in contract, tort, statute or
otherwise) shall be brought or maintained by or on behalf of any party or any
of its Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates or their respective
successors or permitted assigns against any Person not a party hereto. Without
limitation of the foregoing, no claim described in the immediately preceding
sentence shall be brought or maintained against any past, present or future
officer, director, employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager,
management company, member, stockholder, equity holder, controlling Person,
representative or Affiliate, or any heir, executor, administrator, successor
or assign of any of the foregoing, of Buyer, the Company (including its
Subsidiaries) or Seller or any of their respective Affiliates (including, in
the case of Seller, the Selling Sponsors), as applicable, unless such Person
is a party, and no recourse shall be had against any of them in respect of any
such claim, including in connection with any alleged misrepresentation or
inaccuracy in or breach of or omission in any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of any party set forth or contained in
this Agreement or any exhibit or schedule hereto or any certificate delivered
hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall limit
Buyers or any Selling Sponsors rights and remedies under any Letter
Agreement against the parties thereto.

 



 

(b) The parties agree that, subject to the limitations in _Section 10.1_,
nothing in this Agreement (including in _Section 10.14(a)_ or _Section 9.1_)
shall limit (i) any Persons right to bring a claim until the latest time
permitted by applicable Law based on the intentional fraud of any other Person
(such other Person, the " _Fraudulent Actor_ ") against such Fraudulent Actor
in respect of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein at any time following the Closing Date (which claim, for the avoidance
of doubt may only be brought in respect of the representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement with respect to which the intentional fraud of such
Fraudulent Actor is being claimed), or (ii) any of the first specified
Persons rights against such Fraudulent Actor pursuant to any such claim.

 



 

 **SECTION 10.15** **_Release_**. Effective as of the Closing (but only if
the Closing actually occurs), except for any rights or obligations under this
Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, Buyer, on behalf of itself, Seller, on behalf of
itself, and each of Buyer and Seller on behalf of its respective Affiliates
(including, in the case of Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries, and, in
the case of Seller, excluding the Company and its Subsidiaries), and each of
their respective past, present or future general or limited partners,
management companies, members, stockholders, equity holders or controlling
Persons, or any successor or assign of any of the foregoing (collectively, the
" _Releasing Parties_ "), hereby irrevocably and unconditionally releases and
forever discharges (the " _Release_ ") the other Party and its Affiliates
(including, in the case of Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries, and, in
the case of Seller, excluding the Company and its Subsidiaries), and each of
their respective past, present or future officers, directors, employees,
agents, general or limited partners, managers, management companies, members,
stockholders, equity holders, controlling Persons, representatives or
Affiliates, or any heir, executor, administrator, successor or assign of any
of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Released Parties_ ") of and from any
and all actions, causes of action, suits, proceedings, executions, judgments,
duties, debts, dues, accounts, bonds, contracts and covenants (whether express
or implied), and claims and demands whatsoever whether in law or in equity
(whether based upon contract, tort or otherwise) which the Releasing Parties
may have against any of the Released Parties, now or in the future (each, a "
_Claim_ "), in each case in respect of any cause, matter or thing relating to
the Company or its Subsidiaries or the operation of the business, operations
or properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any actions taken or
failed to be taken by any of the Released Parties in any capacity related to
the Company and its Subsidiaries or the operation of the business, operations
or properties of the Company and its

 



     

 

 



 

Subsidiaries, in each case, occurring or arising on or prior to the Closing
but only to the extent that such cause, matter or thing does not otherwise
constitute intentional fraud; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the case of
any Releasing Party that is a Company Employee or Company Independent
Contractor, the foregoing Release shall not be deemed given or made in respect
of any Claim other than Claims that arise from such Releasing Partys
ownership of any Equity Interests of Seller or any of its Affiliates. The
provisions of this _Section 10.15_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, the Released Parties, who are third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 10.15_.
