Section 3.1. _Treatment of Capital Stock_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or holders of
any securities of the Company or of Merger Sub, each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than any Remaining Shares, any Converted Shares, any Company Restricted Shares
and any Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically converted into the right to
receive $44.50 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "),
subject to the provisions of this _Article_ __ _ III_. From and after the
Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock (other than any

 



-17-  Remaining Shares, any Converted Shares, any Company Restricted Shares and
any Dissenting Shares) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each applicable holder of such
Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the
surrender of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 3.2_.

(b) _Certain Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock that
is, immediately prior to the Effective Time, owned or held in treasury by the
Company or is owned by Parent or Merger Sub (including all Treasury Shares
purchased by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.16_) (collectively, the "
_Remaining Shares_ ") shall remain issued or issued and outstanding (as
applicable) and shall, as of the Effective Time, represent one (1) share of
Surviving Company Stock, and no consideration shall be delivered in connection
with the Merger with respect to such Remaining Shares. At the Effective Time,
any shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time that are owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) or of the Company (the "
_Converted Shares_ ") shall be converted into such number of shares of common
stock of the Surviving Company (" _Surviving Company_ _Stock_ ") such that the
ownership percentage of any such Subsidiary in the Surviving Company shall
equal the ownership percentage of such Subsidiary in the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) _Treatment of Merger Sub Shares_. At the Effective Time, each issued and
outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
(the " _Merger Sub Shares_ ") shall be automatically converted into and become
one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share of Surviving Company Stock. From
and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing Merger Sub Shares
shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of
Surviving Company Stock into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.

 

(d) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. If, between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any
stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock
split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other
similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately
adjusted, without duplication, to reflect any such change. Nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 3.1(d)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any
action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

Section 3.2. _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) _Payment Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the paying
agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). The Paying Agent
shall also act as the agent for the Company Stockholders for the purpose of
receiving and holding their Certificates and Book-Entry Shares and shall
obtain no rights or interests in the shares represented thereby. At or
immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or

 



-18-  cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash in immediately available
funds in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (the "
_Payment Fund_ "), in each case, for the sole benefit of the holders of
Company Common Stock; _provided_ that no such deposits shall be required to be
made with respect to any Dissenting Shares. In the event the Payment Fund
shall be insufficient (other than as a result of payment of the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Agreement) to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited,
additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount that is equal to
the shortfall that is required to make such payment. Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to make, and the Paying Agent shall make, delivery of the Merger
Consideration out of the Payment Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The
Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided
for in this Agreement. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent
as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that any investment
of the Payment Fund shall in all events be limited to direct short-term
obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and
interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated P-1 or A-1 or
better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $50
billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are
then publicly available), and that no such investment or loss thereon shall
affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
pursuant to this  _Article_ __ _ III_. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.

(b)  _Procedures for Surrender_.

(i) _Company Common Stock Certificates_. Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_
") and whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.1_ into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (A) a
letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by
Parent, an indemnity bond) to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and
have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and (B)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent, an indemnity bond) in
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration into which such shares of
Company Common Stock have been converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1_.
Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof and,
if required by Parent, an indemnity bond) for cancellation to the Paying
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together
with such letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration pursuant
to the provisions of this _Article_ __ _ III_ for each share of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent, an indemnity
bond) so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Paying Agent shall
accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and, if
required by Parent, an indemnity bond) upon compliance with such reasonable
terms and conditions as the Paying

 



-19-  Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with
normal exchange practices. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that
(x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to
the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not
required to be paid.

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Any holder of non-certificated Company Common Stock
represented by book-entry (" _Book_ __ _-Entry Shares_ ") and whose shares of
Company Common Stock were converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall not be required to deliver a
Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to
receive the Merger Consideration. In lieu thereof, subject to compliance with
customary procedures of the Paying Agent with respect thereto, each
registered holder of one (1) or more Book-Entry Shares shall upon the
Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent
to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article_ __
_ III_ for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Book-Entry Share, and the Book-Entry Share so exchanged shall be forthwith
cancelled. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry
Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares
are registered.

 

(iii) _No Interest_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any portion of the
Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or affidavit
of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.2(e)_) or in
respect of any Book-Entry Share.

 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. At
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company
Common Stock on the records of the Company. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this _Section_ __ _ 3.2_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article_ __ _ III_,
except as otherwise provided in  _Section_ __ _ 3.3_. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to Parent for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Agreement.

 

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund; No Liability_. At any time following the
first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to
require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) remaining in the Payment Fund that have not
been disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the
Paying Agents routine administrative procedures, to holders of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look
only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) as
general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable
upon due surrender of their Certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.2(e)_) or Book-Entry Shares and
compliance with the procedures in

 



-20-   _Section_ __ _ 3.2(b)_, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Share for any Merger Consideration or other amounts delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and, if required
by Parent, an indemnity bond, the Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1_.

Section 3.3. _Dissenter_ __ _s Rights_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Remaining Shares and Converted Shares) and held
by a holder who did not vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement (or
consent thereto in writing) and has properly exercised appraisal rights in
respect of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such
shares being referred to collectively as the " _Dissenting Shares_ " until
such time as such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such
holders appraisal rights under Delaware Law with respect to such shares)
shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but
instead shall be entitled to payment for such shares determined in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, after the
Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses
such holders right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, or if a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of
Company Common Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)_, without interest thereon, upon
surrender of such Certificate formerly representing such share or transfer of
such Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be. 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, of any
withdrawals of such demands and of any other instruments served pursuant to
the DGCL and received by the Company relating to Section 262 of the DGCL, and
Parent shall have the opportunity to participate in and direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to
settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 3.4. _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is vested and outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, without any action on
the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled, with the
holder of such Company Option becoming entitled to receive within five (5)
business days, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with
respect thereto, an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to the Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time _multiplied by_ (ii) the excess (if any) of the Merger
Consideration over the per share exercise price applicable to the Company
Option.

 



-21- (b) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is unvested and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without any
action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, cease to
represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be
assumed and converted automatically into an option to purchase the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock (each, an " _Adjusted Option_ ") equal to the
product obtained by _multiplying_ (i) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to the Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
_by_ (ii) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded
down to the nearest whole share. Each Adjusted Option shall have an exercise
price per share of Parent Common Stock equal to (x) the per share exercise
price for shares of Company Common Stock subject to the corresponding Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _divided by_ (y) the Equity
Award Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Each Adjusted
Option shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable
to the corresponding Company Option under the applicable Company Equity Plan
and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder, including vesting
terms generally and specifically those set forth on Section 3.4 of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

(c) At the Effective Time, each Company DSU Award that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is held by a non-employee
director of the Company will vest as of the Effective Time and shall, without
any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be
cancelled, with the holder of such Company DSU Award becoming entitled to
receive at the time or times elected by the applicable non-employee director,
in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, the
Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company DSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(d) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU Award and each Company PSU Award
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without
any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be
assumed and converted automatically into a restricted stock unit award with
respect to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (each, an " _Adjusted
RSU Award_ ") equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (i) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company RSU Award or
Company PSU Award, as applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time _by_
 (ii) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded up
to the nearest whole share. For purposes of the immediately preceding
sentence, the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to a Company
PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time shall equal the number of
shares that would vest or become eligible to vest as if performance had been
achieved at target levels. Each Adjusted RSU Award shall otherwise be subject
to the same terms and conditions applicable to the corresponding Company RSU
Award or Company PSU Award, as applicable, under the applicable Company Equity
Plan and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder, including vesting terms,
except as set forth in the remainder of this  _Section_ __ _ 3.4(d)_. With
respect to any Adjusted RSU Award that replaces a Company PSU Award, vesting
shall no longer be subject to achievement of any performance goals or metrics
and shall thereafter be based solely on 

 



-22-  providing continued services to Parent, the Company, or their respective
affiliates through the period of time set forth in the award agreement
relating to the Company PSU Award if the award provided for service-based
vesting after achievement of any performance conditions, or, if no service-
based vesting was required following the end of the applicable performance
period, through the end of the applicable performance period. Each Adjusted
RSU Award will further be subject to the vesting provisions set forth in
Section 3.4 of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(e) At the Effective Time, each Company RS Award that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without any action on the part
of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be assumed and converted
automatically into an award with respect to a number of restricted shares of
Parent Common Stock (each, an " _Adjusted RS_ _Award_ ") equal to the product
obtained by _multiplying_ (i) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to the Company RS Award immediately prior to the Effective Time
_by_ (ii) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded
up to the nearest whole share. The Company Restricted Shares underlying such
Company RS Award shall be cancelled at the Effective Time without the payment
of any consideration therefor. Each Adjusted RS Award shall otherwise be
subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to the corresponding
Company RS Award under the applicable Company Equity Plan and the agreements
evidencing grants thereunder, including vesting terms generally and
specifically those set forth on Section 3.4 of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

(f) As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall take
all actions with respect to the Company ESPP that are necessary to provide
that: (i) with respect to any offering period in effect as of the date hereof
(the " _Current ESPP Offering Period_ "), no employee who is not a participant
in the Company ESPP as of the date hereof may become a participant in the
Company ESPP and no participant may increase the percentage amount of his or
her payroll deduction election from that in effect on the date hereof such for
Current ESPP Offering Period; (ii) subject to the consummation of the Merger,
the Company ESPP shall terminate effective immediately prior to the Effective
Time; (iii) if the Current ESPP Offering Period terminates prior to the
Effective Time, then the Company ESPP shall be suspended and no new offering
period shall be commenced under the Company ESPP prior to the termination of
this Agreement; and (iv) if any Current ESPP Offering Period is still in
effect at the Effective Time, then the last day of such Current ESPP Offering
Period shall be accelerated to a date before the Closing Date and the final
settlement or purchase of shares of Company Common Stock thereunder shall be
made on that day by applying the formula set forth in Section 14.2(ii) of the
Company ESPP in effect on the date hereof. 

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall pass resolutions as are
necessary for the treatment of the Company Equity Awards and the Company ESPP
as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.4_.

(h) Parent shall file with the SEC, no later than five (5) business days
after the Effective Time, a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor form), to the extent such form is available, relating to the shares
of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to the Adjusted Options,
Adjusted RSU Awards and Adjusted RS Awards. Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or statements for so long as Adjusted Options, Adjusted RSU Awards
and Adjusted RS Awards remain outstanding.

 



-23- Section 3.5. _Withholding_. Each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Company and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement any amounts
as are required to be withheld or deducted with respect to such payment under
the Code, or any other applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted or withheld, and timely remitted to the appropriate Governmental
Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made.

relevant, in good standing, (1) has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect and (2) has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the ability of

-37- Section 4.14. _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) Section 4.14(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists for each item of
Company Registered Intellectual Property: (i) the application or registration
number, title, owners or registrants, and the jurisdiction of filing or
application; and (ii) the status of such item. All necessary documents and
certificates currently due for filing as of the date hereof in connection
with any such Company Registered Intellectual Property have been filed with
the relevant patent, copyright, trademark or other authorities in the United
States or foreign jurisdictions, as the case may be, for the purposes of
maintaining such Company Registered Intellectual Property.

(b) Each item of Company Registered Intellectual Property is subsisting and,
to the Companys Knowledge, is not invalid or unenforceable. No Proceeding to
which the Company or one of its Subsidiaries is a party (other than office
actions in connection with the application for, or prosecution of, any Company
Registered Intellectual Property) is pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened, by or before any Governmental Entity, that challenges the
legality, validity, enforceability, registration, use or ownership of any
Company Registered Intellectual Property or other material Company
Intellectual Property Rights.

(c) Other than Company Intellectual Property Rights that are
exclusively licensed to the Company, the Company exclusively owns all Company
Intellectual Property Rights free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted
Liens (where Permitted Liens include, for the purpose of this sentence only,
all licenses, covenants not to assert, releases, agreements not to enforce or
prosecute, or other similar immunities granted with respect to Company
Intellectual Property Rights to any Person). All such Company Intellectual
Property Rights are, and immediately following the Closing will be, fully
transferable, alienable and licensable by the Surviving Company or Parent
without restriction and without material payment of any kind to any third
Person. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has granted
or transferred (or is obligated to grant or transfer) to any Person or has
permitted (or is obligated to permit) any Person to retain any ownership
interest, including any joint ownership interest, or any exclusive rights in,
any Intellectual Property Rights material to the conduct of the business of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. No Governmental
Entity or educational institution has, as a result of funding provided by such
Governmental Entity or educational institution, obtained any right to any
Intellectual Property Rights material to the conduct of the business of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. For clarity, payment
from a Governmental Entity or educational institution to the Company or a
Company Subsidiary in consideration for purchase of, non-exclusive license to,
or subscription to the Company Products will not be deemed "funding" under
this  _Section_ __ _ 4.14(c)_.

(d) No Proceedings are pending, and, to the Companys Knowledge, no Proceeding
is threatened against the Company or any Company Subsidiary, alleging that
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is infringing, misappropriating,
diluting or otherwise violating the Intellectual Property Rights of any
Person, except as would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in
the aggregate, material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole. Except as would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or
in the aggregate, material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, (i) neither any Company Product (when used by or as authorized by
the Company) nor the conduct of the business of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, as conducted at any time on or after April 1, 2015, has
infringed, violated, or misappropriated any Intellectual Property Rights of
any Person or constituted unfair competition or unfair trade practices, (ii)
to the Companys Knowledge, no Person is infringing, misappropriating,
diluting, using in an

 



-38-  unauthorized manner or otherwise violating any Company Intellectual Property
Rights and (iii) since April 1, 2015, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has instituted or threatened in writing to institute any
Proceeding against any Person alleging such Person is infringing,
misappropriating, diluting, using in an unauthorized manner or otherwise
violating any Company Intellectual Property Rights.

 

(e) In each case in which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has engaged or
hired an employee, consultant or contractor who develops or creates for the
Company or any Company Subsidiary any material Technology or Company Product,
the Company or such Company Subsidiary has obtained, either by operation of
Law or by valid assignment or transfer exclusive ownership of all
Intellectual Property Rights in such Technology or Company Product except
where the absence of that assignment or transfer would not reasonably be
expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Company and each Company
Subsidiary have taken commercially reasonable actions to maintain (and
continue to maintain), as confidential, and to reasonably protect, all Company
Trade Secrets, except (i) where Company or a Company Subsidiary has made a
reasonable business decision to no longer maintain a particular item of
information or Technology as a Trade Secret, or (ii) except as would not
reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material
to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. To the
Companys Knowledge, there has been no unauthorized disclosure or use of, or
access to, Company Technology, information or materials that the Company
maintains or intended to maintain as a Trade Secret except as would not
reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

(f) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 4.14(e)_, each employee
of, or consultant or contractor to, the Company or any Company Subsidiary has
executed a valid and binding agreement (i) if such individual has developed or
created for the Company or any Company Subsidiary any material Technology or
Company Product, assigning to the Company or the relevant Company Subsidiary
all Intellectual Property Rights (except as limited by applicable Law) created
by, or that arise as a result of the work of such employee of, or consultant
or contractor to, the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and (ii) requiring
such employee, consultant or contractor to maintain as confidential all
confidential information and Trade Secrets of the Company (including
confidential information or Trade Secrets disclosed to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary by a third Person), except in each case as would not
reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

(g) Except as would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the
aggregate, material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has distributed any
Software or database under an Open Source License in a manner that would
require any Company Technology (other than Company Technology for which the
Company has determined, in its reasonable business judgment, the confidential
and proprietary nature thereof is not material to the Company or its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) (i) to be disclosed or distributed in Source
Code form, (ii) to be licensed for purposes of preparing derivative works or
(iii) to be redistributed at no charge. The Company and the Company
Subsidiaries are and have been in compliance with all Open Source Licenses to
which they are subject except where a failure to comply would not reasonably
be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



-39- (h) Section 4.14(h) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a complete and
accurate list of, and the Company has made available to Parent or publicly
filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof true and complete copies of all
material Contracts pursuant to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary (i)
grants any license, covenant not to assert, release, agreement not to enforce
or prosecute, or other immunity to any Person under or to any Company
Intellectual Property Rights, or (ii) is granted a license, covenant not to
assert, release, agreement not to enforce or prosecute, or immunity to or
under, any Persons Intellectual Property Rights that, in the case of each of
clauses (i) and (ii) above, is, individually or in the aggregate, material to
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and is not a Non-
Scheduled License (the foregoing, the " _IP Contracts_ ").

 

(i) Except as would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the
aggregate, material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the Transactions will result in (A) a breach, violation,
modification, cancellation, termination, or suspension of any IP Contract, (B)
the release of any Source Code or (C) the grant (or requirement to grant) to
any Person of any license, covenant not to assert, release, agreement not to
enforce or prosecute, or other immunity to or under any Company Intellectual
Property Rights. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the Transactions will, by the terms of any Contracts to which
the Company or any Company Subsidiaries is a party (but to which Parent and
its affiliates are not) expressly result in the grant (or requirement to
grant) to any Person of any license, covenant not to assert, release,
agreement not to enforce or prosecute, or other immunity by or on behalf of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any Intellectual Property
Rights of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Except as would not reasonably be
expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (x) all IP Contracts shall remain
in full force and effect following the Closing in accordance with their terms
(other than terminations or expirations occurring in the ordinary course of
business) and (y) immediately after the Closing, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries will be entitled to exercise all of their respective
rights under all IP Contracts to the same extent as prior to the Closing.

 

Section 4.15. _Privacy and Data Protection_.

 

(a) Since April 1, 2015, except as has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect, (i) the Companys and each Company Subsidiarys receipt,
collection, monitoring, maintenance, hosting creation, transmission, use,
analysis, disclosure, storage, disposal and security, as the case may be,
of Protected Information and, to the Companys Knowledge, any such activities
performed or handled by authorized third parties on the Companys or a Company
Subsidiarys behalf, have complied with, and (ii) neither the execution
and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions will
result in the Company, any Company Subsidiary, or the Surviving Company being

Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, (B) applicable Information

acquisition, use or disclosure of any Protected Information owned, used,
hosted, maintained or controlled by or on behalf of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries, including any such unauthorized access, acquisition, use
or disclosure of Protected Information that would constitute a breach for
which notification by the Company or any Company Subsidiary to individuals
and/or Governmental Entities is required under any applicable Information
Privacy and Security Laws or Contracts to which the Company or a Company
Subsidiary is a party. To the Companys Knowledge, since April 1, 2015,

America, N.A., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG New York
Branch, including all exhibits, schedules and annexes to such letter in effect
as of the execution and delivery of this Agreement and (ii) the fee
letters related thereto (together, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ", and,
subject to the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 7.13(a)_, the provision of
funds as set forth therein, the " _Financing_ ") (it being understood that
such fee letters have been redacted to remove fees, the rates and amounts in
the "market flex", if any, and other economic terms that would not adversely
affect the amount, conditionality, availability or termination of
the Financing). As of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, there are
no side letters or other written agreements, contracts or arrangements that
impose conditions or other contingencies related to the funding of the full
amount of the Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter. As of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, there
are no conditions or other contingencies related to the funding of the full
amount of the Financing, other than as set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter. The commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letter have not been
withdrawn or rescinded in any respect prior to the date of this Agreement. As
of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter
represents (A) a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Parent and (B)
to the knowledge of Parent, a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of
each other party thereto, in the case of each of clauses (A) and (B), except
as may be limited by the Enforceability Limitations. As of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, (i) the Debt Commitment Letter has not been
amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, or compliance with any
of the terms waived, and (ii) no commitment under the Debt Commitment Letter

delivery of this Agreement, and will fully pay (or cause to be paid) any such
amounts due on or before the Effective Time. As of the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, no event has occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach or
default on the part of Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party
to the Debt Commitment Letter. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in _Article VIII_ , Parent has no reason to believe that any of the
conditions to funding set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter will not be
satisfied, nor does Parent have knowledge, as of the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, that the Financing will not be made available to Parent on
the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter.

 

(b) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
_Article_ __ _ IV_ and the Companys compliance with its obligations in this
Agreement, the proceeds of the Financing, if funded, together with any
available cash of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, shall constitute
sufficient funds for Parent and Merger Sub to (i) make all cash payments
contemplated to be made by them under this Agreement in connection with the
Merger and the

 



-52-  other Transactions (including the repayment or prepayment of the obligations
under each of the Company Credit Agreements in an amount up to the obligations

incurred thereunder after the date hereof in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement), and (ii) pay all related fees and expenses required to be
paid by them on the Closing Date.

has employed or engaged any investment banker, broker or finder in connection
with the Transactions who is entitled to any fee or any commission from the

arrangements made by Parent or a Parent Subsidiary.

Section 5.8. _Stock Ownership_. Assuming the accuracy of the Companys
representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.23_, Parent is
not, nor at any time for the past three (3) years has been, an "interested
stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL. Neither
Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary directly or indirectly owns as of the date
hereof, and at all times for the past three (3) years through the date hereof,
neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has owned, beneficially or
otherwise, any shares of Company Common Stock.

Section 5.9. _No Merger Sub Activity_. Since its date of formation, Merger
Sub has not engaged in any activities other than in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions.

 

Section 5.10. _No Other Representation_. In connection with the due diligence
investigation of the Company by Parent and Merger Sub, Parent and Merger Sub
have received and may continue to receive from the Company certain estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as
certain business plan and cost-related plan information, regarding
the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective business and
operations. Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking information, with which Parent and Merger
Sub are familiar, that, without limiting in any respect any of the
representations and warranties contained in _Article_ __ _ IV_, Parent and
Merger Sub are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of
the adequacy and accuracy of all such estimates, projections, forecasts and
other forward-looking information, as well as such business plans and cost-
related plans, so furnished to them. Accordingly, except for
the representations and warranties contained in _Article_ __ _ IV_, each of
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that neither the Company nor any
Representative of the Company makes, and each of Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges that it has not relied upon or otherwise been induced by, any
other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or with respect to any other information
provided or made available to Parent in connection with the Transactions,
including any information, documents, projections, forecasts or other material
made available to Parent or to Parents Representatives in certain "data
rooms" or management presentations in expectation of the Transactions or the
accuracy or completeness of any of the foregoing, except, in each case for the
representations and warranties contained in _Article_ __ _ IV_.

Directors (including any committee thereof) and the Companys officers shall
not, and the Company shall cause the Companys other controlled affiliates
not to, and the Company shall cause its and their other respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of providing information

within such ten (10) business day period (or, with respect to any Acquisition
Proposals or material amendments, revisions or changes to the terms of any
such previously publicly disclosed Acquisition Proposal that are publicly
disclosed within the last ten (10) business days prior to the then-scheduled

being replaced with three (3) business days), (vi) fail to include the Company

cause or permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary to enter into, any
merger agreement, acquisition agreement, reorganization agreement, letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, option

or document relating to, or any other agreement or commitment providing for,
any Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
entered into in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_) (a " _Company
Acquisition Agreement_ ") or (viii) commit or agree to do any of the foregoing
(any act described in clauses (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii) and/or (viii) (to
the extent related to the foregoing clauses (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) or (vii)),
a " _Change of Recommendation_ "). The Company, the Company Board of Directors
(including any committee thereof) and the Companys officers shall, and the
Company shall cause the Companys other controlled affiliates to, and the
Company shall cause its and their other respective Representatives to,
immediately cease any and all existing solicitation, discussions or

after the date hereof (and in any event within three (3) business days
following the date hereof), the Company shall (A) request in writing that each
Person (other than Parent) that has heretofore executed a confidentiality
agreement in connection with its consideration of an Acquisition Proposal or

promptly destroy or return to the Company all nonpublic
information heretofore furnished by the Company or any of its Representatives

such confidentiality agreement, unless such request had been made by or on
behalf of the Company prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
and (B) terminate access to any physical or electronic data rooms relating to
a possible Acquisition Proposal by any such Person and its Representatives.
The Company shall enforce, and not waive, terminate or modify without
Parents prior written consent, any confidentiality, standstill

 



-61-  or similar provision in any confidentiality, standstill or other agreement;
_provided_ that, if the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith
after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel that the failure
to waive a particular standstill provision, or other provision with similar
effect, would reasonably be expected to be a breach of the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company may, with prior written
notice to Parent, waive such standstill provision, or other provision with
similar effect, solely to the extent necessary to permit the applicable Person
(if it has not been solicited in violation of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_)
to make, on a confidential basis to the Company Board of Directors, an
Acquisition Proposal, conditioned upon such Person agreeing to disclosure of
such Acquisition Proposal to Parent, in each case as contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 6.3_. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, the term
"Person" means any Person or "group," as defined in Section 13(d) of the

Subsidiary or any of their Representatives. Except with respect to Parent,
Merger Sub, this Agreement and the Transactions, unless this Agreement has
been validly terminated pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, the Company shall
not (x) terminate (or permit the termination of), waive or amend any provision
of the Rights Agreement, (y) redeem any rights under the Rights Agreement or
(z) take any action with respect to, or make any determination under, the
Rights Agreement that would interfere with Parent and Merger Sub consummating
the Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ by the Company Board of
Directors (including any committee thereof), by any of the Companys officers,
by any of the Companys other controlled affiliates or by any of their
respective Representatives shall be a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ by
the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, any notices required to be made to
Parent pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ shall not, in and of
themselves, be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation so long as such notices
are delivered privately to Parent, except if any such notice would constitute
a Change of Recommendation pursuant to the definition thereof.

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_, if
the Company receives, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, a
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of
_Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_, which the Company Board of Directors determines in
good faith (i) after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel
and financial advisors constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (ii) after consultation with
the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to be a breach of the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, then the Company may take the following actions: (x)
furnish nonpublic information with respect to the Company to the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives (and its debt
financing sources)), if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information,
the Company receives from such Person an executed Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement and the Company also provides Parent, prior to or substantially
concurrently with the time such information is provided or made available to
such Person or its Representatives, any non-public information furnished to
such other Person or its Representatives that was not previously furnished to
Parent, and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person (and
its Representatives (and its debt financing sources)) with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal.

 



-62- (c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) notify Parent of any receipt by any director or officer of the Company
or by any of the Companys controlled affiliates, or its or their respective
Representatives, of any Acquisition Proposal or any proposals or inquiries
that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or any
inquiry or request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary by any Person who has made or could reasonably be expected
to make any an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall indicate the identity
of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request, and the
material terms and conditions of any such proposal or offer or the nature of
the information requested pursuant to such inquiry or request, including
unredacted copies of all written requests, proposals or offers, including
proposed agreements received by the Company or, if such Acquisition Proposal
is not in writing, a reasonably detailed written description of the material
terms and conditions thereof. Without limiting the Companys other
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, the Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed on a prompt and timely basis of the status and material
terms (including any amendments or proposed amendments to such material
terms) of any such Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal and
keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt and timely basis as to the nature
of any information requested of the Company with respect thereto. Without
limiting the Companys other obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, the
Company shall promptly provide (and in any event within the earlier of (i)
forty-eight (48) hours and (ii) one (1) business day) to Parent any material
nonpublic information concerning the Company provided to any other Person in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal that was not previously provided to
Parent. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in
any event within twenty-four (24) hours after such determination) inform
Parent in writing if the Company determines to begin providing information or
to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_. Unless this Agreement has been validly
terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, the Company shall not take any
action to exempt any Person other than Parent or Merger Sub from the
restrictions on "business combinations" contained in any applicable Takeover
Statute or in the Company Governing Documents, or otherwise cause such
restrictions not to apply. The Company agrees that it will not, directly or
indirectly, enter into any agreement with any Person which directly or
indirectly prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent in
accordance with, or otherwise complying with, this  _Section_ __ _ 6.3(c)_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ to the contrary,
but subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.3(e)_, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board of Directors may (i) make a
Change of Recommendation (only of the type contemplated by  _Section_ __ _
6.3(a)(iv)_, _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)(vi)_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)(viii)_ (to
the extent related to _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)(iv)_ or  _Section_ __ _
6.3(a)(vi)_)) in response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board of
Directors has determined in good faith after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably
be expected to be a breach of the directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law or (ii) make a Change of Recommendation and cause the Company to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(g)_ in
order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for an Acquisition
Proposal (that did not result from a breach of _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_), which
the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation
with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisors is a Superior
Proposal, but only if the Company Board of Directors has determined in good
faith after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be a breach of the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,

 



-63-  neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall enter into any Company
Acquisition Agreement unless this Agreement has been validly terminated in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(g)_. " _Intervening Event_ " means any
event, change or development first occurring or arising after the date hereof
that is material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (taken as a
whole) and was not known by or reasonably foreseeable to the Company Board of
Directors as of the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall the following events, changes or developments constitute an Intervening
Event: (A) the receipt, existence or terms of an Acquisition Proposal or any
matter relating thereto or consequence thereof, (B) changes in the market
price or trading volume of the Company Common Stock or any other securities of
the Company, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries, or any change in credit
rating or the fact that the Company meets or exceeds internal or published
estimates, projections, forecasts or predictions for any period (it being
understood that the facts or occurrences giving rise or contributing to such
changes may be taken into account to the extent not otherwise excluded), (C)
changes in general economic, political or financial conditions or markets
(including changes in interest rates, exchange rates, stock, bond and/or debt
prices) or (D) changes in GAAP, other applicable accounting rules or
applicable Law or, in any such case, changes in the interpretation thereof.

 

(e) Prior to the Company taking any action permitted (i) under _Section_ __ _
6.3(d)(i)_, the Company shall provide Parent with four (4) business days
prior written notice advising Parent it intends to effect a Change of
Recommendation and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor, and
during such four (4) business day period, the Company shall cause its
Representatives (including its executive officers) to negotiate in good faith
(to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) any proposal by Parent to amend
the terms and conditions of this Agreement in a manner that would obviate the
need to effect a Change of Recommendation and at the end of such four (4)
business day period the Company Board of Directors again makes all of the
required determinations under _Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)(i)_ (after in good faith
taking into account any amendments proposed by Parent) or (ii) under _Section_
__ _ 6.3(d)(ii)_, the Company shall provide Parent with four (4) business
days prior written notice advising Parent that the Company Board of
Directors intends to take such action and specifying the material terms and
conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, including a copy of any proposed
definitive documentation, and during such four (4) business day period,
the Company shall cause its Representatives (including its executive
officers) to negotiate in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) any proposal by Parent to amend the terms and conditions of this
Agreement such that such Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal and at the end of such four (4) business day period the
Company Board of Directors again makes all of the required determinations
under _Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)(ii)_ (after in good faith taking into account
the amendments proposed by Parent). With respect to _Section_ __ _
6.3(e)(ii)_, if there are any material amendments, revisions or changes to the
terms of any such Superior Proposal (including any revision to the amount,
form or mix of consideration the Company Stockholders would receive as a
result of the Superior Proposal), the Company shall comply again with
_Section_ __ _ 6.3(e)(ii)_ with references to the applicable four (4)
business day period being replaced by two (2) business days.

 



-64- (f) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board
of Directors from (i) disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or
(ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the Company
Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or
any similar statement in response to any publicly disclosed Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ that any "stop, look and listen" statement, or any such
similar statement, also includes an express reaffirmation of the Company Board
Recommendation. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(f)_ shall
not permit the Company Board of Directors to make (or otherwise modify the
definition of) a Change of Recommendation except to the extent expressly
permitted by _Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.3(e)_.

Section 7.1. _Access; Confidentiality; Notice of Certain Events_.

 

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date,
if any, on which this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 9.1_, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company shall, and
shall cause each Company Subsidiary to, afford to Parent and Parents
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice to the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries
offices, properties, Contracts, personnel, books and records and, during such
period, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to, furnish
as promptly as practicable to Parent all information (financial or otherwise)
concerning its business, properties, offices, Contracts and personnel as
Parent may reasonably request (including information for purposes of
transition and integration planning). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company shall not be required by this _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ to provide Parent
or Parents Representatives with access to or to disclose information (i) that
is prohibited from being disclosed pursuant to the terms of a confidentiality
agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date hereof (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the required consent of such third party to such access or
disclosure or, if unable to do so, to make appropriate substitute arrangements
to permit reasonable access or disclosure not in violation of such consent
requirement), (ii) the disclosure of which would violate applicable Law (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable
disclosure not in violation of such Law) or (iii) the disclosure of which
would cause the loss of any attorney-client, attorney work product or other
legal privilege ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to allow for such disclosure to the maximum extent
that does not result in a loss of such attorney-client, attorney work product
or other legal privilege); _provided_ , _however_ , that such access and
information shall be disclosed or granted, as applicable, to counsel for
Parent to the extent reasonably required for the purpose of obtaining
required approvals or consents, or making filings or providing notices,
subject to prior execution of a common interest or joint defense agreement in
customary form. Parent and the Company will cooperate to minimize to the
extent reasonably practicable any unnecessary disruption to the businesses of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that may result from the requests for
access, data and information hereunder. Any access to any properties or
facilities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be subject to the
Companys reasonable security measures and shall not include the right to
perform any "invasive" testing or soil, air or groundwater
sampling, including, without limitation, any Phase I or Phase II
environmental assessments.

 



-65- (b) Each of the Company and Parent will hold, and will cause its
Representatives and affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information, including
any information exchanged pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, in confidence
to the extent required by and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply
with, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) Promptly following the date hereof, Parent and the Company shall establish
a transition and integration planning team (the " _Integration Committee_ "),
comprised of (i) the Chief Executive Officer and/or Chief Financial Officer of
Parent, (ii) one or two other senior executives of Parent designated by the
Chief Executive Officer of Parent, (iii) the Chief Executive Officer and/or
Chief Financial Officer of the Company and (iv) one or two other senior
executives of the Company designated by the Chief Executive Officer of the
Company. The chair of the Integration Committee will be the Chief Executive
Officer of Parent or such other Person as designated by the Chief Executive
Officer of Parent. Subject to applicable Law, the Integration Committee shall
discuss and plan for a transition and integration planning process concerning
the combination of the operations of Parent, the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries after the Closing (the " _Integration Plan_ "), and shall meet
from time to time, as reasonably requested by the Chief Executive Officer of
Parent. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)_ to the
contrary and without limiting any of the obligations of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary contained elsewhere in this Agreement, prior to the
Effective Time, none of the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall
be obligated to take any action, or to refrain from taking any action, as a
result of any of the discussions or meetings of the Integration Committee or
otherwise in connection with the Integration Plan or otherwise, unless such
actions are contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing.

 

Section 7.2. _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law to consummate the Transactions, including the Merger, as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof, including (i) preparing and
filing or otherwise providing, in consultation with the other Party and as
promptly as practicable and advisable after the date hereof, all documentation
to effect all necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings, and other
documents and to obtain as promptly as practicable all waiting period
expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders,
registrations, approvals, permits, and authorizations necessary or advisable
to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order
to consummate the Transactions, including the Merger, as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof, and (ii) taking all steps as may be
necessary, subject to the limitations in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, to
obtain all such waiting period expirations or terminations, consents,
clearances, waivers, licenses, registrations, permits, authorizations, orders
and approvals as promptly as practicable after the date hereof. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party agrees to (x)
make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the
HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as practicable, and in
any event within ten (10) business days after the execution of this Agreement
(unless a later date is mutually agreed between the Parties), and to supply as
promptly as practicable and advisable any additional information and
documentary materials that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to
take all other actions necessary

 



-66-  to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods
under the HSR Act as soon as practicable, (y) make an appropriate filing with
the European Commission with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof, and to supply as promptly as practicable
and advisable any additional information and documentary materials that may be
requested by the European Commission pursuant to Antitrust Laws and, subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, to take all other actions
necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods or obtain consents under such Antitrust Laws and (z) make all
other necessary filings as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, and
to supply as promptly as practicable and advisable any additional information
and documentary materials that may be requested under any Antitrust Laws.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to, and
the Company may not and may not permit any Subsidiary to, without the prior
written consent of Parent, become subject to, consent to or offer or agree
to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition,
limitation, understanding, agreement or order to (A) sell, license, assign,
transfer, divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any assets, business
or portion of business of the Company, the Surviving Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or any Subsidiary of any of the foregoing, (B) conduct, restrict, operate,
invest or otherwise change the assets, the business or portion of
the business of the Company, the Surviving Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any
Subsidiary of any of the foregoing in any manner or (C) impose any
restriction, requirement or limitation on the operation of the business or
portion of the business of the Company, the Surviving Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or any Subsidiary of any of the foregoing; _provided_ that if requested by
Parent, the Company or its Subsidiaries will become subject to, consent to or
offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any such
requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order so long
as such requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order
is only binding on the Company or its Subsidiaries in the event the Closing
occurs.

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with and without
limiting the efforts referenced in  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ to obtain all
waiting period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers,
licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, and authorizations for
the Transactions under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, (i) cooperate
in all respects and consult with each other in connection with any filing or
submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry,
including any proceeding initiated by a private party, including by allowing
the other Party to have a reasonable opportunity to review in advance and
comment on drafts of filings and submissions and reasonably considering in
good faith comments of the other Party, (ii) promptly inform the other Party
of any communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party to,
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or any other Governmental Entity, by
promptly providing copies to the other Party of any such written
communications, and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the Transactions and (iii) permit the other Party to review in advance any
communication that it gives to, and consult with each other in advance of any
meeting, substantive telephone call or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC or
any other Governmental Entity, or, in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, with any other Person, and to the extent permitted by the DOJ,
the FTC or other applicable Governmental Entity or other Person, give the
other Party the opportunity to attend and participate in any in-person

 



-67-  meetings, substantive telephone calls or conferences with the DOJ, the FTC
or other Governmental Entity or other Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that
materials required to be provided pursuant to the foregoing clauses (i)-(iii)
may be redacted (A) to remove references concerning the valuation of Parent,
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (B) as necessary to comply
with contractual arrangements existing as of the date hereof and (C) as
necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns;
_provided_ , _further,_ that each of Parent and the Company may, as each deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other under this _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_ as
"Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Without limiting Parents cooperation
obligations described in  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ and this _Section_ __ _
7.2(b)_ (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Parents obligation to use
reasonable best efforts to take all steps as may be necessary, subject to
the limitations in this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, to obtain all such waiting
period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses,
registrations, permits, authorizations, orders and approvals as promptly
as practicable after the date hereof), Parent will control the ultimate
strategy for securing approvals and expiration of relevant waiting periods
under the Antitrust Laws.

 

(c) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall
give any notices to third parties required under Contracts, and the Company
shall use, and cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable
best efforts to obtain any third party consents to any Contracts that are
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions, including the
Merger. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any
consent or other similar fee, payment or consideration, make any other
concession or provide any additional security (including a guaranty), to
obtain such third party consents (except, in the case of the Company, if
requested by Parent and either (a) reimbursed or indemnified for by Parent or
(b) subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time).

Section 7.3. _Publicity_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, neither the
Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries, shall issue or
cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement or
disclosure with respect to the Merger, the other Transactions or this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, unless such
Party determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is required
by applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or the listing rules of a
national securities exchange or trading market to issue or cause
the publication of such press release or other public announcement or
disclosure with respect to the Merger, the other Transactions or this
Agreement, in which event such Party shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable
under the circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to the other
Party to review and comment upon such press release or other announcement or
disclosure in advance and shall give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
__ that (a) neither Party shall be required by this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ to
provide any such review or comment to the other in connection with the
Companys receipt of (and the existence of) an Acquisition Proposal or a
Change of Recommendation and matters directly related thereto and (b) the
Parties shall not be required by this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ to provide any such
review or comment to the other Party to the extent that such release,
announcement or disclosure relates to any dispute between the Parties relating
to this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that each Party and their
respective Subsidiaries and Representatives may make statements that are
consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made by Parent or the Company in compliance with this _Section_ __
_ 7.3_.

 



-68- Section 7.4. _D andO Insurance and Indemnification_.

 

(a) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, indemnify and hold
harmless all past and present directors and officers of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any
costs (including reasonable attorneys fees) and expenses (including
advancing costs (including reasonable attorneys fees) and expenses prior to
the final disposition of any actual or threatened claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law and the Company Governing Documents; _provided_ that such
Indemnified Party agrees in advance to return any such funds to which a court
of competent jurisdiction determines in a final, nonappealable judgment that
such Indemnified Party is not ultimately entitled), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with
any actual or threatened claim, action, investigation, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative process, in respect
of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger or any of the
other Transactions), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, in connection with such Persons serving or having served as an
officer, director, employee or other fiduciary of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or of any other Person if such service was at the request or for
the benefit of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law and the Company Governing Documents or
the organizational documents of the applicable Company Subsidiary (as
applicable) or any indemnification agreements with such Persons in existence
on the date of this Agreement and provided to Parent prior to the date of this
Agreement. The Parties agree that the foregoing rights to indemnification and
advancement shall also apply with respect to any action to enforce this
provision and that all rights to elimination of liability, indemnification and
advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time, now existing in favor of the Indemnified
Parties as provided in their respective certificate of incorporation or
bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) or in any indemnification
agreement in existence on the date of this Agreement and provided to Parent
prior to the date of this Agreement shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with the terms thereof.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Indemnified Party
notifies the Surviving Company on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the Effective Time of a matter in respect of which such Person intends in good
faith to seek indemnification pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_, the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ shall continue in effect with respect
to such matter until the final disposition of all claims, actions,
investigations, suits and proceedings relating thereto.

 

(b) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect the provisions in (i) the Company Governing Documents
and (ii) any indemnification agreement of the Company or a Company Subsidiary
with any Indemnified Party in existence on the date of this Agreement and
provided to Parent prior to the date of this 

 



-69-  Agreement, except to the extent that such agreement provides for an earlier
termination, in each case, regarding elimination of liability, indemnification
of officers, directors and employees and advancement of expenses that are in
existence on the date hereof, and no such provision shall be amended, modified
or repealed in any manner that would adversely affect the rights or
protections thereunder of any such Indemnified Party in respect of acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective
Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger or any of the other
Transactions). 

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a six
(6)-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing coverage
retentions, limits and other material terms substantially equivalent to the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
with respect to matters arising at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Company shall not commit or spend on such "tail"
policy, in the aggregate, more than two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the
last aggregate annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof for
the Companys current policies of directors and officers liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance (the " _Base Amount_ "), and if the cost of
such "tail" policy would otherwise exceed the Base Amount, the Company shall
be permitted to purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for the
Base Amount.

 

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and, in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_. The rights and obligations under this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.4_ shall survive consummation of the Merger and shall not be
terminated or amended in a manner that is adverse to any Indemnified Party
without the written consent of such Indemnified Party. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the Indemnified Parties shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_, each of whom may enforce the
provisions thereof.

 

Section 7.5. _Takeover Statutes_. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Voting Agreement or any of the
Transactions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Sale and the Merger),
and (b) if any such Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to any of the
foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Merger, the other
Transactions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Sale) and the
transactions contemplated by the Voting Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and the
Voting Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such
Takeover Statute on this Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the Transactions
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Sale and the Merger). No Change
of Recommendation shall change, or be deemed to change, or permit the Company
or the Company Board of Directors to change, in any manner or respect the
approval of the Company Board of Directors for purposes of causing any
Takeover Statute to be inapplicable to this Agreement, the Voting Agreement or
any of the Transactions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Sale and
the Merger).

 



-70- Section 7.6. _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement
and to consummate the Transactions, including the Merger, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

Section 7.7. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, assume, honor and
fulfill all of the Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as in
effect immediately prior to the date hereof or as subsequently amended if and
as permitted pursuant to the terms of such Company Benefit Plans and this
Agreement. Effective as of the Effective Time and for a period of twelve (12)
months thereafter, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Company
to provide, to each employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary who
continues to be employed by Parent or the Surviving Company or any Subsidiary
thereof (the " _Continuing Employees_ "), (i) at least the same wage rate or
base salary as in effect for such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) target incentive compensation opportunities (including
cash and equity compensation) and health and welfare benefits (excluding
severance) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than as in effect for
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii)
severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance benefits for
which such Continuing Employee was eligible under the Company Benefit Plans in
effect as of the date of this Agreement as set forth on Section 7.7(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter. 

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Continuing Employees after the
Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Continuing Employee shall, subject
to applicable law and applicable tax qualification requirements, be credited
with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective predecessors before the Effective Time (including, for
avoidance of doubt, any service credit provided by the Company or its
Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employee in connection with acquisitions
occurring prior to the Effective Time); _provided_ that the foregoing shall
not apply with respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension
plan or to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent that
coverage under such New Plan is of the same type as the Company Benefit Plan
in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the
Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) (A)
for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or
vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, Parent or its applicable
Subsidiary shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents and (B) Parent and its applicable Subsidiary shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing
Employee and his

 



-71-  or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old
Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New
Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.

(c) If, at least twenty (20) business days prior to the Effective Time,
Parent provides written notice to the Company directing the Company to
terminate its 401(k) plan(s), the Company shall terminate any and all 401(k)
plans effective as of the day immediately preceding the day on which the
Effective Time occurs (the " _401(k) Termination Date_ "). In the event that
Parent requests that such 401(k) plan(s) be terminated, the Company shall
provide Parent with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent that such
401(k) plan(s) have been terminated pursuant to resolution of the Companys
Board of Directors at least two (2) business days prior to the day on which
the Effective Time occurs; _provided_ that prior to terminating the Companys
401(k) plan, the Company shall provide Parent with the form and substance of
any applicable resolutions for review (and the Company shall consider any of
Parents comments in good faith). If the Company 401(k) plan is terminated
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.7(c)_, then as soon as practicable
following the 401(k) Termination Date, Parent shall permit all Continuing
Employees who were eligible to participate in the Company 401(k)
plan immediately prior to the 401(k) Termination Date to participate in
Parents 401(k) plan, and shall permit each such Continuing Employee to elect
to transfer his or her account balance when distributed from the terminated
Company 401(k) plan, including any outstanding participant loans, to Parents
401(k) plan, except to the extent that accepting such transfers would
adversely affect the tax-qualified status of Parents 401(k) plan or as may
be prohibited by Parents 401(k) plan.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Parent or any affiliate of
Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent or
any affiliate of Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to
discharge or terminate the services of any Continuing Employee at any time
for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, except to the extent
expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between Parent, the
Company or any affiliate of Parent and the Continuing Employee or any
severance, benefit or other applicable plan or program covering such
Continuing Employee, or any collective bargaining agreement or similar labor
agreement with any labor organization, work council or trade union covering
such Continuing Employee. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ shall (i) be
deemed or construed to be an amendment or other modification of any Company
Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan of Parent or Merger Sub, and (ii)
create any third party rights in any current or former employee or other
service provider of the Company or its affiliates (or any beneficiaries or
dependents thereof).

 

Section 7.8. _Rule_ __ _ 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable hereto
to cause any dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative
securities) pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director
or officer of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



-72- Section 7.9. _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall provide Parent prompt
notice of any litigation brought by any stockholder of the Company or
purported stockholder of the Company against the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective directors or officers relating to
the Merger or any of the other Transactions or this Agreement, and shall keep
Parent informed on a prompt and timely basis with respect to the status
thereof. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate (at
Parents expense) in the defense or settlement of any such litigation and
reasonably cooperate with Parent in conducting the defense or settlement of
such litigation, and no such settlement shall be agreed without Parents prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
except that Parent may, in its sole discretion, withhold such consent to any
settlement which does not include a full release of Parent and its affiliates
(including the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries) with respect to
all liabilities, causes of action and claims arising out of, or related to,
the claims asserted in such litigation or which imposes an injunction or other
equitable relief after the Effective Time upon Parent or any of its affiliates
(including the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries). In the event of, and
to the extent of, any conflict or overlap between the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 7.9_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ or  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.9_ shall control.

Section 7.10.  _Delisting_. Each of the Parties agrees to cooperate with the
other Parties in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to
delist the Company Common Stock from NASDAQ and terminate its registration
under the Exchange Act;  _provided_ that such delisting and termination shall
not be effective until at or after the Effective Time.

Section 7.11.  _Director Resignations_. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent
resignations executed by each director of the Company in office as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and effective upon the Effective
Time, and the Company shall cooperate with Parent in preparing for the
replacement, upon the Effective Time, of directors and officers of the Company
Subsidiaries with those Persons designated by Parent.

 

Section 7.12. _Proxy Statement; Company Stockholders_ __ _Meeting_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable, and no later than ten (10) business
days following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare, in
consultation with Parent, and file with the SEC the preliminary Proxy
Statement. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)_, the Company and the Board of
Directors shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the proxy
statement to be filed with the SEC in connection with seeking Company
Stockholder Approval (including the letter to stockholders, notice of meeting
and form of proxy, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). Each of the Company and
Parent shall furnish all information concerning itself and its affiliates
that is required to be included in the Proxy Statement or that is customarily
included in proxy statements prepared in connection with transactions of the
type contemplated by this Agreement, and each of the Company and Parent
covenants that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for
inclusion or incorporation in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it or any
amendment or supplement thereto is filed with the SEC or mailed to the
Companys stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of
the

 



-73-  circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any
comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall
promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its
staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements
to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall give Parent and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement, including
all amendments and supplements thereto, prior to filing such documents with
the SEC or disseminating them to holders of Shares and a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on all responses to requests for additional
information, and shall consider any comments proposed by Parent in good faith.
The Company will cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable, and in no event more than
five (5) business days, after the expiration of the ten (10)-day waiting
period provided in Rule 14a-6(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or the
date on which the Company learns the SEC staff has no further comments on the
Proxy Statement. If, at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting,
any information relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective
affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the Company or
Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Parties and correct such
information, and the Company shall file an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information with the SEC.

further comments on the Proxy Statement, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval (the " _Company Stockholders_ __ _Meeting_ ")
with a record date and meeting date to be selected after reasonable
consultation with Parent, and, subject to a Change of Recommendation in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)_, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval. Within
three (3) business days after the date of this Agreement (and thereafter, upon

adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting if (i) the Company is required to
postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting by applicable Law, or
(ii) the Board of Directors or any authorized committee thereof shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
it is necessary or appropriate to postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting in order to give Company Stockholders sufficient time
to evaluate any information or disclosure that the Company has sent or
otherwise made available to such holders by issuing a press release, filing
materials with the SEC or otherwise (including in connection with any Change
of Recommendation) (in each case so long as any such information or
disclosure was made in compliance with this Agreement); _provided_ that the
Company shall be permitted to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders
Meeting pursuant to this clause (ii) on no more than two occasions and no
such adjournment or postponement shall delay the Company Stockholders Meeting

this Agreement to the stockholders of the Company for adoption at the Company
Stockholders Meeting and shall not submit any Acquisition Proposal for
approval by the stockholders of the Company.

awards, judgments, penalties and amounts paid in settlement suffered or
incurred by them in connection with their cooperation in arranging the
Financing pursuant to this Agreement, the provision of information utilized in
connection therewith (other than written information provided by or on behalf
of the Company) and the cooperation contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 7.14_,
other than to the extent any such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs,

Company Credit Agreements, the repayment in full of all obligations, if
any, outstanding thereunder, the release of all Liens, if any, securing such

 



-77-  obligations, and the release of guarantees in connection therewith on the
Closing Date as of the Effective Time (such termination, repayment and
releases, the " _Credit Facility Terminations_ "). In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company

case, with respect to each of the Company Credit Agreements (each, a " _Payoff
Letter_ ") in form and substance customary for transactions of this type,
from the applicable agent on behalf of the Persons to whom such Indebtedness
is owed, which Payoff Letters together with any related release documentation
shall, among other things, include the payoff amount and provide that Liens
(and guarantees), if any, granted in connection therewith relating to the
assets, rights and properties of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries

be provided to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries funds (or Parent has
directed the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries to use funds on
their balance sheet) to pay in full the then-outstanding principal amount of
and accrued and unpaid interest and fees under each Company Credit Agreement.

(b) _Company Notes_. Upon written request of Parent, the Company shall, and
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, as applicable, (i) execute and

of Sections 5.1, 10.4 and 10.5 of the Indenture applicable to each series of
the Companys outstanding senior notes (the " _Company Notes_ ") in connection
with the Merger, and (ii) provide all assistance reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with obtaining the execution of such instruments by the
other parties required to execute such instruments and take any other actions
reasonably requested by Parent (which shall not require any payment by the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries) that are customary or necessary in
connection therewith, including the execution and delivery by the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries or their Representatives (as applicable) of customary
officers certificates, supplemental indentures and legal opinions,
respectively, to the trustee under the applicable Indenture, to the extent
such certificates, supplemental indentures and opinions are required thereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Company nor the Company Subsidiaries
shall be required to execute and deliver any document or instrument (or cause
any document or instrument to be executed or delivered) (i) that would be
inaccurate in light of the facts and circumstances at the time delivered, or
(ii) not conditioned on or delivered substantially concurrently with the
occurrence of the Effective Time.

 



-78- Section 7.15. _Quarterly Dividends_. For the avoidance of doubt, following
the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall remain responsible for the
payment of, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to pay, the
applicable Quarterly Dividend declared by the Company Board of Directors in
compliance with this Agreement and applicable Law and that has a record date
prior to the Effective Time and a payment date after the Effective Time so
long as the Company had sufficient legally available funds to pay such
Quarterly Dividend prior to the Effective Time;  _provided_ that nothing in
this _Section_ __ _ 7.15_ shall permit the Company or the Company Board of
Directors from taking any action prohibited by _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)(ii)_.

 

Section 7.16. _Sale and Purchase of Treasury Shares_.

 

(a) _Sale and Purchase_. Immediately prior to, and subject to the occurrence
of, the Effective Time, the Company shall issue and sell to Parent, and
Parent shall purchase, all of the Treasury Shares for per share consideration
equal to the Merger Consideration, payable by Parent to the Company either (at
Parents election) in cash or a promissory note in the form attached
hereto as _Annex B_ (the " _Sale_ ").

(b) _Reports_. The Company shall provide to Parent written reports, on each of
the first (1st) and fifteenth (15th) day of every month and on the second
(2nd) business day prior to the anticipated Closing Date, setting forth the
number of Treasury Shares as of the date immediately prior to the date of such

9.1(e)_ _(i)_ or (B) _ Section_ __ _ 9.1(e)_ _(ii)_ (in the case of this
clause (B) if the Company has materially and willfully breached  _Section_ __
_ 6.3_), within two (2) business days after such termination, the Company
shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee.

 

(iv) If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.1(g)_, substantially concurrently with or prior to (and as a condition to)
such termination, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent the
Termination Fee.

(v) In the event any amount is payable by the Company pursuant to the
preceding clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv), such amount shall be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by
Parent. Parent shall promptly provide wire transfer instructions in writing
to the Company upon request (and in any event with sufficient time to allow
the Company to pay or cause to be paid to Parent any Termination Fee payable
hereunder within the time periods required by this  _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_).
For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay
the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 



-83- (vi) Solely for purposes of _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)(i)_ and  _Section_ __ _
9.2(b)(ii)_, the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned
to such term in _Section_ __ _ 1.1_, except that all references to "fifteen
percent (15%)" and "eighty-five percent (85%)" therein shall be deemed to be
references to "fifty percent (50%)."

(c) Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section_
__ _ 9.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without these
agreements, the Parties hereto would not enter into this Agreement. Each Party
further acknowledges that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and
Merger Sub in the circumstances in which the Termination Fee is payable for
the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transactions. In addition, if the
Company fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 9.2(b)_, then (i) the Company shall reimburse Parent for all costs and
expenses (including disbursements and fees of counsel) incurred in the
collection of such overdue amounts, including in connection with any related
claims, actions or proceedings commenced and (ii) the Company shall pay to
Parent interest on the amounts payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_
from and including the date payment of such amounts was due to but excluding
the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in _The Wall Street
Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, upon Parents
receipt of the full Termination Fee (and any other amounts contemplated by
this _Section_ __ _ 9.2(c)_) pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ in
circumstances in which the Termination Fee is payable, none of the Company,
any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective former, current or future
officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, affiliates or
agents shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the Transactions, except for fraud or willful breach
(as defined in _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_).

Section 10.5. _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." As used in this Agreement, the term "affiliates" shall
have the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. The word
"extent" and the phrase "to the extent" when used in this Agreement shall
mean the degree to which a subject or other things extends, and such word or
phrase shall not merely mean "if." The term "or" is not exclusive. The phrases
"the date of this Agreement," "the date hereof," "of even date herewith" and
terms of similar import, shall be deemed to refer to the date set forth in the
preamble to this Agreement. The table of contents and headings set forth in
this Agreement or any schedule delivered pursuant to this Agreement are for
convenience of reference purposes only and shall not affect or be deemed to
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or such
schedule or any term or provision hereof or thereof. All references herein to
the Subsidiaries of a Person shall be deemed to include all direct and
indirect Subsidiaries of such Person unless otherwise indicated or the context
otherwise requires. The Parties agree that they have been represented
by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and,
therefore, waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of
construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will
be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

Section 10.6. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed manually or
by facsimile or by other electronic transmission by the Parties, in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when a counterpart hereof shall have been
signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties. The
exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by
electronic transmission in .pdf format or by facsimile shall be sufficient to
bind the Parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



-86- Section 10.7. _Entire Agreement; Third_ __ _-Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter) and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all other
prior agreements (except that the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed
amended hereby so that until the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, Parent and Merger Sub shall be permitted to take
the actions contemplated by this Agreement) and understandings, both written
and oral, among the Parties or any of them with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof.

(b) Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.13_,
nothing in this Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter) or in the
Confidentiality Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any
Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder or thereunder.

 

Section 10.8. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner adverse to any
Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
Merger is fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 10.9. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

(a) This Agreement, and all claims, causes of action (whether in contract,
tort or statute) or other matter that may directly or indirectly result from,
arise out of, be in connection with or relating to this Agreement or the other
agreements delivered in connection herewith, or the execution or performance
of this Agreement or such other agreements, or the Merger or the other
Transactions (the " _Relevant Matters_ ") shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect
to conflicts of laws principles that would result in the application of the
Law of any other state.

(b) Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it
lacks jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of America sitting
in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to any Relevant Matter or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any
such action or proceeding except in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it lacks jurisdiction, the
Federal court of the United States of America sitting in Delaware, and any
appellate court from any thereof; (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of
any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it
lacks jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of America sitting
in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof; (iii) waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and

 



-87-  effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in such courts; and (iv)
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in such
courts. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by applicable Law. Each Party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to
service of process inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the
courts referred to in this  _Section_ __ _ 10.9(b)_ in the manner provided
for notices in _Section_ __ _ 10.4_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect
the right of any Party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner
permitted by applicable Law.

Section 10.10. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE
RELEVANT MATTERS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION_ __
_ 10.10_.

 

Section 10.11. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of
the Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other Parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, but
without relieving any Party of any obligation hereunder, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

Section 10.12. _Enforcement; Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such
Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable injury will occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or is otherwise breached. It is agreed that prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article_ __ _ IX_, each Party
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or remedy any
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by any other Party, to a
decree or order of specific performance specifically enforcing the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and to any further equitable relief.

 

(c) The Parties rights in this _Section_ __ _ 10.12_ are an integral part of
the Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to any remedy
referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 10.12_ (including any objection on the
basis that there is an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of such remedy
is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity). For

 



-88-  the avoidance of doubt, each Party agrees that there is not an adequate
remedy at Law for a breach of this Agreement by any Party. In the event any
Party seeks any remedy referred to in this  _Section_ __ _ 10.12_, such
Party shall not be required to obtain, furnish, post or provide any bond or
other security in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any such
remedy.

 

Section 10.13. _Certain Financing Provisions_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Company on behalf of itself, the Company
Subsidiaries and each of its controlled affiliates hereby: (a) agrees that any
Proceedings, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, involving the Financing Parties, arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, the Financing or any of the agreements (including any
applicable commitment letter) entered into in connection with the Financing or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of
any services thereunder shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
Federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, so
long as such forum is and remains available, and any appellate court thereof
and each Party hereto irrevocably submits itself and its property with
respect to any such Proceedings to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court;
(b) agrees that any such Proceeding shall be governed by the laws of the State
of New York (without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles that
would result in the application of the laws of another state), except as
otherwise provided in any applicable commitment letter or other applicable
definitive document relating to the Financing; (c) agrees not to bring or
support or permit any of its controlled affiliates to bring or support any
Proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing Party in any
way arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Financing, any
commitment letter relating thereto or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder in any forum
other than any Federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York,
New York; (d) irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent that it may
effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such Proceedings in any such court; (e) knowingly, intentionally and
voluntarily waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law trial by
jury in any Proceedings brought against the Financing Parties in any way
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Financing, any commitment
letter relating thereto or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or the performance of any services thereunder; (f) agrees that neither
the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective affiliates or Representatives (in each case, other than Parent,
Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries) shall have any rights or claims
against any Financing Party in connection with this Agreement, the Financing,
any commitment letter relating thereto or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby; (g) agrees that none of the Financing Parties
will have any liability to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or
any of their respective affiliates or Representatives (in each case, other
than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries) relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, the Financing, any commitment letter relating
thereto or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the
performance of any services thereunder, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise; and (h) agrees that (and each other Party
hereto agrees that) the Financing Parties are express third
party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, any of the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 10.13_, and such provisions and the definition of "Financing
Parties" shall not be amended in any way materially adverse to the
Financing Parties without the prior written consent of the Financing
Entities.
