Conversion of Aztar Preferred Stock. Subject to Section 2.03(e), each issued
and outstanding share of Aztar Preferred Stock (other than shares to be

shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration upon the surrender of such
certificate in accordance with Section 2.03, without interest.   (d)

value $.01 per share, are issued and outstanding) shall be converted into one
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable share
of common stock, $.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation so
that, after the Effective Time, Columbia shall be the holder of all of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

interest accrued thereon, the "Custodial Assets") with Deutsche Bank Trust
Company Americas (the "Custodian"), pursuant to a custody and security
agreement dated as of the date hereof and attached hereto as Exhibit A (the
"Custody and Security Agreement") executed and delivered by each of Sussex,
Columbia, Merger Sub, Aztar and the Custodian. At the Closing, the Custodial
Assets then being held by the Custodian shall be credited against the Payment
Fund (as defined below) and such Custodial Assets shall be promptly released
and paid by the Custodian to the Paying Agent (as defined below) pursuant to
this Section 2.02(a) and the terms of the Custody and Security Agreement.
Upon the termination of this Agreement, the Custodial Assets shall be payable
pursuant to Section 5.07(d) hereof, and thereafter shall be promptly released
by the Custodian to Aztar or Sussex, as the case may be, pursuant to Section
5.07(d) hereof and the terms of the Custody and Security Agreement.   (b)
Aztar, Sussex, Columbia, and Merger Sub agree to execute and be bound by such
other reasonable and customary instructions as may be necessary or reasonably
required by the Custodian or the parties hereto in order to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or
otherwise to distribute and pay the funds as provided in this Agreement
and the Custody and Security Agreement; provided, that such instructions
are consistent with the terms of this Agreement and the Custody and
Security Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and
provisions of such supplemental instructions and the terms and provisions of
this Agreement, or any inconsistency between the terms and provisions of the
Custody and Security Agreement and the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall control, absent
an express written agreement between the parties hereto to the contrary which
acknowledges this Section 2.02(b).   4    Section 2.03 Exchange of
Certificates.   (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Columbia
shall enter into an agreement with such bank or trust company as may be
mutually agreed by Columbia and Aztar (the "Paying Agent"), pursuant to which
Columbia shall deposit with the Paying Agent at the Effective Time, for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Aztar Common Stock and Aztar Preferred
Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, through the Paying
Agent, cash representing the Common Stock Merger Consideration payable to
holders of shares of Aztar Common Stock and cash representing the Preferred
Stock Merger Consideration payable to holders of shares of Aztar Preferred
Stock (the "Payment Fund").  (b) Payment Procedures. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Aztar Common Stock or
Aztar Preferred Stock (the "Certificates") whose shares were converted into
the right to receive cash pursuant to Section 2.01, (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Columbia may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions
for use in surrendering the Certificates in exchange for the applicable
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor,
in the case of Certificates formerly representing shares of Aztar Common
Stock, the Common Stock Merger Consideration, without interest, and in the
case of Certificates formerly representing shares of Aztar Preferred
Stock, the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, without interest, in each
case that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of
this Article II, and, in each case, the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Aztar
Common Stock or Aztar Preferred Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of Aztar, the applicable Merger Consideration may be issued to a
person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered only if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise
be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such issuance shall
pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of the
applicable Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder
of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Columbia that such
tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 2.03, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
applicable Merger Consideration, which the holder thereof has the right to
receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on the Merger
Consideration or any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II.   (c) No Further Ownership Rights in Aztar
Capital Stock. All cash payments of Merger Consideration upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Aztar Common Stock or Aztar Preferred Stock, as
the case may be, theretofore represented by such Certificates, and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
Aztar of the shares of Aztar Common Stock or Aztar Preferred Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective   5   Time, Certificates are presented to Columbia, Aztar or
the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II, except as otherwise provided by law.   (d)
Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains
undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Columbia, upon demand, and any
holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to Columbia for payment of their claims
for Merger Consideration.   (e) No Liability. None of Columbia, Aztar or
the Paying Agent or any of their respective directors, officers, employees
and agents shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash representing
the Merger Consideration or any cash from the Payment Fund, in each case
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered
prior to two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such
earlier date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Authority (as defined in Section
3.01(d)), any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of Columbia, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.   (f) Investment of
Payment Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment
Fund, as directed by Columbia, on a daily basis, in Permitted Investments (as
defined in Section 8.03) or as otherwise consented to by Aztar prior to the
Effective Time (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid
to Columbia.   (g) Withholding Rights. Columbia and the Paying Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any person who was a holder of Aztar Common Stock or Aztar
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, immediately prior to the Effective Time
such amounts as Columbia and the Paying Agent may be required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or any other provision of
applicable federal, state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Columbia or the Paying Agent and duly paid over to
the applicable taxing authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such
consideration would otherwise have been paid.   (h) Lost, Stolen or
Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Columbia, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
Columbia may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Agreement.   6    (i) Adjustments to
Prevent Dilution. In the event that Aztar changes the number of shares of
Aztar Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for shares of Aztar Common Stock, or shares of Aztar Preferred
Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for
shares of Aztar Preferred Stock, issued and outstanding prior to the
Effective Time, in each case as a result of a reclassification, stock
split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or
distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or
exchange offer, or other transaction, the applicable Merger Consideration
shall be equitably adjusted.   Section 2.04 Dissenting Shares. Any holder of
shares of Aztar Common Stock or Aztar Preferred Stock who shall have
exercised rights to dissent with respect to the Merger in accordance with the
DGCL and who has properly exercised such holder\'s rights to demand payment
of the "fair value" of the holder\'s shares of Aztar Common Stock or Aztar
Preferred Stock, as the case may be (the "Aztar Dissenting Shares") as
provided in the DGCL (the "Aztar Dissenting Stockholder") shall thereafter
have only such rights, if any, as are provided a dissenting stockholder in
accordance with the DGCL and shall have no rights to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01; provided, however, that if a Aztar
Dissenting Stockholder shall fail to properly demand payment (in accordance
with the DGCL) or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such rights to
relief as a Aztar Dissenting Stockholder under the DGCL, then such Aztar
Dissenting Stockholder\'s Aztar Dissenting Shares automatically shall
cease to be Aztar Dissenting Shares and shall be converted into and represent
only the right to receive, upon surrender of the Certificate representing the
Aztar Dissenting Shares, the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.01, without interest.   ARTICLE III   Representations and
Warranties   Section 3.01 Representations and Warranties of Aztar. Except as
and to the extent set forth in the letter dated the date of this Agreement
and delivered to Columbia by Aztar concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement (the "Aztar Disclosure Letter") and, to the extent
the qualifying nature of such disclosure is readily apparent therefrom,
except as and to the extent set forth in the Aztar Reports (as defined in
Section 3.01(e)) filed on or after January 1, 2006 and prior to the date
hereof or in Aztar\'s definitive proxy statement for its 2006 Annual Meeting
of Stockholders (excluding, in each case, any disclosures set forth in any
risk factor section, in any section relating to forward looking statements
and any other disclosures included therein to the extent that they are
cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), Aztar represents and
warrants to Columbia and Merger Sub as follows:   (a) Organization and
Qualification. Each of Aztar and its subsidiaries is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization and has full power and authority to conduct its business as and
to the extent now conducted and to own, use and lease its assets and
properties, except for such failures to be so organized, existing and in good
standing or to have such power and authority that, individually or in
the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be   7   expected
to have a material adverse effect (as defined in Section 8.03) on Aztar. Each
of Aztar and its subsidiaries is duly qualified, licensed or admitted to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership,
use or leasing of its assets and properties, or the conduct or nature of its
business, makes such qualification, licensing or admission necessary, except
for such failures to be so qualified, licensed or admitted and in good
standing that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Aztar. Except
as set forth in Section 3.01(a) of the Aztar Disclosure Letter, none of Aztar
or any of its subsidiaries is a party to any agreement, arrangement
or understanding relating to the securities of Aztar or any of its
subsidiaries, including with respect to the voting, holding, issuance,
purchase, sale or registration thereof or entitling any party to any put or
call rights, rights of first offer, rights of first refusal, tag-along or
drag-along rights or any similar rights or obligations, or to any agreement,
arrangement or understanding providing for any governance, veto or similar
rights with respect to Aztar or any of its subsidiaries.   (b) Capital
Stock.   (i) The authorized capital stock of Aztar consists of:   (A)
100,000,000 shares of Aztar Common Stock, of which  36,158,655 shares were
issued and outstanding as of the date of  this Agreement; and   (B) 100,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $.01 per  share, of which 44,689.657
shares of Aztar Preferred Stock were  issued or outstanding as of the date of
this Agreement.   As of May 12, 2006, 18,871,010 shares of Aztar Common
Stock and no shares of Aztar Preferred Stock were held in the treasury of
Aztar.   (ii) A true and correct copy of each of the 1989 Stock Option  and
Incentive Plan, 1999 Employee Stock Option and Incentive Plan, 2004  Employee
Stock Option and Incentive Plan, 1990 Nonemployee Directors  Stock Option
Plan and 2000 Nonemployee Directors Stock Option Plan, in  each case as
currently in effect and reflecting all amendments thereto  (collectively, the
"Aztar Employee Stock Plans") has been delivered or  made available to
Columbia prior to the date hereof. As of the date of  this Agreement, (x)
3,257,663 shares of Aztar Common Stock were subject  to outstanding Aztar
Employee Stock Options (as defined in Section  5.04(a)) and (y) no shares of
Aztar Common Stock were the subject of  other rights (whether contingent,
accrued or otherwise), to acquire or  receive shares of Aztar Common Stock or
benefits measured by the value  of shares of Aztar Common Stock or otherwise
representing an award of  any kind consisting of shares of Aztar Common Stock
under the Aztar  Employee Stock Plans (the items in this clause (y), the
"Aztar  Awards"). The Aztar Employee Stock Plans are the only plans or
other  obligations of Aztar or any of its subsidiaries with respect to
Aztar  Awards or Aztar Employee Stock Options. Aztar has no shares of
capital  stock reserved for issuance, except that, as of May 12, 2006,
there  were an aggregate of 3,073,494 shares of Aztar Common Stock reserved 
for issuance pursuant to the Aztar Employee Stock Plans, including  3,073,494
shares in respect of   8    Aztar Employee Stock Options and no shares in
respect of Aztar Awards,  an aggregate of 472,656 shares of Aztar Common
Stock reserved for  issuance upon conversion of the Aztar Preferred Stock and
an aggregate  of 50,000 shares of preferred stock reserved for issuance in
connection  with the Rights Agreement (as defined in Section 3.01(p)).
Section  3.01(b)(ii) of the Aztar Disclosure Letter contains a correct and 
complete list as of May 12, 2006 of (i) the number of outstanding Aztar 
Employee Stock Options under each of the Aztar Employee Stock Plans,  the
holders of such Aztar Employee Stock Options (if such holder is or  was an
executive officer of Aztar), the exercise price of all Aztar  Employee Stock
Options and the number of shares of Aztar Common Stock  issuable at each such
exercise price, and (ii) the number of  outstanding Aztar Awards under each
of the Aztar Employee Stock Plans  and the holders of such Aztar Awards. From
May 12, 2006 to the date  hereof, Aztar has not issued any shares of Aztar
Common Stock except  pursuant to the exercise of Aztar Employee Stock Options
and the  settlement of Aztar Awards, in each case outstanding on May 12,
2006,  in accordance with their respective terms. From May 12, 2006 through 
the date hereof, neither Aztar nor any of its subsidiaries has granted  or
issued any Aztar Employee Stock Options or Aztar Awards. All Aztar  Employee
Stock Options vest at the Effective Time pursuant to the terms  of the Aztar
Employee Stock Plans as in effect on the date hereof.   (iii) All of the
issued and outstanding shares of Aztar Common  Stock are, and all shares
reserved for issuance will be, upon issuance  in accordance with the terms
specified in the instruments or agreements  pursuant to which they are
issuable, duly authorized, validly issued,  fully paid and nonassessable. All
of the issued and outstanding shares  of Aztar Preferred Stock are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully  paid and nonassessable.   (iv) Except as
disclosed in this Section 3.01(b) and except  for this Agreement, as of the
date of this Agreement, there are no  outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, rights (including stock  appreciation rights), preemptive rights,
redemption rights, repurchase  rights or other contracts, commitments,

Code  or Section 406 of ERISA.   (viii) All contributions, premiums and

set forth in Section 3.01(l)(ix) of the Aztar  Disclosure Letter, neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement  nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement, whether alone, or in connection
with any other event will  (A) result in the acceleration of the time of
payment of or vesting in,  or an increase in the amount of, compensation or
benefits due any  current or former employee, director or officer of Aztar or
its  subsidiaries (including any equity compensation), (B) result in any 
forgiveness of indebtedness or obligation to fund benefits with respect  to
any such employee, director or officer or (C) result in any payment  or any
entitlement to payment (including, but not limited to, any  retention
bonuses, parachute payments or noncompetition payments)  becoming due to any

any director or former director or (D) result  in the payment of any "excess
parachute payment" within the meaning of  Section 280G of the Code with
respect to a current or former employee  of Aztar or any of its subsidiaries.
Section 3.01(l)(ix) of the Aztar  Disclosure Letter sets forth a good-faith
estimate of the amount of any  estimated severance payment (including
estimated gross-up payments, if  applicable) owed under the Aztar Employment
Agreements with the five  most highly compensated Company Employees (as
defined in Section  5.05(a)) employed at Aztar\'s corporate headquarters due

Section 3.01(m) of the Aztar Disclosure Letter, neither Aztar nor any of its
subsidiaries is a party to or bound by, as of   19   the date hereof,
any of the following (whether or not in writing), collectively with all
exhibits and schedules to such Contracts:   (i) any agreement or series of
related agreement providing for  the acquisition or disposition of securities
of any person or any  assets, in each case involving more than $1,000,000
individually or in  the aggregate, other than in the ordinary course of
business consistent  with past practice or in connection with the capital
expenditure  budgets included in Section 4.01(a)(xi) of the Aztar Disclosure
Letter;   (ii) any Contract that imposes payment, cancellation penalties 
or other obligations in connection with the redevelopment or future 
operation (other than ordinary course hotel operations) of all or any 
portion of Aztar\'s property, facility or operations in Las Vegas,  Nevada
(the "Las Vegas Site");   (iii) any Contract or commitment relating to
indebtedness for  borrowed money or the deferred purchase price of property
(in either  case, whether incurred, assumed, guaranteed or secured by any
asset) in  excess of $1,000,000; and   (iv) any Contract that would be
required to be filed as an  exhibit to an Annual Report on Form 10-K pursuant
to Item 601(b)(10) of  Regulation S-K under the Securities Act; (the
Contracts described in  clauses (i) - (iv), together with all exhibits and
schedules to such  Contracts, being the "Material Contracts").   A true and
complete copy of each Material Contract has previously been delivered or made
available to Columbia. Except as individually or in the aggregate has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
Aztar, each Contract by which Aztar or its subsidiaries is bound is a valid
and binding agreement of Aztar or one of its subsidiaries enforceable against
Aztar or one of its subsidiaries, and, to the knowledge of Aztar, the
counterparties thereto in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects
of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium
and other similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally
and to equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding at law or in
equity). Aztar and its subsidiaries are not (and to the knowledge of Aztar,
no counterparty is) in breach or violation of or in default in
the performance or observance of any term or provision of, and no event has
occurred which, with lapse of time or action by a third party or Aztar, would
result in a default under, any Contract to which Aztar or any of its
subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound or to which any of
their property is subject, other than breaches, violations and defaults which
have not had and would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on Aztar. The execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by Aztar do not, and the
consummation by Aztar of the Merger and the compliance by Aztar with the
provisions of this Agreement will not, constitute or result in, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, a material breach or violation of, a
material default under, or the creation of a Lien on any of the assets of
Aztar or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to the Pinnacle Agreement. Aztar
has in all material respects complied with its obligations under the Pinnacle
Agreement, and the Pinnacle Agreement has been terminated in accordance with
the terms thereof.   20    (n) Title to Assets. Except as set forth in
Section 3.01(n) of the Aztar Disclosure Letter, Aztar and each of its
subsidiaries has good and valid title in fee simple to all their owned real
property, as reflected in the most recent balance sheet included in the
Audited Financial Statements included in the Aztar Reports, except for
properties and assets that have been disposed of in the ordinary course of
business since the date of such balance sheet, free and clear of all
mortgages, liens, pledges, charges or encumbrances of any nature whatsoever,
except (i) liens for current taxes, payments of which are not yet delinquent
or are being disputed in good faith, (ii) such imperfections in title and
easements and encumbrances, if any, as are not substantial in character,
amount or extent and do not materially detract from the value, or interfere
with the present use, or Aztar\'s intended use as of the date hereof, of the
property subject thereto or affected thereby, or otherwise materially impair
Aztar\'s business operations (in the manner presently carried on by Aztar or
intended, as of the date hereof, to be carried on by Aztar), or (iii)
for such matters which have not had and would not reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect
on Aztar. Aztar and each of its subsidiaries have good and valid leasehold
interests in all real property leased by them. All leases under which Aztar
or any of its subsidiaries leases any real or personal property are in good
standing, valid and effective against Aztar, and to Aztar\'s knowledge the
counterparties thereto, in accordance with their respective terms, and there
is not, under any of such leases, any existing default by Aztar, or to
Aztar\'s knowledge the counterparties thereto, or event which with notice or
lapse of time or both would become a default by Aztar or to Aztar\'s
knowledge the counterparties thereto other than failures to be in good
standing, valid and effective and defaults under such leases which have not
had and would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate,
to have a material adverse effect on Aztar.   (o) Environmental Matters.

2002, each of Aztar and its subsidiaries has been continuously insured with
financially responsible insurers or has self-insured, in each case, except as
set forth on Section 3.01(r) of the Aztar Disclosure Letter, in such amounts

Warranties of Sussex and Columbia . Except as and to the extent set forth in
the letter dated the date of this Agreement and delivered to Aztar by
Columbia concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the
"Columbia Disclosure Letter"), Sussex and Columbia jointly and severally
represent and warrant to Aztar as follows:   24    (a) Financing
Commitments. Columbia has obtained written commitments (the "Financing
Commitments") for the financing necessary to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby (including any refinancing of
indebtedness of Aztar or Columbia or any of their respective
subsidiaries which Columbia deems is advisable to refinance in connection
with the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby) and to pay all associated fees, costs and expenses (the "Financing").
Columbia has provided true, accurate and complete copies of such commitments
to Aztar. None of the Financing Commitments has been amended, modified or
terminated prior to the date of this Agreement, and the respective
commitments contained in the Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn or
rescinded in any respect. As of the date hereof, the Financing Commitments
are in full force and effect and (based on and assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Aztar in this Agreement and the compliance
by Aztar with its obligations hereunder) no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time (other than the expiration of the term thereof)
or both, would constitute a default on the part of Columbia under any of the
Financing Commitments. There are no conditions precedent or other
contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing,
other than as set forth in or contemplated by the Financing Commitments. The
aggregate proceeds to be disbursed pursuant to the agreements contemplated by
the Financing Commitments, together with Columbia\'s and Aztar\'s cash and
cash equivalents, will be sufficient for Columbia to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration and to consummate the Consent/Tender Offers (as defined in
Section 4.01(c)), if any (and any other repayment or refinancing of debt
contemplated in this Agreement or the Financing Commitments), and to pay all
related fees and expenses. Based on and assuming the accuracy of
the representations and warranties of Aztar in this Agreement and the
compliance by Aztar with its obligations hereunder, Columbia has no reason as
of the date hereof to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing
contemplated by the Financing Commitments will not be satisfied or that the
Financing will not be made available to Columbia on or prior to the Closing
Date. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Columbia from amending or
modifying the Financing Commitments or from seeking to raise equity or other
alternative sources of funds prior to the Closing, as long as such amendment
or modification or other action does not prevent, delay or reduce the
likelihood of the consummation of the Merger.   (b) Solvency. As of the
Effective Time and after giving effect to all of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration, the Financing, consummation of the Consent/Tender Offers, if
any (and any other repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated in this
Agreement or the Financing Commitments), and payment of all related fees and
expenses, and assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
Aztar in this Agreement and the compliance by Aztar with its obligations
hereunder, the Surviving Corporation (on a combined basis with
its subsidiaries) will be solvent (as defined in Section 8.03).   (c)
Organization. Each of Sussex, Columbia and their respective subsidiaries is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization and has full power and authority to conduct its
business as and to the extent now conducted and to own, use and lease its
assets and properties, except for such failures to be so organized, existing
and in good standing or to have such power and authority that, individually
or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have a material   25   adverse effect (as defined in Section 8.03) on
Sussex and Columbia, taken as a whole. Each of Sussex, Columbia and their
respective subsidiaries is duly qualified, licensed or admitted to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership,
use or leasing of its assets and properties, or the conduct or nature of its
business, makes such qualification, licensing or admission necessary, except
for such failures to be so qualified, licensed or admitted and in good
standing that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Sussex and
Columbia, taken as a whole.   (d) Authority. Each of Sussex, Columbia and
Merger Sub has full corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by each of Sussex, Columbia and Merger Sub and the
consummation by each of Sussex, Columbia and Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly and validly unanimously adopted and
approved by the Board of Directors of each of Sussex, Columbia and Merger Sub
and by Columbia as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub. No other corporate
proceedings on the part of any of Sussex, Columbia, Merger Sub or their
stockholders are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement by any of Sussex, Columbia or Merger Sub
and the consummation by any of Sussex, Columbia and Merger Sub of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by each of Sussex, Columbia and Merger Sub
and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Sussex,
Columbia and Merger Sub enforceable against each of Sussex, Columbia and
Merger Sub in accordance with its terms.   (e) No Conflicts; Approvals and
Consents.   (i) Other than the notices, reports, filings, consents, 
registrations, declarations, approvals, permits or authorizations (A) 
required by the Secretary of the State of Delaware as contemplated  hereby;

Disclosure Letter (collectively, the  "Columbia Required Gaming Approvals"
and together with the Aztar  Required Gaming Approvals, the "Required Gaming
Approvals"), no  notices, declarations, reports or other filings are required
to be made  by Sussex or Columbia with, nor are any consents,
registrations,  approvals, permits or authorizations required to be obtained
by Sussex  or Columbia or any of their respective subsidiaries from, any 
Governmental Authority in connection with the execution, delivery and 
performance of this Agreement by Sussex or Columbia and the  consummation by
Sussex or Columbia of the Merger and the other  transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Financing, or in  connection with the continuing
operation of the business of Sussex and  Columbia and their respective
subsidiaries following the Effective  Time, except those that the failure to
make or obtain, individually or  in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to  have a material adverse effect on Sussex and
Columbia, taken as a  whole.   (ii) The execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement  and the Custody and Security Agreement by each of Sussex
and Columbia  does not, and the consummation by each of Sussex and Columbia
of the  Merger and the other transactions   26    contemplated hereby
and thereby, including the Financing, will not,  constitute or result in (A)
a breach or violation of, or a default  under, the articles of incorporation,
by-laws or any equivalent  organizational documents of Sussex or Columbia or
the comparable  governing documents of any of their respective subsidiaries;
(B) with  or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or violation of,
a  termination (or right of termination) or default under, the creation or 
acceleration of any obligations under or the creation of a Lien on any  of
the assets of Sussex or Columbia or any of their respective  subsidiaries
pursuant to any Contract binding upon Sussex or Columbia  or any of their
respective subsidiaries or, assuming (solely with  respect to performance of
this Agreement and consummation by Sussex and  Columbia of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby)  compliance with the matters referred
to in Section 3.02(e)(i), any Law  or governmental or non-governmental permit
or license to which Sussex  or Columbia or any of their respective
subsidiaries is subject; or (C)  any change in the rights or obligations of
any party under any Contract  binding upon Sussex or Columbia or any of their
respective subsidiaries  (including, without limitation, any change in

such offerings will be made, (v) using reasonable best efforts to obtain
accountants\' comfort letters, legal opinions, officers\' certificates,

required in connection with any equity offering and will use its reasonable
best efforts to take all other actions required to be taken by Aztar under
the Financing Commitments if reasonably required to obtain the Financing.
Aztar shall cause its officers, in their capacity as officers, to deliver
such customary management representation letters as the accountants may
require in connection with any comfort letters or similar documents as may be

reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Columbia in obtaining any consents
or waivers to, and in respect of, any of its indebtedness, provided that
Aztar shall not be required to permit any of the foregoing to become
effective prior to the Effective Time. At the request of Columbia, Aztar
shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts
to commence consent solicitations or issuer tender or exchange offers with
respect to their respective indebtedness as and at the times that Columbia
shall request ("Consent/Tender Offers") in each case with the cooperation of
Columbia. All Consent/Tender Offers shall be in accordance with applicable
Law and shall be on the terms and conditions reasonably agreed by Columbia
and Aztar; provided, that all Consent/Tender Offers (and all obligations to
make any payments to holders of all or any portion of any indebtedness in
connection therewith or to modify the terms or provisions of
any indebtedness) shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger,
and shall terminate immediately upon the termination of this Agreement prior
to the Effective Time. Aztar agrees not to consummate any Consent/Tender
Offer unless Columbia consents in writing to such consummation. Aztar agrees

reasonable best efforts to consummate all Consent/Tender Offers, provided

its subsidiaries to provide any assistance which would interfere unreasonably
with the business or operations of Aztar and its subsidiaries. All
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Aztar or any of its
subsidiaries, officers, employees, representatives and advisors in connection
with their respective obligations pursuant to Section 4.01(b) and 4.01(c)
shall be borne (or reimbursed promptly following demand therefor) by
Columbia. Nothing in Section 4.01(b) or 4.01(c) shall require Aztar or any of
its subsidiaries, officers, employees, representatives or advisors to take
any action that might result in any liability in connection with the
Financing unless indemnified by Columbia to the maximum extent permitted by
Law or to take any action other than in their capacity as an officer.
Columbia hereby agrees and acknowledges that Financing and the Consent/Tender
Offers do not constitute conditions to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   Section 4.02 Covenants of Sussex and
Columbia Interim Operations. (a) Each of Sussex and Columbia covenants and
agrees that, except as Aztar may approve in writing and except as set forth
in   (i) Section 4.02(a)(i) of the Columbia Disclosure Letter, it  will not
declare, set aside or pay any dividend or distribution  (whether in cash,
stock or property or any combination thereof) on any  shares of its capital
stock or the capital stock of any affiliate;   35    (ii) Section
4.02(a)(ii) of the Columbia Disclosure Letter, it  and each of its respective
subsidiaries will not incur any indebtedness  or guarantee indebtedness of

respective affiliates; or   (iii) Section 4.02(a)(iii) of the Columbia
Disclosure Letter,  it and each of its respective subsidiaries will not
acquire, or agree  to acquire, all or substantially all of the assets, or a
controlling  interest in, any other person.   (b) Each of Sussex and
Columbia will not take, and will not permit its subsidiaries to take, any
action that at the time of taking such action is reasonably likely to prevent
or materially delay the consummation of the Merger. Each of Sussex and
Columbia agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing
necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby at or
prior to the Closing Date. Each of Sussex and Columbia shall use its
reasonable best efforts to keep Aztar informed of the status of its
efforts to obtain the Financing and of any development that any of Sussex or
Columbia believes is reasonably likely to prevent or delay the receipt of the
Financing. Each of Sussex and Columbia shall use its reasonable best efforts
to comply with the covenants in the Financing Commitments which are within
its control.   Section 4.03 No Solicitation by Aztar.   (a) Aztar shall
not, nor shall it permit any of its subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize
or permit any of its directors, officers or employees, or any investment
banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative
retained by it or any of its subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing non-
public information), or knowingly take any other action designed to
facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes
a Takeover Proposal (as defined below) or (ii) participate in any
negotiations or discussions (other than to state that they are not permitted
to have discussions) regarding any Takeover Proposal; provided, however, that
if, at any time prior to receipt of the Stockholder Approval (the "Applicable
Period"), the Board of Directors of Aztar determines in good faith, after
consultation with its legal and financial advisors, that a Takeover Proposal
that was not solicited by it after the date hereof and that did not otherwise
result from a breach of this Section 4.03(a) is, or is reasonably likely to
result in, a Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 4.03(b)), and subject
to providing prior written notice of its decision to take such action to
Columbia and compliance with Section 4.03(c), Aztar may (x) furnish
information with respect to Aztar and its subsidiaries to the person making
such proposal (and its representatives) pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement (provided, that such confidentiality agreement
shall not in any way restrict Aztar from complying with its disclosure
obligations under this Agreement, including with respect to such proposal;
provided further, that any such confidentiality agreement need not contain a
standstill or similar provision) and (y) participate in discussions or
negotiations regarding such proposal. Aztar agrees to provide Columbia with
any information provided in writing or orally to the person making such
Takeover Proposal and its representatives substantially simultaneously with
the provision thereof to such other person. Aztar, its subsidiaries and their
representatives immediately shall cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties existing on the  
36   date hereof with respect to any Takeover Proposal. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Takeover Proposal" means any bona fide inquiry, proposal or
offer from any person relating to (i) any direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of a business (a "Material Business") that constitutes 20% or more
of the net revenues, net income or the assets (including equity securities)
of Aztar and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) any direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase of 20% or more of any class of voting securities of
Aztar or 20% or more of the voting power of any class of stock of any
subsidiary of Aztar owning, operating or controlling a Material Business,
(iii) any tender offer or exchange offer (or other offer to purchase or
acquire) that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning
20% or more of any class of voting securities of Aztar or 20% or more of the
voting power of any class of stock of any subsidiary of Aztar owning,
operating or controlling a Material Business, (iv) any merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving Aztar or any such subsidiary of Aztar owning, operating
or controlling a Material Business or (v) any direct or indirect acquisition
or purchase of, any joint venture or partnership or similar arrangement
involving, or any recapitalization, restructuring or leveraged financing or
similar transaction involving all or any portion of the Las Vegas Site
(except as expressly specified in Section 4.01(a)(xii), in each case other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b) Except as
contemplated by this Section 4.03, neither the Board of Directors of Aztar
nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly
to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Columbia, the approval or
recommendation by such Board of Directors or such committee of this Agreement
or the Merger, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, any Takeover Proposal, or (iii) cause Aztar to enter into any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or
other similar agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement of the type
and under the circumstances described in Section 4.03(a)) related to any
Takeover Proposal (each, an "Aztar Acquisition Agreement"). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in response to a Takeover Proposal that was not solicited by
it and that did not otherwise result from a breach of Section 4.03(a), during
the Applicable Period, the Board of Directors of Aztar may, if it determines
in good faith, after consulting with outside counsel, that taking such action
is reasonably required by the Board of Directors\' fiduciary obligations
under applicable law, (A) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw
or modify, the approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors or any
committee thereof of this Agreement or the Merger, (B) approve or recommend,
or propose to approve or recommend, any Superior Proposal, or (C) terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(d) simultaneously with the payment of
the Termination Fee and the Termination Expenses, but only after (1) such
Board of Directors has determined in good faith that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, and (2) (I) Aztar has notified Columbia in
writing of the determination that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and (II) at least 48 hours following receipt by Columbia of
such notice, the Board of Directors of Aztar has determined that such
Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
other than in connection with a Takeover Proposal, the Board of Directors of
Aztar may, if it determines in good faith, after consulting with outside
counsel, that the failure to take such action would result in a breach of the
Board of Directors\' fiduciary obligations under applicable Law withdraw or
modify the approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors or any
committee thereof of this Agreement or the Merger if Aztar has notified
Columbia in   37   writing of the decision to do so at least 48 hours
prior to the taking of such action, which notice shall specify in writing the
reasons therefor.   For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal"
means any written Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of Aztar
determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) to be more favorable (taking into account
(i) all financial and strategic considerations, including relevant legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of such Takeover Proposal and the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement deemed
relevant by the Board of Directors, (ii) the identity of the third party
making such Takeover Proposal, (iii) the anticipated timing, conditions and
prospects for completion of such Takeover Proposal, including the prospects
for obtaining regulatory approvals and financing, and any third party
shareholder approvals and (iv) the other terms and conditions of such
Takeover Proposal) to Aztar\'s stockholders than the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (taking into account all of the
terms of any proposal by Columbia to amend or modify the terms of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement), except that (x)
the reference to "20%" in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the definition of
"Takeover Proposal" in Section 4.03(a) shall be deemed to be a reference to
"50%", (y) the "Takeover Proposal" must refer to a transaction involving
Aztar as a whole, and not any of its subsidiaries or Material Businesses or
the Las Vegas Site, and (z) the references to any subsidiary of Aztar owning,
operating or controlling a Material Business in clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv)
shall be deemed to be deleted.   (c) In addition to the obligations of Aztar
set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 4.03, Aztar shall as
promptly as practicable advise Columbia, orally and in writing, of any
request for information or of any Takeover Proposal (and in any case within
24 hours of such request or the receipt of such Takeover Proposal), the
principal terms and conditions of such request or Takeover Proposal and the
identity of the person making such request or Takeover Proposal. Aztar shall
keep Columbia informed of the status and material details (including
amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request or Takeover Proposal
as promptly as practicable.   (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prohibit Aztar from issuing a "stop-look-and-listen communication" pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f), taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position as
required by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or
taking any action required by any order or decree of a Governmental
Authority, in each case, subject to the provisions of Section 7.01(f).  
Section 4.04 Other Actions. Each of Aztar and Columbia shall use
its reasonable best efforts not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
not to permit any of their respective subsidiaries to, take any action that
would, or that would reasonably be expected to, result in any condition to
the Merger set forth in Article VI not being satisfied.   Section 4.05
Control of Aztar\'s Operations. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
give to Columbia, directly or indirectly, rights to control or direct
Aztar\'s operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time,
Aztar shall exercise,   38   consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete control and supervision of its operations.  
ARTICLE V   Additional Agreements   Section 5.01 Preparation of the Proxy
Statement; Stockholders Meeting.   (a) As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, Aztar shall prepare the Proxy Statement
and Columbia shall assist Aztar in such preparation. Aztar shall use its
reasonable best efforts to file the Proxy Statement with the SEC as soon as
possible and to respond as promptly as possible to any comments of the SEC
with respect thereto. Aztar will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to Aztar\'s stockholders as promptly as
practicable. Each party will advise the other, promptly after it receives
notice thereof, of the receipt of any comments from the SEC with respect to
the Proxy Statement or any supplement or amendment, or any request by the SEC
for amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments thereon and responses
thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. If prior to the
Effective Time any event occurs with respect to Aztar, Columbia or any
subsidiary of Aztar or Columbia, respectively, or any change occurs
with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of Aztar or
Columbia, respectively, for inclusion in the Proxy Statement that, in each
case, is required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the
Proxy Statement, Aztar or Columbia, as applicable, shall promptly notify the
other of such event, and Columbia shall cooperate with Aztar in the prompt
filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement and, as required by law, in disseminating the information contained
in such amendment or supplement to Aztar\'s stockholders. Aztar shall provide
Columbia with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any draft
Proxy Statement, any draft amendment thereto, and any correspondence with the
SEC concerning the Proxy Statement, and shall file or submit any of the
foregoing only once such draft is in a form reasonably acceptable to Columbia
and Aztar.   (b) Aztar shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following
the date of this Agreement, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the "Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of
obtaining the Stockholder Approval. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Aztar agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first sentence
of this Section 5.01(b) shall not be affected by (i) the commencement,
proposal, disclosure or communication to Aztar of any Takeover Proposal, (ii)
the withdrawal or modification by the Board of Directors of Aztar of its
approval or recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, or (iii) the approval or recommendation of
any Superior Proposal.   Section 5.02 Access to Information; Effect of
Review.   (a) Access. To the extent permitted by applicable Law
and confidentiality obligations and upon reasonable advance notice, Aztar
shall, and shall cause each of its   39   respective subsidiaries to
afford to Columbia and to its officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
financial advisors and other representatives (and to its potential financing
sources and their respective representatives) reasonable access during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to all its
Contracts, properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records
and, during such period, to the extent permitted by applicable law and
confidentiality provisions, Aztar shall, and shall cause its
subsidiaries, to, (i) confer on a regular and frequent basis with one or more
representatives of Columbia to discuss material operational and regulatory
matters and the general status of its ongoing operations, (ii) advise
Columbia of any change or event that has had or would reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect on such party, and (iii) furnish to
Columbia promptly all other information concerning its business, properties
and personnel, in each case as Columbia may reasonably request. Columbia
shall schedule and coordinate all inspections with the individual(s) set
forth in Section 5.02(a) of the Aztar Disclosure Letter. Aztar shall be
entitled to have representatives present at all times during any such
inspection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Aztar nor its subsidiaries
shall be required to provide access to or to disclose any information (i)
where such access or disclosure could jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege or work product privilege of Aztar or its subsidiaries or
contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to the date
of this Agreement, or (ii) to the extent that outside counsel to Aztar
advises that such access or disclosure should not be disclosed in order to
ensure compliance with any Gaming Law or other applicable Law. Columbia
agrees to hold confidential all information which it has received or to which
it has gained access pursuant to this Section 5.02(a) in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of April 16, 2006, between Aztar and
Columbia (the "Confidentiality Agreement").   (b) Effect of Review. No
investigation or review pursuant to Section 5.02(a) shall have any effect for
the purpose of determining the accuracy of any representation or warranty
given by any of the parties hereto to any of the other parties hereto.  
Section 5.03 Regulatory Matters; Reasonable Best Efforts.   (a) Regulatory
Approvals. Each party hereto shall cooperate and promptly prepare and file
all necessary documentation, to effect all necessary applications, notices,
petitions and filings, and shall use reasonable best efforts to take or cause
to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things in order to
obtain all approvals and authorizations of all Governmental Authorities,
necessary or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner reasonably practicable, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Columbia shall have
the responsibility for the preparation and filing of any required
applications, filings or other materials, including in the State of New
Jersey, a trust agreement necessary to obtain interim casino authorization;
provided, however that (i) Aztar shall provide and cause its affiliates to
provide Columbia with any information required in connection with such
filings as promptly as practicable, (ii) Aztar shall have the right to
review, comment on and approve (which comments Aztar shall provide as
promptly as practicable, but in any event within three days of Columbia\'s
request for such approval) in advance all characterizations of the
information relating to Aztar that appear in any application, notice,
petition or filing made in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) Aztar shall have the
right to review and comment on   40   (which comments Aztar shall provide
as promptly as practicable, but in any event within three days of Columbia\'s
request for such approval, and which comments Columbia shall consider in good
faith) in advance all applications, notices, petitions or filings made in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Aztar and Columbia agree that they will consult and cooperate with
each other with respect to the obtaining of all such necessary approvals and
authorizations of Governmental Authorities.   (b) Filings. Each of Columbia
and Aztar undertakes and agrees to file as soon as practicable a Notification
and Report Form under the HSR Act with the United States Federal Trade
Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice (the "Antitrust Division") and to make such filings and
apply for such approvals and consents as are required under the Gaming Laws
as soon as practicable after the date hereof (and in any event within 45
days), including the filing of all required applications for Columbia and all
"key persons" (as defined under applicable Gaming Laws). Each of Columbia and
Aztar shall use its reasonable best efforts to request as soon as practicable
an accelerated review (to the extent available) from any Gaming Authorities
in connection with such filings and in the case of Gaming Approvals required
in the State of New Jersey, Columbia shall seek to obtain interim casino
authorization at the earliest practicable date. Each of Columbia and Aztar
shall respond as promptly as practicable under the circumstances to
any inquiries received from the FTC or the Antitrust Division or any
authority enforcing applicable Gaming Laws for additional information or
documentation and to all inquiries and requests received from any
Governmental Authority in connection with any Law. Except with respect to the
Missouri Divestiture or Closing (as defined below) and except as otherwise
provided herein, Columbia shall have the right to direct and control the
process of obtaining the Governmental Consents (as defined below) required in
connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and Aztar
agrees to reasonably cooperate with Columbia with respect thereto. Aztar
shall agree if, but solely if, requested by Columbia to, in compliance with
Gaming Laws, divest, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any
action that limits or prohibits Aztar\'s or Columbia\'s freedom of action
with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, services,
employees or assets of Aztar or any of its subsidiaries, in each case at or
after the Effective Time and only in order to enable Columbia to obtain or to
avoid having to obtain a Governmental Consent, provided that any such action
shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Aztar shall use commercially reasonable efforts to divest its
casino property in the State of Missouri in accordance with applicable law in
a bona fide arms length transaction, provided that, in the event that (i)
Aztar and/or the purchaser fails to enter into a purchase and sale agreement
with respect to its casino property in the State of Missouri within 90 days
of the date hereof, (ii) if, in the event a purchase and sale agreement is
entered into within 90 days of the date hereof, Aztar fails to obtain the
Required Gaming Approvals for such sale within six months following the date
hereof or (iii) any party to such agreement terminates such agreement prior
to the consummation of the Merger, Aztar shall, at its sole discretion, use
commercially reasonable efforts to close the operation of such property in
accordance with applicable law (the "Missouri Divestiture or Closing"). At
the option of Aztar, any of the actions taken in connection with the Missouri
Divestiture or Closing may be conditioned on the consummation of the Merger.
Columbia shall promptly reimburse Aztar for any and all costs and expenses in
connection with the Missouri Divestiture or Closing, including any
termination fee or expenses payable to a third party.   41    (c)
Cooperation. In addition, each party shall, subject to applicable law and to
the terms and conditions hereof, except as prohibited by any applicable
representative of any applicable Governmental Authority, (i) promptly notify
the other party of any communication to that party relating to the Merger and
the transactions contemplated hereby from the FTC, the Antitrust
Division, any Governmental Authority, including any Gaming Authority, and
consult with the other party in advance regarding, and provide a reasonable
opportunity to comment on, any proposed written communication relating to the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby to any of the foregoing
persons; and (ii) furnish the other party or its outside counsel with copies
of all correspondence, filings, and written communications (and memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof) between them and its affiliates and
their respective representatives on the one hand, and any government or
regulatory authority or members of their respective staffs on the other hand,
with respect to this Agreement and the Merger, provided, however, that the
parties may redact discussions of the value of the Merger or any other
acquisition, sale, or divestiture, except with respect to the Missouri
Divestiture or Closing; provided, further, that notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, Columbia shall be entitled to redact any
corporate gaming applications to the extent containing personal information,
including personal financial information. Each of Columbia and Aztar, and
their respective representatives, will have the right to participate in any
meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
filings, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the
Merger.   (d) Objections. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
covenants of the parties contained in Section 5.03(a), (b) and (c), but
subject to Section 5.03(g), each of Columbia and Aztar shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by a Governmental Authority or other person with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law (as defined in
Section 8.03) or Gaming Law or by any Gaming Authority. In connection with
the foregoing, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding,
including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to
be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as
violative of any Antitrust Law, Gaming Law or the rules and regulations of
any Gaming Authority, subject to Section 5.03(g), each of Columbia and Aztar
shall cooperate in all material respects with each other and use its
respective reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable, contest
and resist any such action or proceeding, to limit the scope or effect of any
proposed action of, or remedy sought to be obtained or imposed by, any Gaming
Authority, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (e)
Further Actions. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done,
and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all
things reasonably necessary or advisable under applicable Laws (including the
HSR Act and the Gaming Laws) to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner reasonably practicable, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) obtaining any
required third party consents and Governmental Consents   42   and (ii)
the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (f)
Governmental Consents. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Governmental
Consents" shall mean all notices, reports, filings, consents, applications,
registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations required to be made prior
to the Effective Time by Aztar or Columbia or any of their
respective subsidiaries with, or obtained prior to the Effective Time by
Aztar or Columbia or any of their respective subsidiaries from, any
Governmental Authority in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (and shall include the expiration or termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act).   (g) Specified Material Adverse Effect.
Notwithstanding the foregoing (but subject to the fourth and fifth sentences
of Section 5.03(b)), as used in this Section 5.03, "reasonable best efforts"
shall not include nor require any party to (A) sell, or agree to sell, hold
or agree to hold separate, or otherwise dispose, or agree to dispose of, any
asset, in each case other than (i) a hotel casino property owned by Aztar or
Columbia or their affiliates in Laughlin, Nevada designated by Columbia,
and/or (ii) the hotel casino property owned by Aztar in Indiana (the
"Specified Assets") or (B) conduct or agree to conduct its business in any
particular manner, if such conduct has had or would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to (i) have a material adverse effect on
Columbia (after giving effect to the consummation of the Merger and
reflecting the business, assets, results of operations and
financial condition of Aztar and its subsidiaries) (clauses (A) or (B), a
"Specified Material Adverse Effect") or (ii) result in either Columbia or
Aztar or their respective subsidiaries failing to meet the standards for
licensing, suitability or character under any Gaming Laws relating to the
conduct of Columbia\'s or Aztar\'s business which (after taking into account
the anticipated impact of such failure to so meet such standards on other
authorities) would reasonably be expected to have a Specified Material
Adverse Effect. Except for the Missouri Closing or Divestiture, none of Aztar
or any of its subsidiaries may take or agree to take any such action, or
consent to or agree to consent to any such restriction, without the consent
of Columbia (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). For
purposes of clarification, Columbia agrees that if necessary in order to
obtain, or to avoid having to obtain, the Required Governmental Consents (as
defined in Section 6.01(c)), Columbia will (A) sell, or agree to sell, hold
or agree to hold separate, or otherwise dispose, or agree to dispose of, the
Specified Assets (or ask Aztar to do the same) or (B) conduct or agree to
conduct its business in a particular manner or take such other actions as may
be requested by a Governmental Authority, unless such conduct or other action
has had or would reasonably be expected to result in a Specified Material
Adverse Effect.   (h) State Anti-Takeover Statutes. Without limiting the
generality of Section 5.03(b), Aztar and Columbia shall (i) take all
reasonable action necessary to ensure that no state anti-takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation or charter, bylaw or similar provision becomes
applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any state anti-takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation, charter, bylaw or similar provision becomes
applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as   43   promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation, charter, bylaw or similar provision on the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (i) Additional
Financing. At the Closing, Columbia will have in place a revolving credit
facility in the principal amount of $180 million, which shall be supported by
a guaranty of Sussex in the amount of $80 million.   Section 5.04 Stock
Options; Stock Plans.   (a) Each stock option to purchase Aztar Common Stock
(the "Aztar Employee Stock Options") granted under the Aztar Employee Stock
Plans that is outstanding as of or immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time equal to the product of (x) the
excess, if any, of the Common Stock Merger Consideration over the exercise
price per Aztar Common Stock subject to such Aztar Employee Stock Option and
(y) the total number of shares of Aztar Common Stock subject to such Aztar
Employee Stock Option immediately before the Effective Time, with the
aggregate amount of such payment rounded to the nearest cent, less such
amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any
provision of U.S. state, U.S. local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the
making of such payment;   (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of
Directors of Aztar (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Aztar
Employee Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take all such other
actions as may be required to effect the foregoing and shall ensure that
following the Effective Time no holder of Aztar Employee Stock Option or any
participant in any Aztar Employee Stock Plan or other Aztar Employee Benefit
Plan or Aztar Employment Agreement shall have any right thereunder to acquire
any capital stock (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation
rights) of Aztar or the Surviving Corporation.   Section 5.05 Employee
Matters.   (a) Columbia agrees that, during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the
employees of Aztar and any of its subsidiaries who are employed as of the
Closing Date and continue employment (the "Company Employees") will continue
to be provided with salary and benefits under employee benefit and commission
or similar plans that are substantially similar, in the aggregate, to those
currently provided by Aztar or any of its subsidiaries to such employees;
provided that discretionary benefits shall remain discretionary.   (b) For
purposes of all employee benefit plans, programs and agreements maintained by
or contributed to by Columbia and its subsidiaries (including, after Closing,
the Surviving Corporation), Columbia shall, or shall cause its subsidiaries
to cause each such plan, program or arrangement to treat the prior service
with Aztar or any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing of any
Company Employee (to the same extent such service is recognized
under analogous plans, programs or arrangements of Aztar or any of its
subsidiaries   44   prior to the Effective Time) as service rendered to
Columbia or any of its subsidiaries, as the case may be, for all purposes;
provided, however, that such crediting of service shall not (i) operate to
duplicate any benefit or the funding of such benefit under any plan, (ii)
require the crediting of past service for benefit accrual purposes under any
defined benefit pension plan or (iii) be credited if past service credit has
not been or will not be provided to employees of Columbia or its subsidiaries
participating in such plan. Company Employees shall also be given credit for
any deductible or co-payment amounts paid in respect of the plan year in
which the Closing occurs, to the extent that, following the Closing, they
participate in any other plan for which deductibles or co-payments are
required. Columbia shall also cause each Columbia Plan (as defined below) to
waive any preexisting condition or waiting period limitation which would
otherwise be applicable to a Company Employee on or after the Effective Time
(to the extent such limitation would not apply under the corresponding Aztar
Employee Benefit Plan). Columbia shall recognize any accrued but unused
vacation of the Company Employees as of the Effective Time, and Columbia
shall cause Aztar and its subsidiaries to provide such paid vacation. For
purposes of this Agreement, a "Columbia Plan" shall mean such
employee benefit plan, as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or a nonqualified
employee benefit or deferred compensation plan, stock option, bonus or
incentive plan or other employee benefit or fringe benefit program, that may
be in effect generally for employees of Columbia and its subsidiaries from
time to time.   (c) Except as provided specifically in this Section 5.05,
nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict the rights of Columbia or
Aztar to modify, amend, terminate or establish employee benefit plans or
arrangements, in whole or in part, at any time after the Effective Time.  
(d) No provision of this Section 5.05 shall create any third
party beneficiary rights in any Company Employee or any current or former
director or consultant of Aztar or its subsidiaries in respect of continued
employment (or resumed employment) or any other matter.   (e)
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Columbia shall or
shall cause its affiliates to honor and perform all obligations under any
collective bargaining agreements pertaining to any Company Employees.   (f)
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Columbia
shall not, for at least twelve months following the Closing, cause there to
be adopted any amendment to any Aztar Employee Benefit Plan that is
a severance or retention plan, program, policy or agreement that would result
in a diminution of benefits thereunder.   Section 5.06 Indemnification,
Exculpation and Insurance.   (a) Each of Aztar and Columbia agrees that, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, all rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the
current or former directors, officers, employees or fiduciaries under benefit
plans currently indemnified of Aztar and its subsidiaries as provided in
their respective certificate or articles of incorporation, by-laws (or
comparable organizational documents) or other agreements providing  
45   indemnification shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms. The certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall continue to
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and
officers than are presently set forth in the Aztar\'s certificate of
incorporation and by-laws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such
individuals.   (b) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain in effect the directors\' and officers\' liability
(and fiduciary) insurance policies covering acts or omissions occurring on or
prior to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently
covered by Aztar\'s respective directors\' and officers\' liability (and
fiduciary) insurance policies on terms with respect to such coverage and in
amounts at least as favorable as those set forth in the relevant policy in
effect on the date of this Agreement, except in no event shall the Surviving
Corporation be required to make annual premium payments in connection
therewith in excess of the amount set forth on Section 5.06(b) of the Aztar
Disclosure Letter (the "Maximum Amount"), and if the Surviving Corporation is
unable to obtain the insurance required by this Section 5.06(b), the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain the most advantageous policies of
directors\' and officers\' insurance otherwise obtainable for an annual
premium equal to the Maximum Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either
Columbia or Aztar may elect in lieu of the foregoing insurance, prior to the
Effective Time, to obtain and fully pay for a policy (providing only for the
Side A coverage for the Aztar Indemnified Parties (as defined in clause (c)
below) with a claims period of at least six years from the Effective Time
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as Aztar\'s
current insurance carrier with respect to directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance in an amount and scope the same as Aztar\'s
existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time; provided that the cost thereof does not exceed
$4,435,000.   (c) From and after the Effective Time, Columbia agrees to
cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each present
or former director and officer of Aztar or any of its subsidiaries (in each
case, for acts or failures to act in such capacity), determined as of the
date hereof, and any person who becomes such a director or officer between
the date hereof and the Effective Time (collectively, the "Aztar Indemnified
Parties"), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\'
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(collectively, "Costs") incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law (and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses
as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, provided
that if required by applicable law the person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such person is not entitled to indemnification).   (d) The obligations
of the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.06 shall not be terminated
or modified by such parties in a manner so as to adversely affect any
Aztar   46   Indemnified Party or any other person entitled to the
benefit of Sections 5.06(a) and (b), as the case may be, to whom this Section
5.06 applies without the consent of the affected Aztar Indemnified Party or
such other person, as the case may be. If the Surviving Corporation (i) shall
consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such
case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in Section 5.06.   (e) The provisions of Section 5.06
are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii)
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or
otherwise.   Section 5.07 Fees and Expenses.   (a) Except as provided in
this Section 5.07 or Section 4.01(d), all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not the Merger is consummated.   (b) In the event that (i)(A) the
condition set forth in Section 6.01(c)(ii) shall have been satisfied, (B)
following the Stockholder Approval, a Takeover Proposal (or the intention of
any person to make one), whether or not conditional, shall have been made
known to Aztar or shall have been publicly disclosed and thereafter (C)(x)
this Agreement is terminated by Aztar or Columbia pursuant to Section
7.01(b)(i) and (y) within 6 months of such termination Aztar or any of its
subsidiaries enters into any Aztar Acquisition Agreement or any person
consummates any Takeover Proposal, (ii) prior to or during the Stockholders
Meeting (or any subsequent meeting of Aztar stockholders at which it is
proposed that the Merger be approved), a Takeover Proposal (or the intention
of any person to make one), whether or not conditional, shall have been
publicly disclosed, and thereafter (x) this Agreement is terminated by either
Aztar or Columbia pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(ii) and (y) within 9 months of
such termination Aztar or any of its subsidiaries enters into any
Aztar Acquisition Agreement or any person consummates any Takeover Proposal,
(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Aztar pursuant to Section 7.01(d), (iv)
this Agreement is terminated by Columbia pursuant to Section 7.01(f)(i) and
within 9 months of such termination Aztar or any of its subsidiaries enters
into any Aztar Acquisition Agreement or any person consummates any Takeover
Proposal, (v) this Agreement is terminated by Columbia pursuant to Section
7.01(f)(ii), or (vi) this Agreement is terminated by Columbia pursuant to
Section 7.01(g) as a result of a material and intentional breach by Aztar,
then in each case Aztar shall pay Columbia a fee equal to $55.228 million
(the "Termination Fee") and shall reimburse Columbia for its fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby up
to a maximum of $27.36 million (the "Termination Expenses"), payable by wire
transfer of same day funds; (for the purposes of the foregoing the terms
"Aztar Acquisition Agreement" and "Takeover Proposal" shall have the meanings
assigned to such terms in Section 4.03 except that the references to "20%" in
the definition of "Takeover   47   Proposal" in Section 4.03(a) shall be
deemed to be references to "50%". Payment of the Termination Fee and
Termination Expenses to Columbia pursuant to (A) clauses (i), (ii) or (iv)
above shall be made concurrently with the earlier of the consummation of the
Takeover Proposal or the entry of the Aztar Acquisition Agreement, (B) clause
(iii) above shall be made concurrently with termination of this Agreement or
(C) clause (v) or (vi) above shall be made within two business days of
termination of this Agreement.   (c) Aztar acknowledges that the agreement
contained in Section 5.07(b) is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without this agreement, Columbia
would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Aztar fails promptly to
pay any amount due pursuant to Section 5.07(b), and, in order to obtain such
payment, Columbia commences a suit that results in a judgment against Aztar
for the payments set forth in Section 5.07(b), Aztar shall pay to Columbia
its costs and expenses (including attorneys\' fees and expenses) in

the prime rate plus 2% per annum of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made.   (d) In the event of the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to (i) Section 7.01(b)(i), if at the time of such
termination, the condition set forth in Section 6.01(c)(ii) has not been
satisfied, (ii) Section 7.01(b)(iii), if the Restraint is issued by a
Governmental Authority and relates to any Required Gaming Approval or any
Gaming Law applicable in any jurisdiction, (iii) Section 7.01(b)(iv), if the

Required Gaming Approval or Gaming Law) or (iv) Section 7.01(c),
the Custodial Assets, together with any interest earned thereon, shall be
paid to Aztar as liquidated damages. Columbia and Sussex each acknowledges
that payment of the Custodial Assets constitutes a non-exclusive remedy and
does not deprive Aztar of, or limit Aztar to, any other remedies Aztar may
have under this Agreement, at law or in equity, upon a termination of this
Agreement if there has been a willful and material breach by Sussex or
Columbia of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement or the Custody and Security Agreement,
which breach has not been cured by Sussex or Columbia prior to such
termination. Aztar acknowledges that payment of the Custodial Assets
constitutes Aztar\'s exclusive remedy and deprives Aztar of any other
remedies Aztar may have under this Agreement, at law or in equity, upon a
termination of this Agreement, except if there has been a willful
and material breach by Sussex or Columbia of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement which
breach has not been cured by Sussex or Columbia prior to such termination. In
the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to (i) Section
7.01(a), (ii) Section 7.01(b)(i), if at the time of such termination, the
condition set forth in Section 6.01(c)(ii) has been satisfied, (iii) Section
7.01(b)(ii), (iv) Section 7.01(b)(iii), unless the Restraint is issued by a
Governmental Authority and relates to any Required Gaming Approval or any
Gaming Law applicable in any jurisdiction, (v) Section 7.01(b)(iv), unless
the condition that is incapable of satisfaction is the condition set forth in
Section 6.01(c)(ii) or the condition set forth in Section 6.01(b) (to the
extent the Restraint is issued by a Governmental Authority and relates to any
Required Gaming Approval or Gaming Law), (vi) Section 7.01(d), (vii) Section
7.01(e), (viii) Section 7.01(f) or (ix) Section 7.01(g), the Custodial
Assets, together with any interest earned thereon, shall be paid  
48   to Sussex; provided, however, that in the event (A) this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(ii) or Section 7.01(f)(i), (B) at or
prior to the time of such termination, Sussex or Columbia has breached or
failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement to an extent that would reasonably be
expected to prevent or delay beyond the Termination Date the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (C) at or prior to the
time of such termination, Aztar has not breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in
this Agreement to an extent that would reasonably be expected to prevent or
delay beyond the Termination Date the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Custodial Assets, together with any
interest earned thereon, shall be paid to Aztar.   Section 5.08 Public
Announcements. Aztar, on the one hand, and Sussex and Columbia, on the other
hand, will consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the
reasonable opportunity to review, comment upon and concur with, any press
release or other public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement prior to
such consultation, except as any party, after consultation with counsel,
determines is required by applicable law or applicable rule or regulation of
the NYSE; provided, that Sussex and Columbia or Aztar, as the case may be,
may issue its own press releases and make public statements with respect to
the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement so long as the substance of
such statements has already been disclosed publicly.   Section 5.09 Aztar
Headquarters. For a period of not less than 9 months following the Effective
Time, Columbia shall maintain the current headquarters of Aztar in Phoenix,
Arizona as a divisional headquarters. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing
contained herein, shall be deemed to obligate Columbia or any of its
subsidiaries to employ any individual or group of individuals at
such location after the Closing.   Section 5.10 Pinnacle Termination Fee.
Aztar shall, concurrently with the termination of the Pinnacle Agreement, pay
to Pinnacle the full amount of the "Termination Fee" and the "Termination
Expenses" as defined in the Pinnacle Agreement (together the "Pinnacle Fees")
in accordance with Section 5.07(b) of the Pinnacle Agreement. Upon payment of
the Pinnacle Fees by Aztar in accordance with the previous sentence, Aztar
shall be reimbursed therefor in accordance with the Custody and Security
Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated in circumstances requiring payment
of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 5.07(b), or under circumstances
requiring the payment of the Custodial Assets to Columbia pursuant to Section
5.07(d), then Aztar shall reimburse Columbia for the Pinnacle Fees. Any
reimbursement by Aztar of the Pinnacle Fees shall be made at the time that
the Termination Fee and/or Custodial Assets are due to Columbia.   49   
Section 5.11 Guarantee.   (a) Sussex absolutely, unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees to Aztar the due and punctual observance, performance
and discharge of all of the covenants, agreements, obligations and
liabilities of Columbia and Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement, whether
fixed, contingent, now existing or hereafter arising, created, assumed,
incurred or acquired (the "Obligations").   (b) Sussex agrees that the
obligations of Sussex hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole
or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure of Aztar to assert any
claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against Columbia or Merger
Sub, (ii) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of any of the
Obligations or any rescission, waiver, compromise, consolidation or other
amendment or modification of any of the terms of provisions of this
Agreement, (iii) any change in the corporate existence, structure or
ownership of Columbia or Merger Sub, (iv) any insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting Columbia or Merger Sub,
(v) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement, (vi) the
existence of any claim, set-off or other rights which Sussex may have at
any time against Columbia, Merger Sub or Aztar, whether in connection with
the Obligations or otherwise, and (vii) any other act or omission which might
in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of Sussex or otherwise operate
as a release or discharge of Sussex, all of which may be done without notice
to Sussex. Aztar shall not be bound or obliged to exhaust its recourse
against Columbia or Merger Sub or pursue any other remedy whatsoever before
being entitled to demand the satisfaction of the Obligations by Sussex
hereunder. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Sussex hereby expressly
waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of any law which
would otherwise require any election of remedies by Aztar. Sussex
acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits
from the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that the waivers set forth herein are knowingly made in contemplation of such
benefits.   (c) This guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and
shall be binding on Sussex, its successors and assigns until all of the
Obligations have been indefeasibly paid, observed, performed or satisfied in
full.   ARTICLE VI   Conditions Precedent   Section 6.01 Conditions to

Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby (collectively,
"Restraints") shall be in effect. (ii) No Governmental Authority shall have

seeking any Order the issuance of which would be reasonably likely to result
in the failure of the condition set forth in Section 6.01(b)(i).   (c)

Indiana, Mississippi and Louisiana, shall have been obtained and remain in
full force and effect (including by way of obtaining an interim casino
authorization from the State of New Jersey in the case of New Jersey) (the
foregoing Governmental Consents described in clauses (i) and (ii)
collectively, the "Required Governmental Consents"). In the case of the
obligation of Columbia, all Required Governmental Consents that have been
obtained shall have been obtained without the imposition of any term,
condition or consequence the acceptance of which would, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have or result in a Specified
Material Adverse Effect.   Section 6.02 Conditions to Obligations of Aztar.

satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions:   (a) Representations
and Warranties. The representations and warranties of Sussex and Columbia set
forth herein and in the Custody and Security Agreement shall be true and
correct both when made and at and as of the Closing Date, as if made at and

in which case as of such date), except where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct (without
giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or "material adverse
effect" set forth therein) does not have, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect
on the ability of Columbia to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.   (b) Performance of Obligations of Columbia. Each of Sussex and
Columbia shall have performed in all material respects all obligations
required to be performed by it under this Agreement and the Custody and
Security Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date.   (c) Closing
Certificates. Aztar shall have received a certificate signed by an executive

such representations and warranties to be so true and correct (without giving
effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or "material adverse effect" set
forth therein) does not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on Aztar.   (b)
Performance of Obligations of Aztar. Aztar shall have performed in all
material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under
this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date.   (c) Closing Certificates.
Columbia shall have received a certificate signed by an executive officer of

knowledge, the conditions set forth in Sections 6.03(a) and 6.03(b) have been
satisfied.   Section 6.04 Frustration of Closing Conditions. Neither Aztar
nor Columbia may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Section
6.01, 6.02 or 6.03, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was
caused by such party\'s failure to use reasonable best efforts to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to the
extent required by and subject to Section 5.03.   ARTICLE VII  
Termination, Amendment and Waiver   Section 7.01 Termination. This Agreement

(other than pursuant to clauses (d) below) after the Stockholder
Approval:   (a) by mutual written consent of Aztar and Columbia;   (b) by
either Aztar or Columbia:   52    (i) if the Merger shall not have been
consummated by the  12-month anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the
"Termination  Date"); provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement  pursuant to this Section 7.01(b)(i) shall not be available to any
party  whose failure to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement 
results in the failure of the Merger to be consummated by such time; 
provided, further, that if Aztar or Columbia reasonably determines that 
additional time is necessary in connection with obtaining any Required 
Gaming Approval referred to in Section 6.01(c)(ii) or in order to  comply
with the terms of any such Required Gaming Approval to the  extent that such
compliance is required to occur prior to the Effective  Time, or in order to
complete the Missouri Divestiture or Closing,  Aztar or Columbia may extend
the Termination Date for an additional  period of up to three months;  
(ii) if the Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained  at a
Stockholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment  or
postponement thereof;   (iii) if any Restraint having the permanent effects
set forth  in Section 6.01(b)(i) shall be in effect and shall have become
final  and nonappealable; provided that the party seeking to terminate this 
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(b)(iii) shall have used its 
reasonable best efforts to prevent the entry of and to remove such 
Restraint; or   (iv) if any condition to the obligation of such party to 
consummate the Merger set forth in Section 6.02 (in the case of Aztar)  or in
Section 6.03 (in the case of Columbia) becomes incapable of  satisfaction
prior to the Termination Date; provided that the failure  of any such
condition to be capable of satisfaction is not the result  of a material
breach of this Agreement by the party seeking to  terminate this
Agreement;   (c) by Aztar, if any of Sussex or Columbia shall have breached
or failed to perform in any material respect any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement or the Custody and Security Agreement, which breach or failure to
perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 6.02(a) or (b), and (B) is incapable of being cured by Sussex or
Columbia or is not cured by Sussex or Columbia within 120 days following
receipt of written notice from Aztar of such breach or failure to
perform;   (d) by Aztar in accordance with Section 4.03(b); provided, that,

and Termination Expenses, of Section 5.07;   (e) by Columbia, if Aztar
shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement or the Custody and Security Agreement, which breach or failure to
perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 6.03(a) or (b), and (B) is incapable of being cured by Aztar or is
not cured by Aztar   53   within 120 days following receipt of written
notice from Columbia of such breach or failure to perform;   (f) by
Columbia, if the Board of Directors of Aztar (or any committee thereof) (i)
shall have withdrawn or modified, or proposed publicly to withdraw or modify,
the approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors of this Agreement
or the Merger, or (ii) shall have approved or recommended, or proposed to
approve or recommend, a Takeover Proposal (it being understood and
agreed that any "stop-look-and-listen" communication by the Board of
Directors of Aztar to the stockholders of Aztar limited to the matters
specified in Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or any similar communication
to the stockholders of Aztar in connection with the commencement of a tender
offer or exchange offer limited to the "stop-look-and-listen" matters
specified in Rule 14d-9(f), shall not be deemed to constitute an approval or
recommendation of a Takeover Proposal); and   (g) by Columbia, in the event
of a material breach of Section 4.03 or Section 5.01(b).   Section 7.02
Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either Columbia or Aztar as provided in Section 7.01, this Agreement shall
forthwith become null and void and have no effect, without any liability or
obligation on the part of Aztar or Columbia, other than the fee and indemnity
provisions of Section 4.01(b), Section 4.01(c), and Section 4.01(d), and the
confidentiality provisions of Section 5.02, Section 5.07, this Section 7.02
and Article VIII, which provisions shall survive such termination, and except
to the extent that such termination results from the willful and
material breach by a party of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement and in the Custody and
Security Agreement, in which case such termination shall not relieve any
party of any liability or damages resulting from its willful and material
breach of this Agreement or in the case of Columbia, if all of the conditions
to Columbia\'s obligation to consummate the Merger are satisfied (other than
the condition set forth in Section 6.03(c)) (and, in the case of the
condition set forth in Section 6.03(c), either such condition has been
satisfied or Aztar confirms to Columbia in writing that it is willing and
able to deliver the certificate referred to in Section 6.03(c) as of the
Closing Date) and Columbia fails to consummate the Merger in accordance with
the terms and conditions hereof as a result of its failure to obtain the
Financing.   Section 7.03 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the
parties at any time before or after the Stockholder Approval; provided,
however, that after any such approval, there shall not be made any amendment
that by law requires further approval by the stockholders of Aztar without
the further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties.   Section 7.04 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, a party may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of

54   contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to
this Agreement or (c) subject to the proviso of Section 7.03, waive
compliance by the other parties with any of the agreements or conditions
contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.   ARTICLE VIII   General
Provisions   Section 8.01 Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties.
None of the representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective
Time. This Section 8.01 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the
parties that by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time
and such provisions shall survive the Effective Time.   Section 8.02

Section 8.04 Interpretation and Other Matters. (a) When a reference is made
in this Agreement to an Article, Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be
to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit to, this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall
be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The words
"hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in
this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement
shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other
document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein.
The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the
feminine genders of such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined
or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to
herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time
amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or

(b) Each of Aztar and Columbia has or may have set forth information in its
respective disclosure letter in a section thereof that corresponds to
the section of this Agreement to which it relates. A matter set forth in one
section of a disclosure letter need not be set forth in any other section of
the disclosure letter so long as its relevance to the latter section of
the disclosure letter or section of this Agreement is readily apparent on the
face of the information disclosed in the disclosure letter to the person to
which such disclosure is being made. The fact that any item of information
is disclosed in a disclosure letter to this Agreement shall not be construed
to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.
Such information and the dollar thresholds set forth herein shall not be used
as a basis for interpreting the terms "material," "material adverse effect"
or other similar terms in this Agreement.   (c) Columbia agrees to cause
Merger Sub to comply with its respective obligations under this
Agreement.   Section 8.05 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each party and delivered to the other parties.   60    Section
8.06 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement
(including the documents and instruments referred to herein), the Custody and
Security Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement (i) constitute the
entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter
of this Agreement and (ii) except for the provisions of Section 5.06 (which
shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties), are not intended to and
shall not confer upon any person other than the parties any rights or
remedies.   Section 8.07 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware,
regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflict of laws.   Section 8.08 Assignment. Neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this
Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of law or
otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of
the other party. Any attempted or purported assignment in violation of the
preceding sentence shall be null and void and of no effect whatsoever.
Subject to the preceding two sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their
respective successors and assigns.   Section 8.09 Enforcement. The parties
agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have
any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any federal or state court located in the State of Delaware,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit
itself to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located
in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and
(c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other
than a federal or state court in the State of Delaware.   Section 8.10
Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy,
all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.   61    Section 8.11 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY TO THIS
AGREEMENT WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.   Section 8.12
Alternative Structure. The parties agree to cooperate in the consideration of
alternative structures to implement the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as long as there is no change in the economic terms thereof and
such change does not impose any material delay on, or condition to, the
consummation of the Merger, or adversely affect Aztar, prior to the Effective
Time, or Aztar\'s stockholders or result in liability to Aztar directors or
officers. Any such alternative structure shall constitute a "change of
control" with respect to the Aztar Employee Benefit Plans and
Aztar Employment Agreements to the same extent that the transactions
contemplated hereby constitute a "change of control" with respect to the
applicable Plan or Agreement.   62     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of
Aztar, Sussex, Columbia and Merger Sub has caused this Agreement to be signed
by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized, all as of the date
first written above.   COLUMBIA SUSSEX CORPORATION    By: /s/ William J.
