Section 2.05

 

 _Assignment of Certain Acquired Assets_. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an
assignment or transfer of any Acquired Asset or any claim or right or any
benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if an attempted assignment
or transfer thereof, without the consent of a third party, would constitute a
breach or other contravention thereof or would in any way adversely affect the
rights of Buyer or the Asset Sellers (as applicable) thereto or thereunder,
and such consent has not been obtained on or prior to the Closing. Subject to
_Section 5.04(a)_ , Seller will, and will cause each of the other Asset
Sellers (and to the extent practicable, their respective Affiliates) to, use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain any consent necessary for the transfer
or assignment of any such Acquired Asset claim, right or benefit to Buyer;
provided, however, that in no event shall Seller have any obligation to pay
any consent fee or make any other payment of any kind in connection with
obtaining any such consent. If on the Closing Date any such consent is not
obtained, or if an attempted transfer or assignment thereof would be
ineffective or would adversely affect the rights of Buyer so that Buyer would
not in fact receive all such rights, and (i) the Asset Sellers and Buyer will,
subject to _Section 5.04(a)_ , cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement
under which Buyer would obtain the benefits and assume the obligations and
bear the economic burdens associated with such Acquired Asset, claim, right or
benefit in accordance with this Agreement, including subcontracting,
sublicensing or subleasing to Buyer, or under which the Asset Sellers would
enforce for the benefit of Buyer any and all of their rights against a third
party associated with such Acquired Asset, claim, right or benefit
(collectively, "Third Party Rights"), and the Asset Sellers would promptly pay
to Buyer when received all monies received by them under any such Transferred
Asset, claim, right or benefit, (ii) after the Closing Date, subject to
_Section 5.04(a)_ , Seller will, and will cause each of the other Asset
Sellers to, continue to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any consent
necessary for the transfer or assignment of any such Acquired Asset claim,
right or benefit to Buyer, and, upon the receipt of such consent, will
immediately transfer such Acquired Asset to Buyer.

(i)

 

an aggregate amount in cash equal to the sum (the "Cash Consideration") of:

(b)

 

Seller has delivered to Buyer a statement of Net Working Capital (the
"Reference Date Net Working Capital") and a statement of Net Debt (the
"Reference Date Net Debt") as of December 31, 2015 (the "Reference Date"), a
copy of which is set forth in _Section 2.06(b) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter_ (the "Reference Date Balance Sheet"). The Reference Date Balance
Sheet has been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP using the accounting
methods, policies, practices, procedures, judgments and estimation methodology
used by Seller and the Business, as applicable, in the normal year-end closing
process of the Business as reflected in Sellers historical Hyperion accounts
and applied consistent with past practice (the "Calculation Principles").
Seller shall provide, or use reasonable best efforts to cause to be provided,
to Buyer all information reasonably requested by Buyer, including any work
papers (including those prepared by Sellers accountant) and other supporting
documents, used in preparing the Reference Date Balance Sheet. The Parties
agree that (i) the Reference Date Balance Sheet provides an accurate example
of how the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Balance Sheet are to
be prepared and (ii) the Reference Date Net Working Capital and the Reference
Date Net Debt provide accurate examples of how Net Working Capital and Net
Debt, respectively, are to be calculated for the purposes of this Agreement.

 

(c)

 

At least five (5) Business Days before the Closing, Seller shall deliver to
Buyer a preliminary Closing Balance Sheet for the Business (prepared as of the
end of the most recent calendar month for which balance sheet data is
available in the ordinary course of business) (the "Preliminary Closing
Balance Sheet"). The Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet will be in the format
set out in the Reference Date Balance Sheet and set forth a good faith
estimate of (i) the amount of Net Working Capital (such estimate, the
"Estimated Net Working Capital") and (ii) the amount of Net Debt (such
estimate, the "Estimated Net Debt"). The Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet
shall be prepared using (i) the same policies and procedures (including asset
valuation allowances) used in the preparation of the Reference Date Balance
Sheet; and (ii) the Calculation Principles, without deviation except to
reflect changes in facts or circumstances that occurred between the Reference
Date Balance Sheet and the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet. The parties
acknowledge that the sole purpose of the working capital adjustment provided
in this Agreement is to ensure that the purchase price takes into account only
the cash impact of the changes in working capital between the Reference Date
and the Closing. Accordingly, the parties agree that none of the Preliminary
Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Balance Sheet, Net Working Capital, and Net
Debt shall take into account any events to occur or occurring after the
Closing. Seller shall also prepare and deliver to Buyer a worksheet showing
the difference, if any, between the Estimated Net Working Capital and the Net
Working Capital Threshold. The amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net
Working Capital exceeds the Net Working Capital Threshold is referred to
herein as the "Estimated Buyer Working Capital Payment". The amount, if any,
by which the Net Working Capital Threshold exceeds the Estimated Net Working
Capital is referred to herein as the "Estimated Seller Working Capital
Payment".

 

(d)

 

At least five (5) Business Days before the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to
Seller a statement (the "Estimated Buyer Closing Statement") consisting of a
calculation in reasonable detail of the estimated Divestiture EBITDA and the
estimated Divestiture Adjustment Amount (the "Estimated Divestiture Adjustment
Amount"). Seller shall have the right to object to the amounts contained in
the Estimated Buyer Closing Statement within two (2) Business Days after the
delivery of the Estimated Buyer Closing Statement to Seller. Buyer shall in
good faith consider the objections, if any, of Seller to the Estimated Buyer
Closing Statement and, if Seller has made any reasonable objections, will re-
issue an Estimated Buyer Closing Statement containing the Estimated
Divestiture Adjustment Amount no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date with any such revisions that Buyer has determined in good faith
are appropriate.

Section 2.07

 

 _Post-Closing Adjustments to Purchase Price._

 

(a)

 

Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and delivered to Seller no later
than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, (i) a statement of Net Working
Capital and Net Debt, which statement (the "Closing Balance Sheet") will be in
the format set out in the Reference Date Balance Sheet, together with a
worksheet setting forth in reasonable detail how the amounts reflected on the
Closing Balance Sheet were calculated and showing the difference, if any,
between (A) the Net Working Capital shown on the Closing Balance Sheet (Net
Working Capital as finally determined in accordance with _Section 2.07(b)_ ,
the "Final Net Working Capital") and the Estimated Net Working Capital and (B)
the Net Debt shown on the Closing Balance Sheet (Net Debt as finally
determined in accordance with _Section 2.07(b)_ , the "Final Net Debt") and
the Estimated Net Debt and (ii) a statement setting forth in reasonable detail
Buyers calculations of Buyer 2016 Adjusted EBIT, and MHPS 2016 Adjusted
EBITDA and the Share Adjustment Amount based on such calculations (the "Share
Adjustment Calculation"). The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared using
(i) the same policies and procedures (including asset valuation allowances)
used in the preparation of the Reference Date Balance Sheet; and (ii) the
Calculation Principles, without deviation except to reflect changes in facts
or circumstances that occurred between the Reference Date Balance Sheet and
the Closing Date Balance Sheet. The parties acknowledge that the sole purpose
of the working capital adjustment provided in this Agreement is to ensure that
the purchase price takes into account only the cash impact of the changes in
working capital between the Reference Date and the Closing. Accordingly, the
Parties agree that the Closing Balance Sheet shall not take into account any
events occurring after the Closing. In addition, the Parties agree that any
amount used for purposes of determining calculating Indebtedness, Net Working
Capital, intercompany payables or any other similar adjustment or as a basis
for any indemnification hereunder, shall be counted only once and may not be
counted in more than one adjustment hereunder.

 

(b)

 

For thirty (30) days following its receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet and
the Share Adjustment Calculation, Seller shall have the right to object
thereto or any portion thereof. At all times from the date Seller receives
the Closing Balance Sheet and the Share Adjustment Calculation until the final
determination of the Closing Balance Sheet, Final Net Working Capital, Final
Net Debt, the Share Adjustment Calculation and the Share Adjustment Amount in
accordance with this _Section 2.07(b)_ , Seller and its representatives shall
be permitted to review Buyers working papers and any working papers of
Buyers representatives relating to the preparation of the Closing Balance
Sheet or the Share Adjustment Calculation or the calculation of Net Working
Capital or Net Debt shown on the Closing Balance Sheet or the calculations of
Buyer 2016 Adjusted EBIT, MHPS 2016 Adjusted EBITDA or the Share Adjustment
Amount, as well as all books, records and other information relating to the
Business, including the information relating to Net Working Capital or Net
Debt shown on the Closing Balance Sheet or the calculations of Buyer 2016
Adjusted EBIT, MHPS 2016 Adjusted EBITDA or the Share Adjustment Amount shown
on the Share Adjustment Calculation, and Buyer shall make reasonably available
to Seller and its representatives all relevant personnel of Buyer or any of
its Affiliates and instruct the employees, counsel, financial advisors and the
independent accountants of Buyer and its Affiliates to cooperate with Seller
and its representatives in their investigation of the Closing Balance Sheet
and the Net Working Capital and Net Debt shown on the Closing Balance Sheet
and of the Share Adjustment Calculation and Buyer 2016 Adjusted EBIT, MHPS
2016 Adjusted EBITDA and the Share Adjustment Amount shown on the Share
Adjustment Calculation. Any objection made by Seller shall be accompanied by
materials showing in reasonable detail Sellers support for its position or a
reasonable basis for why it lacks sufficient information on which to make such
an objection. Seller shall be deemed to have waived any rights to object to
the Closing Balance Sheet and the Share Adjustment Calculation, unless Seller
furnishes its written objections to Buyer within such thirty (30) day period.
During the ninety (90) days after Buyers receipt of Sellers objection to the
Closing Balance Sheet (the "Consultation Period"), Buyer and Seller shall seek
in good faith to resolve any differences in their respective positions with
respect to the Closing Balance Sheet and the Share Adjustment Calculation.
During the Consultation Period, each party shall provide the other party
supporting documentation and make their respective representatives reasonably
available to answer questions as to their respective positions with respect to
the Closing Balance Sheet and the Share Adjustment Calculation. If Buyer and
Seller are unable to agree on the Closing Balance Sheet and the Share
Adjustment Calculation within ninety (90) days after Buyers receipt of
Sellers written objections, Seller shall appoint a Big Four Accounting Firm,
excluding any such Big Four Accounting Firm (including any of their
Affiliates) that serves as the independent auditor of Seller or Buyer (such
firm, the "Accountant"), to resolve all matters that remain in dispute. Buyer
and Seller shall execute any agreement reasonably required by the Accountant
for its engagement hereunder. The Accountant, acting as an expert and not as
an arbitrator, shall be charged with determining as promptly as practicable,
but in any event within thirty (30) days after the date on which such dispute
is referred to the Accountant, whether (i) Net Working Capital and Net Debt
shown on the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Balance Sheet were prepared
in accordance with this Agreement, in the same manner as set forth in _Section
2.07(a)_ , and (ii) Buyer 2016 Adjusted EBIT, MHPS 2016 Adjusted EBITDA and
the Share Adjustment Amount shown on the Share Adjustment Calculation were
prepared in accordance with this Agreement and (only with respect to the
disagreements as to the disputed line items set forth in the notice of
disagreement and submitted to the Accountant and any corresponding adjustment
required by resolution of such adjustment, and in all instances, the
Accountants determination for each such disputed line item must be within the
range of the amounts asserted by Buyer and Seller with respect to such
disputed line item) whether and to what extent, if any, Net Working Capital
and Net Debt shown on the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Balance Sheet
require adjustment to conform with the method of determination set forth in
_Section 2.07(a)_ or to correct mathematical errors and whether and to what
extent, if any, Buyer 2016 Adjusted EBIT, MHPS 2016

Adjusted EBITDA and the Share Adjustment Amount shown on the Share Adjustment
Calculation require adjustment to conform with the method of determination set
forth in this Agreement or to correct mathematical errors, and the Accountant
is not to make any other determination. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Accountant (i) shall not review any line items or make any determination with
respect to any matter other than those matters that remain in dispute at the
end of the Consultation Period, (ii) with respect to the Closing Balance
Sheet, shall have no discretion to deviate from the calculation method set
forth in _Section 2.07(a)_ and (iii) shall make its determination based solely
on presentations and supporting material provided by the parties and not
pursuant to any independent inquiry. The Accountant shall allocate its costs
and expenses between Buyer and Seller based upon the percentage of the
contested amount submitted to the Accountant that is ultimately awarded to
Buyer on the one hand or Seller on the other hand, such that Buyer bears a
percentage of such costs and expenses equal to the percentage of the contested
amount awarded to Seller and Seller bears a percentage of such costs and
expenses equal to the percentage of the contested amount awarded to Buyer. If
there is no timely objection as provided above, the Closing Balance Sheet and
Net Working Capital and Net Debt shown on the Closing Balance Sheet and Buyer
2016 Adjusted EBIT, MHPS 2016 Adjusted EBITDA and the Share Adjustment Amount
shown on the Share Adjustment Calculation shall be binding and final for
purposes of this Agreement. If there is a timely objection as provided above,
(i) the resolution of the parties as to any disputed matter and (ii) solely
with respect to those matters that remain in dispute after the Consultation
Period, the determination of the Accountant, in each case, shall be binding
and final for purposes of this Agreement.

 

(c)

 

The amount equal to the Final Net Working Capital minus the Estimated Net
Working Capital shall be referred to as the "Working Capital Difference". The
amount equal to the Final Net Debt minus the Estimated Net Debt shall be
referred to as the "Net Debt Difference". The amount equal to the Final
Divestiture Adjustment Amount minus the Estimated Divestiture Adjustment
Amount shall be referred to as the "Divestiture Adjustment Difference". Within
two (2) Business Days following the final determination of the Final Net
Working Capital and the Final Net Debt, whether by agreement between Buyer and
Seller or as otherwise set forth in _Section 2.07(b)_ , (i) (A) Buyer shall
pay to Sellers an amount equal to the absolute value of the Working Capital
Difference if the Working Capital Difference is a positive number, and (B)
Sellers shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the absolute value of the
Working Capital Difference if the Working Capital Difference is a negative
number; and (ii) (A) Sellers shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the
absolute value of the Net Debt Difference, if the Net Debt Difference is a
positive number, and (B) Buyer shall pay to Sellers an amount equal to the
absolute value of the Net Debt Difference, if the Net Debt Difference is a
negative number. Such amounts shall be paid, in immediately available funds,
pursuant to instructions delivered by Buyer or Seller, as applicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate of the respective amounts to be
paid (if any) by Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, under
the preceding two sentences shall, if payable at the same time, be netted
against each other and the party with the positive net payment obligation
shall pay such net obligation amount. 

 

(d)

 

Within ten (10) Business Days following the final determination of the Share
Adjustment Amount, whether by agreement between Buyer and Seller or as
otherwise set forth in _Section 2.07(b)_ , (i) if the Share Adjustment Amount
is a positive number, Buyer shall deliver to Seller (or its designated
Affiliate(s)) a number of Class B Shares equal to the Share Adjustment Amount
and (ii) if the Share Adjustment Amount is a negative number, Seller (or its
designated Affiliate(s)) shall surrender to Buyer a number of Class B Shares
equal to the absolute value of the Share Adjustment Amount.

 

(e)

 

In the event that either Party discovers within ninety (90) days after the
Closing that there exists any Seller Intercompany Balance or Group Company
Intercompany Balance then such Party shall inform the other Party, in writing,
of the balances so discovered, together with reasonable supporting detail
therefor and such other Party will have thirty (30) days to review such
information and to provide any objection to the calculations presented.
During the Consultation Period, the Parties shall seek in good faith to
resolve any differences in their respective positions with respect to Seller
Intercompany Balances or Group Company Intercompany Balances, and make their
respective representatives reasonably available to answer questions as to
their respective positions with respect to such amounts. If the Parties are
unable to agree on any such amount during the Consultation Period, then such
dispute shall be referred to the Accountant and resolved in accordance with
the dispute provisions set forth in Section 2.06(b). Upon final agreement as
to the Seller Intercompany Balances and Group Intercompany Balances (or upon
the Accountants final determination thereof, which shall be final and binding
on the Parties) the absolute value of the difference between all such Seller
Intercompany Balances so discovered and all such Group Intercompany Balances
so discovered shall be deemed for purposes of this Agreement (i) an increase
to the Transaction Consideration if the Group Company Intercompany Balances
are greater than the Seller Intercompany Balances and (ii) a decrease to the
Transaction Consideration if the Seller Intercompany Balances are greater than
the Group Company Intercompany Balances. Such deemed adjustment shall be
finalized between the Parties no later than the date on which the Closing
Balance Sheet is deemed final for purposes of this Agreement in accordance
with Section 2.06(c). For purposes of this Agreement, a payable discovered
after Closing in favor of the Seller or any of its Affiliates (that prior to
Closing was an intercompany payable and was not taken into account in the
calculations of Net Working Capital or Final Net Working Capital) shall herein
be referred to as a "Seller Intercompany Balance" and a payable discovered
after Closing in favor of a Group Company (that prior to Closing was an
intercompany payable and was not taken into account in the calculations of Net
Working Capital or Final Net Working Capital) shall herein be referred to as a
"Group Company Intercompany Balance."

(f)

 

From and after the Closing, each Party shall provide the other Party any
documents relating to, and make their respective Representatives reasonably
available to answer questions with respect to, any completed Divestiture Sale.
Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, no later than ninety (90) days
after the later or the Closing Date and the consummation of the final
Divestiture Sale, and deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth in reasonable
detail any continuing disagreements ("Divestiture Disputes") with the
Estimated Buyer Closing Statement, a calculation in reasonable detail of the
Divestiture EBITDA, the Divestiture Adjustment Amount and an amount, if any,
payable pursuant to this _Section 2.07(f)_. Seller and Buyer shall attempt in
good faith for thirty (30) days to resolve such Divestiture Disputes. If a
resolution cannot be reached through good faith negotiation within thirty (30)
days then, at the request of either Buyer or Seller, Buyer and Seller shall
jointly engage and submit the unresolved Divestiture Disputes to the
Accountant, and such Divestiture Disputes shall be resolved in accordance with
the mechanics set forth in _Section 2.07(b)_ , applied _mutatis mutandis_ to
resolve Divestiture Disputes (such Divestiture Adjustment Amount, as agreed
between Buyer and Seller or as finally determined in accordance with the
mechanics set forth in _Section 2.07(b)_ , applied _mutatis mutandis_ to
resolve Divestiture Disputes, the "Final Divestiture Adjustment Amount").
Within two (2) Business Days following the determination of the Final
Divestiture Adjustment, (i) Sellers shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the
absolute value of the Divestiture Adjustment Difference, if the Divestiture
Adjustment Difference is a positive number, and (ii) Buyer shall pay to
Sellers an amount equal to the absolute value of the Divestiture Adjustment
Difference, if the Divestiture Adjustment Difference is a negative number.

 

(g)

 

Nothing in this _Section 2.07_ shall preclude any party from exercising, or
shall adversely affect or otherwise limit in any respect the exercise of, any
right or remedy available to it hereunder for any misrepresentation or breach
of warranty hereunder, but neither Buyer nor Seller shall have any right to
dispute the Closing Balance Sheet, the Final Net Working Capital, the Final
Net Debt, the Share Adjustment Calculation, Buyer 2016 Adjusted EBIT, MHPS
2016 Adjusted EBITDA, the Share Adjustment Amount or the Final Divestiture
Adjustment Amount or any portion thereof once it has been finally determined
in accordance with _Section 2.07(b)_.

 

Section 2.08

 

 _Divestiture Proceeds_.

 

(a)

 

If the Divestiture Adjustment Amount is greater than $0, then from and after
the Closing, upon, as applicable, the Closing or the receipt of any
Divestiture Proceeds, Buyer shall pay to Seller in U.S. dollars (converted, if
necessary, at the Spot Exchange Rate) an amount equal to the Seller
Divestiture Proceeds (it being agreed and understood that each time Buyer is
required to make a payment under this _Section 2.08(a)_ , the Seller
Divestiture Proceeds shall be calculated taking into account all Divestiture
Proceeds and the amount Buyer shall be required to pay to Seller pursuant to
this _Section 2.08(a)_ shall be net of all prior payments made by Buyer to
Seller pursuant to this _Section 2.08(a)_ (excluding any amounts reimbursed by
Seller pursuant to _Section 2.08(b)_ )).

 

(b)

 

If any Divestiture Sale provides for potential post-closing indemnity or other
payments by Buyer, the Group Companies or any of their Affiliates and such
payments are actually made, Seller agrees to reimburse Buyer from time to time
for any difference in the amount that would have been paid to Seller pursuant
to this _Section 2.08_ if the Divestiture Proceeds had been reduced by the
amount of post-closing indemnity or other payments.

 

(c)

 

For purposes of this Agreement (i) "Seller Divestiture Proceeds" means an
amount equal to the product of (A) the Divestiture Proceeds, _multiplied by_
(B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Divestiture EBITDA, _minus_
U.S.$20,000,000 and the denominator of which is the Divestiture EBITDA;
_provided_ that in no event shall the Seller Divestiture Proceeds exceed the
Divestiture Adjustment Amount; and (ii) "Divestiture Proceeds" means the
aggregate amount of consideration received by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
in respect of assets that are or will be the subject of a Divestiture Sale or
any distributions or other proceeds received or retained from such assets net
of all reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses arising out of
any Divestiture Sale (which costs and expenses shall not include any income
taxes paid or required to be paid with respect thereto). If Divestiture
EBITDA is not finally determined on the date a payment is required to be made
by Buyer pursuant to _Section 2.08(a)_ , the amount of such payment will be
determined based on the estimated Divestiture EBITDA set forth in the
Estimated Buyer Closing Statement and adjusted promptly after Divestiture
EBITDA and the Final Divestiture Adjustment Amount are finally determined.

 

Section 2.09

 

 _Withholding Tax_. Provided that the certificates described in _Section
3.02(a)(v)_ are timely received, the payment of any amount specified in this
Agreement shall be paid free and clear of, and without any deduction or
withholding on account of, any Tax, unless Buyer determines that withholding
is required by Law, in which case Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of such
determination no later than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date and shall provide Seller with a reasonable opportunity to provide any
required information, statements, or forms, or to take such other steps as may
be reasonably required, to reduce or eliminate any required withholding. Any
amount deducted and withheld in accordance with this _Section 2.09_ and
remitted to the relevant Taxing Authority in accordance with applicable Law
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
payee.

Section 2.10

 

 _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

 

(a)

 

Within two (2) months following the delivery of a draft Pre-Closing
Reorganization Plan in accordance with _Section 5.14_ , Buyer and Seller
shall, in good faith, seek to mutually agree a written schedule that allocates
the Transaction Consideration among the Sellers according to the relative fair
market values of the Acquired Assets, the MHPS Shares and the 50% interest in
the DeMag JV (the "Consideration Allocation Schedule", which term shall
include any amendments made thereto in accordance with this Agreement). In
the event that the parties cannot mutually agree upon a resolution with
respect to any disputed items to be included in the Consideration Allocation
Schedule within two (2) months following the delivery of the draft Pre-Closing
Reorganization Plan, such disagreement shall be resolved by the Accountant in
the manner described in _Section 2.07(b)_ , and the Consideration Allocation
Schedule shall be amended accordingly; provided, however, that any such
disagreements shall be resolved no later than five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date. Following the Closing, amendments to the Consideration
Allocation Schedule shall be governed by the following provisions:

 

(i)

 

Any payments made after the Closing to Buyer from Sellers or from Buyer to
Sellers shall be allocated among the Sellers as follows: (A) to the extent any
such payment (or portion thereof) relates primarily to one or more Sellers (or
to assets or one or more Subsidiaries sold by one or more Sellers), such
payment (or portion thereof) shall be allocated to such Seller(s) and (B) to
the extent any such payment (or portion thereof) does not relate primarily to
one or more Sellers (or to assets or one or more Subsidiaries sold by one or
more Sellers), such payment (or portion thereof) shall be allocated among the
Sellers in proportion to the allocation of the Transaction Consideration among
the Sellers in the Consideration Allocation Schedule (as of immediately prior
to the payment at issue).

 

(ii)

 

The Closing Balance Sheet and the Share Adjustment Calculation shall contain
an allocation among the Sellers of any transfers to be made under _Section
2.07(c)_ and _Section 2.07(d)_ , respectively, which allocation shall be (A)
made in accordance with applicable Law and clause (i) above, and (B) subject
to the same timing and dispute resolution procedures as all other aspects of
the Closing Balance Sheet and the Share Adjustment Calculation, as set forth
in Section 2.07. The Parties shall amend the Consideration Allocation Schedule
following the finalization of the Closing Balance Sheet and Share Adjustment
Calculation to reflect the allocations contained therein.

 

(iii)

 

The Parties shall amend the Consideration Allocation Schedule to account for
any payment made pursuant to _Section 2.07(f)_ and _Section 2.08(a)_ , in
accordance with applicable Law and clause (i) above.

 

(iv)

 

Any written notice delivered pursuant to _Section 8.03(a)_ shall contain a
proposed allocation among the Sellers of the amount claimed, in accordance
with applicable Law and clause (i) above. The Parties shall work together in
good faith to resolve any disputes regarding such allocation (including, if
necessary, by submitting any such disputes to the Accountant for resolution in
the manner described in _Section 2.07(b)_ ) prior to the disbursement of any
payment in respect of the claim, and shall amend the Consideration Allocation
Schedule to reflect such allocation as agreed and/or resolved in accordance
with this provision.

 

(b)

 

As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, and in any event within thirty
(30) days thereof, Buyer shall deliver to Seller an allocation of the purchase
price (consistent with the Consideration Allocation Schedule and as determined
for income tax purposes) paid to each Asset Seller and each Equity Seller that
is deemed (or a parent of which is deemed with respect to such Equity Seller)
for income tax purposes to sell assets (or to have its assets sold) among the
assets sold by such Asset Seller or deemed sold by or with respect to such
Equity Seller, in each case in accordance with applicable Law (the "Asset
Allocation Schedule", which term shall include any amendments made thereto in
accordance with this Agreement, and, together with the Consideration
Allocation Schedule, the "Allocation Schedules").

 

(c)

 

Seller shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the Asset Allocation
Schedule unless Seller objects by delivering, within fifteen (15) Business
Days after receipt of the Asset Allocation Schedule, written notice to Buyer
of such objection. Such notice shall specify in reasonable detail the items to
which Seller objects and the basis for such objection. In the event that the
parties cannot mutually agree upon a resolution with respect to such disputed
items within fifteen (15) Business Days of Buyer\'s receipt of such notice,
such disagreement shall be resolved by the Accountant in the manner described
in _Section 2.07(b)_ , and the Asset Allocation Schedule shall be amended
accordingly. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to amend the Asset
Allocation Schedule as required to reflect any subsequent amendments to the
Consideration Allocation Schedule. In the event that the parties cannot
mutually agree upon any such amendment, such disagreement shall be resolved by
the Accountant in the manner described in _Section 2.07(b)_ and the Asset
Allocation Schedule shall be amended accordingly.

(d)

 

Buyer and Seller agree to (i) be bound by the Allocation Schedules, (ii) act
in accordance with the Allocation Schedules in the filing of all Tax Returns
(including, without limitation, filing Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 (and
any supplemental or amended Form 8594) with their U.S. federal income Tax
Return for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date) and in the course
of any Tax audit, Tax examination or Tax litigation relating thereto (and to
cooperate in the preparation of any such filings), and (iii) take no position
and cause its Affiliates to take no position inconsistent with the Allocation
Schedules for Tax purposes, in each case, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 2.10(d)_
shall require a party to commence or otherwise engage in any litigation
regarding the Allocation Schedules.

 

Section 2.11

 

 _Works Council Matters_.

 

(a)

 

Seller and Buyer acknowledge that, under French labor Laws, one or more works
councils of Terex Cranes France SAS and Noell Reggiane France S.a.r.l. will
need to be informed and consulted with respect to the offer made by Buyer to
acquire the total outstanding Equity Interests and voting rights of Terex
Cranes France SAS and Noell Reggiane France S.a.r.l. (the "French Companies"
"), and the French assets listed at _Section 2.11(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter_ (the "French Assets"), collectively, the "French Business".
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, unless and until
Seller has executed and delivered to Buyer the France Acceptance Notice, for
the purpose of this _ARTICLE II_ , the French Companies and the French Assets
will not be considered, respectively, to be a Transferred Company or Acquired
Assets.

 

(b)

 

On the terms and conditions set forth in the offer letter attached as _Exhibit
C_ hereto (the "French Offer Letter" and the offer set forth therein, the
"French Offer"), including the price specified therein (the "France Purchase
Price"), Buyer has irrevocably offered to acquire the French Business (within
the time limit set forth therein) and to have the provisions of this _ARTICLE
II_ apply to the French Business following completion of the consultation
process described in _Section 2.11(a)_. Subject to acceptance of the French
Offer by Seller following completion of the consultation process described in
_Section 2.11(a)_ , and upon delivery to Buyer of the executed acceptance
notice attached as Schedule 2 to the French Offer Letter (the "France
Acceptance Notice"), this _ARTICLE II_ shall be effective with respect to the
French Business, the French Companies shall be included in the Transferred
Companies, the French Assets shall be included in the Acquired Assets and the
Transaction Consideration shall be increased by the France Purchase Price (it
being understood that the Transaction Consideration does not assume delivery
of the France Acceptance Notice and therefore does not already include the
France Purchase Price).

 

(c)

 

Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Seller and its relevant Affiliates in
connection with the applicable consultation processes described in this
_Section 2.11_ , including timely provision of any required information
relating to Buyer in respect of such consultation processes. 

 

(d)

 

If, as a result of the consultation process of any of the works councils,
changes to this Agreement or further arrangements in connection with the
Transactions are considered necessary, Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in
good faith on such changes (if any) to this Agreement or further arrangements
(if any) in connection with the Transactions that are appropriate, in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the French Offer Letter.

 

(e)

 

Seller agrees that until January 31, 2017, except pursuant to this Agreement
and the French Offer, it shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of the French Business or agree to
the foregoing.

 

Section 2.12

 

 _Tax Treatment of Post-Closing Payments_. For Tax purposes, the Parties shall
treat any payments made pursuant to _Section 2.07_ or _Section 2.08_ and any
indemnity payments made pursuant to ARTICLE VIII as adjustments to the Cash
Consideration in accordance with the amendments to the Consideration
Allocation Schedule made with respect to such payments pursuant to _Section
2.10(a)_ , except to the extent otherwise required by Law.

 

ARTICLE III 
  
  _CLOSING_

 

Section 3.01

 

 _Closing_. The closing of the sale and purchase of the MHPS Shares and the
Acquired Assets (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, 40 Bank Street, London E14 5DS, United
Kingdom, at 9:00 a.m. (London time) (the "Effective Time") on the date that is
five (5) Business Days after the satisfaction or written waiver (to the extent
permitted by applicable Law) of the Closing Conditions in accordance with
_ARTICLE VI_ (other than those Closing Conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
those Closing Conditions at such time), or on such other date or at such other
time or place as the Parties may agree in writing; _provided that_ , unless
otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing, the Closing shall not

 


  

 

10

  

 



 

occur prior to January 4, 2017 (it being agreed and understood that if the
Closing occurs on January 4, 2017, the Closing shall be deemed effective as of
12:01 a.m. on January 1, 2017). The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date". For all purposes under
this Agreement, (a) all matters at the Closing will be considered to take

Equity Interests of Buyer or its Subsidiaries, or any Equity Interests or
obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any
Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any Equity Interests of Buyer or
its Subsidiaries, and no Equity Interests or obligations evidencing such
rights are authorized, issued or outstanding.

 _Subsidiaries_. Except as disclosed in _Section 4.03(c) of the Buyer
Disclosure Letter_ , Buyer is, directly or indirectly, the record and

delivery by Buyer of this Agreement, the performance of its obligations
hereunder and the consummation by Buyer of the Transactions have been duly

execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller, constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance

Agreement, the compliance by it with all of the provisions of and the
performance by it of its obligations under this Agreement, nor the
consummation by Buyer of the Transactions (A) will conflict with, or result in
a breach or violation of, or result in any acceleration of any rights or
obligations or the payment of any penalty under or the creation of a Lien on

 _Preparation of Buyer EGM Documents_.

 

(a)

 

As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall, with
the assistance of Seller, prepare the information required to be furnished to
shareholders of Buyer under applicable Law for the Buyer Shareholders Meeting
(the "Buyer EGM Documents"). Each Party shall cooperate with each other and
use its reasonable best efforts to publish the Buyer EGM Documents as required
under applicable Law, as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement. Seller shall furnish as promptly as practicable such information
concerning the Group Companies as reasonably requested by Buyer in connection
with the Buyer EGM Documents or other filings required under applicable Law,
including such information as necessary in order for the Buyer EGM Documents
to be compliant with applicable form requirements, if any.

 

(b)

 

None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Buyer and Seller for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Buyer EGM Documents will
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, and the Buyer EGM Documents, at the date of its publication,
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. If, at any time prior to the Buyer Shareholders Meeting, any
information relating to Buyer or the Business or any of its Affiliates,
directors or officers should be discovered by Buyer or Seller which should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Buyer EGM Documents, so that
such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the Party that
has made such discovery shall promptly notify the other Party of such
information and such Party shall cooperate in the prompt publication of any
necessary amendment or supplement to the Buyer EGM Documents and any
recognized dissemination thereof to the shareholders of Buyer.

 


  

 

30

  

 



 



 

(c)

 

Buyer shall cause the Buyer EGM Documents to comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of applicable Law, except that Buyer shall not
be required to make any representation or warranty except as required by
applicable Law with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference
therein based on information supplied by Seller for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Buyer EGM Documents.

 

(d)

 

No material amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by reference)
to the Buyer EGM Documents shall be made without the approval of Seller, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

(e)

 

Each of Buyer and Seller shall make any necessary filings with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

 

Section 5.03

 

 _Buyer Shareholder Meeting_.

 

(a)

 

Buyer shall take, in accordance with applicable Law and its articles of
association, all actions necessary to cause, as soon as practicable after the
date of this Agreement and, in any event, within sixty (60) days of the date
of this Agreement, an annual or extraordinary general meeting of its
shareholders for the purpose of voting on the matters subject to the Buyer
Requisite Vote (the "Buyer Shareholders Meeting") to be duly called and held
as soon as practicable thereafter, _provided_ , that Buyer shall not be
required to hold the Buyer Shareholders Meeting for the period beginning on
July 11, 2016 and ending on August 15, 2016, and shall submit all of the
matters subject to the Buyer Requisite Vote to its shareholders to be voted on
together as a single matter.

 

(b)

 

The Buyer Board (A) shall recommend that shareholders of Buyer vote in favor
of the authorization and approval of any of the matters subject to the Buyer
Requisite Vote (the "Buyer Board Recommendation"), (B) shall include the Buyer
Board Recommendation in the Buyer EGM Documents, and (C) shall not withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify, or publicly announce its intent to withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Seller, the Buyer Board
Recommendation. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 5.03(b)_
shall prohibit Buyer from disclosing to its shareholders any fact or
circumstance that is required to be disclosed under applicable Law or that the
Buyer determines, in good faith and after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, is material to shareholders in making their decision in how to vote
on the matters subject to the Buyer Requisite Vote; _provided_ that to the
extent that Buyer reasonably determines that such disclosure could have
substantially the same effect as a withdrawal, qualification or modification
of the Buyer Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Seller, Buyer shall
publicly reaffirm the Buyer Board Recommendation concurrently with making such
disclosure.

 

Section 5.04

 

 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Regulatory Filings and Other Actions._

 

(a)

 

Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts
to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement and
applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Transactions as promptly
as practicable, after the date hereof, including (i) preparing and filing as
promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices,
reports and other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all
consents, registrations, approvals, authorizations, clearances, no-action
letters and other permits necessary or deemed advisable by Seller and Buyer to
be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to
consummate the Transactions, including preparing and making a filing for
Finnish CFIUS Approval and a joint, voluntary filing with CFIUS pursuant to
Exon-Florio, (ii) responding as promptly as reasonably practicable to any
inquiries or requests for additional information and documentary material
received from any Governmental Entity in connection with any antitrust or
competition matters or Exon-Florio related to the Transactions, (iii) not
agreeing to extend any waiting period or to refile under Antitrust Law or
Exon-Florio (except with the prior written consent of the other Party hereto,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and
(iv) not entering into any agreement with any Governmental Entity to not
consummate the Transactions. If any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any Transaction as violative of any
Antitrust Law or Exon-Florio, each of Seller and Buyer shall use their
reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
Transactions.

 

(b)

 

Subject to _Section 5.04(b)_ , each of Seller and Buyer agree to take (and to
cause its affiliates to take) promptly any and all steps necessary or
advisable to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment and obtain all
consents under any Antitrust Laws that may be required by any non-U.S. or U.S.
federal, state or local Governmental Entity, in each case with competent
jurisdiction, or to obtain a CFIUS Approval, to ensure that no Governmental
Entity enters any order, decision, judgment, decree, ruling, injunction
(preliminary or permanent), or establishes any law, rule, regulation or other
action preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the
consummation of the Transaction, including accepting operational restrictions
or limitations

 


  

 

31

  

 



 

and committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders,
trust, or otherwise, the sale, license, disposition or holding separate of
such assets or businesses of Seller, Buyer or any of their Subsidiaries as are
required (and the entry into agreements with, and submission to orders of, the
relevant Governmental Entity). Further, and for the avoidance of doubt, each
of Seller and Buyer shall take (and shall cause each of its affiliates to
take) any and all actions necessary or advisable in order to ensure that (x)
no requirement for any non-action by or consent or approval of any
Governmental Entity with respect to any Antitrust Laws or Exon-Florio, (y) no
decree, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or any other order
in any suit or proceeding with respect to any Antitrust Laws or Exon-Florio,
and (z) no other matter relating to any Antitrust Laws or Exon-Florio would
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions.

 

(c)

 

Nothing in this _Section 5.04_ shall require, or be construed to require,
Buyer or Seller to proffer to, or agree to, sell, divest or hold separate or
take any other action with respect to any assets, businesses, or interests in
any assets or businesses of (i) Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) the
Business (or to consent to any sale, divestiture or holding separate, or
agreement to sell, divest or hold separate by (i) Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries or (ii) the Business, as the case may be, of any of its assets,
businesses or interests in any of its assets or businesses), if (i) such
action would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a Substantial Detriment or (ii) if such action is not contingent
upon the consummation of the Closing. Subject to applicable Law and the
instructions of any Governmental Entity, Seller and Buyer shall keep each
other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
Transactions, including promptly furnishing outside counsel for the other
Party with copies of notices or other communications received or provided by
Seller and Buyer, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
from or to any third party and/or Governmental Entity with respect to such
transactions. Without limiting the foregoing, in connection with such Partys
efforts to eliminate each and every impediment and obtain all consents under
any Antitrust Laws that may be required by any non-U.S. or U.S. federal, state
or local Governmental Entity, Buyer shall consult with Seller before making
any voluntary proposal in any phase one review of any Governmental Entity in
respect of a Divestiture Sale and Buyer shall not voluntarily make any phase
one proposal of any Divestiture Sale that would include Divestiture EBITDA of
an amount equal to or greater than $20,000,000 without the prior written
consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. In addition, (x) in the event that the Parties agree
to a proposal for a Divestiture Sale which includes Divestiture EBITDA of
$30,000,000 or more, then Buyer shall be deemed to have waived its right to
terminate the Agreement under _Section 7.01(e)_ and (y) in the event that the
Parties agree to a proposal for a Divestiture Sale which includes Divestiture
EBITDA of $40,000,000 or more (ignoring for this purpose the proviso in the
definition of "Divestiture EBITDA"), then Seller shall be deemed to have
waived its right to terminate the Agreement under _Section 7.01(f)_.

 

(d)

 

Subject to applicable Laws relating to the sharing of information, Seller and
Buyer shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable, each will consult the other on any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity, in
connection with the Transactions. (i) To the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity and (ii) to the extent that the communication or meeting
relates to a national security risk mitigation agreement between Buyer and
CFIUS or any of its constituent agencies, Seller and Buyer shall provide the
other party with the opportunity to participate in any material meeting with
any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other
inquiry in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Seller and
Buyer shall keep each other apprised of all material discussions with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(e)

 

Seller and Buyer each shall, upon request by the other and subject to
applicable Laws relating to the sharing of information, furnish the other with
all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, affiliates, and such
other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with
any statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Seller
and Buyer or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions.

 

(f)

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, for any information
exchanged under this _Section 5.04_ , it is understood that Seller and Buyer
may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other party under this
_Section 5.04_ or any subsection thereof as "outside counsel only." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient unless
express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials
(Seller or Buyer, as the case may be) or its legal counsel; provided, further,
that materials provided pursuant to this _Section 5.04_ or any subsection
thereof may, to the extent permitted by Law or the Governmental Entity, be
redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements
with third parties and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable privilege
concerns. The parties hereto agree to treat information protected from
disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint
defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this _Section 5.04_ in a
manner so as to preserve the applicable privilege.

 

Section 5.05

 

 _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding this Agreement and the
Transactions shall be a joint press release and is set forth herein as
_Exhibit H_. Buyer and Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to develop a
joint communications plan and each party shall use reasonable best efforts to
ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the
Transactions, to the extent they have not been previously issued or disclosed,
shall be consistent with such joint communications plan. Unless otherwise
required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement
with or rules of any securities

 


  

 

32

  

 



 

exchange, each party hereto shall consult with each other before issuing any
press release or public statement with respect to the Transactions and shall
not issue any such press release or public statement prior to such
consultation. In addition to the foregoing, neither Seller nor Buyer shall
issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement or disclosure
concerning the other party or the other partys business, financial condition
or results of operations, to the extent not previously disclosed, without the
consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 

Section 5.06

 

 _Buyer Ordinary Share Listing_. __

 

(a)

 

Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to cause (i) the Buyer Ordinary
Shares, represented by American depositary shares (the "American Depository
Shares") to be registered under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
"Exchange Act"), (ii) the American Depository Shares, evidenced by American
depository receipts issued upon deposit of Buyer Ordinary Shares, to be
registered under the Securities Act, and (iii) the American Depository Shares
to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange effective as of the earlier of (A)
the date, not earlier than the Closing Date, specified by Seller to Buyer upon
90 days prior written notice, in the event that Seller shall have entered
into an agreement with respect to, or consummated, an Acquisition Proposal,
and (B) the earliest date practicable following the Closing and not later than
90 days thereafter; _provided_ that to the extent the Required Financial
Information is required to register the applicable shares and Buyer has not
received from Seller the Required Financial Information at least 90 days prior
to the date specified in clause (A) or (B) above, as applicable, Buyer shall
only be obligated to cause the listing and registration of the Buyer Ordinary
Shares and the American Depositary Shares within 90 days of receipt of such
Required Financial Information.

 

(b)

 

Seller agrees to provide all information related to the Business (which, for
the avoidance of doubt, may be carve-out financial statements) reasonably
requested by Buyer in connection with such registrations and listing,
including any financial information of the Business necessary (i) to produce
historical financial statements of the Business in accordance with Article
3-05 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act and pro forma financial
statements in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange
Act and (ii) in order to have the registration statement related to the
registration of the Buyer Ordinary Shares be declared effective by the SEC
(the "Required Financial Information"). In order to ensure that the financial
information required under Article 3-05 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange
Act is available to Buyer, Seller agrees that, within 30 days of the date of
this Agreement, the independent accounting firm of Seller, or at Sellers
election, another Big Four Accounting Firm, shall commence an audit of the
financial statements of the Business for the years ended December 31, 2013,
2014, and 2015 in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have such audit completed within
four (4) months of commencement of such audit and in any event prior to
Closing.

 

(c)

 

If Seller in good faith reasonably believes that it has provided the Required
Financial Information to Buyer, Seller may deliver to Buyer a written notice
to that effect, in which case Seller shall be deemed to have provided the
Required Financial Information, unless Buyer in good faith reasonably believes
that Seller has not completed delivery of the Required Financial Information
at the time such notice is delivered and, no later than the third (3rd)
Business Day after delivery of such notice by Seller, Buyer gives written
notice to Seller stating the specific Required Financial Information that has
not been delivered and requesting such additional information as Buyer
reasonably believes is necessary to complete the Required Financial
Information. Buyer shall be entitled to send one such written notice
requesting specific additional information, and when all such requested
additional information is delivered by Seller, for the purposes of _Section
5.06(a)_ only, the Required Financial Information shall be deemed to have been
delivered.

 

Section 5.07

 

 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a)

 

Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably informed regarding any Acquisition Proposal
received by or any information related to an Acquisition Proposal requested
from it or any of its Representatives, including regarding the identity of
such Person making the Acquisition Proposal, the terms and conditions of any
such Acquisition Proposal or request for information and the status of
negotiations with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, in each case, material
to the consummation of the Transactions, and in any event Seller shall provide
written notice to Buyer of the initial receipt of any written Acquisition
Proposal within 48 hours of such event.

 

(b)

 

Seller shall only enter into any Acquisition Proposal if:

 

(i)

 

the definitive agreements providing for such Acquisition Proposal do not
prohibit the consummation of the Transactions in accordance with the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and

 

(ii)

 

in the event that the Closing Date occurs, or is reasonably expected to occur,
after the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal, Buyer and Seller jointly
select a third party escrow agent (the "Seller Change of Control Escrow
Agent") and, prior to completion of the Acquisition Proposal, jointly agree an
escrow agreement (the "Seller Change of Control Escrow Agreement")

 


  

 

33

  

 



 

that contemplates the Share Consideration (which, in accordance with its
terms, shall be converted to Buyer Ordinary Shares) to be delivered by Buyer,
on behalf of Seller, to the Seller Change of Control Escrow Agent within one
(1) Business Day of the Closing Date in satisfaction of its obligations under
_Section 3.02(c)_ to be held on a non-voting basis for the benefit of the
stockholders of Seller existing immediately prior to consummation of the
Acquisition Proposal (excluding such Person making the Acquisition Proposal),
and, upon the registration and listing of the Buyer Ordinary Shares pursuant
to _Section 5.06_ , to be distributed to the stockholders of Seller existing
immediately prior to consummation of the Acquisition Proposal.

 

Section 5.08

 

 _Further Actions_.

 

(a)

 

Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Seller and Buyer shall, and Seller
shall cause its Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts to, (i) take
or cause to be taken all appropriate action, to do or cause to be done all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law and to execute and
deliver such agreements, documents and other papers, as may be required to
carry out the provisions hereof and consummate the Transactions and (ii)
refrain from taking any actions that would reasonably be expected to impair,
delay or impede the Closing.

 

(b)

 

From time to time after the Closing, without additional consideration (except
as set forth in this Agreement), each Party will (or, if appropriate, will
cause its Subsidiaries to) execute and deliver such further instruments and
take such other action as may be necessary or reasonably requested by another
party to make effective the Transactions. Without limiting the foregoing,
upon reasonable request of Buyer, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further assurances,
deeds, assignments, consequences, powers of attorney and other instruments and
papers as may be required to sell, transfer, assign, convey and deliver to
Buyer all right, title and interest in and to the MHPS Shares and the Acquired
Assets.

 

Section 5.09

 

 _Confidentiality_. For a period of three years following the Closing, Seller
and each of its Subsidiaries shall treat as confidential and shall safeguard
any and all confidential or proprietary information, knowledge and data about
the Business by using the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable
standard of care, to prevent the unauthorized use, dissemination or disclosure
of such information, knowledge and data as Seller or its Subsidiaries used
with respect thereto prior to the execution of this Agreement; provided that
nothing in this _Section 5.09_ shall limit the disclosure by Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries of any information (a) to the extent required by Law or
judicial process, (b) in connection with any litigation to which Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party, (c) in an Action brought by Seller in pursuit
of its rights or in the exercise of its remedies under this Agreement, and (d)
to the extent that such information is publicly available through no action
omission of Seller or its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 5.10

 

 _Non-Competition_. 

 

(a)

 

Except (i) as contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, (ii) the direct or
indirect ownership of less than 10% of the outstanding voting Equity Interests
of any Person which is listed on a recognized stock exchange and which
Participates in a Competing Business, (iii) hereinafter acquiring (including

such acquired Persons consolidated revenues at the time of such acquisition,
(iv) the sale (including by way of merger or other business combination) of
any Restricted Party to any Person (that is not an Affiliate of Seller) that

of its Subsidiaries) other than through a Restricted Party (before giving
effect to such transaction), for a period of two (2) years following the
Closing (the "Restricted Period"), Seller shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to (Seller and its Affiliates, the "Restricted Parties"),
directly or indirectly, engage in, own, manage, operate, join, control, lend
money or other assistance to, or participate in or be connected with, as an
officer, director, employee, partner, shareholder, consultant, manager, agent
or otherwise (collectively, "Participation"), any individual, corporation,
partnership, firm, other company, business organization, activity, entity or
Person that provides and/or markets any of the same or similar products or
services as Buyer (together with its Subsidiaries) provides and/or markets as
of and giving effect to the Closing (a "Competing Business"). The geographic
scope for the restriction set forth in this _Section 5.10(a)_ shall be
worldwide, which is the geographic scope of the businesses of Buyer.

 

(b)

 

Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that the restrictive period of time,
geographic scope and scope of restricted activity specified herein are
reasonable and necessary in view of the Transactions and the nature of the
businesses in which Buyer is engaged. Seller acknowledges and agrees that
Buyer would not have entered into this Agreement but for Sellers agreements
and obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.10_. If the scope of any stated
restriction is too broad to permit enforcement of such restriction(s) to its
full extent, then Seller agrees that such restriction shall be enforced and/or
modified to the maximum extent permitted by Law. Seller agrees that in the
event of a breach of this _Section 5.10_ , the Restricted Period (for purposes
of this _Section 5.10_ and only with respect to the breaching party) shall be
extended with respect to the breaching party by the period of the breach.

 

Section 5.11

supplier, licensee, licensor, franchisee, employee, consultant or other Person
who is a business relation of the other Party or any of its Subsidiaries as of
and giving effect to the Closing to (i) cease doing business with the other
Party or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) to engage in business with any

other Party through a general advertisement not targeted at such Restricted
Personnel, (ii) hiring or retaining any Restricted Personnel that respond to
any such general advertisement, or (iii) soliciting, hiring or retaining any
Person that has not served as a director, officer, employee, consultant,
contract, agent or as other personnel of the other Party for at least six (6)
months prior to such solicitation or employment.

 

(d)

 

Each Party hereby acknowledges and agrees that the restrictive period of time,
geographic scope and scope of restricted activity specified herein are
reasonable and necessary in view of the Transactions and the nature of the
business in which each Party is engaged. Each Party acknowledges and agrees
that the other would not have entered into this Agreement but for such Partys
agreements and obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.11_. If the scope of
any stated restriction is too broad to permit enforcement of such
restriction(s) to its full extent, then the Parties agree that such
restriction shall be enforced and/or modified to the maximum extent permitted
by law. The Parties agree that, in the event of a breach of this _Section
5.11_ , the Restricted Period (for purposes of this _Section 5.11_ and only
with respect to the breaching party) shall be extended with respect to the
breaching party by the period of the breach.

used in the Business as of the date hereof or the Closing that is not owned by
a Group Company or (y) to the extent primarily used in the business of Seller
and its Affiliates other than the Business as of the date hereof or the
Closing (a "Wrong Pocket Asset") is not held by, or a liability (a "Wrong
Pocket Liability") was not assumed by, the appropriate person (the "Right
Pocket", and the person holding such Wrong Pocket Asset or Wrong Pocket
Liability, the "Wrong Pocket"), except as a result of a transaction occurring
after the Closing consented to by the Right Pocket or as contemplated by this
Agreement:

interest in a Wrong Pocket Asset to transfer as promptly as reasonably
practicable such Wrong Pocket Asset to the Right Pocket for no additional
consideration;

in and to the Wrong Pocket Asset in trust for the Right Pocket until such time
as the transfer is completed; and

 

(iii)

 

The Parties shall cause the Right Pocket to assume from the Wrong Pocket as
promptly as reasonably practicable any Wrong Pocket Liability for no
additional consideration.

 

(b)

 

All costs and expenses arising out of compliance with such transfers shall be
allocated to the parties as though such transfers had been completed as of the
Closing in accordance with this Agreement.

 

(c)

 

The Parties shall cause the Right Pocket to cooperate with the Wrong Pocket in
connection with the transfers contemplated by this _Section 5.12_.

 

(d)

reasonable notice, and except as may otherwise be required by applicable Law,
Seller shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford the Buyers
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the
period prior to the Effective Time, to its properties, books, contracts and
records and, during such period, Seller shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Buyers Representatives all information
concerning the Business and its properties and personnel as may reasonably be
requested by Buyer; _provided_ that no investigation pursuant to this _Section

made by Seller; _provided_ , _further_ , that (i) Buyer shall reimburse Seller
for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with any such
request; (ii) any such access rights shall be exercised in such manner as not
to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of Seller and its
Subsidiaries; and (iii) the foregoing shall not require Seller (1) to permit
any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable
judgment of Seller, would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of
third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality or (2) to disclose any privileged information of Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries _provided_ that, in either such case, Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to provide for an arrangement that permits the
exchange of such information, such as a joint defense or similar arrangement.
All requests for information made pursuant to this _Section 5.13(a)_ shall be
directed to an executive officer of Seller or such Person as may be designated
by Sellers executive officers, with a copy to the General Counsel of Seller.
All such information shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 

(b)

 

Subject to applicable Law relating to the sharing of information, as the
Seller may reasonably require in connection with any audit, investigation,
dispute or litigation or any other reasonable business purpose, upon
reasonable notice, and except as may otherwise be required by applicable Law,
Buyer shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford the Sellers
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours for a period
of seven (7) years after the Closing Date, to (including the right to make, at
Sellers expense, photocopies of) the properties, books, contracts and records

reasonable confidentiality obligations, _provided_ that (i) Seller shall
reimburse the Buyer for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in
connection with any such request; (ii) any such access rights shall be
exercised in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of
the business of Buyer and its Subsidiaries; and (iii) the foregoing shall not
require Buyer (1) to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information,
that in the reasonable judgment of Buyer, would result in the disclosure of
any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with
respect to confidentiality or (2) to disclose any privileged information of
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, _provided_ that, in either such case, Buyer
shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide for an arrangement that
permits the exchange of such information, such as a joint defense or similar
arrangement. Buyer and its Affiliates shall not destroy or dispose of any of
the books and records of the Business existing as of the Closing Date for a
period of seven (7) years after the Closing Date or such longer time as may be
required by applicable Law and thereafter, if it desires to destroy or dispose
of such books and records, to offer first in writing to surrender them to
Seller.

 

Section 5.14

 

 _Pre-Closing Reorganization_.

 

(a)

 

Within ninety (90) days following the date of this Agreement, Seller shall
prepare, in good faith and in consultation with Buyer (including by
incorporating any suggestions from Buyer that would not adversely affect
Seller or any of its Affiliates), and deliver to Buyer a draft plan
describing, in reasonable detail, the reorganization steps it plans to
undertake to implement the Pre-Closing Reorganization, including, if
necessary, by adding or removing entities from _Section 1.01 of the Seller
Disclosure Letter_ and _Schedule 1_ (the "Pre-Closing Reorganization Plan").
Buyer shall then have forty-five (45) days to review such draft Pre-Closing
Reorganization Plan, during which time Buyer may review and comment on the
draft Pre-Closing Reorganization Plan. Seller shall consider in good faith
Buyers comments and must incorporate into the Pre-Closing Reorganization Plan
any reasonable requests of Buyer (i) that would avoid any adverse Tax
consequences to Buyer and would not adversely affect Seller or any of its
Affiliates, and (ii) in all other cases, only if Buyer agrees to indemnify
Seller for, and pays Seller at Closing or at termination of this Agreement, an
amount equal to the aggregate amount of the documented Losses (including Taxes
and the use of Tax attributes), on a grossed-up basis, that result to Seller
and its Affiliates from accommodating such request. Within thirty (30) days
following the end of such review period, Seller shall provide to Buyer a copy
of the final Pre-Closing Reorganization Plan. Seller shall cause the Pre-
Closing Reorganization to be completed in accordance with the final Pre-
Closing Reorganization Plan by no later than the fifth (5th) Business Day
prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Seller identifies
external requirements or considerations necessitating or making desirable an
expedited review and implementation of any of the steps contemplated by
Sellers working draft of the Pre-Closing Reorganization Plan, Seller may
implement such steps as soon as reasonably necessary or desirable, provided
that Seller has (i) described such external requirements or considerations to
Buyer, (ii) given Buyer a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
portion of the Pre-Closing Reorganization Plan that relates to such steps,
(iii) consulted with Buyer in good faith regarding such steps, and (iv)
incorporated into the portion of the Pre-Closing Reorganization Plan that
relates to such steps any suggestions from Buyer that would not adversely
affect Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 


  

 

36

  

 



 



 

(b)

 

At or prior to the Closing, Seller shall (i) form a new entity in the Swiss
Confederation ("DeMag JV") by filing formation documents in form reasonably
agreed upon by Buyer and Seller, (ii) enter into with Buyer an operating
agreement with respect to DeMag JV in a form reasonably agreed upon by Buyer
and Seller in accordance with the principles set forth in _Section 5.14(b) of
the Buyer Disclosure Letter_ and (iii) contribute, or cause to be contributed,
to DeMag JV the Demag Trademarks pursuant to a contribution agreement with
DeMag JV in form reasonably agreed upon by Buyer and Seller (it being agreed
and acknowledged that such agreement will not contain any representations,
warranties or indemnities by any party thereto). Buyer and Seller shall cause
DeMag JV at Closing to (i) grant to Buyer a license for the use of the Demag
Trademarks, pursuant to a license agreement incorporating the terms set forth
in _Section 5.14(b) of the Buyer Disclosure Letter_ (the "Kappa Demag License
Agreement") and (ii) grant to Seller a license for the use of the Demag
Trademarks, pursuant to a license agreement incorporating the terms set forth
in _Section 5.14(b) of the Buyer Disclosure Letter_ (the "Theta Demag License
Agreement") (the transactions described in this _Section 5.14(b)_ ,
collectively, the "DeMag JV Arrangements"). For purposes of this Agreement,
"Demag Trademarks" means all rights throughout the world in the name,
trademark and service mark "Demag" and any variation thereof (including any
foreign equivalent, translation or transliteration thereof) or name or mark
containing "Demag" (including all applications and registrations therefor,
associated logos, stylizations and trade dress, all Internet domain names and
all goodwill therein) owned by Seller and its Affiliates.

 

(c)

 

Subject to _Section 5.14(a)_ in all respects, Seller shall incorporate into
the Pre-Closing Reorganization Plan any reasonable requests of Buyer regarding
transferring the Transferred Intellectual Property to a designated Subsidiary
of Buyer at Closing.

 

Section 5.15

 

 _Transition Assistance_. __

 

(a)

 

Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to assist in the transition of the Business, records, customers and
operations (including IT) at Closing to Buyer as reasonably requested by Buyer
between the date hereof and the Closing in furtherance of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (such assistance, the
"Transition Assistance"). Prior to Closing, Buyer and Seller shall each bear
their own expenses incurred in respect of such Transition Assistance;
_provided_ that Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller for the costs of third
party consultants, contractors and advisors in connection with the Transition
Assistance provided during such period.

 

(b)

 

From and after Closing, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
assist the Buyer in connection with the Buyers preparation and audit of any
financial statements of the Business or the Buyer that the Buyer determines,
in its reasonable discretion, are required or advisable under applicable laws
(including applicable securities laws and regulations) in connection with the
Buyers acquisition of the Business (the "Financial Statement Assistance"). As
part of the Financial Statement Assistance (and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing), the Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to (a) cause its accountants to be available to the Buyer (upon
reasonable prior notice and at mutually agreeable times and at no cost to the
Buyer) to respond to questions and information requests, and participate in
interview sessions, to the extent reasonably necessary in connection with the
Buyers preparation and audit of any such financial statements and (b) cause
its manager, officers and other agents to execute and deliver any and all
management representation letters and other certificates as may reasonably be
requested by the Buyer or its accountants in connection with the preparation
and/or audit of any such financial statements. Buyer will pay or, if paid,
promptly reimburse the Seller, following invoice from the Seller, for any
reasonable out-of-pocket and overhead costs incurred by such Seller in
complying with the provisions of this _Section 5.14(b)_.

 

(c)

 

As soon as reasonably practicable and regularly from time to time during the
ninety (90) day period following the date hereof, Buyer and Seller shall
confer and negotiate in good faith to reach agreement on a definitive form of
the Services Schedule (as defined in the Transition Services Agreement), which
shall provide additional detail in the description of the Services (as defined
in the Transition Services Agreement) and the calculation of the fees relating
thereto, in accordance with the Transition Services Agreement attached to
_Exhibit E_ to this Agreement; _provided_ , however, that any in the event
Seller is required to pay any licensing fees in connection with Seller
providing any IT related services to Buyer under the Transition Services
Agreement, Buyer agrees that Buyer shall be responsible for reimbursing Seller
for all such amounts. The definitive Transition Services Agreement entered
into at the Closing shall incorporate the Services Schedule as mutually agreed
by Buyer and Seller in accordance with this _Section 5.15(c)_.

 

Section 5.16

 

 _Customer Communications_. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in developing
communications materials and notices primarily relating to the Transaction to
be sent to customers of the Business on or after the date hereof and prior to
the Closing. Neither Party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to,
send any communications or notices relating to the Transaction to customers of
the Business on or after the date hereof and prior to the Closing without the
prior written approval of the other Party, not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

 


  

 

37

  

 



 



 

Section 5.17

 

 _Resignations_. Unless otherwise requested by Buyer, Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause each director of each Transferred Company or
any officer or director of any Group Company to resign in such capacity other
than individuals who will continue to act as full time employees of the Group
Companies after the Closing and directors representing works councils or labor
unions, such resignations to be effective as of the Closing.

 

Section 5.18

 

 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a)

 

Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall (i) make offers of employment on an at-will
basis to each Business Employee employed in the United States who is not a
Group Company Employee (including those on short term disability or who are
not actively at work but have a right to return to employment with the Company
or one of its Affiliates), with such offers to be effective as of the Closing
(or upon the employee\'s return to work if he is not actively at work at the
time of the Closing), (ii) continue to employ (where employment continues
automatically by operation of Law or where employer substitution or similar
transfer method is possible under applicable Law) each Business Employee
employed outside of the United States who is not a Group Company Employee
(including those on short term disability or who are not actively at work but
have a right to return to employment with the Company or one of its
Affiliates), effective as of the Closing Date (or upon the employee\'s return
to work if he is not actively at work at the time of the Closing), (iii) make
offers of employment to (where employment does not continue automatically by
operation of law or where employer substitution or similar transfer method is
not possible under applicable Law) each Business Employee employed outside of
the United States who is not a Group Company Employee (including those on
short term disability or who are not actively at work but have a right to
return to employment with the Company or one of its Affiliates), with such
offers to be effective as of the Closing (or upon the employee\'s return to
work if he is not actively at work at the time of the Closing) (each offer
described in (i) and (iii), an "Employment Offer"); provided, however, that
Buyer shall in no event be obligated to make an Employment Offer to any
Business Employee who is on long-term disability leave as of immediately prior
to the Closing if they do not have a right to return to employment with the
Company or one of its Affiliates. Each Employment Offer shall be (i) at a
compensation level (other than equity compensation) and with employee benefits
that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the compensation
(other than equity compensation) and employee benefits as were paid or
provided to such Business Employee immediately prior to Closing, and (ii) made
in accordance with applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall not
be required to assume any equity compensation plan (including any long-term
incentive plan) in which any Business Employee participates.

 

(b)

 

Each Business Employee who accepts Buyers offer of employment shall, as of
the Closing Date or, with respect to any Business Employee on a leave of
absence or otherwise has a right to return to employment, as of the date such
Business Employee commences active employment with Buyer and each Business
Employee who continues in employment by operation of law in accordance with
_Section 5.18(a)(ii)_ shall become an employee of Buyer (each such Business
Employee and each Group Company Employee, a "Continuing Employee").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) be treated
as an amendment of any particular compensation and benefit plan provided by
Buyer, its Subsidiaries or the Group Companies, (ii) give any third party any
right to enforce the provisions of this _Section 5.18_ , or (iii) obligate
Buyer or any Group Company to (A) maintain any particular compensation and
benefit plan provided by Buyer, its Subsidiaries or the Group Companies or (B)
retain the employment of any particular employee.

 

(c)

 

With respect to any "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA, maintained by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Group
Companies, in which any Continuing Employee becomes a participant, Buyer shall
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its third party insurers to
provide that the Continuing Employees shall receive full credit for service
with Seller or any of its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and determination of benefits under severance and
vacation pay plans, to the same extent that such service was recognized as of
the Closing under a comparable Seller Plan in which the Continuing Employee
participated (but not for purposes of benefit accrual to the extent such
credit would result in a duplication of benefits). Buyer shall (and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its third party insurers to) (i) waive,
or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions,
actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit
plan maintained by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries in which the Continuing
Employees (and their eligible dependents) are eligible to participate from and
after the Closing to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods were satisfied
or waived under the comparable Seller Plan in which the Continuing Employees
participated and (ii) cause any health benefit plan of Buyer or its
Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employees participate after the Closing
to recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar
expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) during the calendar year in which the Closing occurs for purposes
of satisfying deductible and co-payment limitations for such year under the
relevant welfare benefit plans in which such Continuing Employee (and
dependents) participates following the Closing.

 


  

 

38

  

 



 



 

(d)

 

Effective as of the Closing, the Continuing Employees shall cease active
participation in the Employee Plans (the "Retained Welfare Plans") providing
welfare benefits that are maintained by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other
than MHPS Employee Plans). With respect to any Retained Welfare Plans, Seller
shall remain liable for all eligible claims for benefits under the plan that
are incurred by the Continuing Employees prior to the Closing. For purposes of
this _Section 5.18(d)_ , a claim is deemed to have been incurred (i) with
respect to claims for life, accidental death and dismemberment and short-term
disability benefits, on the occurrence of event giving rise to such benefits,
(ii) with respect to long-term disability benefits, on the date on which the
relevant individual satisfied the eligibility requirements for the
commencement of the long-term disability benefits (regardless of whether the
claim was approved before or after the Closing) and (iii) on the date on which
the charge or expense giving rise to such claim is incurred (without regard to
the date of inception of the related illness or injury or the date of the
submission of the claim related thereto) in the case of all other claims.
Buyer shall be liable for all claims incurred by Continuing Employees on or
after the Closing.

 

(e)

 

Prior to making any written or material oral communications to the Business
Employees pertaining to the effect of the Transaction on compensation or
benefit matters, the Seller shall, and shall cause the Group Companies to,
provide Buyer with a copy of the intended communication, Buyer shall have a
reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication and Buyer
and the Seller shall cooperate in providing any such mutually agreeable
communication.

 

(f)

 

Seller shall, effective as of the Closing Date, cease all contributions in
respect of each Continuing Employee in Sellers defined contribution plans in
which such individual is then participating. Such defined contribution plans
that are individual account plans are set forth on Schedule 4.02(m)(i)
("Sellers Savings Programs"). As of the Closing Date, Buyer or one of its
Subsidiaries shall have in effect one or more defined contribution plans that
includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of
Section 401(k) of the Code ("Buyers 401(k) Plan"). As soon as practicable
following the Closing Date, to the extent elected by a Continuing Employee and
permitted by Buyers 401(k) Plan, Seller agrees to cause the Sellers Savings
Programs to transfer to Buyers 401(k) Plan, and Buyer agrees to cause Buyers
401(k) Plan to accept eligible rollover distributions within the meaning of
Section 402(c)(4) of the Code of Continuing Employees account balances
(including the in-kind rollover of notes evidencing outstanding Plan loans)
under Sellers Savings Programs as of the valuation date next preceding the
date of transfer; provided, that if Buyers 401(k) Plan does not permit such
transfer, Buyer agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
Buyers 401(k) Plan to accept such eligible rollover distributions. Buyer and
Seller shall cooperate to take any and all commercially reasonable actions
needed to permit each Continuing Employee with an outstanding loan balance
under the Seller\'s Savings Programs as of the Closing Date to continue to
make scheduled loan payments to the Seller\'s Savings Programs after the
Closing Date, pending the distribution and in-kind rollover of the note
evidencing such loan from the Seller Savings Programs to the Buyer\'s 401(k)
Plan, so as to prevent, to the extent reasonably possible, a deemed
distribution or loan offset with respect to such outstanding loan.

 

(g)

 

Buyer shall assume the liability arising under COBRA with respect to Business
Employees who become MandA Qualified Beneficiaries (as that term is defined in
26 C.F.R. Section 54.4980B-9 Q and A 4).

 

(h)

 

Buyers workers compensation program shall be responsible for all claims for
benefits which are incurred on or after the Closing Date by participating
Continuing Employees. Sellers workers compensation program shall be
responsible for all claims for benefits which are incurred prior to the
Closing Date by participating Continuing Employees.

 

(i)

 

As legally or contractually required, Seller and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, shall provide notice to, enter into any consultation procedure
with, and shall use reasonable efforts to have obtained required consent or
opinion from any labor union, labor organization, works council or group of
employees of Seller and its Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions,
and Seller shall, upon request of Buyer, promptly inform Buyer about the
status regarding any such consultations, consents or opinions, including
discussions with employee representatives.

 

Section 5.19

 

 _Additional Covenants of Buyer_. From the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, unless Seller shall otherwise consent in writing (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) or as
expressly set forth in _Section 5.19_ of the Buyer Disclosure Letter or as
otherwise expressly provided for or contemplated by this Agreement or as may
be required by applicable Law, Buyer shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, conduct its business in all material respects in the ordinary
course and in a manner consistent with past practice, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact its business organization
and goodwill and relationships with all Governmental Entities, customers,
employees, suppliers and others having business dealings with it, and maintain
its current rights and franchises, in each case, consistent with past
practice. In addition to and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, except as expressly set forth in _Section 5.19_ of the Buyer
Disclosure Letter or as otherwise expressly provided for or contemplated by
this Agreement or as required by applicable Law, from the date hereof until
the Effective Time, without the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Buyer shall not,

most recent annual per share dividend (but subject to any increase in the
ordinary course of business in an amount required by applicable Law) and with
the timing of such dividend to be consistent with past practice, or (ii)
split, combine or reclassify, or issue, deliver, sell, grant, dispose of or
subject to a Lien any Buyer Ordinary Shares or Equity Interests of Buyer or

aggregate, net revenues not to exceed €45 million in 2015, or (iii) any

employees for advancement of travel and related business expenses in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice or (ii) create,
incur, guarantee or assume any indebtedness, issuances of debt securities,

course of business consistent with past practice and approved by the Buyer
Board or (ii) in connection with the repair or replacement of the plant and

set forth in _Section 6.01(b)_ or _Section 6.01(c)_ ; or

 

(i)

 

authorize, resolve, agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

 

Section 5.20

 

 _Buyer Ordinary Shares_. During the period from the date hereof to the
Closing, Seller shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, alone or in concert with any other Person acquire,
offer to acquire or agree to acquire Beneficial Ownership of any shares of

Section 5.23

 

 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a)

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _ARTICLE VIII_ , all transfer,
sales, gross receipts, real estate, use, stamp, registration and other similar
Taxes or fees resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including any transactions described in _Section 5.14(b)_ ), plus any
reasonable out-of-pocket costs associated with the preparing and filing of
related Tax Returns (collectively, the "Transfer Taxes") shall be borne
equally by Buyer and Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Transfer Taxes
incurred in effecting the Pre-Closing Reorganization (excluding, for this
purpose, any transactions described in Section 5.14(b)) shall be borne by
Seller, other than any Transfer Taxes incurred in effecting any transactions
for which Buyer has agreed to indemnify Seller pursuant to _Section 5.14(a)_ ,
which shall be borne by Buyer. The person required to do so by applicable Law
shall prepare and timely file (or cause to be prepared and timely filed) any
Tax Return required to be filed in respect of any Transfer Tax, and shall
timely pay (or cause to be timely paid) to the applicable Tax Authorities such
Transfer Tax (subject to prompt reimbursement for half of such Transfer Tax
from the other Party).

 

(b)

 

If, and only if, requested by Buyer, Buyer and Seller shall jointly make an
election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any comparable provisions
of state or local Tax Law) with respect to the purchase from a U.S.
corporation of any Transferred Company that is a U.S. corporation on Form 8023
(or any successor form), with all attachments. In the event that such
election is made pursuant to this _Section 5.23(b)_ , (A) Buyer and Seller
shall cooperate with each other to take all actions necessary and appropriate
(including filing such additional forms, returns, elections, schedules and
other documents as may be required) to effect and preserve each timely
election in accordance with the provisions of section 1.338(h)(10)-1 of the
Treasury Regulations (or any comparable provisions of state or local Tax Law)
or any successor provision, (B) Buyer, with the assistance and cooperation of
Seller, shall prepare Form 8883 and all requisite attachments thereto (and all
forms under analogous provisions of state or local Tax Law) in accordance with
Tax Laws, (C) Buyer shall deliver such forms and attachments to Seller at
least sixty (60) days prior to the due date for filing such election and
Seller shall execute and return such completed forms and attachments to Buyer
at least 45 days prior to the due date for filing such election and (D) Buyer
shall indemnify Seller, on a grossed-up basis, for any incremental costs
(including the use of Tax attributes) resulting to Seller and its Affiliates
from each such election.

 

(c)

 

Except as permitted under _Section 5.23(b)_ , Buyer may not make or cause to
be made any election under Section 338 of the Code with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereunder.

 

(d)

 

Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns for the Group
Companies for any taxable year or period that ends on or before the Closing
Date (each such period, a "Pre-Closing Period" and such Tax Returns, the "Pre-
Closing Tax Returns"). Seller shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts
to submit each Pre-Closing Tax Return to Buyer for review and comment at least
fifteen (15) days prior to its due date and (ii) revise such Pre-Closing Tax
Return to reflect any timely comments requested by Buyer in good faith,
provided such comments are consistent with past practice and applicable Law
and do not adversely affect Seller. Buyer shall timely file, or cause to be
timely field, each Pre-Closing Tax Return as prepared by Seller in accordance
with this _Section 5.23(d)_ and shall remit, or cause to be timely remitted,
any Taxes due in respect of such Pre-Closing Tax Return to the relevant Taxing
Authority. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to
be filed all Tax Returns for the Group Companies for any taxable year or
period beginning on or before, and ending after, the Closing Date (each such
period, a "Straddle Period" and such Tax Returns, the "Straddle Tax Returns").
Buyer shall (A) use commercially reasonable efforts to submit each Straddle
Tax Return to Seller for review and comment at least fifteen (15) days prior
to its due date and (B) revise such Straddle Tax Return to reflect any timely
comments requested by Seller in good faith, provided such comments (i) are
consistent with past practice and applicable Law, and (ii) do not adversely
affect Buyer or the Group Companies (or any Affiliates thereof) in any taxable
year or period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date. Seller
shall pay Buyer in immediately available funds, at least five (5) days before
the due date of any Pre-Closing Tax Return or Straddle Tax Return, an amount
equal to any Taxes for which Seller is obligated to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnified Parties under _Section 8.02_. Buyer shall pay Seller in
immediately available funds, at least five (5) days before the due date of any
Straddle Tax Return, the amount (if any) by which (A) the sum of any Tax
payments (including estimated tax payments) made prior to the Closing with
respect to the relevant Straddle Period and any Liabilities included in the
Net Working Capital with respect to such Straddle Period exceeds (B) the
amount of Taxes allocated to the Pre-Closing Portion of such Straddle Period
under _Section 5.23(g)_.

 


  

 

41

  

 



 



 

(e)

 

The parties hereto shall, to the extent permitted under applicable Tax Law,
elect to treat the Closing Date as the last day of any taxable period of the
Group Companies that includes the Closing Date; _provided_ that no party shall
be required to amend any articles of association, change any financial
accounting period, or otherwise take any action other than solely for Tax
purposes.

 

(f)

 

The portion of any Taxes that are allocable to the Pre-Closing Portion of any
Straddle Period shall be (x) in the case of real property, personal property
and other similar Taxes deemed to be the amount of such Taxes due with respect
to the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of calendar days in the Pre-Closing Portion of the Straddle
Period and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the
entire Straddle Period and (y) in all other cases, determined on the basis of
an interim closing of the books as of the Closing. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Pre-Closing Portion" means, with respect to any Straddle Period,
the portion of such Straddle Period that begins on the first day of such
Straddle Period and ends on, and includes, the Closing Date.

 

(g)

 

After the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall, upon request, (i) reasonably assist
(and cause their respective Affiliates to reasonably assist) the other party
in preparing and filing any Tax Returns that such other party is responsible
for preparing, (ii) reasonably cooperate in preparing for any audits of, or
disputes or other proceedings with, any Taxing Authority or with respect to
any matters with respect to Taxes of or relating to the Group Companies and
(iii) make available to the other party and to any Taxing Authority as
reasonably requested in writing all information, records, and documents
relating to Tax matters of or relating to the Group Companies. In addition,
Seller and Buyer shall make themselves (and their respective employees)
reasonably available, on a mutually convenient basis during normal working
hours, to provide explanations of any documents or information provided under
this _Section 5.23(g)_. Each party shall keep any information obtained under
this _Section 5.23(g)_ confidential except (x) as may be necessary in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns or the conduct of any Tax audit,
dispute, contest or other similar proceeding or (y) with the consent of the
other party.

 

(h)

 

Seller and Buyer shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers and
all material records or other documents or electronic data in their possession
(or in the possession of their respective Affiliates) relating to Tax matters
relevant to the Business for Pre-Closing Periods and Straddle Periods until
the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable
periods to which such Tax Returns and other documents relate, taking into
account all extensions thereof, or (ii) six (6) years following the due date
for such Tax Returns. Before Seller or Buyer disposes of any such documents
in its possession (or in the possession of its respective Affiliates), the
other party shall be given the opportunity, for thirty (30) days upon written
notice, to remove and retain all or any part of such documents as such other
party may select (at such other party\'s sole expense).

 

(i)

 

After the Closing Date, Buyer shall notify Seller promptly without any undue
delay of the commencement of any notice of Tax deficiency, proposed Tax
adjustment, Tax assessment, Tax audit, Tax examination or other administrative
or court proceeding, suit, dispute or other claim with respect to Taxes that,
if resolved adversely to the taxpayer, would be grounds for a claim for
indemnity pursuant to _Section 8.02_ hereof (a "Tax Claim"); provided _,_
however, that a failure by Buyer to provide timely notice of a Tax Claim shall
not entitle Seller to reduce the amount of the liability required to be paid
pursuant to _Section 8.02_ , except to the extent such delay actually
prejudices Seller. Buyer shall deliver to Seller copies of all relevant
notices and documents (including court papers) received by Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer that relate to such Tax Claim. In the case of any Tax
Claim relating solely to any Pre-Closing Period, Seller (at its sole cost and
expense) shall have the right to control the conduct of such Tax Claim and
shall have the right to settle such Tax Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , (i)
that Buyer may fully participate in the conduct of such Tax Claim (at its own
expense), (ii) Seller shall not settle, compromise or dispose of any Tax Claim
in a manner that would adversely affect Buyer or the Group Companies (or any
Affiliates thereof) after the Closing Date without Buyers prior written
consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
and (iii) Seller shall keep Buyer fully and timely informed with respect to
the status of such Tax Claim. In the case of any Tax Claim that Seller does
not control, Seller may fully participate, at its own expense, in such Tax
Claim, and Buyer (i) shall not settle such Tax Claim without the consent of
Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed and (ii) shall keep Seller reasonably informed with respect to the
status of such Tax Claim.

 

(j)

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall have
no obligation to provide to any Person any right to access or review any
consolidated Tax Return or work papers relating to the affiliated group of
which Seller is the common parent, and neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
shall have any rights to participate in or influence the conduct of any Tax
Claim involving such affiliated group.

 

(k)

 

Buyer shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to amend, refile or
otherwise modify any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to any Pre-
Closing Period of any Group Company without Sellers prior written consent,
which may be withheld in Sellers sole discretion.

 


  

 

42

  

 



 



 

(l)

 

Buyer shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to carry back to any Pre-
Closing Period any operating losses, net operating losses, capital losses,
income tax credits or similar income tax items arising in, resulting from, or
generated in connection with a taxable period beginning after the Closing
Date.

 

(m)

 

On the last day of each financial quarter, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid
to Seller any Tax refunds and credits (including any interest included therein
and less any reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in obtaining such refund
or credit) that were both (i) claimed or requested by Buyer or an Affiliate
thereof, or with respect to which Seller delivered a written request as
contemplated by the last sentence of this _Section 5.23(m)_ , within the six
(6) year period following the Closing, and (ii) received or applied by Buyer
or an Affiliate thereof during such quarter in respect of or relating to any
taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date of
any Group Company or with respect to any Acquired Asset, except to the extent
such refund or credit was specifically reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet.
Subject to _Section 5.23(l)_ , Buyer shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to)
use commercially reasonable efforts to claim or request any Tax refunds or
credits to the extent requested in writing by Seller within the six (6) year
period following the Closing.

 

(n)

 

Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and shall deliver to Buyer no
later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, a schedule of the accrued
non-current Tax liabilities attributable to the Business as of the Effective
Time (the "Closing Non-Current Tax Accrual Schedule"). The Closing Non-
Current Tax Accrual Schedule (i) shall be prepared in accordance with U.S.
GAAP using the accounting methods, policies, practices, procedures, judgments
and estimation methodology used by Seller and the Business, as applicable, in
the normal year-end closing process of the Business as reflected in Sellers
historical Hyperion accounts and applied consistent with past practice, (ii)
shall otherwise be prepared in the same manner as the corresponding line items
in the Financial Information, and (iii) shall exclude any liabilities incurred
outside the ordinary course of business after the Reference Date. The
Accountant shall resolve any disputes regarding the Closing Non-Current Tax
Accrual Schedule subject to the procedures described in _Section 2.07(b)_. 

 

Section 5.24

 

 _Financing_.

 

(a)

 

Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, advisable or
proper to obtain the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter on or
prior to the Closing Date on the terms and conditions described in the
Commitment Letter, including using reasonable best efforts to: (i) maintain in
effect and enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter and comply with its
obligations thereunder; _provided,_ that the Commitment Letter may be amended,
supplemented, modified and replaced as permitted by clause (b) of this
_Section 5.24_ ; (ii) satisfy or obtain the waiver of on a timely basis (and
in a manner that will not prevent, impair or delay the consummation of the
Transactions) all conditions and covenants applicable to Buyer to the funding
of the financing (including the Financing Conditions) set forth in the
Commitment Letter and any definitive agreements to be executed in connection
therewith and (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with
respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Commitment
Letter (including, if necessary, any "flex" provisions). Buyer shall keep
Seller informed on a regular basis and in reasonable detail of the status of
its efforts to arrange the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter and
any other financing, shall provide Seller copies of documents related to such
financing upon request and shall give Seller prompt notice of any fact,
change, event or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse impact with respect to
the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter including notice in
writing of any breach or default by Buyer or to its knowledge any other party
with respect to the Commitment Letter or any condition precedent to funding on
the Closing or any material dispute between the parties to the Commitment
Letter related to the Commitment Letter of which the Buyer becomes aware. In
no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
(including the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter) by or to Buyer
or any of their respective Affiliates or any other financing transaction be a
condition to any of the obligations of Buyer hereunder.

 

(b)

 

Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall not agree to or permit any termination,
amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of, or waive any of
its rights under, the Commitment Letter without Sellerss prior written
consent.

 

(c)

 

In the event that all or a portion of the financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letter becomes unavailable on the terms contemplated in the
Commitment Letter, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) arrange
replacement financing, on terms that are not materially less favorable to
Buyer, in the aggregate, than the terms contained in the Commitment Letter,
from alternative sources as promptly as practicable in an amount sufficient,
together with any cash held by Buyer, to consummate the Transactions and (ii)
obtain new financing commitment and fee letters with respect to such
replacement financing which shall be promptly provided to the Seller. Upon
any amendment, replacement, supplement or modification permitted by _Section
5.24(b)_ or _Section 5.24(c)_ , the term "Commitment Letter" shall mean the
Commitment Letter as so amended, replaced, supplemented or modified.

Section 5.25

 

 _Financing Assistance_.

 

(a)

 

Prior to the Closing, Seller agrees to provide, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its Representatives to provide, all customary cooperation (including with
respect to timeliness) in connection with the arrangement of the financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter as may be reasonably requested by Buyer,
including (i) participating in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations,
road shows, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions and sessions with
prospective lenders, investors and ratings agencies that are customary for
financings of a type similar to the financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter; (ii) assisting in a commercially reasonable manner Buyer and the
Financing Sources in the preparation of any lender presentations, bank
information memoranda and similar documents reasonably requested by Buyer in
connection with the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter at times
and locations mutually agreed; (iii) reasonably cooperating with the marketing
efforts of Buyer and the Financing Sources for any of such financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter; (iv) assisting in the preparation of
documents relating to the Financing, including any customary credit
agreements, indentures and pledge and security documents and otherwise
reasonably facilitating the granting of a security interest (and perfection
thereof) in collateral, guarantees, other definitive financing documents or
other certificates, customary closing certificates and documents as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer and assisting in the negotiation of any such
agreements and other documents; provided, that any obligations contained in
all such agreements and documents shall be subject to the occurrence of the
Closing and effective no earlier than the Closing; and (v) using reasonable
best efforts to facilitate the obtaining of customary payoff letters, lien
terminations and instruments of discharge to be delivered at and subject to
the Closing providing for the payoff, discharge and termination on the Closing
Date of all Indebtedness of the Business contemplated by this Agreement to be
paid off, discharged and terminated on the Closing Date. Customary
cooperation shall not include taking any actions that would unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing business or operations of Seller and its
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (v) none of Seller or its
Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any fees or expenses or incur prior to
the Effective Time any other liability or obligation in connection with the
financings contemplated by the Commitment Letter, (w) none of Seller, its
Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors or employees shall be
required to execute or enter into or perform any agreement with respect to the
financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters that is not contingent upon
the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Effective Time (and for
the avoidance of doubt, the boards of directors or other equivalent governing
bodies of Buyer shall enter into or provide any resolutions, consents,
approvals or other closing arrangements on behalf of Seller and its
Subsidiaries as may be required by the lenders pursuant to the Commitment
Letter at, or as of, the Closing), (x) Seller shall not be required to make
any representation, warranties or certifications as to which, after Sellers
use of reasonable best efforts to cause such representation, warranty or
certification to be true, Seller has in its good faith determined that such
representation, warranty or certification is not true, (y) Seller shall not be
required to become subject to any obligations or liabilities with respect to
such agreements or documents prior to the Closing, and (z) nothing shall
obligate Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to provide, or cause to be
provided, any legal opinion by its counsel, or to provide any information or
take any action to the extent it would result in a violation of Law or loss of
any privilege. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries be in breach of this _Section 5.25(a)_ because of the failure
to deliver, after use of reasonable best efforts to do so, any information
that is not prepared in the ordinary course of the Sellers business and
operations at the time requested by Buyer. Seller and its Representatives
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any financing
documents and any materials that are to be presented during any meetings
conducted in connection with the financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter, and Buyer shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by Seller and its Representatives. 

 

(b)

 

Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its Subsidiaries and its and
their Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the
financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter and the performance of their
respective obligations under _Section 5.25(a)_ and any information utilized in
connection therewith. Whether or not the Closing occurs, Buyer shall,
promptly upon written request by Seller, reimburse Seller and its Subsidiaries
for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by
Seller or its Subsidiaries (including those of its accountants, consultants,
legal counsel, agents and other Representatives) in connection with the
cooperation required by _Section 5.25(a)_.

 

Section 5.26

 

 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_. The certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other comparable organizational documents of each of
the Group Companies shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification that are set forth in such documents immediately prior to the
Closing, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
for a period of six (6) years after the Closing in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at or prior to the
Closing were present or former managers, members, directors, officers,
employees or agents of the Group Companies (the "DandO Indemnified Parties")
related to service prior to the Closing. Buyer shall cause to be maintained
in effect for six (6) years after the Closing the current policies of the
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Group Companies
with respect to matters occurring prior to the Closing; provided that Buyer
may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing
terms and conditions that are not less favorable that the existing policies
(including with respect to the period covered). The rights of each DandO
Indemnified Parties hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation
of, any other rights such DandO Indemnified Party may have under the certificate
of incorporation, bylaws or other comparable organization documents of each of
the Group Companies, and any other indemnification arrangement, applicable
Laws or otherwise. The provisions of this _Section 5.26_ shall survive the
consummation of the Transactions and are expressly intended to benefit each
DandO Indemnified Party.

by Buyer, if Seller shall have breached any representation or warranty or
failed to comply with any covenant or agreement applicable to Seller that

(a)

 

In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01_ ,
this Agreement (other than _Section 1.01_ , _Section 5.25(b)_ , this _Section
7.03_ and _ARTICLE IX_ ) shall become void and of no effect with no liability
on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its directors, officers,
employees, agents, legal and financial advisors or other Representatives);
_provided_ , _however_ , that, except as otherwise provided herein, no such
termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages
resulting from any fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement.

 

(b)

 

In the event that this Agreement is terminated by either Seller or Buyer
pursuant to _Section 7.01(d)(iii)_ , then Buyer shall reimburse Seller for all
of its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement up to a maximum amount of $20,000,000, by wire transfer of
same day funds to an account designated by Seller, within two (2) Business
Days after such termination.

 

(c)

 

In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to _Section
7.01(b)(i)_ , then Seller shall pay Buyer a fee of $37,000,000, by wire
transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Buyer, within two (2)
Business Days after such termination.

 

(d)

 

Each of Buyer and Seller acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 7.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if Buyer fails to promptly pay or cause to
be paid the amount due pursuant to _Section 7.03(b)_ , and, in order to obtain
such payment, Seller commences a suit that results in a judgment against Buyer
for the payment set forth in _Section 7.03(b)_ or any portion of such payment,
Buyer shall pay to Seller its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees)
in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the
payment at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A., in effect on the date such
payment was required to be paid, from the date on which such payment was
required through the date of actual payment.

 

(e)

 

In the event that legal action is taken by any party (including any of the
Parties) against Buyer or the Buyer Board in relation to the legality of the
decision by Buyer or the Buyer Board to enter into or perform the agreements
between Buyer and Seller set forth in this _Section 7.03_ , and, despite the
party subject to the legal action having vigorously defended against such
legal action, it is concluded by a final non-appealable judgment or decision
of a court of competent jurisdiction that the decision by the Buyer Board to
enter into the agreements under this _Section 7.03_ is unlawful or
unenforceable, then Seller shall promptly remit to Buyer the portion of such
termination payment (to the extent already paid) that such court has
determined to be unlawful or unenforceable, net of any reasonable costs and
expenses of Seller.

 


  

 

47

  

 



 



 

(f)

 

At Sellers option, Seller shall be entitled to assume and control the defense
of any legal action referred to in _Section 7.03(e)_ subject to Seller
assuming all the costs relating to such defense. In the event that Seller
assumes such defense, Buyer shall fully cooperate with Seller\'s defense of
such legal action, including by providing to Seller all such information
regarding Buyer and the Buyer Board, and making available to Seller such
employees, officers and directors of Buyer, as Seller shall reasonably
request.

 

(g)

 

Notwithstanding, anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any payments made
pursuant to this _Section 7.03_ shall constitute liquidated damages, and from
and after the termination giving rise to such payment, neither Party shall
have any further liability of any kind for any reason in connection with this
Agreement or the termination contemplated hereby other than as provided under
this _Section 7.03_. In no event shall Seller be entitled to payment under
_Section 7.03(a)_ on more than one occasion.

Section 8.03

 

 _Notice and Resolution of Claims. Except with respect to Tax Claims:_

 

(a)

 

 _Notice_. Each Person entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section
8.02(a)_ or _Section 8.02(b)_ (an "Indemnified Party") shall give written
notice to the indemnifying party or parties from whom indemnity is sought (an
"Indemnifying Party") promptly after obtaining knowledge of any pending or
threatened claim, demand or circumstance that the Indemnified Party has
determined has given or would reasonably be expected to give rise to a right
of indemnification that such Person may have under _Section 8.02(a)_ or
_Section 8.02(b)_ , as applicable (including a pending or threatened claim or
demand asserted by a third party against the Indemnified Party, such claim
being a "Third Party Claim"). The notice shall set forth in reasonable detail
the claim, the basis for indemnification, and a good faith estimate of all
related Losses, to the extent practicable. Failure to give notice shall not
release the Indemnifying Party from its obligations under _Section 8.02(a)_ or
_Section 8.02(b)_ , as applicable, except to the extent that the failure
prejudices such Indemnifying Party, it being understood that notices for
claims in respect of a breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement must be delivered before the expiration of any applicable survival
period specified in _Section 8.01_ for claims with respect to such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

 

(b)

 

 _Defense of Third Party Claims_. If a Third Party Claim shall arise, the
Indemnifying Party may assume the defense of such Third Party Claim by
providing written notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days
after receipt of the notice of such claim. The Person that shall control the
defense of any such Third Party Claim (the "Controlling Party") shall select
counsel, contractors and consultants of recognized standing and competence
after consultation with the other Party and shall take all steps reasonably
necessary in the defense or settlement of such Third Party Claim, _provided_
that the Indemnified Party shall retain the right to employ its own counsel
and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim at its own expense
(which shall not be recoverable from the Indemnifying Party under this
_ARTICLE VIII_ unless (i) the Indemnified Party is advised by counsel that (x)
there may be one or more legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party
which are not available to the Indemnifying Party, or available to the
Indemnifying Party the assertion of which would be adverse to or in conflict
with the interests of the Indemnified Party, or (y) that representation of
both parties by the same counsel would be otherwise inappropriate under
applicable standards of professional conduct, (ii) the Indemnifying Party
shall not have employed counsel to represent the Indemnified Party within
thirty (30) Business Days after notice of the assertion of any such claim or
institution of any such Third Party Claim, (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall
authorize the Indemnified Party in writing to employ separate counsel at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party, or (iv) such Third Party Claim relates to
or arises in connection with any criminal action, in each of which cases the
reasonable expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party shall be reimbursed by
the Indemnifying Party). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 8.03(b)_ , (A) no Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to settle any
Third Party Claim for which indemnification is sought under _Section 8.02(a)_
or _Section 8.02(b)_ without the Indemnified Partys prior written consent,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless it
has assumed the defense of such Third Party Claim and as a part of the
settlement the Indemnified Party is released from all liability with respect
to the Third Party Claim and the settlement does not impose any financial or
equitable remedy on the Indemnified Party, does not cause any restriction or
condition that would apply to or materially adversely affect the Indemnified
Party or the conduct of the Indemnified Partys business or require the
Indemnified Party to admit any fault, wrongdoing, violation, culpability or
failure to act by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party, and (B) no
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to settle any Third Party Claim for which
indemnification is sought under _Section 8.02(a)_ or _Section 8.02(b)_ without
the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Seller or Buyer, as the case
may be, shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates and Representatives to,
cooperate fully with the Controlling Party in the defense of any Third Party
Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 8.03(b)_ , if
the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty
(30) Business Days after receipt of the Indemnified Partys notice of a Third
Party Claim of indemnity hereunder that it elects to assume the control of the
defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to contest the Third Party Claim but shall not thereby waive any right to
indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement and the costs of such Actions by
the Indemnified Party shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party.

 

(c)

 

 _Resolution of Claims_. Following timely provided notice of an
indemnification claim under this Agreement in accordance with _Section
8.03(a)_ (other than a Third Party Claim which is governed by _Section
8.03(b)_ ), the Indemnifying Party will have thirty (30) days from the date
notice was provided of such claim (the "Dispute Period") to make such
investigation of the claim as the Indemnifying Party deems necessary or
advisable. For purposes of such investigation, the Indemnified Party will make
available to the Indemnifying Party all the information reasonably related to
such claim relied upon by, or in the possession or control of, the Indemnified
Party to substantiate such claim. If the Indemnifying Party disagrees with the
validity or amount of all or a portion of such claim made by the Indemnified
Party, the Indemnifying Party will provide to the Indemnified Party written
notice thereof (the "Indemnification Dispute Notice") prior to the expiration
of the Dispute Period. If no Indemnification Dispute Notice is timely provided
to the Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period or if the Indemnifying
Party provides notice that it does not have a dispute with respect to such
claim for indemnification, then such claim will be deemed approved and
consented to by the Indemnifying Party (such claim being referred to herein as
an "Approved Indemnification Claim"). The Indemnifying Party will pay the
amount of the Approved Indemnification Claim by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account designated in writing by the Indemnified Party
within five (5) Business Days after such claim is determined to be an

 


  

 

50

  

 



 

Approved Indemnification Claim. If a Dispute Notice is provided to the
Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period and the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party do not agree to the validity and/or amount of such disputed
claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall negotiate in
good faith for a period of at least sixty (60) days to resolve the dispute. If
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are unable to come to an
agreement regarding such disputed claim during such sixty (60) day period,
such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with _Section 9.06_.

 

Section 8.04

 

 _Exclusive Remedies_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this
Agreement, and except for fraud or intentional misrepresentation, following
the Closing, the indemnification provisions of this _ARTICLE VIII_ shall be
the sole and exclusive remedies of any Seller Indemnified Party and any Buyer
Indemnified Party, respectively, for any Losses (including any Losses from
claims for breach of contract, warranty, tortious conduct (including
negligence) or otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute, strict
liability, or otherwise) that it may at any time suffer or incur, or become
subject to, as a result of, or in connection with, any breach of or inaccuracy
with respect to any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement by
Buyer or Seller, respectively, or any breach or failure by Buyer or Seller,
respectively, to perform or comply with any covenant or agreement set forth
herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except for fraud or
intentional misrepresentation, the Parties hereby irrevocably waive any right
of rescission they may otherwise have or to which they may become entitled.

 

Section 8.05

 

 _Additional Indemnification Provisions._

 

(a)

 

With respect to each indemnification obligation contained in this Agreement:

 

(i)

 

all Losses shall be net of any (A) amounts that have been recovered by the
Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification by, or indemnification
agreement with, any third party or any insurance policy or other cash receipts
or sources of reimbursement in respect of such Loss (including the recovery or
reimbursement of payments from a Taxing Authority) and (B) Tax benefits to the
Indemnified Party and its Affiliates arising out of such Losses (or out of the
event or occurrence that gave rise to such Losses),

 

(ii)

 

all Losses will be determined after deducting therefrom the amount of any
reserve with respect to such matter on the Financial Statements,

 

(iii)

 

no representation or warranty of Seller or Buyer shall be deemed untrue or
incorrect as a consequence of the existence of any fact, circumstance or event
that is disclosed in connection with another representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement, and

 

(iv)

 

Seller shall not be liable for any Losses to the extent that such Losses
suffered by any Buyer Indemnified Party, on the one hand, and Buyer shall not
be liable for any Losses to the extent that such Losses suffered by any Seller
Indemnified Party, on the other hand, (A) result from any act or omission by
such Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable, (B)
result from the failure of such Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified
Party, as applicable, to take reasonable action to mitigate such Losses, (C)
in the case of a Buyer Indemnified Party, result from the operation of the
Group Companies after the Closing, (E) in the case of a Seller Indemnified
Party, result from the operation of the Group Companies prior to the Closing,
or (F) are caused by or result from any action (1) that Seller or Buyer is
required, permitted or requested to take pursuant _Section 5.01_ (including
pursuant to the consent of Buyer or Seller, as applicable) or (2) that Seller
or Buyer having sought Buyers or Sellers consent, as applicable, pursuant to
_Section 5.01_ or _Section 5.19_ , did not take as a result of Buyer or
Seller, as applicable, having unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed
the requested consent.

 

(b)

 

With respect to _Section 8.05(a)(i)_ , the Indemnified Party shall first use
commercially reasonable efforts to collect any amounts under such
indemnification agreements, insurance policies or other sources of
reimbursement to the same extent as they would if such Loss were not subject
to indemnification hereunder or otherwise; _provided_ that, (A) in accordance
with and subject to the terms of this _ARTICLE VIII_ , the Indemnified Party
may submit a claim for indemnification prior to or simultaneously with
satisfying such commercially reasonable efforts to collect such amounts prior
to being indemnified with respect to such Losses, and (B) recovery for any
such claims from the Indemnifying Party shall be permitted in accordance with
and subject to the terms of this _ARTICLE VIII_ in the event that an
insurance, indemnity, reimbursement or similar recovery is not actually and
fully realized, to the extent of such Losses, by the Indemnified Party within
one hundred twenty (120) days of the date of such claim by the Indemnified
Party in accordance with and subject to the terms of this _ARTICLE VIII_ ; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the diligence findings, opinions or disposition
of any insurance company with respect to any claim for indemnification, the
determination of such insurance company regarding whether to deny or pay any
claim in whole or in part, and all communications between such insurance
company and any Indemnified Party, shall not be binding on the Parties, any
Buyer Indemnified Party or any Seller Indemnified Party or have any force or
effect with respect to any claim for indemnification hereunder. If an
Indemnified Party receives any such insurance proceeds or indemnity,
reimbursement or similar payments after being indemnified hereunder with
respect to some or all of such Losses, the Indemnified Party shall pay to the
Indemnifying Party the lesser of (1) the amount of such insurance proceeds or
indemnity, reimbursement or similar payment, less reasonable attorneys fees
and other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with such
recovery and (2) the aggregate amount paid by the Indemnifying Party to any
Indemnified Party with respect to such Losses.

(c)

 

If an Indemnifying Party makes any payment for any Losses suffered or incurred
by an Indemnified Party pursuant to the provisions of this _ARTICLE VIII_ ,
such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to
all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party to any insurance benefits or
other claims of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Losses and with
respect to the claim giving rise to such Losses.

 _Limitation on Liability_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or in
any other Transaction Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any
Indemnified Party have any Liability under any Transaction Agreement
(including under this _ARTICLE VIII_ ) for (i) any consequential, special,
incidental, indirect or punitive damages (except (a) to the extent punitive
damages are paid in connection with a Third Party Claim finally resolved in
accordance with _Section 8.03_ or (b) fines or penalties imposed by a
Governmental Entity) or lost profits or similar items (including loss of
revenue; income or profits; any amount calculated based upon any multiple of
earnings, book value or cash flow; diminution of value or loss of business
reputation or opportunity relating to a breach or alleged breach of this
Agreement); provided that such limitation with respect to lost profits shall
not limit any Indemnified Partys right to recover contract damages in
connection with such Partys failure to close in breach or violation of this
Agreement, or (ii) any amount that is a possible or potential Loss that the
Indemnified Party believes may be asserted rather than a Loss that has in fact
been paid or incurred by an Indemnified Party pursuant to the provisions of
this ARTICLE VIII.

ARTICLE III. 
 RIGHTS OF CLASS B SHARES

 

Section 3.1 _Board Size._ The Parties acknowledge that Section 12 of the
Articles of Association sets out the minimum and maximum size of the Companys

member of the Shareholder Group as is designated by Theta by notice in writing

Articles of Association been granted rights to appoint Directors (any such
Director appointed pursuant to the Articles of Association, a " _Shareholder
Designee_ ") to the Board of Directors and to remove them from office.

 

(b)

 

The Shareholder Group hereby appoints David Sachs and Oren Shaffer (or if any

Closing, another person or persons, as applicable, designated by the
Shareholder Group from the persons listed as Approved Theta Designees) as the

Designees to be appointed to the Board of Directors as of the Closing and (ii)
to enable Theta to exercise its rights pursuant to Section 5 of the Articles
of Association.

 

(c)

 

The Company and Theta agree that for purposes of Section 5(c) of the Articles
of Association, the individuals listed on Exhibit B hereto, as updated from
time to time jointly by Theta and the Company, shall constitute " _Approved

(d)

 

Notwithstanding the Theta Designating Person\'s appointment rights in section
5 of the Articles of Association, (i) in the event that the Company reasonably
objects to any Shareholder Designee, other than any Approved Theta Designee,
the Company shall have the right to notify the Theta Designating Person in
writing of such objections and the Companys basis for such objection (which,
to the extent the Company continues to object after the Theta Designating
Person\'s consultation with the Company, must be reasonable) and the Theta
Designating Person shall appoint a different Shareholder Designee taking into
account in good faith the basis for the Companys objection set forth in its
objection notice; provided, however, that the Company shall not have the right
to object to more than two (2) Shareholder Designees in each annual period and
(ii) no Theta Designating Person shall appoint as a Shareholder Designee any
Unapproved Shareholder Designee.

Initial Shareholder Designees, who shall be appointed as of Closing) to
coincide with the appointment of other Directors.

 

(f)

 

If, according to the Articles of Association, the Shareholder Group would be
required to remove Directors from Board of Directors, then the Theta
Designating Person shall promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business
Days) cause such number of the Shareholder Designees then serving on the Board
to resign from the Board (such resigning Shareholder Designees to be selected
at the Theta Designating Persons sole discretion) as is necessary so that the
remaining number of the Shareholder Designees then serving on the Board is

4

  

 



 



 

Section 3.5 _Voting Rights._ The Parties acknowledge that Section 10 of
the Articles of Association includes provisions on the voting rights carried

Securities Act. The Company acknowledges that Theta intends for financial
accounting purposes pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(" _US GAAP_ ") to account for the Shareholder Groups ownership of Company
Class B Shares pursuant to the equity method of accounting. The Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to provide, or cause to be provided, as promptly
as practicable, to the Shareholder Group all information necessary for Theta
to so account for the Shareholder Groups ownership of Company Class B Shares
pursuant to US GAAP. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 3.7_
shall require the Company to produce financial statements prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP.

 

Section 3.8 _Dividend Rights_.

 

(a)

 

The Parties acknowledge that each Company Ordinary Share and each Company
Class B Share carries equal rights to dividends and other distributions of
assets, as set out in Section 11 of the Articles of Association.

(c)

 

Nothing set forth herein, including _Section 4.1_ , shall in any way limit the

that Theta and its Affiliates shall have consulted with the Unaffiliated
Directors at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to making such Shareholder
Group Tender Offer. Upon the making of a Shareholder Group Tender Offer, the
restrictions set forth in _Section 4.1(b)_ shall be suspended until such time
that the Shareholder Group Tender Offer is either withdrawn or completed. In
the event that (i) a majority of Unaffiliated Directors recommend the
Shareholder Group Tender Offer or (ii) following completion of such
Shareholder Group Tender Offer, the Shareholder Group holds two thirds of the
then-outstanding Voting Securities, then _Section 4.1(b)_ shall automatically
terminate upon completion of the Shareholder Group Tender Offer.

 

(c)

 

If, at any time during the Initial Standstill Period or the Subsequent
Standstill Period, (i) the Company enters into definitive documentation
providing for a transaction that, if consummated, would constitute a Company
Change of Control; (ii) the Board publicly announces its determination that
(A) it will sell or dispose of, or has commenced a process by which it
proposes to sell or dispose of, the Company or all or substantially all of the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B) will

that, if consummated, would constitute a Company Change of Control is
commenced or the subject of an announcement of a firm intention to be made or
commenced by any Person or group of Persons acting in concert and the Board
either (x) publicly recommends that shareholders of the Company tender their
shares of the Company to the Person or group of Persons acting in concert
making such offer or (y) fails to recommend that the shareholders of the
Company reject such offer, in each case within ten (10) Business Days after
the date of commencement or posting of such offer, then, in any such case, the
provisions of _Section 4.1(a)_ and _Section 4.1(b)_ shall terminate
immediately and all other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect; _provided_ , however, that if, (x) with respect to clause
(i) of this sentence, such transaction is terminated without being
consummated, (y) with respect to clause (ii) of this sentence, the Board has
publicly announced that it has rescinded such determination or (z) with
respect to clause (iii) of this sentence, such offer or similar transaction is
withdrawn, terminated or expires without being consummated or if the Board
publicly recommends that the shareholders of the Company reject such offer,
then, in any such case all provisions of _Section 4.1_ previously terminated
shall be reinstated and shall be in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms from and after the date of such termination, public announcement,
withdrawal or expiration, as the case may be; _provided further_ , that such
reinstatement shall not prevent Theta or any of its Affiliates from continuing
to pursue any activities described in this _Section 4.1(c)_ that were
definitively commenced after the date of such termination, but at or prior to
the date of such reinstatement.

 

(d)

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 4.1_ , nothing
herein shall prohibit or prevent Theta or any of its Affiliates from acquiring
securities of, or from entering into any merger or other business combination

_however_ , that (i) such other Person shall have acquired such Company Shares
or other securities other than in contemplation of the Theta or any of its
Affiliates acquiring the securities of, or entering into any such merger or
other business combination with, such Person; (ii) the Beneficial Ownership of
such Company Shares or other securities by such other Person shall not be a
primary reason for Theta or any of its Affiliates acquiring the securities of,
or entering into any such merger or other business combination with, such
other Person; and (iii) the combined Beneficial Ownership of such Company
Shares of Theta or any of its Affiliates entering into the business
combination and such other Person would not result in Theta or any of its
Affiliates or such other Person being required, pursuant to the Finnish
Securities Market Act, to commence a mandatory tender offer to acquire
additional Company Shares.

Prior to or concurrently with the closing of a Shareholder Parent Change of
Control, the Company shall have the right, upon written notice to the
Shareholder Group, to cause the Shareholder Group to effect a Distribution
Transaction that results in the Transfer of all of the Company Shares
Beneficially Owned by the Shareholder Group to holders of Thetas issued and

Person who has consummated or is seeking to consummate such Shareholder Parent
Change of Control, and the Shareholder Group shall notify the Company of any
potential Shareholder Parent Change of Control at least sixty (60) calendar
days prior to the date of the expected occurrence of the Shareholder Parent

drafting and approval of such prospectus before listing the New Ordinary
Shares on the NASDAQ Helsinki (counting from the date the Company receives

conversion.

behalf of the depositary in connection with the issuance of the ADSs
representing the New Ordinary Shares.

ARTICLE II 
  
  _Registration Rights_

 

Section 2.01.

 

 _Demand Registration_.

 

(a)

 

Any Holder(s) of Registrable Securities (the " _Initiating Holder_ ") shall
have the right to request that the Company file a Registration Statement, on
behalf of itself or, in the case of any member of the Shareholder Group, on
behalf of any other member of the Shareholder Group, with the SEC on the
appropriate registration form for all or part of the Registrable Securities
held by such Initiating Holder, by delivering a written request thereof to the
Company specifying the number of shares of Registrable Securities such
Initiating Holder wishes to register (a " _Demand Registration_ "); _provided_
, however, that the anticipated aggregate number of Company Ordinary Shares
subject to such Demand Registration exceeds 2% of the total issued and
outstanding Company Shares. The Company shall (i) within five (5) Business
Days of the receipt of a Demand Registration, give written notice of such
Demand Registration to all Holders of Registrable Securities, (ii) use its
reasonable best efforts to prepare and file the Registration Statement as
expeditiously as possible but in any event within 45 days of such request, and
(iii) use reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to
become effective in respect of each Demand Registration in accordance with the
intended method of distribution set forth in the written request delivered by
the Initiating Holder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
required to cause such Registration Statement to become effective prior to the
Listing Date. The Company shall include in such Registration all Registrable
Securities with respect to which the Company receives, within the five (5)
Business Days immediately following the receipt by the Holder(s) of such
notice from the Company, a request for inclusion in the Registration from the
Holder(s) thereof. Each such request from a Holder of Registrable Securities
for inclusion in the Registration shall also specify the aggregate amount of
Registrable Securities proposed to be Registered. The Initiating Holder may
request that the Registration Statement be on any appropriate form, including
Form F-4 in the case of an Exchange Offer or a Shelf Registration Statement,
and the Company shall effect the Registration on the form so requested.

 

(b)

 

The Holder(s) may collectively make a total of six (6) Demand Registration
requests pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_ (including any exercise of rights to
Demand Registration transferred pursuant to _Section 3.08_ ); _provided_ that
the Holder(s) may not make more than two (2) Demand Registration requests in
any 365-day period.

 

(c)

 

The Company shall be deemed to have effected a Registration for purposes of
this _Section 2.01_ if the Registration Statement is declared effective by
the SEC or becomes effective upon filing with the SEC and remains effective
until the earlier of (i) the date when all Registrable Securities thereunder
have been Sold and (ii) 60 days from the effective date of the Registration
Statement (or from the date the applicable Prospectus is filed with the SEC if
the Company is satisfying a request for a Demand Registration by filing a
Prospectus under an effective Shelf Registration Statement) (the "
_Registration Period_ "). No

 


  

 

5

  

 



 

Registration shall be deemed to have been effective if the conditions to
closing specified in the underwriting agreement or dealer manager agreement,
if any, entered into in connection with such Registration are not satisfied by
reason of a wrongful act, misrepresentation or breach of such applicable
underwriting agreement or dealer manager agreement by the Company. If during
the Registration Period, such Registration is interfered with by any stop
order, injunction or other order or requirement of the SEC or other
Governmental Entity or the need to update or supplement the Registration
Statement, the Registration Period shall be extended on a day-for-day basis
for any period in which the Holders are unable to complete an offering as a
result of such stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the SEC
or other Governmental Entity.

 

(d)

 

With respect to any Registration Statement, whether filed or to be filed
pursuant to this Agreement, if the Company shall reasonably determine, upon
the advice of legal counsel, that maintaining the effectiveness of such
Registration Statement or filing an amendment or supplement thereto (or, if no
Registration Statement has yet been filed, filing such a Registration
Statement) would require the public disclosure of material nonpublic
information concerning any transaction or negotiations involving the Company
or any of its consolidated Subsidiaries that would materially interfere with
such transaction or negotiations (a " _Disadvantageous Condition_ "), the
Company may, for the shortest period reasonably practicable, and in any event
for not more than 60 consecutive calendar days (a " _Blackout Period_ "),
notify the Holders whose offers and Sales of Registrable Securities are
covered (or to be covered) by such Registration Statement (a " _Blackout
Notice_ ") that such Registration Statement is unavailable for use (or will
not be filed as requested). Upon the receipt of any such Blackout Notice, the
Holders shall forthwith discontinue use of the Prospectus contained in any
effective Registration Statement; _provided_ , that, if at the time of receipt
of such Blackout Notice any Holder shall have Sold its Registrable Securities
(or have signed a firm commitment underwriting agreement with respect to the
purchase of such shares) and the Disadvantageous Condition is not of a nature
that would require a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement,
then the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such
action as to eliminate any restriction imposed by federal securities laws on
the timely delivery of such Registrable Securities. When any Disadvantageous
Condition as to which a Blackout Notice has been previously delivered shall
cease to exist, the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable notify
the Holders and take such actions in respect of such Registration Statement as
are otherwise required by this Agreement. The effectiveness period for any
Demand Registration for which the Company has given notice of a Blackout
Period shall be increased by the length of time of such Blackout Period. In
connection with the Companys Registration obligation under this _Section
2.01_ and _Section 2.03_, _Section 2.04_ and _Section 2.05_, the Company
shall not impose, in any 365-day period, Blackout Periods more than twice, and
any such Blackout Periods may not last, in the aggregate, in excess of 90
calendar days during such 365-day period. If the Company declares a Blackout
Period with respect to a Demand Registration for a Registration Statement that
has not yet been declared effective, (i) the Holders may by notice to the
Company withdraw the related Demand Registration request without such Demand
Registration request counting against the number of Demand Registration
requests permitted to be made under _Section 2.01(b)_ and (ii) the Holders
shall not be responsible for any of the Companys related Registration
Expenses.

 

(e)

 

If the Initiating Holder so indicates at the time of its request pursuant to
_Section 2.01(a)_, such offering of Registrable Securities shall be in the
form of an Underwritten Offering or an Exchange Offer, and the Company shall
include such information in the written notice to the Holders required under
_Section 2.01(a)_. In the event that the Initiating Holder intends to Sell
the Registrable Securities by means of an Underwritten Offering or Exchange
Offer, the right of any Holder to include Registrable Securities in such
registration shall be conditioned upon such Holders participation in such
Underwritten Offering or Exchange Offer and the inclusion of such Holders
Registrable Securities in the Underwritten Offering or the Exchange Offer to
the extent provided herein. The Holders of a majority of the outstanding
Registrable Securities being included in any Underwritten Offering or Exchange
Offer shall select the underwriter(s) in the case of an Underwritten Offering
or the dealer manager(s) in the case of an Exchange Offer; _provided_ that
such underwriter(s) or dealer manager(s) are reasonably acceptable to the
Company.

 

(f)

 

If the managing underwriter or underwriters of a proposed Underwritten
Offering of Registrable Securities included in a Registration pursuant to this
_Section 2.01_ inform(s) in writing the Holders participating in such
Registration, with a copy of such writing provided to the Company, that, in
its or their opinion, the number of securities requested to be included in
such Registration exceeds the number that can be Sold in such offering without
being likely to have a significant adverse effect on the price, timing or
distribution of the securities offered or the market for the securities
offered, the number of Registrable Securities to be included in such
Registration shall be reduced to the maximum number recommended by the
managing underwriter or underwriter and allocated pro rata among the Holders,
including the Initiating Holder, in proportion to the number of Registrable
Securities each Holder has requested to be included in such Registration;
_provided_ , that the Initiating Holder may notify the Company in writing that
the Registration Statement shall be abandoned or withdrawn, in which event the
Company shall abandon or withdraw such Registration Statement. In the event
the Initiating Holder notifies the Company that such Registration Statement
shall be abandoned or withdrawn, such Holder shall not be deemed to have
requested a Demand Registration pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_, and the
Company shall not be deemed to have effected a Demand Registration pursuant to
_Section 2.01(b)_. If the amount of Registrable Securities to be underwritten
has not been limited in accordance with the first sentence of this _Section
2.01(f)_, the Company and the holders of Company Shares or, if the Registrable
Securities include securities other than Company Shares, the holders of
securities of the same class of those securities included in the Registrable
Securities, in each case, other than the Holders (" _Other Holders_ "), may
include such securities for their own account or for the account of Other
Holders in such Registration if the underwriter(s) so agree and to the extent
that, in the opinion of such underwriter(s), the inclusion of such additional
amount will not adversely affect the offering of the Registrable Securities
included in such Registration.

Section 2.02.

 

 _Piggyback Registrations_.

 

(a)

 

If the Company proposes to file a Registration Statement (other than a Shelf
Registration) or a Prospectus supplement filed pursuant to a Shelf
Registration Statement under the Securities Act with respect to any offering
of such securities for its own account and/or for the account of any Other
Holders (other than (i) a Registration under _Section 2.01_, (ii) a
Registration pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-8, S-4 or F-4 or
similar form that relates to a transaction subject to Rule 145 under the
Securities Act, (iii) any form that does not include substantially the same
information, other than information relating to the selling holders or their
plan of distribution, as would be required to be included in a Registration
Statement covering the sale of the Registrable Securities, (iv) in connection
with any dividend reinvestment or similar plan, (v) for the sole purpose of
offering securities to another entity or its security holders in connection
with the acquisition of assets or securities of such entity or any similar
transaction or (vi) a Registration in which the only Company Shares being
registered are Company Shares issuable upon conversion of debt securities that
are also being registered) (a " _Company Public Sale_ "), then, as soon as
practicable, but in any event not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to
the proposed date of filing such Registration Statement, the Company shall
give written notice of such proposed filing to each Holder, and such notice
shall offer such Holders the opportunity to Register under such Registration
Statement such number of Registrable Securities as each such Holder may
request in writing (a " _Piggyback Registration_ "). Subject to _Section
2.02(b)_ and _Section 2.02(c)_, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to include in a Registration Statement with respect to a
Company Public Sale all Registrable Securities that are requested to be
included therein within five (5) Business Days after the receipt of any such
notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, at any time after giving written
notice of its intention to Register any securities and prior to the effective
date of the Registration Statement filed in connection with such Registration,
the Company shall determine for any reason not to Register or to delay
Registration of the Company Public Sale, the Company may, at its election,
give written notice of such determination to each such Holder and, thereupon,
(x) in the case of a determination not to Register, shall be relieved of its
obligation to Register any Registrable Securities in connection with such
Registration, without prejudice, however, to the rights of any Holder to
request that such Registration be effected as a Demand Registration under
_Section 2.01_ and (y) in the case of a determination to delay Registration,
shall be permitted to delay Registering any Registrable Securities for the
same period as the delay in Registering such other Company Shares in the
Company Public Sale. No Registration effected under this _Section 2.02_ shall
relieve the Company of its obligation to effect any Demand Registration under
_Section 2.01_. For purposes of clarification, the Companys filing of a
Shelf Registration Statement shall not be deemed to be a Company Public Sale;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any prospectus supplement filed pursuant to a
Shelf Registration Statement with respect to an offering of Company Shares for
its own account and/or for the account of any other Persons will be a Company
Public Sale unless such offering qualifies for an exemption from the Company
Public Sale definition in this _Section 2.02(a)_.

 

(b)

 

In the case of any Underwritten Offering, each Holder shall have the right to
withdraw such Holders request for inclusion of its Registrable Securities in
such Underwritten Offering pursuant to _Section 2.02(a)_ at any time prior to
the execution of an underwriting agreement by giving written notice to the
Company of such Holders request to withdraw and, subject to the preceding
clause, each Holder shall be permitted to withdraw all or part of such
Holders Registrable Securities from a Piggyback Registration at any time
prior to the effective date thereof.

 

(c)

 

If the managing underwriter or underwriters of any proposed Underwritten
Offering of a class of Registrable Securities included in a Piggyback
Registration informs the Company and each Holder in writing that, in its or
their opinion, the number of securities of such class that such Holder and any
other Persons intend to include in such offering exceeds the number that can
be Sold in such offering without being likely to have a material adverse
effect on the price, timing or distribution of the securities offered or the
market for the securities offered, then the securities to be included in such
Registration shall be (i) first, all securities of the Company and any other
Persons (other than the Companys executive officers and directors) for whom
the Company is effecting the Registration, as the case may be, proposes to
Sell, (ii) second, the number, if any, of Registrable Securities of such class
that, in the opinion of such managing underwriter or underwriters, can be Sold
without having such adverse effect, with such number to be allocated pro rata
among the Holders that have requested to participate in such Registration
based on the relative number of Registrable Securities of such class requested
by such Holder to be included in such Sale, (iii) third, the number of
securities of executive officers and directors of the Company for whom the
Company is effecting the Registration, as the case may be, with such number to
be allocated pro rata among the executive officers and directors and (iv)
fourth, any other securities eligible for inclusion in such Registration,
allocated among the holders of such securities in such proportion as the
Company and those holders may agree.

 

(d)

 

After a Holder has been notified of its opportunity to include Registrable
Securities in a Piggyback Registration, such Holder (i) shall treat the
Offering Confidential Information as confidential information, (ii) shall not
use any Offering Confidential Information for any purpose other than to
evaluate whether to include its Registrable Securities (or other Company
Shares) in such Piggyback Registration and (iii) shall not disclose any
Offering Confidential Information to any Person other than such of its agents,
employees, advisors and counsel as have a need to know such Offering
Confidential Information, and to cause such agents, employees, advisors and
counsel to comply with the requirements of this _Section 2.02(d)_; _provided_
, that any such Holder may disclose Offering Confidential Information if such
disclosure is required by legal process, but such Holder shall reasonably
cooperate with the Company to limit the extent of such disclosure through
protective order or otherwise, and to seek confidential treatment of the
Offering Confidential Information.

Section 2.03.

 

 _Shelf Registration_.

 

(a)

 

The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to file, no later than 45
days following any written request from any Initiating Holder, a Registration
Statement for a Shelf Registration on a Long-Form Shelf covering the resale of
all of the Registrable Securities on a delayed or continuous basis and shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Long-Form Shelf to become
effective as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Company shall not be required to cause such Registration Statement
to become effective prior to the Listing Date. The Company shall maintain the
Long-Form Shelf in accordance with the terms hereof. The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to convert the Long-Form Shelf to a Short-Form
Shelf as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company is eligible to use a
Short-Form Shelf. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
such Shelf Registration Statement to remain effective until there are no
longer any Registrable Securities that are not otherwise registered under a
Registration Statement. The "Plan of Distribution" section of such Shelf
Registration Statement shall permit all lawful means of disposition of
Registrable Securities and the other Company Shares to be registered
thereunder, including firm-commitment underwritten public offerings, block
trades, agented transactions, sales directly into the market, purchases or
sales by brokers and sales not involving a public offering. If the SEC will
not permit the Company to include all unregistered Company Shares in a Shelf
Registration Statement (including the initial Shelf Registration Statement),
the Company will include as many unregistered Company Shares as possible and
exclude unregistered Company Shares on a pro rata basis; provided, that, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to include any unregistered
Company Shares excluded from the initial Shelf Registration Statement on a
future Shelf Registration Statement as promptly as practicable following such
exclusion. 

 

(b)

 

If the Company reasonably determines, upon the advice of counsel, that a
Disadvantageous Condition exists, the Company may impose a Blackout Period on
the filing or use of a Shelf Registration Statement on the same terms and
conditions as set forth in _Section 2.01(d)_.

 

(c)

 

No Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to this _Section 2.03_ shall be
deemed a Demand Registration pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_, provided, that
any takedown of shares registered under a Shelf Registration Statement in
connection with an underwritten offering of Registrable Securities (including
an Underwritten Block Trade) shall be deemed to be a Demand Registration by
the Holder requesting such takedown. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, any takedown of shares registered under the Shelf Registration
Statement in connection with an offering of Registrable Securities (including
a block trade or similar transaction) which is not underwritten shall not
count against the number of Demand Registration requests permitted to be made
under _Section 2.01(b)_.

 

(d)

 

If any Short-Form Shelf has been outstanding for at least three (3) years, at
the end of the third year the Company shall file a new Short-Form Shelf
covering all of the Registrable Securities then held by the Holders. If any
Short-Form Shelf filed pursuant to this _Section 2.03(d) _ceases to be
effective for any reason, the Company shall file a new Short-Form Shelf
covering all of the Registrable Securities then held by the Holders. If the
Company does not pay the filing fee covering the Registrable Securities held
by the Holders at the time any Short-Form Shelf is filed pursuant to this
_Section 2.03(d)_, the Company shall pay such fee at such time or times as
the Registrable Securities are to be sold pursuant thereto.

 

Section 2.04.

 

 _Underwritten Block Trade_. 

 

(a)

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if an Initiating
Holder wishes to engage in an underwritten block trade or similar transaction
or other transaction with a two-day (or shorter) marketing period
(collectively, an " _Underwritten Block Trade_ ") off of a Shelf Registration
Statement (either through filing an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement or
through a takedown from an already existing and effective Shelf Registration
Statement), then the Initiating Holder must notify the Company of the
Underwritten Block Trade on the day before such offering is to commence, and
the Company shall as expeditiously as reasonably possible, but subject to
_Section 2.03(b)_, use its reasonable best efforts to facilitate such
Underwritten Block Trade (which may close as early as three (3) business days
after the date it commences); provided that the Initiating Holder effecting
such Underwritten Block Trade shall use its reasonable best efforts to work
with the Company and the underwriters in order to facilitate preparation of
the registration statement, prospectus and other offering documentation
related to the Underwritten Block Trade. In the event the Initiating Holder
requests such an Underwritten Block Trade, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, no other holder of Registrable Securities shall
have any right to notice of or to participate in such Underwritten Block
Trade. Any Underwritten Block Trade under which any Registrable Securities
are sold will count as one (1) Demand Registration. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, an Underwritten Block Trade shall not require any
minimum anticipated aggregate offering price. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, any block trade or similar transaction which is not
underwritten shall not count against the number of Demand Registration
requests permitted to be made under _Section 2.01(b)_.

 

Section 2.05.

 

 _Distribution Transactions_. 

 

(a)

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event any
member of the Shareholder Group elects to effect a Distribution Transaction,
such members of the Shareholder Group shall have the right to request that the

 


  

 

8

  

 



 

Company file a Registration Statement, on behalf of itself and the other
members of the Shareholder Group, with the SEC on the appropriate registration
form for all or part of the Registrable Securities held by such members of the
Shareholder Group, by delivering a written request thereof to the Company
specifying the number of shares of Registrable Securities the members of the
Shareholder Group wish to register (a " _Distribution Transaction
Registration_ "). The Company shall (i) use its reasonable best efforts to
prepare and file the Registration Statement as expeditiously as possible but
in any event within 45 days of such request, and (ii) use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become effective in respect of
each Distribution Transaction Registration in accordance with the intended
method of distribution set forth in the written request delivered by such
member of the Shareholder Group. Such requesting member of the Shareholder
Group may request that the Registration Statement be on any appropriate form,
including a Shelf Registration Statement, and the Company shall effect the
Registration on the form so requested (which may include an already existing
and effective Registration Statement). For the avoidance of doubt, such
request for a Distribution Transaction Registration shall not count against
the number of Demand Registration requests permitted to be made under _Section
2.01(b)_.

 

(b)

 

The Company shall be deemed to have effected a Registration for purposes of
this _Section 2.05_ if the Registration Statement is declared effective by
the SEC or becomes effective upon filing with the SEC and remains effective
for the Registration Period. If during the Registration Period, such
Registration is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order
or requirement of the SEC or other Governmental Entity or the need to update
or supplement the Registration Statement, the Registration Period shall be
extended on a day-for-day basis for any period in which the applicable members
of the Shareholder Group are unable to complete the Distribution Transaction
as a result of such stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of
the SEC or other Governmental Entity.

 

(c)

 

If the Company reasonably determines, upon the advice of counsel, that a
Disadvantageous Condition exists, the Company may impose a Blackout Period on
the filing or use of a Shelf Registration Statement on the same terms and
conditions as set forth in _Section 2.01(d)_.

 

Section 2.06.

 

 _Registration Procedures_.

 

(a)

 

In connection with the Companys Registration obligations under _Section
2.01_, _Section 2.02_, _Section 2.03_, _Section 2.04_ and _Section 2.05_,
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect such Registration
to permit the offer and Sale of such Registrable Securities in accordance with
the intended method or methods of distribution thereof as expeditiously as
reasonably practicable, and in connection therewith, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause

Prospectus or amendments or supplements thereto or any Ancillary Filing to
which any Holder or the underwriters or dealer managers, if any, shall
reasonably object;

Registration Period;

 

(iii)

suspending the effectiveness of such Registration Statement, any order
preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary or final Prospectus or any

(iv)

 

(A) promptly notify each participating Holder and the managing underwriter(s)
or dealer manager(s), if any, when the Company becomes aware of the occurrence
of any event as a result of which the applicable Registration Statement, the
Prospectus included in such Registration Statement (as then in effect) or any
Ancillary Filing contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of
such Prospectus and any preliminary Prospectus, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made) not misleading, or if for any other reason it
shall be necessary during such time period to amend or supplement such
Registration Statement, Prospectus or any Ancillary Filing in order to comply

to the plan of distribution with respect to such Registrable Securities and
(B) make all required filings of such Prospectus supplement or post-effective
amendment as soon as reasonably practicable after being notified of the
matters to be incorporated in such Prospectus supplement or post-effective
amendment;

 

(vii)

 

furnish to each participating Holder and each underwriter or dealer manager,
if any, without charge, as many conformed copies as such Holder or underwriter

and Sale of the Registrable Securities covered by such Prospectus or any
amendment or supplement thereto) and such other documents as such
participating Holder or underwriter or dealer manager may reasonably request
in order to facilitate the Sale of the Registrable Securities by such Holder
or underwriter or dealer manager;

 

(ix)

 

on or prior to the date on which the applicable Registration Statement is
declared effective or becomes effective, register or qualify, and cooperate
with each participating Holder, the managing underwriter(s) or dealer
manager(s), if any, and their respective counsel, in connection with the
registration or qualification of, such Registrable Securities for offer and
Sale under the securities or " _blue sky_ " laws of each state and other
jurisdiction of the United States as any participating Holder or managing
underwriter(s) or dealer manager(s), if any, or their respective counsel
reasonably request, and in any foreign jurisdiction mutually agreeable to the
Company and the participating Holders, and do any and all other acts or things
reasonably necessary or advisable to keep such registration or qualification
in effect for so long as such Registration Statement remains in effect and so
as to permit the continuance of offers and Sales and dealings in such
jurisdictions for so long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of
the Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement; _provided_

(xv)

 

in the case of an Exchange Offer that does not involve a dealer manager,

and warranties or other covenants or agreements as may be requested by any
participating Holder comparable to those that would be included in an
underwriting or dealer manager agreement;

 

(xvi)

or other responsibility, subject to the foregoing; _provided_ , that in no
event shall any member of the Company Group be required to make available any
information which the Company determines in good faith to be competitively
sensitive or confidential. The recipients of such information shall coordinate
with one another so that the inspection permitted hereunder will not
unnecessarily interfere with the Company Groups conduct of business. Each
Holder agrees that information obtained by it as a result of such inspections
shall be deemed confidential and shall not be used by it as the basis for any
market transactions in the securities of the Company or its Affiliates unless
and until such information is made generally available to the public by the
Company or such Affiliate or for any reason not related to the Registration of
Registrable Securities;

 


  

 

11

  

 



 



 

(xx)

 

in the case of an Underwritten Offering or Exchange Offer, cause the senior
executive officers of the Company to participate at reasonable times and for
reasonable periods in the customary "road show" presentations that may be
reasonably requested by the managing underwriter(s) or dealer manager(s), if
any, and otherwise to facilitate, cooperate with, and participate in each
proposed offering contemplated herein and customary selling efforts related
thereto, except to the extent that such participation materially interferes
with the management of the Companys business; _provided_ that the
effectiveness period for any Demand Registration shall be increased on a day-
for-day basis by the period of time that management cannot participate;

 

(xxi)

 

comply with all requirements of the Securities Act, Exchange Act and other
applicable laws, rules and regulations, as well as all applicable stock
exchange rules; and

 

(xxii)

 

take all other customary steps reasonably necessary or advisable to effect the
Registration and distribution of the Registrable Securities contemplated
hereby.

 

(b)

 

As a condition precedent to any Registration hereunder, the Company may
require each Holder as to which any Registration is being effected to furnish
to the Company such information regarding the distribution of such securities
and such other information relating to such Holder, its ownership of
Registrable Securities and other matters as the Company may from time to time
reasonably request in writing. Each such Holder agrees to furnish such
information to the Company and to cooperate with the Company as reasonably
necessary to enable the Company to comply with the provisions of this
Agreement.

 

(c)

 

Each Holder shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, notify the Company,
at any time when a Prospectus is required to be delivered (or deemed
delivered) under the Securities Act, of the occurrence of an event, of which
such Holder has knowledge, relating to such Holder or its Sale of Registrable
Securities thereunder requiring the preparation of a supplement or amendment
to such Prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered (or deemed delivered) to
the purchasers of such Registrable Securities, such Prospectus will not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading.

 

(d)

 

The Shareholder agrees (on behalf of itself and each member of the Shareholder
Group), and any other Holder agrees by acquisition of such Registrable
Securities, that, upon receipt of any written notice from the Company of the
occurrence of any event of the kind described in _Section 2.06(a)(iv)_ such
Holder will forthwith discontinue Sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to
such Registration Statement until such Holders receipt of the copies of the
supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by _Section 2.06(a)(iv)_, or
until such Holder is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the
Prospectus may be resumed, and if so directed by the Company, such Holder will
deliver to the Company, at the Companys expense, all copies of the Prospectus
covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such
notice. In the event the Company shall give any such notice, the period during
which the applicable Registration Statement is required to be maintained
effective shall be extended by the number of days during the period from and
including the date of the giving of such notice through the date when each
seller of Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement either
receives the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by
_Section 2.06(a)(iv)_ or is advised in writing by the Company that the use of
the Prospectus may be resumed.

 

Section 2.07.

 

 _Registration and Maintenance of Company ADSs_.

 

(a)

 

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, immediately
following the date hereof, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to
(i) register the Company Ordinary Shares, represented by the Company ADSs, on
Form 20-F under the Exchange Act, (ii) enter into, and cause the Company ADSs
to be issued pursuant to, a depositary agreement, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Shareholder, with an institution reasonably
acceptable to the Shareholder, as depositary, and the owners and holders from
time to time of the Company ADSs, (iii) cause the Company ADSs, evidenced by
American depositary receipts and issuable upon deposit of Company Ordinary
Shares, to be registered on Form F-6 under the Securities Act, and (iv) cause
the Company ADSs to be listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange, in
each case, effective as of the earlier of (A) the date, not earlier than the
Closing Date, specified by the Shareholder to the Company upon 90 days prior
written notice, in the event that the Shareholder shall have entered into or
consummated an Acquisition Proposal, and (B) the earliest date practicable
following the Closing and not later than 90 days thereafter (such date once
each of the foregoing sub clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) have all occurred,
the " _Listing Date_ "). In connection therewith, the Company will deposit
Company Ordinary Shares from time to time with the Company ADS depositary and
cause the Company ADS depositary to issue Company ADSs to the Holders upon
deposit of such Company Ordinary Shares; _provided_ that the Company shall not
be required to deposit such Company Ordinary Shares in exchange for Company
ADSs except in compliance with the Securities Act.

 


  

 

12

  

 



 



 

(b)

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless the Company has
previously caused the Company Ordinary Shares to be listed on the New York
Stock Exchange or another national securities exchange or trading system in
the United States (it being acknowledged that the Company shall have no
obligation to so list the Company Ordinary Shares) and a market in the United
States for Company Shares not held in the form of Company ADSs exists, in any
registration pursuant to _Section 2.01_, _Section 2.02_, _Section 2.03_,
_Section 2.04_ or _Section 2.05_, the Company will ensure that any
Registrable Securities registered and sold pursuant to the applicable
Registration Statement are in the form of Company ADSs.

 

Section 2.08.

 

 _Underwritten Offerings or Exchange Offers_.

 

(a)

 

If requested by the managing underwriter(s) for any Underwritten Offering or
dealer manager(s) for any Exchange Offer that is requested by Holders pursuant
to a Registration under _Section 2.01_, _Section 2.03_, _Section 2.04_ or
_Section 2.05_, the Company shall enter into an underwriting agreement or
dealer manager agreement, as applicable, with such underwriter(s) or dealer
manager(s) for such offering, such agreement to be reasonably satisfactory in
substance and form to the Company and the underwriter(s) or dealer manager(s)
and, if the Shareholder is a participating Holder, to the Shareholder. Such
agreement shall contain such representations and warranties by the Company and
such other terms as are generally prevailing in agreements of that type. Each
Holder with Registrable Securities to be included in any Underwritten Offering
or Exchange Offer by such underwriter(s) or dealer manager(s) shall enter into
such underwriting agreement or dealer manager agreement at the request of the
Company, which agreement shall contain such reasonable representations and
warranties by the Holder and such other reasonable terms as are generally
prevailing in agreements of that type.

 

(b)

 

In the event of a Company Public Sale involving an offering of Company Shares
or other equity securities of the Company in an Underwritten Offering (whether
in a Demand Registration or a Piggyback Registration, whether or not the
Holders participate therein), the Holders hereby agree, and, in the event of a
Company Public Sale of Company Shares or other equity securities of the
Company in an Underwritten Offering or an Exchange Offer, the Company shall
agree, and it shall cause its executive officers and directors to agree, if
requested by the managing underwriter or underwriters in such Underwritten
Offering or by the Holder or the dealer manager or dealer managers, in an
Exchange Offer, not to effect any Sale or distribution (including any offer to
Sell, contract to Sell, short Sale or any option to purchase) of any
securities (except, in each case, as part of the applicable Registration, if
permitted hereunder) that are of the same type as those being Registered in
connection with such public offering and Sale, or any securities convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, during the period
beginning seven (7) days before, and ending 90 days (or such lesser period as
may be permitted by the Company or the participating Holder(s), as applicable,
or such managing underwriter or underwriters) after, the effective date of the
Registration Statement filed in connection with such Registration (or, if
later, the date of the Prospectus), to the extent timely notified in writing
by such selling Person or the managing underwriter or underwriters or dealer
manager or dealer managers. The participating Holders and the Company, as
applicable, also agree to execute an agreement evidencing the restrictions in
this _Section 2.08(b)_ in customary form, which form is reasonably
satisfactory to the Company or the participating Holder(s), as applicable, and
the underwriter(s) or dealer manager(s), as applicable; _provided_ that such
restrictions may be included in the underwriting agreement or dealer manager
agreement, if applicable. The Company may impose stop-transfer instructions
with respect to the securities subject to the foregoing restriction until the
end of the required stand-off period.

 

(c)

 

No Holder may participate in any Underwritten Offering or Exchange Offer
hereunder unless such Holder (i) agrees to Sell such Holders securities on
the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements or dealer manager
agreements approved by the Company or other Persons entitled to approve such
arrangements and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of
attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements, dealer manager agreements and
other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting
arrangements or dealer manager agreements or this Agreement.

 

Section 2.09.

 

 _Registration Expenses_.

 

(a)

 

In the case of any Registration of Registrable Securities required pursuant to
this Agreement, the Company shall pay all Registration Expenses regardless of
whether the Registration Statement becomes effective; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company shall not be required to pay for any expenses of any
Registration begun pursuant to _Section 2.01_ (or that otherwise constitutes
a Demand Registration) if the Demand Registration request is subsequently
withdrawn at the request of the Holders of a majority of the Registrable
Securities to be Registered (in which case all participating Holders shall
bear such expenses), unless the Holders of a majority of the Registrable
Securities agree to forfeit their right to one (1) Demand Registration to
which they have the right pursuant to _Section 2.01(b)_.

 

(b)

 

Each Holder shall be responsible for (i) any allocable underwriting fees,
discounts or commissions, (ii) any allocable commissions of brokers and
dealers, (iii) fees and disbursements of counsel for such Holder (other than
the reasonable fees and disbursements of one (1) counsel for the Holders of
Registrable Securities selected by a majority of the Holders of Registrable
Securities requested to be included in such registration or offering), and
(iv) capital gains, income and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale of
such Holders Registrable Securities.

Section 2.10.

 

 _Indemnification_.

 

(a)

 

The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent
permitted by law, each Holder whose shares are included in a Registration
Statement, such Holders Affiliates and their respective officers, directors,
agents, advisors, employees and each Person, if any, who controls (within the
meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act) such Holder, from and
against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities (or actions or
proceedings in respect thereof, whether or not such indemnified party is a
party thereto) and expenses, joint or several (including reasonable costs of
investigation and legal expenses) (each, a " _Loss_ " and collectively "
_Losses_ ") arising out of or based upon (i) any untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement under
which the offering and Sale of such Registrable Securities was Registered
under the Securities Act (including any final or preliminary Prospectus
contained therein or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any
documents incorporated by reference therein), or any such statement made in
any free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act)
that the Company has filed or is required to file pursuant to Rule 433(d) of
the Securities Act or any Ancillary Filing, (ii) any omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a Prospectus,
preliminary Prospectus or free writing prospectus, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading; provided, that with
respect to any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or
omission made therein, the indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph
shall not apply to the extent that any such liability or Loss results from or
arises out of information furnished in writing by such Holder or on such
Holders behalf, in either case expressly for use in such Registration
Statement, Prospectus, free writing prospectus or Ancillary Filing relating to
such Holders Registrable Securities. This indemnity shall be in addition to
any liability the Company may otherwise have, including under the Purchase
Agreement and the Shareholders Agreement. Such indemnity shall remain in full
force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such
Holder or any indemnified party and shall survive the Sale of such securities
by such Holder.

 

(b)

 

Each participating Holder whose Registrable Securities are included in a
Registration Statement agrees (severally and not jointly) to indemnify and
hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by law, the Company, its
directors, officers, agents, advisors, employees and each Person, if any, who
controls (within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) the
Company from and against any and all Losses arising out of or based upon
information furnished in writing by such Holder or on such Holders behalf, in
either case expressly for use in a Registration Statement, Prospectus, free
writing prospectus or Ancillary Filing relating to such Holders Registrable
Securities. This indemnity shall be in addition to any liability the
participating Holder may otherwise have, including under the Purchase
Agreement and the Shareholders Agreement. In no event shall the liability of
any participating Holder hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount
of the net proceeds received by such holder under the Sale of the Registrable
Securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation. Such indemnity
shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by
or on behalf of the Company or any indemnified party.

 

(c)

 

Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this _Section 2.10_ (an
" _Indemnitee_ ") of notice of the commencement of any action, such Indemnitee
will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying
party (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") under this _Section 2.10_, notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so
to notify the Indemnifying Party (i) will not relieve it from liability under
_Section 2.10(a)_ or _Section 2.10(b)_ above unless and to the extent such
action and such failure results in material prejudice to the Indemnifying
Party and forfeiture by the Indemnifying Party of substantial rights and
defenses; and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the Indemnifying Party from
any obligations to any Indemnitee other than the indemnification obligation
provided in _Section 2.10(a)_ or _Section 2.10(b)_ above. The Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it
shall wish, jointly with any other Indemnifying Party similarly notified, to
assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such Indemnitee (who
shall not, except with the consent of the Indemnitee, be counsel to the
Indemnifying Party), and, except as provided in the next sentence, after
notice from the Indemnifying Party to such Indemnitee of its election to so
assume the defense thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such
Indemnitee for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with the defense
thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. Notwithstanding the
Indemnifying Partys rights in the prior sentence, the Indemnitee shall have
the right to employ its own counsel (and one local counsel), and the
Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such
separate counsel if:

 

(A)

 

the use of counsel chosen by the Indemnifying Party to represent the
Indemnitee would present such counsel with an actual or potential conflict of
interest;

 

(B)

 

the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include
both the Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnitee shall have
reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or
other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those
available to the Indemnifying Party;

 

(C)

 

the Indemnifying Party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the
Indemnitee to represent the Indemnitee within a reasonable time after notice
of the institution of such action; or

 

(D)

 

the Indemnifying Party shall authorize the Indemnitee to employ separate
counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party.

 


  

 

14

  

 



 



 

(d)

 

 No Indemnifying Party shall, in connection with any one action or separate
but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising
out of the same general circumstances or allegations, be liable for the fees
and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any
local counsel) for all indemnified parties. An Indemnifying Party shall not be
liable under this _Section 2.10_ to any Indemnitee regarding any settlement
or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any
pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which
indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the
indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action)
unless such settlement, compromise or consent is consented to by such
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. No
Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall,
except with the consent of each Indemnitee (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement or compromise unless such settlement or compromise (x) includes as
an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff therein,
to such Indemnitee , of a full and final release from all liability in respect
to such claim or litigation and (y) does not include a statement as to, or an
admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of such
Indemnitee.

 

(e)

 

If for any reason the indemnification provided for in _Section 2.10(a)_ or
_Section 2.10(b)_ is unavailable to an Indemnitee or insufficient to hold it
harmless as contemplated by _Section 2.10(a)_ or _Section 2.10(b)_, then the
Indemnifying Party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the
Indemnitee as a result of such Loss in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party on the one hand and the
Indemnitee on the other hand. The relative fault shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by the Indemnifying Party or the
Indemnitee and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information
and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 2.10(e)_ to the contrary, no
Indemnifying Party (other than the Company) shall be required pursuant to this
_Section 2.10(e)_ to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which
the net proceeds received by such Indemnifying Party from the Sale of
Registrable Securities in the offering to which the Losses of the Indemnitees
relate (before deducting expenses, if any) exceeds the amount of any damages
which such Indemnifying Party has otherwise been required to pay by reason of
such untrue statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not
be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this _Section 2.10(e)_ were
determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that
does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this
_Section 2.10(e)_. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within
the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnitee hereunder shall
be deemed to include, for purposes of this _Section 2.10(e)_, any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with
investigating, preparing to defend or defending against or appearing as a
third party witness in respect of, or otherwise incurred in connection with,
any such loss, claim, damage, expense, liability, action, investigation or
proceeding. If indemnification is available under this _Section 2.10_, the
Indemnifying Parties shall indemnify each Indemnitee to the full extent
provided in _Section 2.10(a)_ and _Section 2.10(b)_ without regard to the
relative fault of said Indemnifying Parties or Indemnitee. Any Holders
obligations to contribute pursuant to this _Section 2.10(e)_ are several and
not joint.

 

Section 2.11.

 

 _Reporting Requirements; Rule 144_.

 

Until the earlier of (a) the expiration or termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms or (b) the date upon which the Shareholder Group
ceases to own any Registrable Securities, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to be and remain in compliance with the
periodic filing requirements imposed under the SECs rules and regulations,
including the Exchange Act, and any other applicable laws or rules, and
thereafter shall timely file such information, documents and reports as the
SEC may require or prescribe under Sections 13, 14 and 15(d), as applicable,
of the Exchange Act so that the Company will qualify for registration on Form
S-3 or F-3 and to enable the Shareholder Group to Sell Registrable Securities
without registration under the Securities Act consistent with the exemptions
from registration under the Securities Act provided by (i) Rule 144 or
Regulation S under the Securities Act, as amended from time to time, or (ii)
any similar SEC rule or regulation then in effect. From and after the date
hereof through the earlier of the expiration or termination of this Agreement
in accordance with its terms and the date upon which the Shareholder Group
ceases to own any Registrable Securities, the Company shall forthwith upon
request furnish any Holder (x) a written statement by the Company as to
whether it has complied with such requirements and, if not, the specifics
thereof, (y) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the
Company and (z) such other reports and documents filed by the Company with the
SEC as such Holder may reasonably request in availing itself of an exemption
for the offering and Sale of Registrable Securities without registration under
the Securities Act.

 

Section 2.12.

 

 _Registration Rights Covenant_.

 

The Company covenants that it will not, and it will cause the members of the
Company Group not to, grant any right of registration under the Securities Act
relating to any of its Company Shares or other securities to any Person other
than pursuant to this Agreement, unless the rights so granted to another
Person do not limit or restrict the rights of the Holder(s) hereunder or are
not in any way senior to the rights of the Holder(s) hereunder.

jurisdiction or general consent to service of process in the State of New York
for any purpose except with respect to any Dispute.

 

(c)

 

EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE
HEREUNDER IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE

would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions hereof were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached and that any defense in any action for specific
performance that a remedy at law would be adequate is hereby waived. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches hereof and to enforce

be enforced against a Holder.

 

Section 3.07.

 

 _Waiver of Default_.

 

Waiver by any party of any default by the other party of any provision of this
Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver by the waiving party of any subsequent
or other default, nor shall it prejudice the rights of such party. No failure
or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this
Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall a single or partial
exercise thereof prejudice any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

 _Rights related to shares_

 

§ 5 Special appointment procedure of members of the board of directors (Fi:
_Hallituksen j asenten erityinen asettamisjarjestys_)

 

(a) Terex Corporation ("Theta") or such other member of Theta Group (as
defined in section 22) as is designated by Theta by notice in writing to the
company (the "Theta Designating Person"), shall have the right, subject to
section 5(c), upon written notice to the company, to appoint members to the
companys board of directors (any such member of the companys board of
directors appointed pursuant to this section 5(a) or pursuant to section 5(b),
a "Theta Designee") as follows:

 

i.

 

two (2) Theta Designees, if Theta Groups ownership of the company\'s Class B
shares represents fifteen per cent (15 %) or more of the number of all shares
(Class A and Class B) of the company excluding such shares owned by the
company or its subsidiaries (the "Company Shares");

 

ii.

 

one (1) Theta Designee, if Theta Group\'s ownership of the company\'s Class B
shares represents ten per cent (10 %) or more but less than fifteen per cent
(15 %) of the number of Company Shares;

 

iii.

 

no Theta Designees, if Theta Group\'s ownership of the company\'s Class B
shares represents less than ten per cent (10 %) of the number of Company
Shares; and

 

iv.

 

no Theta Designees, if (A) a Theta Change of Control (as defined below in
section 22) has occurred, or (B) if Theta Group ceases to own in excess of
fifty per cent (50 %) of all outstanding Class B shares as a result of an
entity within Theta Group which owns Company Shares ceasing to be a part of
Theta Group, and Theta not having reconveyed (or caused the reconveyance of)
such Company Shares to itself or another member of Theta Group immediately
before such entity has ceased to be a part of Theta Group or within ten (10)
Business Days (as defined in section 22) thereafter.

 

(b) The Theta Designating Person shall have the right, upon written notice to
the company, (i) to remove any Theta Designee then serving as a member of the
board of directors, and (ii) subject to section 5(c), to appoint a new Theta
Designee to replace any Theta Designee who (A) is unable to serve as a member
of the board of directors for any reason, or (B) is removed (upon death,
resignation, at the election of the Theta Designating Person pursuant to the
foregoing section 5(b)(i) or otherwise).

 

(c) At least ten (10) Business Days prior to submitting any notice to appoint
a Theta Designee, the Theta Designating Person shall (other than with respect
to an Approved Theta Designee (as defined in this section below)) (i) notify
the company of the name of the potential Theta Designee who shall be presented
to the company by the Theta Designating Person in good faith, (ii) provide, or
cause such Theta Designee to provide, to the company his or her curriculum
vitae and a completed director\'s and officer\'s questionnaire, which shall be
signed by the potential Shareholder Designee, in the form then used by the
members of the board of directors not appointed by Theta (such information in
clauses (i) and (ii), the "Theta Designee Information"), and (iii) consult
with the company and consider in good faith any reasonable objections raised
by the company regarding the potential Theta Designee. "Approved Theta
Designee" means (i) any individual approved by the company and Theta from time
to time, and (ii) any Theta Designee previously appointed to the companys
board of directors in the five (5) years preceding the notice contemplated by
the prior sentence.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the Theta Designating Person\'s appointment rights in
section 5(a) and section 5(b), the Theta Designating Person shall not be
permitted to appoint as Theta Designee any individual who would be prohibited
or disqualified from serving as a member of the board of directors pursuant to
any applicable rule or regulation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ Helsinki Ltd, or pursuant to
the Finnish Companies Act. The Theta Designees shall not be required to be
"independent" of Theta under the Finnish Corporate Governance Code.

 



 


  

 



  2 (7)

 



 

(e) The appointment of the Theta Designee to the companys board of directors
shall be effective upon receipt of the written notice of appointment sent by
the Theta Designating Person to the company pursuant to section 5(a) or
section 5(b), as applicable, and the company and the board of directors shall
take all actions necessary to cause the registration with the Finnish Trade
Register of each Theta Designee as promptly as practicable.

 

(f) Subject to section 6, if (i) Theta Group\'s ownership falls below an
Ownership Threshold specified in section 5(a) or (ii) in the event of a Theta
Change of Control, then the Theta Designating Person shall promptly (and in
any event within two (2) Business Days) cause such number of the Theta
Designees then serving on the board of directors to resign from the board of
directors (such resigning Theta Designees to be selected at the Theta
Designating Person\'s sole discretion) as is necessary so that the remaining
number of the Theta Designees then serving on the board of directors is less
than or equal to the number of Theta Designees that the Theta Designating
Person is then entitled to appoint to the board of directors pursuant to
section 5(a). If the Theta Designating Person is obligated in accordance with
this section 5(f) to cause the resignation of one or more Theta Designees but
such resignation has not taken place, the general meeting of shareholders may,
with the majority of the votes cast, remove such Theta Designees or one of
them from the board of directors.

 

§ 6 Top-up rights

 

(a) If the company causes an action, event or other circumstance to occur that
results in Theta Group\'s ownership of Company Shares to fall below any
Ownership Threshold (as defined in section 22) (a "Threshold Dilution Event")
and such Threshold Dilution Event did not result from a Transfer by Theta
Group of Company Shares (excluding for the avoidance of doubt any Transfers
constituting a Conversion Event referred to in sections 20(a)(i)-(vi) that do
not reduce Theta Groups ownership of Company Shares) or Theta Group\'s
failure to exercise its rights pursuant to section 7, then, following the
Threshold Dilution Event, Theta Group or the Theta Designating Person, on
prior written notice to the company that it intends to restore its ownership
of Company Shares to the applicable Ownership Threshold within the Initial
Top-Up Period, shall be entitled to defer the applicable members resignation
from the board of directors, until the date that is three (3) months (the
"Initial Top-Up Period") after the date upon which Theta Group first fell
below the applicable Ownership Threshold (the "Top-Up Right"); provided that
to the extent that Theta Group or the Theta Designees are subject to blackout
restrictions implemented by the company or otherwise restricted from making
open market purchases by applicable securities laws with respect to the
Company Shares resulting in fewer than thirty (30) trading days exempt from
such restrictions in such three (3)-month period, then such three (3)-month
period shall be extended for an additional three (3) months (the "Extension
Top-Up Period"), provided further, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, any rights granted under these articles of association to
Theta, the Theta Group or the Theta Designating Person which are dependent on
the Theta Designating Person having the right to appoint a certain number of
Theta Designees shall not be lost until the expiration of any Extension Top-Up
Period or, if no such Extension Top-Up occurs, the Initial Top-Up Period, in
each case, as applicable for the relevant Threshold Dilution Event.

 

(b) If Theta Group delivers written notice to the company pursuant to section
6(a) that it intends to exercise the Top-Up Right in respect of a Threshold
Dilution Event, in the event that the company issues Company Shares (including
shares owned by the company or its Subsidiaries) in a B-Diluting Issue (as
defined in section 7), Theta Group shall be deemed not to have fallen below
any Ownership Threshold during the period from the date of receipt by Theta
Group of the applicable B-Diluting Issue Notice (as defined in section 7)
until six (6) months following the date of receipt of the B-Diluting Issue
Notice.

 

§ 7 Preemptive Rights

 

(a) In accordance with the Finnish Companies Act, Theta Group shall be granted
preemptive rights with respect to its Class B Shares to the extent that
preemptive rights are granted to the owners of Company Shares, and Theta Group
shall be permitted to exercise such preemptive rights as permitted under the
Finnish Companies Act.

 

(b) If the company proposes to issue any Company Shares (including shares
owned by the company or its Subsidiaries) in a directed issue where preemptive
rights are not afforded to the owners of Class B shares (a "B-Diluting
Issue"), the company shall give notice (a "B-Diluting Issue Notice") to Theta
Group of any B-Diluting Issue on each of (w) the date that the company issues
Company Shares (including shares owned by the company or its Subsidiaries) in
a B-Diluting Issue if such issuance, together with any prior B-Diluting Issue
of which Theta Group has not previously been notified, exceeds one percent
(1%) of the total number of Company Shares outstanding on a fully diluted
basis, (x) the tenth (10th) trading day prior to the record date for any
general meeting of shareholders of the company, (y) the six (6)-month
anniversary of each record date for the company\'s annual general meeting of
shareholders and (z) any other date specified by the members of the board of
directors not appointed by Theta.

 

§ 8 Committees

 

For so long as the Theta Designating Person has the right to appoint a Theta
Designee under section 5(a), the board of directors shall cause the
appointment of at least one (1) Theta Designee (in each case as selected by
the Theta Designating Person) to each of the committees of the board of
directors (excluding any ad-hoc or special committee established primarily for
the purpose of evaluating any potential acquisition between the company and
any member of the Theta Group and where the members of the board of directors
not appointed by Theta reasonably determine that the Theta Designee would have
actual or potential conflict-of-interest (in Finnish: _intressij aavi_) when
participating in such ad hoc or special committee as a result of his or her
relationship with Theta Group). In the event of a vacancy on any committee
caused by the replacement or inability to serve of the Theta Designee then
serving as a member of such committee, the Theta Designating Person shall have
the right to demand that the replacement Theta Designee or any other Theta
Designee be appointed to fill such committee vacancy.

  



  3 (7)

 



 

§ 9 Expenses, compensation and indemnification of Theta Designees

 

Each Theta Designee appointed to the board of directors shall be entitled to
the same compensation (including equity compensation) and other benefits as
well as to expense reimbursements on the same grounds as the other members of
the board of directors. Furthermore, each Theta Designee shall be entitled to
the same liability insurance and indemnity protection, including right to
advancement of fees and expenses, as the other members of the board of
directors, with the exception that each Theta Designee\'s liability insurance
shall include insurance for liabilities under U.S. securities laws.

 

§ 10 Voting rights

 

(a) Each Class A share shall carry one (1) vote. Each Class B share shall
carry one (1) vote, provided, however, that the Class B shares shall not carry
any voting rights (i) after a Theta Change of Control has occurred, (ii) if
Theta Group ceases to own in excess of fifty per cent (50 %) of all
outstanding Class B shares as a result of an entity within Theta Group which
owns Company Shares ceasing to be a part of Theta Group, and Theta not having
reconveyed (or caused the reconveyance of) such Company Shares to itself or
another member of Theta Group immediately before such entity has ceased to be
a part of Theta Group or within ten (10) Business Days thereafter, or (iii) in
any of the following matters: (A) the appointment or removal of members of the
board of directors other than Theta Designees; (B) an increase or decrease in
the size of the board of directors up to the maximum size specified in these
articles of association; (C) the compensation of members of the board of
directors; (D) discharge from liability of the Theta Designees; (E) issuances
by the Company of Company Shares (including shares owned by the company or its
Subsidiaries) where pre-emptive rights are available to Theta Group in
accordance with the Finnish Companies Act; and (F) the approval of Transfers
by Theta Group representing five per cent (5 %) or more of the then
outstanding Company Shares as described in section 20(a)(v).

 

(b) Without the consent of Theta, the company shall not take any action, or
authorize, resolve, agree or commit to take any action, that would result in
Theta Group Beneficially Owning (as defined in section 22) more than the
maximum amount of voting securities of the company that a Person may hold
without being required under the Finnish Securities Market Act to make a
mandatory takeover offer to the company\'s shareholders.

 

§ 11 Dividend rights

 

Each Class A share and Class B share carries equal rights to dividends and to
other distributions of assets.

 

 _Management of the company and the annual general meeting_

 

§ 12 Board of Directors and term of office

 

The company has a board of directors consisting of no less than five (5) and
no more than ten (10) director members.

 

The term of office of the members of the board of directors other than the
Theta Designees expires at the end of the first annual general meeting of

giving effect to such Transfer; or

 

vii.

 

when the aggregate amount of Class B shares constitutes less than five per
cent (5 %) of the Company Shares.

 

(b) Upon a Conversion Event, the owner of Class B shares has the right to
demand conversion by making a written conversion demand ("Conversion Demand")
to the companys board of directors setting out (i) the Conversion Event in
such reasonable detail as to enable the board of directors to assess whether a
Conversion Event entitling such owner of Class B shares to demand conversion
is at hand or will be at hand within a reasonable period of time (having
regard to the type of Conversion Event), it being understood that, without
limitation, the passing of any relevant corporate resolution or the entering
into any binding agreement to effect or approve any Conversion Event shall
always be deemed sufficient for such purpose; (ii) the number of Class B
shares to be converted and (iii) such information regarding the account in
which the relevant Class B shares are held in the book-entry system as is
necessary to enable to company to effect the conversion.

 

(c) The companys board of directors shall effect the conversion and notify
the Trade Register of the changes in the number of shares in the share classes
as soon as practically possible and no later than within fourteen (14) days
from having received a Conversion Demand, provided, however, that

 

i.

 

if it is reasonably apparent that the completion of the relevant Conversion
Event would occur later than ten (10) Business Days after the completion of
the conversion, then the companys board of directors may, after having
consulted with the relevant owner of the Class B shares, delay effecting the
conversion until such date that is ten (10) Business Days before the
anticipated date of the completion of the relevant Conversion Event; and

 

ii.

 

if it is reasonably apparent that there would occur a record date for voting
at any general meeting of shareholders (Fi: _yhti okokouksen tasmaytyspaiva_)
between the date when the conversion is effected and the date of the
completion of the relevant Conversion Event, then the companys board of
directors may, after having consulted with the relevant owner of the Class B
shares, delay effecting the conversion until, and shall effect the conversion
as soon as possible, after such record date.

 

The company may request that a note restricting the shareholder\'s right to
Transfer the Company Shares on the relevant book-entry account prior to the
completion of the relevant Conversion Event shall be entered in the book-entry
account of the shareholder, it being understood that the Transfer completing
the Conversion Event is to be permitted.

 

(d) A Class B share is converted into a Class A share on a one-to-one (1:1)
conversion ratio.

 

(e) A Class B share shall be considered to have been converted into a Class A
share once the entry into the Trade Register has been made. The company shall
without delay notify the owner of Class B shares who has demanded conversion
and the book-entry register keeper that the conversion has been registered.

 

(f) If necessary, the companys board of directors shall provide further
instructions on the process of the conversion, provided that such instructions
are not prejudicial to the rights of Theta Group or owners of Class B shares.

shares received or acquired by Theta Group shall be converted into Class B

Class A shares acquired by Theta Group, setting out the number of shares to be
converted and such information regarding the account in which the relevant
Company Shares are held in the book-entry system as is necessary to enable to
company to effect the conversion (a "Class A Share Conversion Notice").

 

(c) The companys board of directors shall carry out the conversion and notify
the Trade Register of the changes in the number of shares in the share classes
as soon as practically possible and no later than within fourteen (14) days
from having received a Class A Share Conversion Notice. The company may
request that a note restricting the shareholder\'s right to Transfer Class A
shares prior to completion of the conversion thereof into Class B shares shall
be entered in the book-entry account of the shareholder.

  



  6 (7)

 



 

(d) The company has an independent right, regardless of whether a Class A
Share Conversion Notice has been made in accordance with section 21(b), to
convert into Class B shares any Class A shares acquired by Theta Group.
Further, if Theta Group has come to own Class A shares as a result of a
conversion of Class B shares pursuant to section 20, and it becomes reasonably
apparent that the completion of the relevant Conversion Event will not occur
within the next thirty (30) days, then the companys board of directors has
the right (after having consulted with Theta) to convert into Class B shares
any Class A shares so held by Theta Group, and Theta shall have a
corresponding right to demand such conversion.

 

(e) A Class A share is converted into a Class B share on a one-to-one (1:1)
conversion ratio.

 

(f) A Class A share shall be considered to have been converted into a Class B
