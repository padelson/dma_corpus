such holder elects to convert all or any number of such holder&rsquo;s shares of Series&nbsp;A Non-Voting Preferred Stock and,

the certificate or certificates for such shares of Series&nbsp;A Non-Voting Preferred Stock (or, if such registered holder alleges
that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the
