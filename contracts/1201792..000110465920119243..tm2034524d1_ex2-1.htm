and shall be bound by, the Closing Statement and the calculation of the
Closing Working Capital Amount, the Working Capital Surplus Amount, the
Working Capital Shortfall Amount, the Closing Cash Amount, the Closing Debt
Amount and the aggregate amount of Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses set
forth therein, unless Seller shall have provided Purchaser with a written
notice of Seller's disagreement with the Closing Statement prior to the
expiration of the Objection Period (the  " _Objection Notice_ ") that (i)
specifies each disputed item (a " _Disputed Item_ ") and Seller's calculation
of such Disputed Item and (ii) sets forth in reasonable detail the basis for
each such dispute (it being understood that Seller shall be deemed to have
accepted, and shall be bound by, Purchaser's calculation of each item included
in the Closing Statement that Seller has not identified as a Disputed Item in
the Objection Notice). Purchaser shall have 30 days from the date on which it
receives the Objection Notice (such 30-day period, the " _Response Period_ ")
to review and respond to the Objection Notice. If Purchaser and Seller are
able to negotiate a mutually agreeable resolution of each Disputed Item, the
Closing Statement and the calculation of the Closing Working Capital Amount,
the Working Capital Surplus Amount, the Working Capital Shortfall Amount, the
Closing Cash Amount, the Closing Debt Amount and the aggregate amount of
Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses set forth therein, as adjusted to reflect
such resolution, shall be deemed final, non-appealable and binding for all
purposes under this Agreement. If any Disputed Item has not been resolved
during the Response Period or any mutually agreed extension thereof, either
Purchaser or Seller may refer such Disputed Item to the public accounting firm
of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or another independent, mutually agreeable,
nationally recognized public accounting firm (the " _Accounting Referee_ ")
who accepts its appointment within seven days after such referral, to make a
final, non-appealable and binding determination as to any such remaining
Disputed Item pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The Accounting Referee
shall be directed to make a determination of each Disputed Item in accordance
with _Section 1.6(c)_ promptly, but no later than 30 days, after
acceptance of its appointment. Purchaser and Seller agree to use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to effect the selection and
appointment of the Accounting Referee pursuant to this _Section 1.6(b)_,
including executing an engagement agreement with the Accounting Referee
consistent with the provisions of this _Section 1.6_ and providing for
reasonable and customary compensation for the Accounting Referee.

(c) _Dispute Resolution_.

  



  

(i) If any Disputed Item is referred to the Accounting Referee
for resolution pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_, the Accounting Referee shall
determine only with respect to such Disputed Item submitted whether such
Disputed Item as set forth in the Closing Statement requires adjustment and
the amount of any such required adjustment. The Accounting Referee shall not
have the power to alter, amend or otherwise affect any provision of this
Agreement. Purchaser and Seller shall be entitled to submit presentations and
other documentation to support their respective calculations of each such
Disputed Item to the Accounting Referee and shall instruct the
Accounting Referee to, and the Accounting Referee shall, act as an expert and
not as an arbitrator and make its determination based solely on such
documentation and presentations submitted by Seller and Purchaser to the
Accounting Referee in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth
in this Agreement, and not on the basis of an independent review. Purchaser
and Seller shall provide the other party with a copy of all materials
submitted to the Accounting Referee pursuant to this _Section 1.6(c)_
concurrently with the submission of such materials to the Accounting Referee.
Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall participate in any _ex parte _
communications with the Accounting Referee. With respect to each submitted
Disputed Item, the Accounting Referee's determination shall be within the
range of values assigned to such Disputed Item in the Closing Statement and
the Objection Notice, respectively. Any finding by the Accounting Referee
shall be final, non-appealable and binding upon Seller and Purchaser. Seller
and Purchaser shall instruct the Accounting Referee that any finding by the
Accounting Referee shall be: (A) a reasoned award stating in reasonable
detail the findings of fact on which it is based; and (B) accompanied by a
certificate from the Accounting Referee certifying that it reached such
findings in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 1.6_.

  



  

(ii) The Expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be borne by
Purchaser and Seller in the same proportion that the aggregate dollar
amount of the Disputed Items that are not resolved in favor of Purchaser or
Seller, as applicable, bears to the total dollar amount of Disputed Items
resolved by the Accounting Referee. Each of Purchaser and Seller shall bear
the Expenses of its own Representatives in connection with the matters
contemplated by this _Section 1.6_.

  



  

(d) _Adjustment_. If, upon the final determination of the Closing
Working Capital Amount, the Working Capital Surplus Amount, the Working
Capital Shortfall Amount, the Closing Cash Amount, the Closing Debt Amount
and the aggregate amount of Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses as provided
in _Section 1.6(b)_ or _Section 1.6(c)_:

  



  

(i) the Estimated Adjustment Amount exceeds the Final Adjustment
Amount (the amount of any such excess, the " _Downwards Adjustment Amount_
"), then Purchaser and Seller shall, within five Business Days following such
determination, instruct the Escrow Agent to (A) pay the Downwards Adjustment
Amount to Purchaser from the Adjustment Escrow Fund, and (B) release any
amounts remaining in the Adjustment Escrow Fund to Seller, _provided,
however_ , that if the amount available in the Adjustment Escrow Fund is
insufficient to cover the full Downwards Adjustment Amount, then (1) Purchaser
and Seller shall, within five Business Days following such determination,
instruct the Escrow Agent to release to Purchaser the full amount remaining in
the Adjustment Escrow Fund, and (2) Seller shall, within five Business Days
following such determination, pay the difference of the Downward Adjustment
Amount _minus_ such amount then available in the Adjustment Escrow Fund to
Purchaser;

  



  

   

6

 

CONFIDENTIAL

    



  

(ii) the Final Adjustment Amount exceeds the Estimated Adjustment
Amount (the amount of any such excess, the " _Upwards Adjustment Amount_ "),
then (A) Purchaser shall, within five Business Days following such final
determination, pay to Seller an amount equal to the Upwards Adjustment
Amount, and (B) Purchaser and Seller shall, within five Business Days
following such determination, instruct the Escrow Agent to release all
amounts held in the Adjustment Escrow Fund to Seller; or

  



  

(iii) the Final Adjustment Amount is equal to the Estimated
Adjustment Amount, then (A) no payment shall be required to be made
pursuant to this _Section 1.6(d)_, and (B) Purchaser and Seller shall,
within five Business Days following such determination, instruct the Escrow
Agent to release all amounts held in the Adjustment Escrow Fund to Seller.

  



  

Any payment required to be made pursuant to _Section 1.6(d)_ shall be made:
(x) if no Objection Notice is provided to Purchaser by Seller during the
Objection Period, within five Business Days following the expiration of the
Objection Period; or (y) if Seller submits an Objection Notice during the
Objection Period, within five Business Days following the final
determination of the Closing Working Capital Amount, the Working Capital
Surplus Amount, the Working Capital Shortfall Amount, the Closing
Cash Amount, the Closing Debt Amount and the aggregate amount of Unpaid
Company Transaction Expenses as provided in _Section 1.6(b)_ or  _Section
1.6(c)_. To the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, any payment
made pursuant to this _Section 1.6_ shall be treated by all parties to this
Agreement as an adjustment to the aggregate consideration paid in the
Membership Interest Purchase.

  



  

1.7 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Purchaser, the Escrow Agent and any other
withholding agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to
be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Legal Requirements. Other than from any amounts which
are treated as compensation or deductions or withholdings made pursuant to
Section 1445 of the Code if Seller does not provide the certificate
referenced in _Section 1.4(a)(vi)_, the Purchaser shall be required to
notify Seller within five days prior to the Closing Date of any obligation it
or any other withholding agent has to withhold taxes under this Agreement and
the Purchaser shall cooperate with the Seller to reduce any such withholding
tax obligations. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and
properly remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

  



  

1.8 _Allocation of Assets and Liabilities_. For U.S. federal
income Tax purposes, Purchaser and Seller shall treat the purchase and sale
of all of the Membership Interests pursuant to this Agreement as a purchase
and sale of the assets of the Acquired Companies in exchange for the
Transaction Consideration Amount and the assumption of liabilities of the
Acquired Companies. Accordingly, within 90 days after the Closing Date,
Purchaser and Seller shall jointly prepare an allocation of the Transaction
Consideration Amount (plus such assumed liabilities, to the extent properly
taken into account under the Code) and any other consideration payable to
Seller pursuant to this Agreement among the assets of the Company in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code, the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder (and any similar provision of any state,
local or foreign Legal Requirement, as appropriate), and the methodology set
forth on _Schedule 1.8_ (the " _Allocation Schedule_ "). If the Allocation
Schedule needs to be updated to reflect adjustments to the Transaction
Consideration Amount pursuant to _Section 1.6_, such adjustments shall
be made in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this _Section 1.8_.
All income Tax Returns (including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) filed
by Purchaser and Seller shall be prepared consistently with the Allocation
Schedule. Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall, nor shall they permit their
respective Affiliates to, file any Tax Return or other document with, or make
any statement or declaration to, any Governmental Entity that is inconsistent
with the Allocation Schedule, as it may be adjusted in accordance with this
_Section 1.8_, except, in each case, as otherwise required by a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

(b) _Charter Documents_. Each Acquired Company has Made Available
to Purchaser accurate and complete copies of its Charter Documents,

statements (consisting of balance sheets, statements of income, statements of
changes in members' equity and statements of cash flows, including the
footnotes thereto, for the relevant 12-month periods) of the Acquired
Companies, on a consolidated basis, as of September 30, 2018, September 30,
2019 and September 30, 2020 (collectively, the " _Financial Statements_ ", and
the financial statements as of September 30, 2020, the " _Latest Financial
Statements_ "). The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods covered and in
accordance with each Acquired Company's historic past practice. The Financial
Statements fairly present in all material respects the financial
position, results of operations, changes in members' equity and cash flows of
the Acquired Companies as of the dates, and for the periods, indicated
therein. The Acquired Companies maintain a standard system of accounting
established and administered in accordance with GAAP including complete books
and records in written or electronic form. Except as set forth in _Section
3.5(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, since October 1, 2017, no Acquired
Company has changed its methods of accounting, accounting
principles, accounting practices, collection practices or credit policy in
any material respect except as required by GAAP.

  



  

   

11

 

CONFIDENTIAL

    



   



  

(b) _Internal Controls_. The Acquired Companies maintain a system
of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management's
general or specific authorizations; (ii) transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP (applied consistently with the Financial Statements) and to maintain
asset accountability; (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance
with management's general or specific authorization; (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences; and (v) submissions to Governmental Entities, Education Agencies
and in connection with Title IV Programs are accurate and complete in all
material respects. There are no significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses in the design or operation of the Acquired Companies' internal
controls over financial or regulatory reporting that could reasonably be
expected to adversely affect any Acquired Company's ability to record,
process, summarize or report financial information to any Acquired Company's
management and board of directors or to Governmental Entities or Education
Agencies. There is not, and there has not been, any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves or involved any member of management or any other
employee who has or had a significant role in the Acquired Companies' internal
control over financial or regulatory reporting. The Acquired Companies'
internal control over financial or regulatory reporting is effective.

  



  

(c) _Accounts Receivable_. All of the accounts receivable of each
Acquired Company arose in the ordinary course of business, are carried on the
records of each Acquired Company at values determined in accordance with GAAP
(applied consistently with the Financial Statements) and are bona fide
receivables incurred in the ordinary course. No Person has any Lien (other
than a Permitted Lien) on any of such accounts receivable, and no request or
agreement for deduction or discount has been made with respect to any of such
accounts receivable except as fully and adequately reflected in reserves for
doubtful accounts set forth in the Latest Financial Statements (the "
_Most Recent Balance Sheet_ ").

  



  

(d) _Insider Receivables_. _Section 3.5(d)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule provides an accurate and complete list of all Insider Receivables as
of the date of this Agreement. There will be no outstanding Insider
Receivables as of the Closing.

  



  

3.6 _No Liabilities; Indebtedness_.

  



  

(a) _Absence of Liabilities_. No Acquired Company has Liability of
any nature, other than: (i) liabilities identified as such in the 
"liabilities" column of the Most Recent Balance Sheet; (ii) liabilities
incurred subsequent to the date of the Most Recent Balance Sheet in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practices of such Acquired
Company; (iii) obligations that (A) exist under Company Contracts, (B) are
expressly set forth in and identifiable by reference to the text of
such Company Contracts and (C) are not required to be identified as
liabilities in a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP; (iv)
liabilities under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document; and (v)
any liabilities described in _Section 3.6(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

(b) _Indebtedness_.  _Section 3.6(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule
sets forth an accurate and complete list of all Company Indebtedness as of
the date of this Agreement, identifying the name of the creditor or creditors
to which such Indebtedness is owed, the type of instrument under which such
Indebtedness is evidenced or the agreement under which such Indebtedness was
incurred and the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness as of the
close of business on the date of this Agreement. Except as set forth on
_Section 3.6(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, no Acquired Company has
incurred any Indebtedness under the Paycheck Protection Program administered
by the U.S. Small Business Administration. No Acquired Company is in default
with respect to any Company Indebtedness and no payment with respect to any
Company Indebtedness is past due. No Acquired Company has received any notice
of a default, alleged failure to perform or any offset or counterclaim with
respect to any Company Indebtedness. Neither the consummation of any of the
Contemplated Transactions nor the execution, delivery or performance of any
Transaction Document will, or would reasonably be expected to, cause or
result in a default, breach or acceleration, automatic or otherwise, of any
condition, covenant or other term of any Company Indebtedness. No Acquired
Company has guaranteed or otherwise become liable for any Indebtedness or
other obligation of any other Person.

CONFIDENTIAL

    



  

(c) _Manager and Officer Indemnification; Claims by
Securityholders_. No event has occurred, and no circumstance or condition
exists, that has resulted in, or that will or would reasonably be expected to
result in, any claim for indemnification, reimbursement or contribution by,
or the advancement of any expense to, any Company Associate (other than a
claim for reimbursement from an Acquired Company of immaterial travel
expenses incurred by such Company Associate in the course of performing such
Company Associate's duties for an Acquired Company) or any member of an
Acquired Company pursuant to: (i) any term of any of the Charter Documents
of any Acquired Company; (ii) any indemnification agreement or other Contract
between any Acquired Company and any such Company Associate or member; or
(iii) any applicable Legal Requirement. No event has occurred, and no
circumstance or condition exists, that has resulted in, or that will or would
reasonably be expected to result in, any Acquired Company incurring any
Liability to, or any basis for any claim against any Acquired Company by, any
current, former or alleged holder of membership interests, profits interests
or other securities of any Acquired Company.

  



  

3.7 _Taxes_.

  



  

(a) All income and other material Tax Returns required to be filed
by or with respect to any Acquired Company have been duly and timely filed
with the appropriate Taxing Authority and each such Tax Return is true,
correct and complete in all material respects. All Taxes owed by each
Acquired Company, whether or not shown on a Tax Return, have been timely paid
in full. There are no Liens (other than Liens for Taxes not yet due and
payable) on any assets of any Acquired Company that arose in connection with
any failure (or alleged failure) to pay any Tax.

  



  

(b) No assessment, deficiency or adjustment has been asserted,
proposed or threatened in writing with respect to any Tax Return of or with
respect to any Acquired Company, other than those disclosed in _Section
3.7(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule. No Tax audit or administrative or
judicial proceeding is being conducted, is pending or has been threatened in
writing with respect to any Acquired Company, other than those disclosed in
_Section 3.7(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule. No written claim has ever been
made by any Taxing Authority in a jurisdiction where any Acquired Company does
not file Tax Returns that any Acquired Company is or may be subject to

the legal, valid and binding obligations of Purchaser and, to the knowledge
of Purchaser, the respective Financing Sources, fully and specifically

relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to
general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding at equity or
law)), and, as of the date hereof, Purchaser knows of no fact or circumstance
that would cause the Debt Financing to be unavailable on a timely basis in
order to consummate the Membership Interest Purchase and the other
transactions contemplated hereby if the conditions set forth in _Section 7_
hereof are satisfied. There are no other agreements, side letters or
arrangements to which Purchaser is a party relating to the Debt
Commitment Letters that could in any manner affect the availability of the
full amount of the Debt Financing if the terms or conditions to be satisfied
by it contained in the Debt Commitment Letters are satisfied. As of the date

or modified and no such amendment or modification is contemplated except in

Purchaser, are sufficient (after netting out applicable fees, expenses,
original issue discount and similar premiums and charges and after
giving effect to the maximum amount of "flex" (including original issue
discount "flex") provided under the Debt Commitment Letters) to enable
Purchaser to (i) consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents upon the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, as the case may be, (ii)
pay all of the Closing Cash Consideration pursuant to this Agreement and
(iii) pay all related fees and expenses associated with the transactions

conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the
full amount of the Debt Financing (both before and after giving effect to any

become a default) by Purchaser under the Debt Commitment Letters nor, to the
knowledge of Purchaser, a default or breach on the part of any other party to
the Debt Commitment Letters. As of the date hereof, Purchaser does not have

not be timely satisfied or that the Debt Financing will not be available to
Purchaser on the Closing Date in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the Debt Commitment Letters. As of the date of this Agreement, Purchaser
is not aware of any fact or occurrence that would reasonably be expected to

"Debt Commitment Letters" will include such documents as amended or
modified in compliance with the provisions of _Sections 6.5(a)_ and _(b)_
and (ii) the "Debt Financing" will include the financing contemplated by the

any obligation to approve any such matter). During the Pre-Closing Period,
Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller in writing of any event, condition,
fact or circumstance of which Purchaser obtains knowledge or otherwise
becomes aware of that would reasonably be expected to make the timely
satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in _Section 8_ impossible or
unlikely; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser's failure to notify Seller

upon execution thereof, in each case, to the extent entered into prior to the
Closing (which, for the avoidance of doubt, may be redacted in respect of fee
amounts and the financial terms that do not affect the conditionality of the
Financing).

  



  

(b) Unless the Debt Commitment Letters have been terminated in
accordance with _Section 6.5(g)_ below, Purchaser shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the
Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment
Letters ( _provided_  that Purchaser may amend any Debt Commitment Letter to
add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities who had not executed such Debt Commitment Letter as of the
date hereof), including using commercially reasonable efforts to (i) maintain
in effect the Debt Commitment Letters, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Purchaser to obtaining the Debt Financing at the
Closing set forth therein, (iii) enter into definitive agreements with respect
thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters (and provide final copies thereof (which, in the case of Fee Letters,
may be customarily redacted) to Seller), (iv) enforce its rights under the
Debt Commitment Letters and (v) upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letters, consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to
the Closing, including by causing the Financing Sources to fund the Debt
Financing on the Closing Date, in each case in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and the Debt Commitment Letters. Purchaser will fully pay, or
cause to be fully paid, all commitment or other fees arising pursuant to the
Debt Commitment Letters as and when they become due.

CONFIDENTIAL

    



  

(c) Unless the Debt Commitment Letters have been terminated in
accordance with _Section 6.5(g)_ below, in the event any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in any
Debt Commitment Letter, Purchaser shall (i) promptly notify Seller thereof
including the reasons therefor and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain alternative debt financing from alternative sources in an amount
sufficient, together with any unrestricted cash available to Purchaser, to
make the Closing Payments. Purchaser shall promptly deliver to Seller true and
complete copies of all agreements pursuant to which any such alternative debt
financing shall be obtained (the " _New Debt Commitment Letter_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no New Debt Commitment Letter may expand upon
the conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding of the
Debt Financing on the Closing Date as set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letters in effect on the date hereof or otherwise include terms (including
any "flex" provisions) that would reasonably be expected to make the
likelihood that the such alternative debt financing would be funded less
likely in any material respect. In the event that any New Debt Commitment
Letter is obtained in accordance with the foregoing, (i) any reference in
this Agreement to the "Debt Commitment Letters" will be deemed to include the
Debt Commitment Letter to the extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment
Letter at the time in question and any New Debt Commitment Letter to the
extent then in effect, and (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the
"Debt Financing" includes the debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters as modified pursuant to the foregoing.

  



  

(d) Purchaser shall keep Seller reasonably informed, in reasonable
detail on a reasonably current basis of all material activity concerning
the Debt Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller (i) of any breach (or threatened
breach in writing) or default (or any event or circumstance that, with notice
or lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any
breach or default) by Purchaser or any other party of which Purchaser becomes
aware to the Debt Commitment Letters or definitive agreements related to the
Debt Financing, (ii) of any dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to a Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements with respect
to the obligation to fund the Debt Financing or the amount of the Debt
Financing to be funded at the Closing, (iii) of the receipt by Purchaser of
any written notice or communication from any Financing Source with respect to
any of the items described in clauses (i) or (ii) above, (iv) of the
termination or expiration prior to Closing of the Debt Commitment Letters or
definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing and (v) if for any reason
Purchaser at any time believes that it will not be able to obtain all or any
portion of the Debt Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters or any definitive
agreements related to the Debt Financing. Purchaser shall provide any
information reasonably requested by Seller relating to any of the
circumstances referred to in the previous sentence as soon as reasonably
practical (but in any event within two Business Days) after the date that
Seller delivers a written request therefor to Purchaser. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this _Section 6.5(d)_ shall require Purchaser to
disclose any information to Seller to the extent that doing so would
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
legal privilege applicable to such information or would violate any
confidentiality obligation to which Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is
subject.

  



  

(e) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, the Acquired
Companies and their respective Representatives from and against any and all
Damages sustained or incurred by any of them in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing or any Alternative Financing (including
actions taken at the request of Purchaser in accordance with _Section 5.8_)
and any information utilized in connection therewith, except to the extent
resulting from (i) the breach of this Agreement by Seller or any member of
the Acquired Companies or (ii) such Person's bad faith, gross negligence or
willful misconduct. Nothing contained in this  _Section 6.5_ or otherwise
shall require any of the Acquired Companies, as applicable, to be an issuer or
other obligor with respect to the Debt Financing prior to the Closing.
Purchaser shall, promptly upon written request by Seller, the
Acquired Companies and their respective Representatives, reimburse such
Persons for all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by
Seller prior to the Closing in connection with _Section 5.8_ (other than
Seller's obligation to deliver its annual and quarterly financial
statements).

CONFIDENTIAL

    



  

(f) Without limiting Purchaser's obligations pursuant to this
_Section 6.5_, Purchaser shall be entitled, as an alternative source of
financing, to pursue and enter into alternative or substitute financing,
including any offering of debt or equity securities or the entrance into any
credit facility, the proceeds of which are intended to be used to satisfy the
obligations under this Agreement, the terms of which may differ from the
terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters, but which will conform with
_Section 6.5(a)_ above. Provided that the terms of the financing
contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence conform with the
requirements of _Section 6.5(a)_ (including with respect to the commitment
and creditworthiness of the financing sources to be providing such financing),
Purchaser at Closing may substitute the proceeds of any such financing for
all or any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters by reducing commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter;
provided that, any such cash substitution or reduction shall not adversely
impact the effectiveness of the Debt Commitment Letter or otherwise cause a
breach thereof. To the extent otherwise in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement, no actions taken by Purchaser or its Affiliates or
Representatives in connection therewith shall in and of itself constitute a
breach of the obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement.

  



  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
_Section 6.5_, Purchaser shall be entitled to terminate the Debt
Commitment Letters, and/or reduce the commitment to provide financing
thereunder, to the extent that (i) prior to the date of such termination or
reduction, Purchaser deposits the proceeds of any equity or debt financing
consummated thereby following the date of this Agreement in an amount equal
to the amount of such reduction or, in the case of a termination, the entire
amount of the Term Loan B Facility (as defined under the Debt Commitment
Letter) then committed under the Debt Commitment Letters into an escrow
account with the Escrow Agent on terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory
to Seller, or (ii) Seller in its sole discretion otherwise consents to such
termination or reduction in writing.

  



  

6.6 _December Audited Financial Statements_. Promptly, and in no
event more than five Business Days following receipt by Seller or the Acquired
Companies of the December Audited Financial Statements, Seller shall deliver
to Purchaser a true and complete copy of the December Audited Financial
Statements.

  



  

6.7 _Certificate of Merger_. Immediately following the Closing, the
Company and Rasmussen College shall cause a certificate of merger in the form
of _Exhibit F_ (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged
and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, and shall
make all other filings or recordings required by the Delaware Limited
Liability Company Act to complete the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other time as Company
and Rasmussen College shall agree and shall specify in the Certificate of
Merger. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
neither Seller nor the Acquired Companies shall have any liability or
obligation under or in connection with the provisions of this _Section 6.7_.

CONFIDENTIAL

    



  

6.8 _Withdrawal of Member_. Seller and the Company shall take such
action as may be necessary to cause Seller to withdraw as a member of
the Company effective upon (and subject to the occurrence of) the Closing.

  



  

6.9 _R andW Insurance Policy_. During the term of the RandW Insurance
Policy, Purchaser (a) shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies and its
and their respective Affiliates, to maintain the RandW Insurance Policy in full
force and effect and (b) shall not, and shall not permit (i) any amendment,
repeal or modification of any provision of the RandW Insurance Policy
without Seller's prior written express consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, it being understood that it shall not be
unreasonable for Seller to withhold consent in the event that any such
amendment, repeal or modification would adversely affect the anti-subrogation
rights of the RandW Insurer against Seller, its Affiliates or any of their
respective indirect or direct members, partners, employees, directors,
agents, managers or other representatives in Seller's sole discretion), (ii)
to take any action or omit to take any action that would result in the
cancellation, termination, amendment or modification of the RandW Insurance
Policy or coverage thereunder other than by payment of claims thereunder, or
(iii) the assignment, substitution or transfer of the rights or obligations
of the RandW Insurer under the RandW Insurance Policy other than as allowed by
the terms of the RandW Insurance Policy.

adversely impact Nursing Programs enrolling more than 10% of students

any update of or modification to the Disclosure Schedule made or purported to

indemnify each of the Seller Indemnitees from and against, and shall

and that arise from or are a result of, or are connected with:

  



  

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty
made by Purchaser in this Agreement (without giving effect to any
materiality or similar qualification limiting the scope of such
representation or warranty) or the Purchaser Closing Certificate;

  



  

(ii) any breach of any covenant or obligation of Purchaser or, in
the case of any covenant or obligation to be performed after the Closing, the
Company in this Agreement; or

  



  

(iii) any Fraud by Purchaser.

  



  

10.3 _Limitations_.

  



  

(a) _Deductible_. Subject to _Section 10.3(b)_, Seller shall not
be required to make any indemnification payment pursuant to _Section
10.2(a)(i)_ for any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty
in this Agreement (other than the Seller Fundamental Representations) until
(i) the Damages incurred by the Purchaser Indemnitees with respect to the
matter giving rise to such inaccuracy or breach exceed $200,000 (the " _Mini-
Basket_ "), and (ii) such time as the total amount of all Damages (including
the Damages arising from such inaccuracy or breach and all other Damages
arising from any other inaccuracies or breaches of any representations or
warranties, but excluding all Damages that are not indemnifiable because they
do not exceed the Mini-Basket pursuant to the provisions of clause "(i)"
above) that have been sustained or incurred by any one or more of the
Purchaser Indemnitees, or to which any one or more of the Purchaser
Indemnitees have otherwise become subject, exceeds $1,233,750 (the "
_Deductible Amount_ ") in the aggregate. If the total amount of such Damages
exceeds the Deductible Amount, then the Purchaser Indemnitees shall be
entitled to be indemnified against and compensated and reimbursed for only the
portion of such Damages exceeding the Deductible Amount.

  



  

(b) _Applicability of Deductible_. The limitation set forth in
_Section 10.3(a)_ shall not apply to: (i) inaccuracies in or breaches of any
of the Seller Fundamental Representations; or (ii) any Other Indemnifiable
Matter.

  



  

(c) _Retention Escrow Amount Cap_. Subject to _Section 10.3(d)_
(and without limiting Purchaser's right to make any claim or obtain any
recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy), the total Liability of Seller to the
Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ (other than for any
inaccuracy in or breach of any Seller Fundamental Representations) shall be
limited to the Deductible Amount and shall be recoverable solely from the
proceeds then available in the Retention Escrow Fund.

  



  

   

65

 

CONFIDENTIAL

    



  

(d) _Applicability of Retention Escrow Amount Cap_. The limitation
set forth in _Section 10.3(c)_ shall not apply to (i) inaccuracies in or
breaches of any of the Fundamental Representations or (ii) any Other
Indemnifiable Matter.

  



  

(e) _Cap; Breach of Restrictive Covenants_. The total amount of
indemnification payments that Seller shall be required to make to
the Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_ shall be limited to
the aggregate dollar amount of the consideration paid to Seller pursuant to
_Section 1.2_ (after deduction of any applicable Taxes, but before any
contribution to the Escrow Funds). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement (but subject to _Section 10.3(f)_ and  _Section
10.11_), there shall be no limitation (whether under this _Section 10_ or
otherwise) on the amount payable by Seller in indemnification payments under
this Agreement for Fraud committed by any Acquired Company or Seller.

  



  

(f) _Source of Indemnification_. The Purchaser Indemnitees'
sources of payment for any claims made pursuant to this _Section 10_ shall
be satisfied (i) first from the Seller RWI Policy subject to the limitations
thereunder, (ii) second, solely to the extent that any coverage under the
Seller RWI Policy has been denied, exhausted or is otherwise unavailable, from
the Retention Escrow Fund, (iii) third from the RandW Insurance Policy subject
to the limitations thereunder and (iv) fourth, solely to the extent that any
coverage under the RandW Insurance Policy has been denied, exhausted or is
otherwise unavailable, from Seller (subject to the limitations set forth in
this _Section 10_).

  



  

(g) _Insurance and Third Party Contribution_. Payments pursuant to
_Section 10.2(a)_ or _Section 10.2(b)_ in respect of any Damages shall be
limited to the amount of any liability or damage that remains after deducting
therefrom any insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other
similar payment received or reasonably expected to be received by any
Indemnitee in respect of any matter underlying a claim pursuant to _Section
10.2(a)_ or _Section 10.2(b)_, as the case may be. Each Indemnitee shall use
its, his or her commercially reasonable efforts to recover under insurance
policies or indemnity, contribution or other similar agreements for any
Damages prior to seeking indemnification under this Agreement.

  



  

(h) _No Double Recovery_. Any Damages for which any Indemnitee is
entitled to indemnification under _Section 10.2(a)_ or  _Section 10.2(b)_,
as applicable, shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason
of the state of facts giving rise to such Damages allowing for recovery under
more than one provision of this Agreement or as a result of inaccuracies in
or breaches of more than one of the representations and warranties contained
in this Agreement. No Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification under
this Agreement for any Damages to the extent such Damages were already
reflected or otherwise taken into account in the calculation of the Closing
Consideration (as adjusted by the Final Adjustment Amount, if any).

  



  

(i) _Disclaimers_. Except for the representations and warranties
set forth in _Section 2_, _Section 3_ and the Seller Closing Certificate,
in any Transaction Document or any certificate delivered by the Seller or an
Acquired Company under this Agreement or any Transaction Document, Seller and
the Company respectively disclaim any representation or warranty of any kind
or nature, express or implied, including any representation or warranty as to
the accuracy and completeness of any information regarding any Acquired
Company, its businesses and affairs or the Contemplated Transactions. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, except for the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 2_, _Section 3_ or the Seller Closing
Certificate, none of Seller, the Company or any Representative of Seller or
the Company, has made, and shall not be deemed to have made,
any representation or warranty in the materials relating to the business and
affairs of the Acquired Companies that have been Made Available to Purchaser,
including due diligence materials, or in any presentation of the business and
affairs of the Company by the management of the Company or others in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions, and no statement contained in
any of such materials or made in any such presentation shall be deemed a
representation or warranty hereunder or otherwise or deemed to be relied upon
by Purchaser in executing, delivering and performing this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions. It is understood that except for the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3_ or the Seller Closing
Certificate, any cost estimates, projections, forward-looking information or
other predictions, any data, any financial information or any memoranda or
offering materials or presentations, including any offering memorandum or
similar materials that have been Made Available to Purchaser, are not and
shall not be deemed to be or be included as representations or warranties of
Seller or the Company, and are not and shall not be deemed to be relied upon
by Purchaser in executing, delivering and performing this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions. With respect to any estimate, projection or
forecast delivered by or on behalf of the Seller or any Acquired
Company, Purchaser acknowledges that: (i) there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such estimates, projections and forecasts; (ii) Purchaser
is aware that actual results may differ materially; and (iii) Purchaser shall
have no claim against Seller with respect to any such estimate, projection or
forecast.

(j) _Effect of Indemnification Payments_. To the extent permitted
by applicable Legal Requirements, indemnification payments made pursuant to
this _Section 10_ shall be treated by all parties as adjustments to the
aggregate consideration paid in the Membership Interest Purchase.

  



  

(k) _Effect of Acquired Company Damages_. The parties acknowledge
and agree that, if the Company becomes entitled to indemnification
for Damages under _Section 10.2(a)_, then Purchaser may also be entitled to
indemnification under _Section 10.2(a)_ for any reduction in the value of
the shares of the Company then owned by the Purchaser as a result of such
Damages; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) any amount recovered by Purchaser
for such reduction in value shall automatically reduce on a dollar-for-
dollar basis the amount of such Damages that the Company may recover under
_Section 10.2(a)_, and (ii) any amount recovered by the Company for such
Damages shall automatically reduce on a dollar-for-dollar basis the amount of
such reduction in value that Purchaser may recover under _Section 10.2(a)_.

  



  

10.4 _No Contribution_. Effective as of the Closing, Seller
expressly waives, and acknowledges and agrees that it shall not have and shall
not exercise or assert, any right of contribution, right of indemnity, right
to reimbursement or advancement of expenses or other right or remedy against
the Company, whether in such Person's capacity as a securityholder, director,
officer, manager, member, partner, Representative or otherwise, or pursuant
to any Charter Document of any Acquired Company, any applicable Legal
Requirement, any Contract or otherwise, in connection with any
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement obligation or any other
liability to which such Person may become subject under or in connection with
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document.

  



  

10.5 _Notice of Claim_. If any Purchaser Indemnitee or any Seller
Indemnitee (as applicable, the " _Indemnitee_ ") has incurred or sustained, or
would reasonably be expected to sustain, Damages, for which it is or may be
entitled to be held harmless, indemnified, compensated or reimbursed under
this  _Section 10_ (including in the case of a claim based on Fraud, or any
Third Party Claim), such Indemnitee may deliver a written notice of claim (a
" _Notice of Claim_ ") to Seller or Purchaser (as applicable, the "
_Indemnitor_ "). Each Notice of Claim shall: (i) contain a reasonably
detailed description of the facts and circumstances relating to
such Indemnitee's claim for indemnification hereunder; (ii) if reasonably
practicable, contain a good faith estimate of the total dollar amount of
Damages which the Indemnitee has incurred or sustained, and/or would
reasonably be expected to incur or sustain, based on documented evidence, and
may be entitled to indemnification under this _Section 10_; and (iii)
shall be delivered to the Indemnitor by the Indemnitee (A) in the case of a
claim other than a Third Party Claim, as soon as reasonably practicable upon
the Indemnitee incurring or sustaining such Damages, or at such time as
Indemnitee would reasonably be expected to incur or sustain, Damages, (B) in
the case of a Third Party Claim, as soon as reasonably practicable upon
receipt of notice of such claim by the Indemnitee, or the Indemnitee
otherwise becoming aware of such Third Party Claim and (C) together
with copies of all written evidence thereof available to the Indemnitee,
including, in the case of any Third Party Claim, a copy of any written
complaint, claim, pleading or other allegation, or a reasonably detailed
summary of any oral claim or allegation, by any third party in connection
with such Third Party Claim. The Indemnitee's failure to deliver a Notice of
Claim in accordance with this _Section 10.5_ shall not relieve the
Indemnitor of its indemnification obligations under this _Section
10_, except to the extent that the Indemnitor is actually prejudiced by
reason of such failure.

CONFIDENTIAL

    



  

10.6 _Defense of Third Party Claims_.

  



  

(a) In the event of the assertion or commencement of a Third Party
Claim (whether against any Acquired Company, Purchaser or any other Person)
with respect to which Seller may become obligated to hold harmless, indemnify,
compensate or reimburse any Indemnitee pursuant to this _Section 10_,
Purchaser shall have the right, at its election, to proceed with the defense
of such Third Party Claim. If Purchaser so proceeds with the defense of any
such Third Party Claim:

  



  

(i) Seller shall make available to Purchaser any documents or
other materials in Seller's possession or control or in the control of any of
Seller's Representatives that may be necessary or otherwise relevant to the
defense of such Third Party Claim;

  



  

(ii) Purchaser shall have the right to settle, adjust or
compromise such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
Indemnitor settles, adjusts or compromises any such Third Party Claim without
the consent of Seller, such settlement, adjustment or compromise shall not be
conclusive evidence of the amount of Damages incurred by the Indemnitee in
connection with such Third Party Claim (it being understood that: (A) if
Purchaser requests that Seller consent to a settlement, adjustment or
compromise, Seller shall not (subject to the provisions of _Section
10.6(a)(iv)_) unreasonably withhold, condition or delay such consent; and (B)
the consent of Seller with respect to any settlement, adjustment or compromise
of any such Third Party Claim shall be deemed to have been given unless
Seller shall have objected within 20 days after a written request for such
consent by Purchaser);

  



  

(iii) Seller shall have the right, at its expense, to participate
in (but not control) the defense, settlement, adjustment and compromise
of such Third Party Claim, and Purchaser shall consider in good faith any
comments made by Seller in connection therewith; and

  



  

(iv) if such Third Party Claim is made by or before any Education
Agency, Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any Acquired Company to,
make any admission of guilt, liability or wrongdoing, in connection with such
Third Party Claim with respect to the period from the March 2019 Change of
Ownership through the Closing, that would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the ability or qualification of any member of Seller or any Affiliate
thereof, or any owner, director or officer of any such Affiliate, to own or
operate any educational program or institution, or other business subject to
Education Laws, without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent
Seller shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay.

  



  

(b) If Purchaser does not elect to proceed with the defense of any
such Third Party Claim, Seller may proceed with the defense of such Third
Party Claim at the expense of Seller with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller may not settle, adjust or
compromise any such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of
Purchaser (it being understood that: (i) if Seller requests that Purchaser
consent to a settlement, adjustment or compromise, Purchaser shall not
unreasonably withhold, condition or delay such consent; and (ii) the consent
of Purchaser with respect to any settlement, adjustment or compromise of any
such Third Party Claim shall be deemed to have been given unless Purchaser
shall have objected within 20 days after a written request for such consent
by Seller). Purchaser shall give Seller prompt notice of the commencement of
any Third Party Claim against Purchaser or any Acquired Company with respect
to which Purchaser intends to demand indemnification from Seller; _provided_
, _however_ , that any failure on the part of Purchaser to so notify Seller
shall not limit any of the obligations of Seller under this _Section 10_
(except to the extent such failure prejudices the defense of such Third Party
Claim).

  



  

   

68

 

CONFIDENTIAL

    



  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
control of any Tax Matter in respect of an Acquired Company or Seller shall be
governed exclusively by _Section 6.4(e)_.

  



  

10.7 _Direct Claim Procedure_. During the 45-day period commencing
upon delivery by an Indemnitee to the Indemnitor of a Notice of Claim (other
than with respect to any Third Party Claim) (the " _Dispute Period_ "),
Indemnitee shall (and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to)
allow the Indemnitor and its Representatives to conduct a reasonable
investigation of the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to such
Notice of Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in
respect of the matter or circumstance set forth in the Notice of Claim, and
the Indemnitee shall (and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to)
reasonably assist the Indemnitor's reasonable investigation by giving such
information and assistance (including, in the case where Seller is the
Indemnitor, reasonable access to management personnel upon reasonable advance
notice during normal business hours and the right to examine any accounts,
existing documents or existing records) as the Indemnitor or any of its
Representatives may reasonably request. If the Indemnitee and Indemnitor
resolve any claim or matter set forth in the Notice of Claim, then they shall
enter into a mutually agreeable settlement agreement memorializing the terms
of such resolution. If the Indemnitee and Indemnitor are unable to resolve
any claim or matter set forth in such Notice of Claim during the
Dispute Period, then either the Indemnitee or the Indemnitor may commence an
action to resolve such claim or matter and enforce its rights with respect
thereto in any court of competent jurisdiction under _Section 11.7_.

  



  

10.8 _Release of Retention Escrow Fund_. Promptly after the General
Expiration Date, Purchaser and Seller shall, promptly (but in any
event within five Business Days) instruct the Escrow Agent to release from
the Retention Escrow Fund in accordance with the Escrow Agreement for
distribution to Seller the amount, if any, by which: (i) the amount then
remaining in the Retention Escrow Fund exceeds the aggregate amount of
Damages set forth in all Notices of Claim delivered by the Purchaser
Indemnitees on or prior to the General Expiration Date in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 10.5 _with respect to indemnifiable claims set forth
therein that have not then been fully and finally resolved in accordance with
the provisions of _Section 10.6_ and _Section 10.7_, as applicable (each
such claim, an " _Unresolved Claim_ "). Purchaser and Seller shall instruct
the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement to release from the
Retention Escrow Fund any amounts then retained in the Retention Escrow Fund
with respect to any Unresolved Claim as required by any settlement agreement,
or any final, non-appealable award of any court of competent jurisdiction
under _Section 11.7_, binding upon Seller and Purchaser with respect to such
Unresolved Claim.

  



  

10.9 _Satisfaction from Closing Stock Consideration_. In the event
that Purchaser has delivered the Closing Stock Consideration (rather than
paying the Closing Stock Consideration in cash) pursuant to _Section
1.4(b)(i)(B)_, (a) Seller may elect to satisfy any indemnification obligation
for any amount of Damages under this _Section 10_ (to the extent in excess
of the amounts held from time to time in escrow as part of the
Adjustment Escrow Amount or Indemnity Escrow Amount) by surrendering to
Purchaser for cancellation a number of shares of the Closing
Stock Consideration entitled under the Certificate of Designations to an
aggregate liquidation preference equal to the amount of such Damages, and (b)
Purchaser, may elect, at any time following a 30-day period during which
Seller fails to pay any amount owed to any Purchaser Indemnitee under this
_Section 10_, as determined by a non-appealable order of a court of
competent jurisdiction under _Section 11.7_, to withhold and deduct such
amount (to the extent such amount remains outstanding) from any amount
otherwise payable by any Purchaser Indemnitee to Seller in respect of the
Closing Stock Consideration (including any conversion thereof, any repurchase
or redemption payments or dividends payable to Seller or any successor thereto
or assign thereof pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Designations or
in respect of repurchase or redemption of any Closing Stock Consideration).

CONFIDENTIAL

    



  

10.10 _Exercise of Remedies_. No Purchaser Indemnitee (other than
Purchaser or any successor thereto or assign thereof) shall be permitted to
assert any claim for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement or
exercise any other remedy under this Agreement unless Purchaser (or any
successor thereto or assign thereof) shall have consented to the assertion of
such claim for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement or the exercise
of such other remedy. No Seller Indemnitee (other than Seller or any successor
thereto or assign thereof) shall be permitted to assert any claim for
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement or exercise any other remedy
under this Agreement unless Seller (or any successor thereto or assign
thereof) shall have consented to the assertion of such claim for
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement or the exercise of such other
remedy.

  



  

10.11 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for specific performance as provided
in _Section 11.9_ (and without limiting Purchaser's rights under the RandW
Insurance Policy), from and after the Closing, the rights to indemnification,

OF

  



  

AMERICAN PUBLIC EDUCATION, INC.

  



  

(Pursuant to Section 151(g) of the

  

General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware)

  



  

The undersigned DOES HEREBY CERTIFY that the following resolution was duly
adopted by the Board of Directors (the " _Board_ ") of American Public
Education, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Corporation_ "), at a meeting
duly convened and held, at which a quorum was present and acting throughout:

  



  

RESOLVED, that pursuant to the provisions of the Fifth Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation and applicable law, a
series of Preferred Stock, having a par value of $0.01 per share, of the
Corporation be and hereby is created, and that the designation and number of
shares of such series, and the voting and other powers, preferences and
relative, participating, optional or other rights, and the qualifications,
limitations and restrictions, of the shares of such series be and hereby are
as follows:

  



  

1. _Number of Shares; Designation_. There is hereby created out of the authorized and unissued shares of Preferred Stock of the Corporation a series of preferred stock designated as the "Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock" (the " _Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock_"). The authorized number of shares of the Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock shall be 100,000 shares. Such number of shares may be decreased by resolution of the Board, subject to the terms and conditions hereof; provided that no decrease shall reduce the number of authorized shares of the Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock to a number less than the number of shares of the Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding.

  



  

2. _Dividends_.

  



  

2.1 Holders of shares of the Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock are
entitled to receive, out of funds of the Corporation available
for distribution to its stockholders, all to the extent permitted under the
provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware governing
distributions to stockholders (" _Available Proceeds_ "), dividends as
provided in this _Section 2_. Commencing on the date of first issuance of
Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock (as applicable, the " _Issue Date_
"), cash dividends shall accrue daily on each outstanding share of Series A
Non-Voting Preferred Stock at the rate of 9% per annum (the " _Divided Rate_
") of $290 (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock split,
combination or other recapitalization, the " _Series A Original Issue
Price_"), whether or not declared, and shall be paid by the Corporation
quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each
year (unless any such day is not a Business Day, in which event such
dividends shall be payable on the next succeeding Business Day, without
accrual to such Business Day) (and compounding annually to the extent any
accrued dividend is unpaid) (dividends accrued in respect of a share of
Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock but unpaid, " _Accruing Dividends_ ");
provided that the Dividend Rate shall increase to a rate of 15% per annum of
the Series A Original Issue Price commencing on the day immediately following
the date that is the third anniversary of the Issue Date and
continuing thereafter for so long as any Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock
remains outstanding; provided, further, that, in the event that on any such
payment date the Corporation is not permitted under the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware to pay any amount of such Accruing Dividends in
full as a result of the Corporation not having sufficient Available Proceeds:
(a) the Corporation shall (1) pay the amount of such Accruing Dividends to
the extent of the Corporation's then Available Proceeds to the holders of
shares of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock ratably in proportion to the
respective amounts of Accruing Dividends which would have been payable in
respect of the shares of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock held by them on
such payment date had the Corporation had sufficient Available Proceeds to
pay such Accruing Dividends in full, and (2) use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Corporation to have sufficient Available Proceeds as soon
as practicable (including, without limitation, by causing the revaluation of
the assets of the Corporation and/or otherwise increasing the "surplus" of
the Corporation under Section 154 of the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware); (b) any amount of such Accruing Dividends that remains unpaid
by the Corporation on such payment date shall continue to remain outstanding
and accrue at the then applicable Dividend Rate (calculated in accordance
with the other provisions of this _Section 2.1_ and _Section 2.2_); and (c)
the Corporation shall pay such unpaid amount of Accruing Dividends, together
with any accrual thereon, to the holders of shares of Series A Non-Voting
Preferred Stock within three (3) Business Days following the date on which the
Corporation obtains sufficient Available Proceeds. As used in this
Certificate, " _Business Day_ " means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday

2.2 Accruing Dividends shall be cumulative from and including the
Issue Date, and shall be payable to the holders of record of the Series
A Non-Voting Preferred Stock upon (a) each of the dates indicated in _Section
2.1_, (b) conversion in accordance with _Section 5.3_, (c) redemption in
accordance with _Section 6_ or (d) the occurrence of a Deemed Liquidation
Event (as defined below). Notwithstanding any provision of this Certificate to
the contrary, in the event any Accruing Dividends are not timely paid in cash
(including, without limitation, as a result of the Corporation not having
sufficient Available Proceeds), the Dividend Rate then in effect under
_Section 2.1_ shall increase by 5% per annum of the Series A Original Issue
Price and such increased Dividend Rate shall continue in effect until such
time that all Accruing Dividends due and payable in accordance with this
_Section 2_ are paid in full. The Corporation shall not declare, pay or set
aside any dividends on shares of any other class or series of capital stock
of the Corporation (other than dividends on shares of Common Stock
(as defined below) payable in shares of Common Stock) unless (in addition to
the obtaining of any consents required elsewhere in this Certificate) the
holders of the Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding shall
first receive, or simultaneously receive, a dividend on each outstanding
share of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock in an amount at least equal to
the amount of the aggregate Accruing Dividends then accrued on such share of
Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock and not previously paid.

entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation available for
distribution to its stockholders, and in the event of a Deemed Liquidation

outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the consideration payable to
the stockholders in such Deemed Liquidation Event (the " _Deemed

applicable, before any payment shall be made to the holders of the Common

Stock_ "), or any other class or series of capital stock of the Corporation,
by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share equal to the Series
A Original Issue Price plus Accruing Dividends thereon. If upon any such
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or Deemed
Liquidation Event, the Available Proceeds and/or the Deemed Liquidation Event
Consideration, as applicable, shall be insufficient to pay the holders of
shares of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock the full amount to which they
shall be entitled under this _Section 3.1_, the holders of shares of Series
A Non-Voting Preferred Stock shall share ratably in any distribution of the
Available Proceeds and/or the Deemed Liquidation Event Consideration in
proportion to the respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in
respect of the shares held by them upon such distribution if all amounts
payable on or with respect to such shares were paid in full.

preferential amounts required to be paid to the holders of shares of Series
A Non-Voting Preferred Stock, the remaining assets of the Corporation

rights as follows (the " _Conversion Rights_ "):

CONFIDENTIAL

    



  

5.1 _Right to Convert_.

  



  

(a) _Conversion Ratio_. Upon notice to the Corporation that any
dividends, including, without limitation, Accruing Dividends were not
timely paid in cash within the time period described for payment in _Section
2.1_, if the Corporation fails to pay, in full, all dividends due to the
holders of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock within five Business Days of
receipt of such notice, or at any time after the third anniversary of the
Issue Date, each share of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time
to time, and without the payment of additional consideration by the holder
thereof, into such number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common
Stock as is determined by dividing (a) the Series A Original Issue Price plus
any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, including, without limitation,
Accruing Dividends thereon by (b) the Series A Conversion Price (as defined
below). The " _Series A Conversion Price_" applicable to the Series A Non-
Voting Preferred Stock shall equal the per day average volume-weighted price
per share as reported by SandP Capital IQ, or any successor thereto, through
its "Volume Weighted Average Price" function, for a share of Common Stock in
respect of the period from the scheduled open of trading until the scheduled
close of trading of the primary trading session for the 10-day trading period
immediately preceding the date of calculation of the Conversion Price;
provided, however, that if any such conversion, or the issuance of the Series
A Non-Voting Preferred Stock with such conversion rights, would require the
Corporation, under the rules of the Nasdaq stock exchange (or any other
exchange on which the Corporation's Common Stock is then trading), to obtain
the written consent or affirmative vote of holders of its capital stock to
effect such conversion, the Corporation shall be entitled to reduce the
number of shares of Common Stock into which any share of Series A Non-Voting
Preferred Stock may convert such that the Corporation would not be required to
obtain such written consent or affirmative vote, so long as the Corporation,
concurrently with such conversion, pays the holder of such share (1) for each
whole share of Common Stock into which such share of Series A Non-Voting
Preferred Stock would have otherwise converted, cash equal to the Series A
Conversion Price, and (2) for each fractional share of Common Stock into which
such share of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock would have otherwise
converted, cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the Series A
Conversion Price.

  



  

(b) _Termination of Conversion Rights_. In the event of a
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or a Deemed
Liquidation Event, the Conversion Rights shall terminate at the close of
business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for the payment of any
such amounts distributable on such event to the holders of Series A Non-Voting
Preferred Stock.

  



  

5.2 _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall
be issued upon conversion of the Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock. In lieu
of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the
Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the Series A
Conversion Price. Whether or not fractional shares would be issuable upon such
conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of
Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock a holder is at the time converting into
Common Stock and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
such conversion.

5.3 _Mechanics of Conversion_.

  



  

(a) _Notice of Conversion_. In order for a holder of Series A
Non-Voting Preferred Stock to voluntarily convert shares of Series A Non-
Voting Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, such holder shall (a)
provide written notice to the Corporation that such holder elects to convert
all or any number of such holder's shares of Series A Non-Voting Preferred
Stock and, if applicable, any event on which such conversion is contingent
and (b), if such holder's shares are certificated, surrender the certificate
or certificates for such shares of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock (or, if
such registered holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to
the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be
made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or
destruction of such certificate), at the office of the transfer agent for the
Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of the
Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent). Such notice
shall state such holder's name or the names of the nominees in which such
holder wishes the shares of Common Stock to be issued. If required by the
Corporation, any certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or
accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form
satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or
his, her or its attorney duly authorized in writing. The close of business on
the date of receipt by the transfer agent (or by the Corporation if the
Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) of such notice and, if
applicable, certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement)
shall be the time of conversion (the " _Conversion Time_ "), and the shares
of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the specified shares shall be
deemed to be outstanding of record as of such date. The Corporation shall, as
soon as practicable after the Conversion Time (a) cause the Corporation's
transfer agent to record such number of full shares of Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof in the name of
the holder of the Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock, or her, his or its
nominees and (b) pay in cash such amount as provided in _Section 5.2_ in
lieu of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such
conversion.

  



  

(b) _Effect of Conversion_. All shares of Series A Non-Voting
Preferred Stock which shall have been surrendered for conversion as
herein provided shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights
with respect to such shares shall immediately cease and terminate at the
Conversion Time, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive
shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor and to receive payment in lieu of
any fraction of a share otherwise issuable upon such conversion as provided in
_Section 5.2_. Any shares of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock so
converted shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of
such series, and the Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action
(without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the
authorized number of shares of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock
accordingly.

  



  

6. _Redemption_.

  



  

6.1 _Optional Redemption Right_. The Corporation may, at its
option, upon not less than five nor more than 30 days' prior written
notice, redeem any whole number of shares of Series A Non-Voting Preferred
Stock, at any time or from time to time, for cash at a redemption price of
the Series A Original Issue Price per share, plus any accrued and unpaid
dividends, including, without limitation, Accruing Dividends, thereon to, but
not including, the date fixed for redemption. If the Corporation elects to
redeem any shares of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock as described in this
_Section 6.1_, it may use any available cash to pay the redemption price,
and it will not be required to pay the redemption price only out of the
proceeds from the issuance of other equity securities or any other specific
source.

  



  

6.2 _Notice of Redemption_. In the event the Corporation elects to
redeem Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock, the notice of redemption will be
mailed by the Corporation, postage prepaid, not less than five nor more than
30 days prior to the redemption date, to each holder of record of Series A
Non-Voting Preferred Stock called for redemption at such holder's address as
it appears on the stock transfer records of the Corporation and shall state:
(a) the redemption date; (b) the number of shares of Series A Non-Voting
Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (c) the redemption price; (d) instructions for
surrender of the certificates (if any) for the Series A Non-Voting Preferred
Stock to the transfer agent in return for the payment of the redemption
price; and (e) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to
accumulate on the redemption date. No failure to give such notice or any
defect thereto or in the mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the
proceedings for the redemption of any shares of Series A Non-Voting Preferred
Stock except as to the particular holder to whom notice was defective or not
given.

6.3 _Surrender of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock_. Holders of
Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall surrender the Series
A Non-Voting Preferred Stock (either by surrendering any certificates with
respect thereto, or, if such any holder alleges that such certificate has
been lost, stolen or destroyed, providing a lost certificate affidavit and
agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the
Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on
account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to the
transfer agent specified by the Corporation and shall be entitled to the
redemption price and any accumulated and unpaid dividends payable upon the
redemption following such surrender. If so required by the Corporation, any
certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by
written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the
Corporation and the transfer agent specified by the Corporation, duly
executed by the registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly
authorized in writing.

  



  

6.4 _No Right to Future Dividends_. If notice of redemption of any
shares of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock has been given and if the
Corporation irrevocably sets apart for payment the funds necessary for
redemption in trust for the benefit of the holders of the shares of Series A
Non-Voting Preferred Stock so called for redemption, then from and after the
redemption date (unless the Corporation shall default in providing for the
payment of the redemption price plus accumulated and unpaid dividends
(including, without limitation, Accruing Dividends), if any), dividends will
cease to accumulate on those shares of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock,
those shares of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed
outstanding and all rights of the holders of those shares will terminate,
except the right to receive the redemption price plus accumulated and unpaid
dividends (including, without limitation, Accruing Dividends), if any,
payable upon redemption.

  



  

6.5 _Redemption on Non-Business Days_. If any redemption date is
not a Business Day, then the redemption price and accumulated and unpaid
dividends, if any, payable upon redemption may be paid on the next Business
Day and no interest, additional dividends or other sums will accumulate on
the amount payable for the period from and after that redemption date to that
next Business Day.

  



  

6.6 _Partial Redemption_. In the event the Corporation elects to
redeem less than all of the outstanding shares of Series A Non-
Voting Preferred Stock pursuant to this _Section 6_, it shall redeem a
proportionate number (as nearly as may be practicable without creating
fractional shares) of such shares from each holder of shares of Series A Non-
Voting Preferred Stock (based on the number of such shares held by such
holder relative to the total number of such shares outstanding at the time of
the Corporation's applicable redemption election).

  



  

6.7 _Dividends_. In connection with any redemption of Series A Non-
Voting Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall pay, in cash, any accrued and
unpaid dividends (including, without limitation, Accruing Dividends) to, but
not including, the redemption date.

  



  

6.8 _Corporation 's Rights after Redemption_. Any shares of Series
A Non-Voting Preferred Stock that are redeemed or otherwise acquired by the
Corporation may be cancelled, retired and re-classified as authorized but
unissued shares of Preferred Stock, without designation as to class or
series, and may thereafter be reissued as any class or series of Preferred
Stock (other than Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock). The Corporation shall
not exercise any voting or other rights granted to the holders of Series A
Non-Voting Preferred Stock following redemption.

7. _Transfer_. Any holder of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock may transfer some or all of its shares of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock without the consent of the Corporation, subject to compliance with the Securities Act of 1933. If any shares of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock are to be transferred, upon the Corporation's receipt of duly endorsed written notice of a proposed transfer together with an opinion of counsel that such transfer complies with the Securities Act of 1933, each in a form reasonably acceptable to the Corporation and the Corporation's transfer agent, then the Corporation and such transfer agent will cause each such transfer to be recorded.

  



  

8. _Waiver_. Any of the rights, powers, preferences and other terms of the Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock set forth herein may be waived on behalf of all holders of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock by the affirmative written consent or vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding.

  



  

9. _Notices_. Any notice required or permitted by the provisions herein to be given to a holder of shares of Series A Non-Voting Preferred Stock shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to the post office address last shown on the records of the Corporation, or given by electronic communication in compliance with the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and shall be deemed sent upon such mailing or electronic transmission.
