Purchaser also shall pay (i) recording fees, escrow fees and other

allocated herein to Purchaser (e.g. surveys and Investigation costs).

Real estate taxes and assessments on the Premises and any personal property
taxes on the Personal Property for the year of Closing shall be prorated as of
the Closing Date. Seller shall be responsible for all real estate and
personal property taxes and assessments for the period ending on the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date and Purchaser shall be responsible for
all such taxes and assessments from and after the Closing Date. If the tax
or assessments bill for the year of Closing has not been issued prior to

Seller assumes all risk and liability, damage to or injury occurring to the

casualty or cause until the Closing has been consummated. If the Premises
and/or Personal Property or any part thereof, suffers any damages prior to the
Closing from fire or other casualty, Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser of
such damage. If such damages are not material, the Closing shall continue as
scheduled and Seller shall assign to Purchaser the insurance proceeds (or
Sellers right to the insurance proceeds) up to the amount of the loss and the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount of any deductible and co-
insurance. If such damages are material, then Purchaser shall have the option
to: (a) terminate this Agreement by providing written notice thereof to Seller
within twenty (20) days after receipt of notice of said, in which event the
parties shall have no further rights and liabilities hereunder except with
respect to those matters specifically surviving termination or Closing; or (b)
elect to proceed to Closing without Seller repairing such damages, consummate
the Closing, in which event the proceeds of any insurance covering such
damages shall be assigned to Purchaser at Closing and the Purchase Price shall
be reduced by the amount of any deductible and co-insurance. For purposes
hereof, "material" shall be deemed to mean damages as to all parcels in the
aggregate which will cost more than $4.2 million to replace and/or repair.

11.2 _Condemnation_.

If, prior to Closing, any action(s) are initiated to take a material part of
the Premises by eminent domain proceedings or by deed in lieu under threat
thereof, then either Seller or Purchaser may either (a) terminate this
Agreement by providing written notice thereof to Seller within twenty (20)
days after receipt of notice of said, in which event the parties shall have no
further rights or obligations hereunder except those matters specifically
surviving termination or Closing, or (b) consummate the Closing in which
latter event the award(s) of the condemning authority or authorities not
exceeding the Purchase Price shall be assigned to Purchaser at the Closing.
For purposes hereof, a "material part" shall be deemed to mean taking(s) of
the value of which is greater than $4.2 million as to all parcels in the
aggregate.

ARTICLE XII

_DEFAULT_

12.1.  _Default by Seller_.

If Seller is in material default or materially breaches the terms or
provisions of this Agreement, then Purchaser shall give Seller written notice
specifying the nature of the default. Seller shall have five (5) business days
after receipt of Purchasers notice of default  



 

19  within which to cure the specified default. If Seller does not cure such
default within said five (5) business day period, or if such default is
not waived in writing by Purchaser, then Purchaser, at its option, may (a)
within five (5) days of Sellers default file suit against Seller seeking to
enforce specific performance of this Agreement, as its sole and exclusive
remedy and relief, (b) terminate this agreement; or (c) waive such default by
Seller and close the purchase, notwithstanding such default by Seller. In no
event shall Seller be liable to Purchaser for any actual, punitive,
speculative, consequential or other damages. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchasers rights and remedies for any breach by Seller under _Section 6.1_
shall be governed by _Section 12.3_.

12.2 _Default by Purchaser_.

If Purchaser is in material default or materially breaches the terms or
provisions of this Agreement, then Seller shall give Purchaser written notice
specifying the nature of the default. Purchaser shall have five (5) business
days after receipt of Sellers notice of default within which to cure the
specified default. If Purchaser does not cure such default within said five
(5) business day period, or if such default is not waived in writing by
Seller, then Seller may, within five (5) days of Purchasers default, be
entitled to (a) terminate this agreement; (b) pursue an action for damages,
without terminating this Agreement; or (c) pursue an action for specific
performance. 

12.3 _Survival and Limitation of Representations and Warranties; Seller s
Knowledge; Indemnification_.

The representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement and in the
transaction documents executed in connection herewith are made as of the date
of this Agreement and are remade as of the Closing Date (as provided in
Section 9.2 (g), herein) and shall survive the Closing but written
notification of any claim arising therefrom must be received by Seller within
twelve (12) months of the Closing Date or such claim shall be forever barred
and Seller shall have no liability with respect thereto. Recovery of actual
damages is Purchasers sole and exclusive remedy for any such breach, provided
that Seller shall have no liability to Purchaser for matters disclosed by
Seller or discovered by Purchaser or its agents prior to Closing. This
_Section 12.3_ shall remain in full force and effect for twelve (12) months
after the Closing. 

Notwithstanding the above, prior to making any claim against Seller for any
matter or issue or warranty or representation concerning title,
Purchaser shall be required to (a) submit any such claim to the Title Company
to the extent such claims are insured against under any title insurance
maintained by Purchaser as provided by Section 5.1 of this Agreement; and (b)
await the Title Companys resolution or non-resolution of any such claims
provided, however, if the claim against the Title Company has not been
resolved prior to the expiration of the Survival Period, Purchaser may give
notice to Seller of any claim it may have against the Seller but shall take
no further action on such claim against the Seller until such time as the
claim against the Title Company has been resolved.

  

 

20 12.4 _Termination of Agreement_.

If Purchaser does not close the transaction contemplated herein, Purchaser
shall return all documents delivered to Purchaser by Seller. The provision of
this _Section 12.4_ shall survive termination of this Agreement.

first obtaining Sellers written consent. Any assignment in contravention of
this provision shall be void. No assignment shall release the Purchaser herein
named from any obligation or liability under this Agreement. Any assignee
shall be deemed to have made any and all representations and warranties made
by Purchaser hereunder, as if the assignee were the original signatory hereto.
If Purchaser requests Sellers written consent to any assignment, Purchaser
shall (a) notify Seller in writing of the proposed assignment; (b) provide
Seller with the name and address of the proposed assignee; (c) provide Seller
with financial information including financial statements of the proposed
assignee; and (d) provide Seller with a copy of the proposed assignment.

13.11 _Invalid Provision_.

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable under present or future laws, such provision shall be fully
severable; this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part of this
Agreement; and, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect and shall not be affected by such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision or by its severance from this Agreement.

13.12 _Attorneys  Fees_.

In the event it becomes necessary for either party hereto to file suit to
enforce this Agreement or any provision contained herein, the party prevailing
in such suit shall be entitled to recover, in addition to all other remedies
or damages as herein provided, reasonable attorneys, paralegals, or expert
witnesses fees and costs incurred in such suit at trial or on appeal or in
connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings.

13.13 _Multiple Counterparts and Facsimile Transmission_.

This Agreement may be executed in a number of identical counterparts, each of
which for all purposes is deemed an original, and all of which constitute
collectively one (1) agreement, but in making proof of this Agreement, it
shall not be necessary to produce or account for more than one such
counterpart. Facsimile copies of signatures on this Agreement shall be deemed
to be originals.

13.14 _Non-Merger_.

Any provision hereof which by its terms would be performed after Closing shall
survive the Closing, and shall not merge in the Closing or in the Deed, for a
period of twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, except as
specifically provided to the contrary herein.



 

24 13.15 _No Recording_.

Neither party shall record this Agreement or a short form notice or memorandum
of this Agreement in any public records or in any other place of recording
and any such recording shall constitute a default by the recording party under
this Agreement.

13.16 _[Reserved_ ]. 

13.17 _Purchaser s Assumption of Service Contracts_.

Prior to the expiration of the Inspection Period, Purchaser shall provide to
Seller a list of those Service Contracts which Purchaser elects to assume, if
permitted pursuant to the particular Service Contract (the " _Assumed Service
Contracts_ "). If Purchaser fails to notify Seller of which Service Contracts
it desires to assume, Purchaser will be deemed to have agreed to assume all
Service Contracts as permitted pursuant to the terms of such Service
Contracts. All Service Contracts Purchaser elects not to assume shall be
terminated by Seller on or before Closing; provided, however, that Seller
shall be responsible for any termination fees incurred with the termination
of those Service Contracts which are not to be assumed.

13.18  _Section 1031 Exchange_.

Either party may consummate the purchase or sale (as applicable) of the
Property as part of a like kind exchange (an " _Exchange_ ") pursuant to §
1031 of the Code, provided that: (a) the Closing shall not be delayed or
affected by reason of the Exchange nor shall the consummation or
accomplishment of an Exchange be a condition precedent or condition
subsequent to the exchanging partys obligations under this Agreement; (b) the
exchanging party shall effect its Exchange through an assignment of this
Agreement, or its rights under this Agreement, to a qualified intermediary;
(c) neither party shall be required to take an assignment of the purchase
agreement for the relinquished or replacement property or be required to
acquire or hold title to any real property for purposes of consummating an
Exchange desired by the other party; and (d) the exchanging party shall pay
any additional costs that would not otherwise have been incurred by the non-
exchanging party had the exchanging party not consummated the
transaction through an Exchange. Neither party shall by this Agreement or
acquiescence to an Exchange desired by the other party have its rights under
this Agreement affected or diminished in any manner or be responsible for
compliance with or be deemed to have warranted to the exchanging party that
its Exchange in fact complies with § 1031 of the Code.

13.19 _Limitation of Liability_. 

Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that in no event shall any partner or
member or officer of Seller or any partner or member or officer of any member
of Seller (or any of such members members or officers or partners) ever be
liable to Purchaser as a result of a breach of this Agreement, and Purchaser
agrees to look solely to Seller for satisfaction of any claim, loss or
damage, except and unless Seller is hereinafter dissolved prior to the
expiration of the period (the " _Survival Period_ ") commencing on the Closing
Date and ending on the date which is twelve (12) months following the Closing
Date. In consideration of such  



 

25  acknowledgement and agreement of Purchaser, Seller hereby agrees that Seller
shall remain in existence through the Survival Period, and will
maintain tangible net worth as determined by Seller in its reasonable
judgment, in an amount of at least $9.25 million. Seller shall provide to
Purchaser during the Survival Period on a quarterly basis a letter from a
reputable financial institution or an accounting firm indicating that Seller
has, at quarter end, maintained such net worth. Seller hereby acknowledges and
agrees that in no event shall any partner or member of Purchaser ever be
liable to Seller as a result of a breach of this Agreement, and Seller agrees
to look solely to Purchaser for satisfaction of any claim.

13.20. _Record Retention_.

From the Closing Date until the third (3rd) anniversary of the date Sellers
2007 tax returns for the Property following the Closing Date are due and
filed, Purchaser agrees to furnish to Seller, upon request, as promptly as
practicable, and at Sellers expense, such information (including access to
books, records, computer files and personnel) and assistance relating to
Purchaser as is reasonably necessary for the filing of any return, amended
return or other report required to be filed by Seller for the preparation for
any audit or for the prosecution or defense of any action or proceeding with
respect to all federal, state, local or foreign taxes, charges, fees, levies
or other assessments, however denominated. After such third anniversary,
Purchaser agrees not to destroy or dispose of any such books, records or
computer files without providing Seller with reasonable notice and
opportunity to take possession of all or part thereof, at Sellers expense.
