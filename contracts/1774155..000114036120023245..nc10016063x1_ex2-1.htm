ARTICLE III

 


 

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF COMPANY SECURITIES

 


 

 

 

SECTION 3.01 __

 

 _Conversion of Securities_.

 

 


 

 

(a)

 

The Company shall take all actions necessary to cause each share of Company
Preferred Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time to be  automatically converted immediately prior to the
Effective Time into (i) a number of shares of Company Common Stock at the
then-effective conversion rate as calculated pursuant to the Company Charter
in accordance with the terms of the Company  Charter and (ii) a number of
shares of Company Common Stock issuable with respect to any accrued dividends
in accordance with the terms of the Company Charter ((i) and (ii)
collectively, the " _Company Preferred Stock Conversion_ "). All of the 
shares of Company Preferred Stock converted into shares of Company Common
Stock shall be canceled, shall no longer be outstanding and shall cease to
exist and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto, and
each holder of shares of  Company Preferred Stock shall thereafter cease to
have any rights with respect to such securities.

 


 

 

 

22  


 

 

(b)

 

At the Effective Time (and, for the avoidance of doubt, following the Company
Preferred Stock Conversion), by virtue of the First Merger and without any
action on the part of  SMMC, First Merger Sub, the Company or the Company
Stockholders, each share of Company Common Stock (including Company Common
Stock resulting from the Company Preferred Stock Conversion) that is issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective Time (other than the
Dissenting Shares and the Cancelled Shares) shall be converted into the right
to receive (A) subject to the provisions of _Annex I_ , the contingent right
to receive a number of Earnout Shares (which may be zero  (0)) following the
Closing in accordance with _Section 3.07_ and _Annex I_ and (B) the following:

 


 

 

(i)

 

if the holder of such share of Company Common Stock makes a proper and timely
election in accordance with _Section 3.02_ to receive cash (a " _Cash
Election_ ") with  respect to such share of Company Common Stock, which
election has not been revoked pursuant to _Section 3.02_ (each such share, a "
_Cash Electing Share_ "), an amount in cash for such Cash Electing Share,
without interest, equal to the Per  Share Merger Consideration Value (the "
_Per Share Cash Consideration_ "), except that if (x) the sum of the aggregate
number of Dissenting Shares and the aggregate number of Cash Electing Shares,
multiplied by  (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration Value (such product,
the " _Aggregate Cash Election Amount_ ") exceeds the Cash Consideration Cap,
then each Cash Electing Share shall be converted into the right to receive (A)
an amount in cash, without  interest, equal to the product of (1) the Per
Share Merger Consideration Value and (2) a fraction, the numerator of which
shall be the Cash Consideration Cap and the denominator of which shall be the
Aggregate Cash Election Amount (such fraction, the  " _Cash Fraction_ ") and
(B) a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of SMMC
Elected Common Stock equal to the product of (1) the Per Share Stock
Consideration and (2) one minus the Cash Fraction; and

 


 

 

(ii)

 

if the holder of such share makes a proper election to receive shares of SMMC
Elected Common Stock (a " _Stock Election_ ") with respect to such share of
Company Common  Stock, which election has not been revoked pursuant to
_Section 3.02_ , or the holder of such share fails to make a Cash Election or
Stock Election with respect to such share in accordance with the procedures
set forth in _Section 3.02_ ,  the Per Share Stock Consideration.

 


 

 

All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive
consideration as described in this _Section 3.01(b)_ shall no longer be
outstanding and shall cease to exist, and each holder of  shares of Company
Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such
securities, except the right to receive the applicable consideration described
in this _Section 3.01(b)_ into which such share of Company Common Stock 
shall have been converted.

 


 

 

(c)

 

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without any action on
the part of any holder thereof, each Company Share held in the treasury of the
Company shall be  canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or
distribution shall be made with respect thereto (such Company Shares, the "
_Cancelled Shares_ ").

 


 

 

(d)

 

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without any action on
the part of any holder thereof, each share of First Merger Sub Common Stock
issued and  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

 


 

 

 

23  


 

 

(e)

 

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without any action on
the part of any holder thereof, each Company Option that is outstanding
immediately prior to the  Effective Time shall be assumed by SMMC and
converted into (A) an option to purchase shares of SMMC Class A Common Stock
(each, a " _Converted Option_ "), _provided_ that the assumption and
conversion of any such Company Options that are  incentive stock options
under Section 422 of the Code will be effected in a manner that is intended to
be consistent with the applicable requirements of Section 424 of the Code and
the applicable regulations promulgated thereunder, and (B) the  contingent
right to receive a number of Earnout Securities following the Closing in
accordance with _Section 3.07_ and _Annex I_. Each Converted Option will have
and be subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting and 
exercisability terms) as were applicable to such Company Option immediately
before the Effective Time, except that (x) each Converted Option will be
exercisable for that number of shares of SMMC Class A Common Stock equal to
the product (rounded down  to the nearest whole number) of (1) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Option immediately
before the Effective Time and (2) the Per Share Stock Consideration; and (y)
the per share exercise price for each share of  SMMC Class A Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of the Converted Option will be equal to the quotient
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained by dividing (1) the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock of such Company Option  immediately
before the Effective Time by (2) the Per Share Stock Consideration; _provided_
, _however_ , that the exercise price and the number of shares of SMMC Class A
Common Stock purchasable under each Converted Option will be  determined in a
manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the
applicable regulations promulgated thereunder. In connection with the
assumption of the Converted Options pursuant to this _Section 3.01(e)_ , the 
Company and SMMC shall cause SMMC to assume the Company Option Plan as of the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time and subject to the prior
reasonable review and approval of SMMC (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed, or  conditioned), the Company shall take all
actions reasonably necessary to effect the transactions anticipated by this
_Section 3.01(e)_ under the Company Option Plan and any Contract applicable to
any Company Option (whether written or oral,  formal or informal), including
delivering all required notices, obtaining all necessary approvals and
consents, and delivering evidence reasonably satisfactory to SMMC that all
necessary determinations by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "
_Company    Board_ ") or applicable committee of the Company Board to
assume and convert Company Options in accordance with this _Section 3.01(e)_
have been made.

 


 

 

(f)

 

At the Second Effective Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and without any
action on the part of SMMC, Surviving Corporation, Second Merger Sub, or the
holders of any  securities of SMMC or the Surviving Corporation or the Second
Merger Sub: (i) each share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall be
canceled and shall cease to exist  without any conversion thereof or payment
therefor; and (ii) each membership interest in Second Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall be converted
into and become one validly issued, fully paid and  non-assessable membership
interest in the Surviving Entity, which shall constitute the only outstanding
equity of the Surviving Entity.

 


 

 

 

24  


 

 

SECTION 3.02

 

_Consideration Election Procedure_.

 


 

 

(a)

 

On or prior to the Election Date, each Company Stockholder (i) entitled to
receive consideration pursuant to _Section 3.01(b)_ and (ii) who was a Company
Stockholder on  the date of the delivery of the Consent Solicitation
Statement, shall be entitled to specify the number of such holder's Company
Shares with respect to which such holder makes a Cash Election or a Stock
Election by complying with the procedures set  forth in this _Section 3.02_.
For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything else to the contrary
set forth herein, each Cash Election or Stock Election made pursuant to this
_Section 3.02_ shall be deemed to be made with respect  to each applicable
Company Stockholder on an "as-converted" to Company Common Stock basis.

 


 

 

(b)

 

SMMC shall prepare and file as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, a
form of election (the " _Form of Election_ ") in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the  Company. Not less than twenty (20) days prior to the
Election Date, the Company shall mail or otherwise deliver the Form of
Election to each holder of record (as of such mailing) of Company Common Stock
and Company Preferred Stock. Each Company  Stockholder entitled to receive
consideration pursuant to _Section 3.01(b)_ shall use the Form of Election to
make a Cash Election or a Stock Election. In the event that any such Company
Stockholder fails to make a Cash Election or a Stock  Election with respect
to any or all Company Shares held or beneficially owned by such holder, then
such holder shall be automatically deemed to have made a Stock Election with
respect to those shares.

 


 

 

(c)

 

Any applicable Company Stockholder's election pursuant to the Form of Election
will be deemed properly made only if the Company has received at its
designated office, by 5:00  p.m. (New York time) on the business day that is
five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date or such other date as SMMC
and the Company will, prior to the Closing, mutually agree (the " _Election
Date_ "), a Form of Election duly, completely  and validly executed and
accompanied by (A) Certificates to which such Form of Election relates or (B)
in the case such shares are uncertificated, any additional documents required
by the procedures set forth in the Form of Election, and in each  case,
together with any additional documents required by the procedures set forth in
the Form of Election. SMMC and the Company shall publicly announce the
anticipated Election Date at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing  Date. If the Closing Date is delayed to a subsequent
date, the Election Date shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and
SMMC and the Company shall promptly announce any such delay and, when
determined, the rescheduled Election Date; _provided_ ,  that such subsequent
announcement may be made five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date and
the Election Date may be four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

 


 

 

(d)

 

Any election made pursuant to this _Section 3.02_ will have been properly made
only if the Company will have actually received a properly completed Form of
Election  prior to the Election Date. Any Form of Election may be revoked or
changed by the person submitting it, by written notice received by the Company
prior to the Election Date. In the event an Form of Election is validly
revoked prior to the Election  Date, the holders of the shares of Company
Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock represented by such Form of Election
then such holder shall be deemed to have made a Stock Election with respect to
those shares, except to the extent a subsequent  election is properly made
prior to the Election Date. Any Cash Election or Stock Election as of the
Election Date is final and irrevocable, unless (i) otherwise consented to in
writing by the Company (which such consent may, in the Company's sole 
discretion, be provided or denied), or (ii) this Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with _Article IX_ , in which case all Cash Elections
and Stock Elections shall automatically be revoked concurrently with the
termination of this  Agreement. Without limiting the application of any other
transfer restrictions that may otherwise exist, after a Cash Election or a
Stock Election is validly made or deemed to be made with respect to any shares
of Company Common Stock (or Company  Preferred Stock on an "as-converted" to
Company Common Stock basis), no further registration of transfers of such
shares shall be made on the stock transfer books of the Company until the
Closing, unless and until such Cash Election or Stock Election  is validly
revoked in accordance with this _Section 3.02_.

 


 

 

 

25  


 

 

(e)

 

The determination of the Company shall be final, conclusive and binding in the
event of ambiguity or uncertainty as to whether or not a Cash Election or a
Stock Election has  been properly made or revoked pursuant to this Section
3.02. None of SMMC, First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub, the Company or the
Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any person of any
defect in a Form of Election.

 


 

 

 

SECTION 3.03 __

 

 _Exchange of Company Securities_.

 

 


 

 

(a)

 

_Exchange Agent_. On the Closing Date, SMMC shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, with a bank or trust company that shall be designated by SMMC
and is  reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "),
for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with this _Article III,_ an amount in cash payable by SMMC pursuant
to _Section 3.01(b)_   and _Section 3.03(i)_ (in any event, not to exceed the
Cash Consideration Cap) and the number of shares of SMMC Elected Common Stock
sufficient to deliver the Stock Consideration payable by SMMC pursuant to this
Agreement, in each case, as set  forth in the Merger Payment Schedule (such
amount of cash and such shares of SMMC Elected Common Stock being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Upon the completion of such deposit,
SMMC shall have no liability with respect to  the amount in cash payable by
SMMC pursuant to _Section 3.01(b)_ and _Section 3.03(i)_ or the Stock
Consideration. SMMC shall cause the Exchange Agent, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, to pay the amount in cash payable by SMMC  pursuant to _Section
3.01(b)_ and _Section 3.03(i)_ or the Per Share Stock Consideration, as
applicable, out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with the Merger Payment
Schedule and the other applicable provisions contained in this  Agreement.
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The cash portion of
the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by SMMC;
_provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed  by
the United States of America in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation,
respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
banker's  acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion,
or in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category
granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a
combination of the foregoing  and, in any such case, no such instrument shall
have a maturity exceeding three (3) months. To the extent such fund increases
for any reason above the level required to make prompt payment of any
outstanding Per Share Cash Consideration to be paid  in pursuant to _Section
3.01(b)(i)_ , SMMC shall, following such prompt payment, be the sole owner of
any amounts left over in such Exchange Fund.

 


 

 

 

26  


 

 

(b)

 

_Exchange Procedures_. Concurrently with the mailing of the Consent
Solicitation Statement, SMMC shall direct the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of Company Common  Stock or Company Preferred Stock evidenced by
certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") entitled to receive the Per Share Stock
Consideration or Per Share Cash Consideration, as applicable, pursuant to
_Section 3.01_ : a letter of transmittal,  which shall be in a form
reasonably acceptable to SMMC and the Company (the " _Letter of Transmittal_
") and which shall (A) have customary representations and warranties as to
title, authorization, execution and delivery, (B) have a customary  release
of all claims against SMMC and the Company arising out of or related to such
holder's ownership of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock, (C) specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the  Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and (D) include instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant to the Letter of
Transmittal. Within two (2) Business Days (but  in no event prior to the
Effective Time) after the surrender to the Exchange Agent of all Certificates
held by such holder for cancellation (to the extent such shares of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock are or were certificated),  together
with a Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificates shall
be entitled to  receive in exchange therefore, and SMMC shall direct the
Exchange Agent to deliver the Per Share Stock Consideration or the Per Share
Cash Consideration, as applicable, in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 3.01_ and _Section 3.02_ ,  and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
3.03_ , each Certificate entitled to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration
or the Per Share Cash Consideration, as  applicable, in accordance with
_Section 3.01_ shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Per Share Stock
Consideration or the Per Share Cash Consideration, as applicable,  that such
holder is entitled to receive in accordance with the provisions of _Section
3.01_.

 


 

 

(c)

 

_No Further Rights in Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock_. The
Per Share Stock Consideration and the Per Share Cash Consideration, as
applicable, payable  upon conversion of the Company Shares (including Company
Shares resulting from the conversion of the Company Preferred Stock and the
Company Warrant) in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have
been paid and issued in full  satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Company Shares.

 


 

 

(d)

 

_Adjustments to Per Share Consideration_. The Per Share Stock Consideration
and the Per Share Cash Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect
appropriately the effect of  any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to SMMC Elected Common
Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior  to the Effective Time.

 


 

 

(e)

 

_Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for one-year after the
Effective Time  shall be delivered to SMMC, upon demand, and any holders of
Company Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _Section 3.03_
shall thereafter look only to SMMC for the Per Share Stock Consideration or
the Per Share Cash Consideration,  as applicable. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Company Shares as of a date which is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall,  to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of SMMC free and clear of any claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 


 

 

 

27  


 

 

(f)

 

_No Liability_. None of the Exchange Agent, SMMC, the Surviving Corporation or
the Surviving Entity shall be liable to any holder of Company Shares
(including shares of  Company Common Stock resulting from the conversion of
the Company Preferred Stock and the Company Warrant) for any such Company
Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash delivered
to a public official pursuant to any  abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law in accordance with this _Section 3.03_.

 


 

 

(g)

 

_Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity, SMMC, First
Merger Sub, Second  Merger Sub and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from amounts (including shares, options or other property)
otherwise payable, issuable or transferable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Company Options or Company  Shares (including shares of Company
Common Stock resulting from the conversion of the Company Preferred Stock and
the Company Warrant) such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to such payment, issuance or transfer under the  United States
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ ") or any provision of state,
local or non U.S. Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or
withheld and timely paid to the applicable Governmental Authority in
accordance with  applicable Law, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid, issued or
transferred to the holder of the Company Securities (or intended recipients of
compensatory payments) in respect of  which such deduction and withholding
was made.

 


 

 

(h)

 

_Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to  be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Per
Share Stock Consideration or Per Share Cash Consideration, as applicable, that
such holder is otherwise entitled to  receive pursuant to, and in accordance
with, the provisions of _Section 3.01_ and _Section 3.02(b)_.

 


 

 

(i)

 

_Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip or shares representing
fractional shares of SMMC Elected Common Stock shall be issued upon the
exchange of Company Shares  and such fractional share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of
SMMC or a holder of shares of SMMC Elected Common Stock. Each holder of
Company Shares who would otherwise have been entitled to  receive a fraction
of a share of SMMC Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates
surrendered by such holder and after aggregating all fractional shares that
would otherwise be received by such holders into whole shares) shall
receive,  in lieu thereof, an amount equal to such fractional amount
multiplied by the average weighted price per share of SMMC Class A Common
Stock on the Nasdaq (as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. or, if not reported by
Bloomberg, L.P., in another authoritative  source mutually selected by SMMC
and the Company) on each of the five (5) consecutive trading days ending with
the last complete trading day prior to the Closing Date.

 


 

 

 

28  


 

 

(j)

 

_Merger Payment Schedule_. At least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to SMMC and the Exchange Agent a
schedule (the " _Merger    Payment Schedule_ ") that is true, correct and
consistent with the Forms of Election received by the Company pursuant to
_Section 3.02_ showing (i) the percentage allocation of the Stock
Consideration to each of the holders of Company  Securities at the Closing as
well as the corresponding number (and class) of shares of SMMC Elected Common
Stock to be issued to such holders of Company Common Stock in accordance with
_Section 3.01_ and the Company Charter, (ii) the Per Share  Cash
Consideration to be paid to each of the holders of Company Common Stock in
accordance with _Section 3.01_ and the Company Charter and (iii) with respect
to each holder of Company Securities, the Earnout Pro Rata Portion in respect
of such  holder's Company Common Stock and the Earnout Pro Rata Portion in
respect of such holder's Company Options. The Merger Payment Schedule shall
also include (A) the name of each Company Securityholder and any  other
holder of Equity Equivalents and (B) the number and type of Company Shares,
Company Options and other Equity Equivalents held by each holder thereof. For
the avoidance of doubt, SMMC and the Company agree that (1) if no Company
Stockholder  makes a Cash Election or receives cash pursuant to _Section
3.03(i),_ the aggregate number of shares of SMMC Elected Common Stock to be
issued in respect of Company Shares and issuable in respect of converted
Company Options pursuant to the  terms of this Agreement shall be 118,950,452
and the Merger Payment Schedule shall reflect the same, (2) if Company
Stockholders make a number of Cash Elections that result in the Aggregate Cash
Election Amount equaling or exceeding the Cash  Consideration Cap (assuming a
Cap Adjustment Amount and Applicable Redemption Amount equal to zero (0)), the
number of shares of SMMC Elected Common Stock to be issued as Per Share Stock
Consideration shall be 101,150,452 and (3) in no event shall  the cash
payable by SMMC or any other person in respect of Company Shares and the
Company Warrant pursuant to the terms of this Agreement exceed the Cash
Consideration Cap and the Merger Payment Schedule shall reflect the same.

 


 

 

 

SECTION 3.04 __

 

 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Company Shares thereafter  on the records of the Company. From

Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such Company Common Stock  or Company Preferred
Stock, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law. On or after
the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or SMMC
for any reason shall be converted into the Per Share Stock Consideration  or
Per Share Cash Consideration, as applicable, in accordance with the provisions
of _Section 3.01_.

Sub or Sponsor in connection with the Transactions or otherwise in connection
with SMMC's operations (together with written invoices and wire transfer
instructions for the payment thereof) (collectively, the " _Outstanding   
SMMC Transaction Expenses_ "). On the Closing Date, SMMC shall pay or cause to
be paid, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, all such Outstanding
SMMC Transaction Expenses.

 


 

 

(c)

 

Except as set forth in this _Section 3.05_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, all

SECTION 3.06 __

 

 _Appraisal Rights_.

 

 


 

 

(a)

 

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and to the
extent available under the DGCL, Company Shares that are outstanding

Stockholders who shall have neither voted in favor of the First Merger nor
consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing
appraisal for such Company Shares in accordance with  Section 262 of the DGCL
and otherwise complied with all of the provisions of the DGCL relevant to the

shall have no right to receive, the Per Share Stock Consideration or Per Share
Cash Consideration, as applicable, unless and until such stockholder fails to

and  payment under the DGCL. Any stockholder of the Company who fails to
perfect or who effectively withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its rights
to appraisal of his, her or its Dissenting Shares under Section 262 of the
DGCL shall thereupon be  deemed to have been converted into, and to have
become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Per Share Stock Consideration or Per Share Cash Consideration, as applicable,
without any interest thereon, upon surrender, if  applicable, in the manner
provided in _Section 3.03(b)_ , of the Certificate or Certificates that

not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned  or delayed), make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such
demands.

SMMC has filed all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents,
including any exhibits thereto, required to be filed by it with the Securities
and Exchange  Commission (the " _SEC_ ") since June 19, 2019, together with
any amendments, restatements or supplements thereto (collectively, the " _SMMC
SEC Reports_ "). SMMC has heretofore furnished to the Company true and correct
copies of all material  amendments and modifications that have not been filed
by SMMC with the SEC to all agreements, documents and other instruments that
previously had been filed by SMMC with the SEC and are currently in effect. As
of their respective dates, the SMMC SEC  Reports (i) complied in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and (ii)  did not, at
the time they were filed, or, if amended, as of the date of such amendment,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made  therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Each director and executive officer of SMMC has
filed with the SEC on a timely basis all documents required with respect to
SMMC by Section 16(a) of the Exchange  Act.

 


 

 

 

56  


 

 

(b)

 

Each of the financial statements (including, in each case, any notes thereto)
contained in the SMMC SEC Reports was prepared in accordance with GAAP
(applied on a consistent  basis) and Regulation S‑X and Regulation S-K, as
applicable, throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited financial statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and each fairly  presents, in all material
respects, the financial position, results of operations, changes in
stockholders equity and cash flows of SMMC as at the respective dates thereof
and for the respective periods indicated therein, (subject, in the case of 
unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments which have
not had, and would not reasonably be expected to individually or in the
aggregate be material). SMMC has no off-balance sheet arrangements that are
not disclosed in the  SMMC SEC Reports. No financial statements other than
those of SMMC are required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated
financial statements of SMMC.

 


 

 

(c)

 

Except as and to the extent set forth in the SMMC SEC Reports, neither SMMC,
First Merger Sub nor Second Merger Sub has any liability or obligation of a
nature (whether  accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) required to be
reflected on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, except for (i)
liabilities that were incurred in the ordinary course of SMMC's, First Merger
Sub's or Second Merger Sub's  business, (ii) liabilities or obligations
disclosed in the SMMC Disclosure Schedule or (iii) such other liabilities and
obligations which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to SMMC.

 


 

 

(d)

 

SMMC is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable listing and
corporate governance rules and regulations of the Nasdaq.

 


 

 

(e)

 

SMMC has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure controls and
procedures are designed  to ensure that material information relating to SMMC
and other material information required to be disclosed by SMMC in the reports
and other documents that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported  within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material
information is accumulated and communicated to SMMC's principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely 
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting SMMC's
principal executive officer  and principal financial officer to material
information required to be included in SMMC's periodic reports required under
the Exchange Act.

 


 

 

 

57  


 

 

(f)

 

SMMC maintains systems of internal control over financial reporting that are
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and  the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP, including policies and procedures sufficient
to provide reasonable assurance: (i) that SMMC maintains records that in
reasonable detail accurately and fairly  reflect, in all material respects,
its transactions and dispositions of assets; (ii) that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP; (iii) that receipts and expenditures are being  made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and its board of
directors; and (iv) regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of its assets that could have a material
effect on its financial  statements. SMMC has delivered to the Company a true
and complete copy of any disclosure (or, if unwritten, a summary thereof) by
any representative of SMMC to SMMC's independent auditors relating to any
material weaknesses in internal controls and  any significant deficiencies in
the design or operation of internal controls that would adversely affect the
ability of SMMC to record, process, summarize and report financial data. SMMC
has no knowledge of any fraud or whistle-blower allegations,  whether or not
material, that involve management or other employees or consultants who have
or had a significant role in the internal control over financial reporting of
SMMC. Since March 31, 2020, there have been no material changes in SMMC 
internal control over financial reporting.

 


 

 

(g)

 

There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit made by SMMC to
any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or
director of SMMC and  SMMC has not taken any action prohibited by Section 402
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 


 

 

(h)

 

Neither SMMC (including any employee thereof) nor SMMC's independent auditors
has identified or been made aware of (i) any significant deficiency or
material weakness in the  system of internal accounting controls utilized by
SMMC, (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves SMMC's management
or other employees who have a role in the preparation of financial statements
or the internal accounting controls  utilized by SMMC or (iii) any claim or
allegation regarding any of the foregoing.

 


 

 

(i)

 

As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding SEC comments from the SEC with
respect to the SMMC SEC Reports. To the knowledge of SMMC, none of the SMMC
SEC Reports filed  on or prior to the date hereof is subject to ongoing SEC
review or investigation as of the date hereof.

 


 

 

 

SECTION 5.08 __

SECTION 5.12 __

SECTION 5.13 __

 

 _SMMC Trust Fund_. As of the date of this Agreement, SMMC has no less than
two hundred fifty million dollars ($250,000,000) in the trust fund established
by SMMC for the benefit of its  public stockholders (the " _Trust Fund_ ")
maintained in a trust account (the " _Trust Account_ "). The monies of such
Trust Account are invested in United States Government securities within the
meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment  Company Act of 1940 (the "
_Investment Company Act_ "), having a maturity of 185 days or less, or in
money market funds meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3)
and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company  Act and
held in trust by Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, a New York
Corporation (the " _Trustee_ ") pursuant to the Investment Management Trust
Agreement, dated as of June 19, 2019, between SMMC and the Trustee (the "
_Trust  Agreement_ "). The Trust Agreement has not been amended or modified
and is a valid and binding obligation of SMMC and is in full force and effect
and is enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the Remedies
Exceptions. SMMC has  complied in all material respects with the terms of the
Trust Agreement and is not in material breach thereof or material default
thereunder and there does not exist under the Trust Agreement any event which,
with the giving of notice or the lapse  of time, would constitute such a
material breach or material default by SMMC or the Trustee. There are no
separate Contracts, side letters or other understandings (whether written or
unwritten, express or implied): (i) between SMMC and the  Trustee that would
cause the description of the Trust Agreement in the SMMC SEC Reports to be
inaccurate in any material respect; or (ii) to the knowledge of SMMC, that
would entitle any person (other than stockholders of SMMC who shall have 
elected to redeem their shares of SMMC Class A Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer) to any portion of the proceeds in the Trust Account. Prior to the
Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust Account may be released except:
(A) to pay income  and franchise Taxes from any interest income earned in the
Trust Account or fund regulatory compliance costs; and (B) upon the exercise
of Redemption Rights in accordance with the provisions of the SMMC
Organizational Documents. As of the date  hereof, there are no Actions
pending or, to the knowledge of SMMC, threatened in writing with respect to
the Trust Account. Upon consummation of the First Merger and notice thereof to
the Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement, SMMC shall cause  the Trustee
to, and the Trustee shall thereupon be obligated to, release to SMMC as
promptly as practicable, the Trust Funds in accordance with the Trust
Agreement at which point the Trust Account shall terminate; _provided_ ,
_however_ ,  that the liabilities and obligations of SMMC due and owing or
incurred at or prior to the Effective Time shall be paid as and when due,
including all amounts payable (a) to stockholders of SMMC who shall have
exercised their Redemption Rights and  (b) to the Trustee for fees and costs
incurred in accordance with the Trust Agreement. As of the date hereof,
assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company
herein and the compliance by the Company with its respective  obligations
hereunder, SMMC has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the use
of funds in the Trust Account will not be satisfied or funds available in the
Trust Account will not be available to SMMC at the Effective Time (other
than  any funds to be distributed to stockholders of SMMC who have elected to
redeem their shares of SMMC Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Offer).

SECTION 6.03 __

 

 _Claims Against Trust Account_. Reference is made to the final prospectus of
SMMC, dated as of June 20, 2019 and filed with the SEC (Registration No.
333-231881) on June 20, 2019 (the " _Prospectus_ ").    The Company hereby
represents and warrants that it has read the Prospectus and understands that
SMMC has established the Trust Account containing the proceeds of its initial
public offering (the " _IPO_ ") and the overallotment shares acquired  by its
underwriters and from certain private placements occurring simultaneously with
the IPO (including interest accrued from time to time thereon) for the benefit
of SMMC's public stockholders (including overallotment shares acquired by
SMMC's  underwriters the " _Public Stockholders_ "), and that, except as
otherwise described in the Prospectus, SMMC may disburse monies from the Trust
Account only: (a) to the Public Stockholders in the event they elect to redeem
their SMMC Class A  Common Stock pursuant to the Offer in connection with the
consummation of SMMC's initial business combination (as such term is used in
the Prospectus) (the " _Business Combination_ ") or in connection with an
extension of its deadline to  consummate a Business Combination, (b) to the
Public Stockholders if SMMC fails to consummate a Business Combination within
twenty-four (24) months after the closing of the IPO, (c) with respect to any
interest earned on the amounts held in the  Trust Account, as necessary to
pay any Taxes, or (d) to SMMC after or concurrently with the consummation of a
Business Combination. For and in consideration of SMMC entering into this
Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the  receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Company hereby agrees on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates do
now or  shall at any time hereafter have any right, title, interest or claim
of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account or distributions
therefrom, or make any claim against the Trust Account (including any
distributions therefrom), regardless of  whether such claim arises as a
result of, in connection with or relating in any way to, this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents or any proposed or actual business relationship between
SMMC or its Representatives, on the one hand, and the  Company or its
Representatives, on the other hand, or any other matter, and regardless of
whether such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory
of legal liability (any and all such claims are collectively referred to 
hereafter as the " _Released Claims_ "). The Company on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates hereby irrevocably waives any Released Claims that the Company
or any of its Affiliates may have against the Trust Account (including any
distributions  therefrom) now or in the future as a result of, or arising out
of, any negotiations or Contracts with SMMC or its Representatives and will
not seek recourse against the Trust Account (including any distributions
therefrom) for any reason whatsoever  (including for an alleged breach of
this Agreement or any other agreement with SMMC or its Affiliates). The
Company agrees and acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is material to
this Agreement and specifically relied upon by SMMC and its  Affiliates to
induce SMMC to enter in this Agreement, and the Company further intends and
understands such waiver to be valid, binding and enforceable against the
Company and each of its Affiliates under applicable Law. To the extent the
Company  or any of its Affiliates commences any action or proceeding based
upon, in connection with, relating to or arising out of any matter relating to
SMMC or its Representatives, which proceeding seeks, in whole or in part,
monetary relief against SMMC  or its Representatives, the Company hereby
acknowledges and agrees that the Company's and its Affiliates' sole remedy
shall be against funds held outside of the Trust Account and that such claim
shall not permit the Company or its Affiliates (or  any person claiming on
any of their behalves or in lieu of any of them) to have any claim against the
Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) or any amounts contained
therein. In the event the Company or any of its Affiliates  commences any
action or proceeding based upon, in connection with, relating to or arising
out of any matter relating to SMMC or its Representatives, which proceeding
seeks, in whole or in part, relief against the Trust Account (including any 
distributions therefrom) or the Public Stockholders of SMMC, whether in the
form of money damages or injunctive relief, SMMC and its Representatives, as
applicable, shall be entitled to recover from the Company and its Affiliates
the associated  legal fees and costs in connection with any such action, in
the event SMMC or its Representatives, as applicable, prevails in such action
or proceeding. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
provisions of this paragraph  shall survive indefinitely with respect to the
obligations set forth in this Agreement.

insufficient. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as  a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (i) any claim that it is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as

immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced
in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of  execution of judgment, execution of judgment
or otherwise) and (iii) that (A) the Action in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such Action is improper or (C) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be  enforced in or by such
courts.

 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a trial by

parties hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any
other party has represented, expressly or otherwise,  that such other party
would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver
and (b) acknowledges that it and the other hereto have been induced to enter
into this Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable, by, among other 
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section 10.07_.

damages or otherwise, in addition to any other remedy to which they  are
entitled at law or in equity as expressly permitted in this Agreement. Each of
the parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific
performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement
under any  Law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

_Annex I_

 


 

 

Earnout Merger Consideration

 


 

 

This _Annex I_ sets forth the terms for the calculation of the number (if any)
of $12.50 Earnout Shares and $15.00 Earnout Shares, as applicable. Terms used
but not defined in this _Annex I_   shall have the meanings ascribed to such
terms in the other parts of this Agreement to which this _Annex I_ is a part.

 


 

 

1.

 

12.50 Share Price Milestone.

 


 

 

a.

 

If the closing share price of SMMC Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds
$12.50 per share for any 20 trading days within any consecutive 30-trading day
period that occurs  after the Closing Date and on or prior to the five
(5)-year anniversary of the Closing Date (the first occurrence of the
foregoing is referred to herein as the " _$12.50_ _Share Price Milestone_ ",
and such date is referred to as the " _$12.50    Share Price Milestone
Date_ "), then, except as provided in _Section 1(b)_ , SMMC shall issue, as
promptly as practicable, to each holder of Company Common Stock and/or Company
Options that had an Earnout Pro Rata Portion exceeding zero (0),  a number of
shares of SMMC Class A Common Stock equal to such holder's Earnout Pro Rata
Portion of 6,000,000 shares (such number of shares being referred to as the "
_$12.50_ _Earnout Shares_ ").

 


 

 

b.

 

Notwithstanding anything in _Section 1(a)_ to the contrary, to the extent that
any portion of the $12.50 Earnout Shares that would otherwise be issued to a
holder of  Company Securities hereunder relates to a Converted Option that
remains unvested as of the $12.50 Share Price Milestone Date (each such
option, a " _$12.50 Unvested Converted Option_ "), then in lieu of issuing
such $12.50 Earnout Shares, SMMC  shall instead issue, as soon as practicable
following the later of (1) the occurrence of the $12.50 Share Price Milestone
and (2) SMMC's filing of a Form S-8 Registration Statement, to each holder of
a $12.50 Unvested Converted Option, an award of  restricted stock units of
SMMC for a number of shares of SMMC Class A Common Stock equal to such portion
of the $12.50 Earnout Shares issuable with respect to the $12.50 Unvested
Converted Option (such number of shares being referred to as the "
_$12.50    Earnout RSUs_ "). A holder of a $12.50 Unvested Converted Option
shall only be granted $12.50 Earnout RSUs if such holder remains in continuous
service to the Company or its successor as of the $12.50 Share Price Milestone
Date and the applicable  grant date. Such $12.50 Earnout RSUs shall vest in
equal amounts (or as close as possible, with any excess shares vesting on the
last vesting date) over the remaining vesting events of the applicable $12.50
Unvested Converted Option and shall be  subject to the same vesting
conditions as applied to the applicable $12.50 Unvested Converted Option. In
the event that a Company Securityholder had more than one grant of Converted
Options as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, the issuance  of the
Earnout Securities shall be apportioned among each of such grants of Converted
Options as if each grant were held by a different person.

 


 

 

2.

 

15.00 Share Price Milestone.

 


 

 

a.

 

If the closing share price of SMMC Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds
$15.00 per share for any 20 trading days within any consecutive 30-trading day
period that occurs  after the Closing Date and on or prior to the five
(5)-year anniversary of the Closing Date (the first occurrence of the
foregoing is referred to herein as the " _$15.00_ _Share Price Milestone_ ",
and such date is referred to as the " _$15.00    Share Price Milestone
Date_ "), then, except as provided in _Section 2(b)_ , SMMC shall issue, as
promptly as practicable, to each holder of Company Common Stock and/or Company
Options that had an Earnout Pro Rata Portion exceeding zero (0),  a number of
shares of SMMC Class A Common Stock equal to such holder's Earnout Pro Rata
Portion of 6,000,000 shares (such number of shares being referred to as the "
_$_ _15.00 Earnout Shares_ " and, together with the $12.50 Earnout Shares, 
the " _Earnout Shares_ ").

 


 

 

 

I-1  


 

 

b.

 

Notwithstanding anything in _Section 2(a)_ to the contrary, to the extent that
any portion of the $15.00 Earnout Shares that would otherwise be issued to a
holder of  Company Securities hereunder relates to a Converted Option that
remains unvested as of the $15.00 Share Price Milestone Date (each such
option, a " _$15.00 Unvested Converted Option_ "), then in lieu of issuing
such $15.00 Earnout Shares, SMMC  shall instead issue, as soon as practicable
following the later of (1) the occurrence of the $15.00 Share Price Milestone
and (2) SMMC's filing of a Form S-8 Registration Statement, to each holder of
a $15.00 Unvested Converted Option, an award of  restricted stock units of
SMMC for a number of shares of SMMC Class A Common Stock equal to such portion
of the $15.00 Earnout Shares issuable with respect to the $15.00 Unvested
Converted Option (such number of shares being referred to as the "
_$15.00    Earnout RSUs_ " and together with the $12.50 Earnout RSUs, the "
_Earnout RSUs_ "). A holder of a $15.00 Unvested Converted Option shall only
be granted $15.00 Earnout RSUs if such holder remains in continuous service to
the Company or its  successor as of the $15.00 Share Price Milestone Date and
the applicable grant date. Such $15.00 Earnout RSUs shall vest in equal
amounts (or as close as possible, with any excess shares vesting on the last
vesting date) over the remaining vesting  events of the applicable $15.00
Unvested Converted Option and shall be subject to the same vesting conditions
as applied to the applicable $15.00 Unvested Converted Option. In the event
that a Company Securityholder had more than one grant of  Converted Options
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, the issuance of the Earnout
Securities shall be apportioned among each of such grants of Converted Options
as if each grant were held by a different person.

 


 

 

3.

 

For the avoidance of doubt, if the condition for more than one Milestone is
achieved, the Earnout Securities to be earned in connection with such
Milestone shall be cumulative  with any Earnout Securities earned prior to
such time in connection with the achievement of any other Milestone;
_provided_ that, for avoidance of doubt, Earnout Securities in respect of each
Milestone will be issued and earned only once and  the aggregate Earnout
Securities issued shall in no event exceed 12,000,000 shares of SMMC Class A
Common Stock.

 


 

 

4.

 

If, at or following the five (5)-year anniversary of the Closing Date, the
$12.50 Share Price Milestone and/or the $15.00 Share Price Milestone have not
occurred, none of the  Earnout Securities shall be issued.

 


 

 

5.

 

In the event that after the Closing and prior the five (5)-year anniversary of
the Closing Date, (i) there is a Change of Control (or a definitive agreement
providing for a  Change of Control has been entered into prior to the five
(5)-year anniversary of the Closing Date and such Change of Control is
ultimately consummated, even if such consummation occurs after the five
(5)-year anniversary of the Closing Date), (ii)  any liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of SMMC (whether voluntary of involuntary) is initiated, (iii)
any bankruptcy, reorganization, debt arrangement or similar proceeding under
any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, or any dissolution or  liquidation
proceeding, is instituted by or against SMMC, or a receiver is appointed for
SMMC or a substantial part of its assets or properties or (iv) SMMC makes an
assignment for the benefit of creditors, or  petitions or applies to any
Governmental Authority for, or consents or acquiesces to, the appointment of a
custodian, receiver or trustee for all or substantially all of its assets or
properties (each of _clauses_ _(i)_ through _(iv)_ ,  an " _Acceleration
Event_ "), then any Earnout Securities that have not been previously issued by
SMMC (whether or not previously earned) shall be deemed earned and issued by
SMMC to the holders of Company Securities as of immediately prior to the 
Effective Time (but in the case of Company Options, only such Company Options
that are vested as of such date (after giving effect to any acceleration of
vesting of such Company Options)) upon such Acceleration Event pursuant to
_Section 3.01_   and _Section 3.07_ unless, in the case of an Acceleration
Event that is a Change of Control, the value of the consideration to be
received by the holders of the SMMC Class A Common Stock in such Change of
Control transaction is less than the  stock price threshold applicable to the
$12.50 Share Price Milestone and/or the $15.00 Share Price Milestone, as
applicable; _provided_ , that the determinations of such consideration and
value shall be determined in good faith by the  disinterested members of the
SMMC Board; and provided, further that such Earnout Securities that are not
deemed earned as of such Change in Control transaction shall be cancelled to
the extent that such Change in Control transaction consists of a  sale of
SMMC by merger, business combination or otherwise in which the stockholders of
SMMC receive only cash consideration for their shares.

 


 

 

 

I-2  


 

 

6.

 

For purposes hereof, a " _Change of Control_ " means the occurrence in a
single transaction or as a result of a series of related transactions, of one
or more of the  following events:

 


 

 

a.

 

any person or any group of persons acting together which would constitute a
"group" for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act or any successor
provisions thereto (a " _Group_ ")    (excluding a corporation or other
entity owned, directly or indirectly, by the stockholders of SMMC in
substantially the same proportions as their ownership of stock of SMMC) (x) is
or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of  securities of
SMMC representing more than fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power
of SMMC's then outstanding voting securities or (y) has or acquires control of
the SMMC Board;

 


 

 

b.

 

a merger, consolidation, reorganization or similar business combination
transaction involving SMMC, and, immediately after the consummation of such
transaction or series of  transactions, either (x) the SMMC Board immediately
prior to the merger or consolidation does not constitute at least a majority
of the board of directors of the company surviving the merger or, if the
surviving company is a Subsidiary, the ultimate  parent thereof, or (y) the
voting securities of SMMC immediately prior to such merger or consolidation do
not continue to represent or are not converted into more than fifty percent
(50%) of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting  securities
of the person resulting from such transaction or series of transactions or, if
the surviving company is a Subsidiary, the ultimate parent thereof; or

 


 

 

c.

 

the sale, lease or other disposition, directly or indirectly, by SMMC of all
or substantially all of the assets of SMMC and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, other than such  sale or other disposition by SMMC of all or
substantially all of the assets of SMMC and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, to an entity at least a majority of the combined voting power of the
voting securities of which are owned by stockholders of  SMMC.

 


 

 

 

I-3  


 

 

7.

 

If SMMC shall, at any time or from time to time, after the date hereof effect
a subdivision, stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, combination,
recapitalization or  similar transaction affecting the outstanding shares of
SMMC Class A Common Stock, the number of Earnout Securities issuable pursuant
to, and the stock price targets set forth in, paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this
_Annex I_ , shall be equitably  adjusted for such subdivision, stock split,
stock dividend, reorganization, combination, recapitalization or similar
transaction. Any adjustment under this paragraph shall become effective at the
close of business on the date the subdivision or  combination becomes
effective (which shall be the "ex" date, if any, with respect to any such
event). For the avoidance of doubt and without duplication, to the extent that
SMMC Class A Common Stock has been exchanged for Series 1 Common Stock, this 
Annex 1 shall be read such that each reference to SMMC Class A Common Stock
shall refer instead to Series 1 Common Stock.

 


 

 

8.

 

All Earnout RSUs to be issued hereunder shall be issued under and pursuant to
the terms and conditions of the SMMC 2020 Equity Incentive Plan and the
Earnout RSU Share Reserve  (as defined in the SMMC 2020 Equity Incentive
Plan) thereunder, and for purposes of clarity shall not reduce the Share
Reserve (as defined in the SMMC 2020 Equity Incentive Plan) under such Plan.

 


 

 

9.

 

Notwithstanding anything contained in the Agreement or this Annex I to the
contrary, to the extent that any portion of the $12.50 Earnout Shares or
$15.00 Earnout Shares that  would otherwise be issued to a holder of Company
Securities hereunder relates to a share of Company Common Stock that was
converted into SMMC Class C Common Stock in accordance with the Agreement (the
" _Nonvoting Request Shares_ ") then in lieu  of issuing such $12.50 Earnout
Shares or $15.00 Earnout Shares, as applicable, SMMC shall instead issue, as
soon as practicable following the applicable Milestone, a number of shares of
Class 2 Common Stock (as defined in the SMMC AandR Charter)  equal to such
portion of the applicable Earnout Shares issuable with respect to the
Nonvoting Request Shares.
