2. _PURCHASE AND SALE; CLOSING_.

 



 

2.1 _Agreement to Purchase_. In reliance upon the representations, warranties
and covenants of the Buyer contained herein, and on the terms and subject to
the conditions herein set forth, each Seller agrees to sell and deliver, or
cause to be sold and delivered, the Stock owned by such Seller, as set forth
in Annex 1, to the Buyer, free and clear of all Encumbrances other than
restrictions on transfer under applicable state or federal securities Laws. In
reliance upon the representations, warranties and covenants of the Sellers
contained herein, and on the terms and subject to the conditions herein set
forth, the Buyer agrees to purchase, or cause to be purchased, such Stock for
an aggregate purchase price equal to Four Hundred Twenty Five Million Dollars
($425,000,000) (the " _Purchase Price_ "), subject to certain adjustments as
set forth herein, and payable in cash and MFRM Stock as set forth herein.

 



 

2.2 _Payment of Purchase Price_.

 



 

(a) _Cash Closing Payment_. At Closing, the Buyer shall pay in accordance with
this _Section 2.2_ an aggregate amount in cash equal to the product of (i)
90%, multiplied by (ii) the Closing Price (such product, the " _Cash Closing
Price_ "). The Buyer shall pay the Escrow Amount and the Secondary Escrow
Amount to the Escrow Agent, and the Buyer shall reduce the Cash Closing Price
payable to the Sellers by the Escrow Amount and the Secondary Escrow Amount
(the Cash Closing Price as reduced by the Escrow Amount and the Secondary
Escrow Amount, the " _Cash Closing Payment_ "). The Buyer shall pay to each
Seller an amount equal to the product of (x) such Sellers Allocation
Percentage multiplied by (y) the Cash Closing Payment, such payment to be made
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such Sellers account
specified in writing by the Shareholder Representative not later than three
(3) Business Days prior to Closing. Each Seller hereby agrees that the Buyer
shall have no responsibility to see to

 



      
 

 



 

the payment of such amounts to the appropriate Seller, its sole responsibility
being to make payments to such accounts as are specified in writing by the
Shareholder Representative.

 



 

(b) _MFRM Stock_. At Closing, the Buyer shall deliver to the Sellers, in the
aggregate, a number of shares of common stock of MFRM (the " _MFRM Stock_ ")
equal to the quotient of (i) 10% of the Closing Price, divided by (ii) the
Share Price (the " _MFRM Stock Consideration_ "). Each Seller will be issued a
number of shares of MFRM Stock equal to the product of (x) such Sellers
Allocation Percentage multiplied by (y) the MFRM Stock Consideration. Each
share of MFRM Stock issued to the Sellers will reflect the restrictive legends
set forth in _Exhibit A-1_ if and only if the MFRM Stock is issued pursuant
to the section 4(2) exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each
share of MFRM Stock that is issued to Killgore Trust or Carlsen Trust will
reflect the restrictive legends set forth in _Exhibit A-1_, if applicable,
and the restrictive legends set forth in _Exhibit A-2_. Fractional shares
will not be issued and in lieu thereof the Buyer will pay in cash to each
Seller in respect of any such fractional share the value thereof, based on the
Share Price. The shares of MFRM Stock issued to any Seller will not bear the
restrictive legends set forth in _Exhibit A-1_ if the MFRM Stock is issued
pursuant to the exemption from registration under section 3(a)(10) of the
Securities Act.

 



 

(c) _Escrow Amount and Secondary Escrow Amount_. At Closing, the Buyer shall
deposit the Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Escrow Agent, such
Escrow Amount to be held by the Escrow Agent in a segregated account in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement (the " _Escrow Account_ "). At Closing,
the Buyer shall deposit the Secondary Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Escrow Agent, such Secondary Escrow Amount to be held by the Escrow Agent in a
segregated account separate and apart from the Escrow Account for the sole and
exclusive benefit of and access and recourse by the Shareholder
Representative, acting on behalf of the Sellers, in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement (the " _Secondary Escrow Account_ ").

 



 

2.3 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) _Estimated Net Working Capital_. At least five (5) Business Days prior to
Closing, the Shareholder Representative shall deliver to the Buyer its good
faith estimate of the Net Working Capital as of the Companys most recent
fiscal period end for which the books are closed (such books shall be closed
not later than fifteen (15) days after the end of the applicable period) (the
" _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "). The Buyer shall be given access to the
books and records and other information of the Company and the opportunity to
consult with the Shareholder Representative for purposes of confirming or
disputing the Estimated Net Working Capital; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
the Shareholder Representative and the Buyer cannot agree on the Estimated Net
Working Capital, the Estimated Net Working Capital shall be deemed to be equal
to the arithmetic mean of the Shareholder Representatives and the Buyers
respective good faith determinations thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, no
adjustments to the Closing Price, including any calculations of Estimated Net
Working Capital or Final Net Working Capital, will double count any amounts
used in determining the Closing Price or any adjustments thereto.

 



 

(b) _Final Net Working Capital_. Within ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date, the Buyer shall submit to the Shareholder Representative its written
calculations,

 



      
 

 



 

prepared in accordance with GAAP and the Working Capital Methodology (with the
addition of new line items thereto as may be required by changes in Current
Assets or Current Liabilities) of the Net Working Capital as of the Sunday
immediately preceding the Closing Date (the " _Final Net Working Capital_ "),
accompanied by the Buyers work papers supporting such calculations and
Companys balance sheet as of 11:59 p.m. on the Sunday immediately preceding
the Closing Date (the " _Final Balance Sheet_ "). The Shareholder
Representative and his representatives shall be provided access, during normal
business hours following reasonable advance notice and in a manner that does
not unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Buyer or the Company, to
all materials, records (including work papers, schedules, memoranda and other
documents) and personnel of the Buyer or the Company reasonably necessary for
the Shareholder Representative to verify the amount of the Final Net Working
Capital. The Final Net Working Capital and the Final Balance Sheet submitted
by the Buyer to the Shareholder Representative shall become final and binding
upon the Buyer and the Sellers thirty (30) days after delivery thereof to the
Shareholder Representative (the " _Purchase Price Review Period_ "), unless
the Shareholder Representative, within the Purchase Price Review Period,
provides written notice to the Buyer disputing the amount of the Final Net
Working Capital or the Final Balance Sheet, specifying in reasonable detail
the amount, nature and basis of all disputed items (the " _Protest Letter_ "),
in which case the Final Net Working Capital and the Final Balance Sheet of the
Company shall not be binding upon the parties and such dispute shall be
resolved pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_.

 



 

(c) _Dispute_. If the Shareholder Representative delivers to the Buyer a
Protest Letter in accordance with _Section 2.3(b)_, the Buyer and the
Shareholder Representative shall attempt to resolve the matter(s) in dispute
in good faith. If any such dispute cannot be resolved by the Buyer and the
Shareholder Representative within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the
Protest Letter, then the specific matter(s) in dispute shall be submitted to
an independent accounting firm as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties,
which firm shall render its opinion as to such matter(s). Based on such
opinion, such independent accounting firm will then send to the Buyer and the
Shareholder Representative its determination on the specific matter(s) in
dispute, which determination shall be final and binding on the Buyer and the
Sellers. If, after taking into account the independent accounting firms
determination, the Final Net Working Capital is less than the sum of (i) the
Final Net Working Capital proposed by the Buyer plus (ii) 10% of the absolute
value of the Final Net Working Capital proposed by the Buyer, then the fees
and other costs charged by such independent accounting firm shall be borne by
the Sellers. If, after taking into account the independent accounting firms
determination, the Final Net Working Capital is greater than or equal to the
sum of (i) the Final Net Working Capital proposed by the Buyer plus (ii) 10%
of the absolute value of the Final Net Working Capital proposed by the Buyer,
then the fees and other costs charged by such independent accounting firm
shall be borne by the Buyer.

 



 

(d) _Final Adjustment_. Not later than five (5) Business Days after the final
determination of the Final Net Working Capital in accordance with this
_Section 2.3_, (i) if the amount of the Final Net Working Capital is greater
than the Estimated Net Working Capital, then the Buyer shall pay to each
Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to
the product of (A) such Sellers Allocation Percentage multiplied by (B) the
amount by which the Final Net Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Net
Working Capital, and (ii) if the amount of the Final Net Working Capital is
less than the Estimated Net Working Capital, the Sellers shall pay to the
Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to the
excess of the Estimated

 



      
 

 



 

Net Working Capital over the Final Net Working Capital (" _Working Capital
Deficit_ "). In the event a Party that is obligated to make a payment or cause
a payment to be made pursuant to this _Section 2.3(d)_ fails to make or cause
to be made such payment in full on or before the date due, the unpaid amount
shall bear interest at the Default Rate from (and including) the date due to
(but excluding) the date on which such unpaid amount is paid.

 



 

(e) _Closing Price Adjustment_. Within ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date, if the Buyer or the Shareholder Representative determines that the
amount of any item used to determine the Closing Price (other than the amounts
used with respect to items (A), (I), and (J) within the definition of Closing
Price) was inaccurate and the actual Closing Price differs from the Closing
Price on which the payments at the Closing were based, then the Buyer or the
Shareholder Representative shall submit to the Shareholder Representative or
the Buyer, as applicable, its determination of the correct amount of any such
item, accompanied by such partys work papers supporting such determination.
The procedures for the Shareholder Representative or the Buyer to protest any
such determination, for the parties to resolve any disputes related thereto,
and for final adjustment of the Closing Price shall be the same as the
procedures set forth in subsections _(b)_ \- _(d)_ above with respect to
Final Net Working Capital as modified as appropriate to reflect the party
making the initial determination that the Closing Price is inaccurate.

 



 

2.4 _Vendor Payments_. _Schedule 2.4_ sets forth all Contracts between the
Company or any Company Subsidiary and vendors of mattresses or bedding
products (the " _Company Mattress Vendors_ ") or any third party consumer
finance provider, including amounts payable under such Contracts to any such
Company Mattress Vendor or third party consumer finance provider (i) for
forfeiture or refund of new store funds, (ii) relating to the financing
pursuant to that certain Amended and Restated Retailer Program Agreement,
dated as of December 22, 2010, by and between GE Capital Retail Bank, formerly
known as GE Money Bank, the Company, and Sleep Country USA, LLC, as amended by
that certain First Amendment to Retailer Program Agreement, dated as of
September 1, 2013, as a result of (A) the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement or (B) the termination of the applicable Contracts with any Company
Mattress Vendor or (iii) relating to any termination of Contracts between the
Company or any Company Subsidiary and any Company Mattress Vendor. The Buyer
shall be liable for and pay if and when due all amounts referred to in clauses
(i) and (ii) of this _Section 2.4_ (the " _Buyer Vendor Payments_ "), and the
Sellers shall be liable for and pay if and when due any amounts referred to in
clause (iii) of this _Section 2.4_ (the " _Company Vendor Payments_ ").

 



 

2.5 _Extra Tax Cost; Extra Tax Benefit_.

 



 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Extra Tax Cost_ " means the net
incremental increase in the income Tax liabilities imposed on the Sellers
other than the ESOP, if any, (i) as a result of (A) the Company being required
to pay the Section 1374 Taxes, including the Section 1374 Taxes being included
in the Aggregate Deemed Sales Price (as such term is defined under applicable
Treasury Regulations under Section 338 of the Code) as an assumed liability,
and (B) the Section 1374 Taxes being treated as a loss and/or deduction
sustained by the Company or any Company Subsidiary under Section 1366(f)(2)
and/or other applicable Tax Law in any income Tax Returns of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary for the period ending on and including the Closing
Date, and (ii) taking into account the Tax effect on such liabilities of the
receipt of the payment of the Extra Tax Cost. In computing any Extra Tax Cost,
such computations shall be made (w) using the highest applicable marginal
income Tax rate or rates

 



      
 

 



 

applicable to a resident of Rocklin, California, with respect to each category
of gain, income, loss or deduction taken into account under clauses (i) and
(ii) of this _Section 2.5(a)_ (for example, capital gain, ordinary income,
capital loss, ordinary loss or ordinary deduction), (x) assuming any such loss
and/or deduction taken into account is deductible in full in the tax period or
periods of each of the Sellers that includes the Closing Date, (y) on a stand-
alone basis that ignores any items not attributable to the items described in
clauses (i) and (ii) of this _Section 2.5(a)_ and (z) otherwise in a manner
consistent with the principles reflected in the illustrative calculation set
forth in _Schedule 2.5_. The amount of any Extra Tax Cost shall in no event be
less than zero. For the avoidance of doubt, (I) the ESOP shall not be
considered a Seller for purposes of the determination of the Extra Tax Cost
and the calculation of the Extra Tax Cost shall not reflect or otherwise take
into account any amount attributable to the ESOP, and (II) any loss and/or
deduction attributable to the Section 1374 Taxes under Section 1366(f)(2)
and/or other applicable Tax Law shall be claimed in the applicable income Tax
Returns of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the period ending on
and including the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Extra Tax Benefit_ " means the net
incremental reduction in the income Tax liabilities imposed on the Sellers
other than the ESOP, if any, (i) as a result of (A) the Company being required
to pay the Section 1374 Taxes, including the Section 1374 Taxes being included
in the Aggregate Deemed Sales Price (as such term is defined under applicable
Treasury Regulations under Section 338 of the Code) as an assumed liability,
and (B) the Section 1374 Taxes being treated as a loss and/or deduction
sustained by the Company or any Company Subsidiary under Section 1366(f)(2)
and/or other applicable Tax Law in any income Tax Returns of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary for the period ending on and including the Closing
Date, and (ii) taking into account the Tax effect on such liabilities of the
payment of the Extra Tax Benefit. In computing any Extra Tax Benefit, such
computations shall be made (w) using the highest applicable marginal income
Tax rate or rates applicable to a resident of Rocklin, California, with
respect to each category of gain, income, loss or deduction taken into account
under clauses (i) and (ii) of this _Section 2.5(b)_ (for example, capital
gain, ordinary income, capital loss, ordinary loss or ordinary deduction), (x)
assuming any such loss and/or deduction taken into account is deductible in
full in the tax period or periods of each of the Sellers that includes the
Closing Date, (y) on a stand-alone basis that ignores any items not
attributable to the items described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this _Section
2.5(b)_ and (z) otherwise in a manner consistent with the principles reflected
in the illustrative calculation set forth in _Schedule 2.5_. The amount of any
Extra Tax Benefit shall in no event be less than zero. For the avoidance of
doubt, (I) the ESOP shall not be considered a Seller for purposes of the
determination of the Extra Tax Benefit and the calculation of the Extra Tax
Benefit shall not reflect or otherwise take into account any amount
attributable to the ESOP, and (II) any loss and/or deduction attributable to
the Section 1374 Taxes under Section 1366(f)(2) and/or other applicable Tax
Law shall be claimed in the applicable income Tax Returns of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries for the period ending on and including the Closing
Date.

 



 

(c) On or before the later of March 15, 2015 and five (5) Business Days after
the final determination of the Extra Tax Cost or Extra Tax Benefit (as the
case may be), as reflected on the Extra Tax Cost/Benefit Statement that has
become final and binding under _Section 2.10_, (i) if such Extra Tax
Cost/Benefit Statement reflects an Extra Tax Cost, then the Buyer shall pay to
each Seller (other than the ESOP), by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, an amount equal to the product of (A) such Sellers Allocation
Percentage (for the purposes of this _Section 2.5_, the Allocation Percentage
of

 



      
 

 



 

the ESOP is deemed to equal 0%) multiplied by (B) the amount of such Extra Tax
Cost, and (ii) if such Extra Tax Cost/Benefit Statement reflects an Extra Tax
Benefit, then the Sellers shall have no obligation to pay any portion of such
Extra Tax Benefit to the Buyer.

 



 

(d) In the event that any Section 338(h)(10) Election is disallowed as a
result of a "determination" (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code), each
of the Sellers shall repay to the Buyer any Extra Tax Cost received by such
Seller relating to the applicable jurisdiction(s), but only to the extent, if
any, that such Extra Tax Cost, as recalculated after taking into account such
disallowance, is reduced to an amount below the amount paid by the Buyer to
such Seller under this _Section 2.5_.

 



 

(e) If:

 



 

(i) as a result of an audit, examination, or administrative, judicial or other
proceeding the amount of the Section 1374 Taxes are adjusted pursuant to a
"determination" (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code and including any
comparable determination under applicable state or local Tax law), or due to a
proposed adjustment otherwise becoming final, and such adjustment results in
an increase or decrease in the Extra Tax Cost and/or the Extra Tax Benefit, as
the case may be, theretofore determined or redetermined under this Agreement,
including under this _Section 2.5_ and _Section 2.10_, or

 



 

(ii) as a result in a change in applicable Tax law (including the enactment of
an amendment to the Code that eliminates the Section 1374 Taxes by decreasing
the "recognition period" (as defined in Section 1374 of the Code) to a 5-year
period) or otherwise the Buyer determines that any previously filed Tax Return
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary covering a taxable period for which a
determination of Section 1374 Taxes is applicable should be amended to reflect
one or more changes affecting or otherwise relating to the determination of
the Section 1374 Taxes, and the filing of such amended Tax Return results in
an increase or decrease in the Extra Tax Cost and/or the Extra Tax Benefit, as
the case may be, theretofore determined or redetermined under this Agreement,
including under this _Section 2.5_ and _Section 2.10_,

 



 

then within thirty (30) days after such "determination" (as defined in Section
1313(a) of the Code and including any comparable determination under
applicable state or local Tax law) becomes final or such proposed adjustment
otherwise becoming final, or such amended Tax Return is filed, as the case may
be, the Seller Representative and the Buyer shall recalculate the amount of
such Extra Tax Cost or the Extra Tax Benefit, as the case may be, and compute
the appropriate adjustments, if any, to any payment or payments with respect
to the Extra Tax Cost theretofore made between the Buyer and each of the
Sellers to reflect such recalculation. If within such thirty (30) day time
period, the Buyer and the Seller Representative are unable to resolve any
differences with respect to such recalculation or computation, or if at any
time the Buyer and the Seller Representative are unable to agree on whether
any change reflected in such an amended Tax Return is appropriate under
applicable Tax law (such appropriateness to be determined by applying the
standard of whether such change is more likely than not to be sustained if
challenged by the applicable Taxing Authority), then such unresolved
differences or disagreements will be submitted to an independent accounting
firm mutually agreed upon by the parties for resolution. Promptly, but not
later than fifteen (15) days after such matters are

 



       
 

 



 

submitted to the independent accounting firm for resolution, such independent
accounting firm will determine those matters in dispute and will render a
written report as to the disputed matters, which report shall be conclusive
and binding on the parties. The fees and expenses of the independent
accounting firm in respect of such report shall be paid one-half by the Buyer
and one-half by the Sellers. Within five (5) Business Days after any such
recalculation and computation becomes final and binding under this _Section
2.5(e)_, any payment or payments with respect to the Extra Tax Cost
theretofore made between the Buyer and each of the Sellers shall be
appropriately adjusted by means of a payment from the Buyer to such Seller or
such Seller to the Buyer, as the case may be, in accordance with such
recalculation and computation. The Buyer shall control, at its expense and in
its sole discretion, (i) the defense, prosecution, conduct and handling of any
matter relating to any such audit, examination, or administrative, judicial or
other proceeding, including any settlement or compromise thereof and the
retention of counsel and experts with respect thereto, to the extent such
matter relates to the Section 1374 Taxes or the determination of the amount
thereof, and (ii) the preparation and filing of any such amended Tax Return.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, in
the event of the breach of a Sellers covenant to make any payment required to
be made to the Buyer under this _Section 2.5_, only the Seller breaching such
covenant shall be liable to the Buyer Indemnified Persons for Buyer Damages
resulting from such breach.

 



 

2.6 _Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the " _Closing_ ") shall take place through an exchange of consideration and
documents using overnight courier service or electronic transmission, or in
such other manner as agreed to in writing by the Buyer and the Shareholder
Representative, on the first Business Day following the Sunday immediately
following the date on which all conditions to closing in _ARTICLE_ 7 are
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions), or at such other time and place as the parties may agree in
writing. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the "
_Closing Date_ ". For financial reporting purposes, the Closing shall be
deemed to have occurred at 11:59 p.m., California time, on the Sunday
immediately preceding the Closing Date.

 



 

2.7 _Deliveries and Actions by the Sellers_. At the Closing, the Company or
the Sellers shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Buyer:

 



 

(a) a payoff letter from each lender or other creditor holding Debt of the
Company indicating the amount of Debt to be discharged at the Closing;

 



 

(b) a certificate or certificates representing the Stock owned by each Seller
together with stock powers or other documents of transfer sufficient to
validly convey such Sellers ownership interest in such Stock to the Buyer,
free and clear of all Encumbrances other than restrictions on transfer under
any applicable state or federal securities Law;

 



 

(c) the minute books and stock transfer records of the Company;

 



 

(d) evidence, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer, of the release of
all Encumbrances, including those listed on _Schedule 2.7(d)_ , other than

the Shareholder Representative a statement allocating the Aggregate Deemed
Sales Price and Adjusted Grossed-up Basis (as each such term is defined under

Assets, which allocation shall be consistent with Section 338 and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder and the principles set forth in _Schedule 2.10_ (the "
_Allocation Statement_ "), and (ii) a statement (the " _Extra Tax Cost/Benefit
Statement_ ") setting forth the determination of the Extra Tax Cost or the
Extra Tax Benefit, as the case may be.

 



 

(b) Within twenty (20) days after receipt of such Allocation Statement and
Extra Tax Cost/Benefit Statement, the Shareholder Representative will propose
to the Buyer in writing any reasonable changes to such Allocation Statement
and Extra Tax Cost/Benefit Statement together with reasonable documentation
supporting such changes (and in the event that no such changes are proposed in
writing to the Buyer within such time period, the Shareholder Representative
and the Sellers will be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted, the Allocation
Statement and the Extra Tax Cost/Benefit Statement). The Buyer and the
Shareholder Representative will attempt in good faith to resolve any
differences with respect to the Allocation Statement and the Extra Tax
Cost/Benefit Statement, in accordance with the requirements of Section 338 of

be submitted to an independent accounting firm mutually agreed upon by the
parties for resolution. Promptly, but not later than fifteen (15) days after

such independent accounting firm will determine those matters in dispute and
will render a written report as to the disputed matters and the resulting
Allocation Statement and Extra Tax Cost/Benefit Statement, which report and
resulting Allocation Statement and Extra Tax Cost/Benefit Statement shall be
conclusive and binding on the parties. The fees and expenses of the
independent accounting firm in respect of such report shall be paid one-half
by the Buyer and one-half by the Sellers.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The Buyer, the Company, the Sellers, the Shareholder Representative, and

Company, the Shareholder Representative nor the Sellers shall take any
position that is inconsistent with such final Allocation Statement unless

Statement as a result of the payment of any additional purchase price for the
Stock or otherwise, the Buyer shall prepare, and shall provide to the
Shareholder Representative, a revised Allocation Statement reflecting such
adjustment. Such revised Allocation Statement shall be subject to review and
resolution of timely raised disputes in the same manner as the initial
Allocation Statement. Each of the Buyer, the Shareholder Representative and
the Sellers shall file or cause to be filed a revised IRS Form 8883 reflecting
such adjustment as so finalized for its taxable year that includes the event
or events giving rise to such adjustment, and (except as required by future

or in the course of any Tax audit, review, or litigation inconsistent with the
allocation provided in the revised Allocation Statement.

deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any Seller such amounts as are
required to be deducted or withheld from such consideration under the Code or

deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid, and the Buyer shall remit any such amounts to the
applicable Taxing Authority in a timely manner in accordance with applicable
Law.

Company has engaged or does engage in business in such state and was required
or is required to file Tax Returns with respect to its income. The Company has
not made any filing, has not taken or failed to take any action, nor has any
event occurred, that would, either alone or in combination with other events,
result in the revocation or termination of the "S corporation" status of the
Company prior to the beginning of the day immediately after the Closing Date.
No Taxing Authority has challenged or is challenging the Companys
qualification as an "S

 



      
 

 



 

corporation" for any federal, state or local Tax purpose. The Company has not
made any non-pro rata distributions to its shareholders on or after October 1,
2009.

 



 

(k) Each of the Company Subsidiaries is, and at all times since the respective
dates set forth on _Schedule 4.8(k)_ has been, and immediately prior to the
Closing will be, disregarded as an entity separate from the Company for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes under Treasury Regulations §§ 301.7701-2 and
301.7701-3 (and state, local, and foreign income Tax purposes where
applicable) (a " _Disregarded Entity_ "), and no election has been or will be
filed, no action has been or will be taken, and no failure to act has occurred
or will occur, in each case prior to the beginning of the day immediately
after the Closing Date, that would result in any of the Company Subsidiaries
being classified at the Closing as an entity that is not a Disregarded Entity
for U.S. federal income Tax purposes (and state, local, and foreign income Tax
purposes where applicable) and, therefore, the purchase of the Stock pursuant
to this Agreement will, by reason of the Section 338(h)(10) Elections, be
treated for U.S. federal income Tax purposes (and state, local, and foreign
Tax purposes where applicable) as the purchase by the Buyer of all the Assets
owned by each of the Company Subsidiaries.

 



 

(l) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has participated (within
the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(c)(3)) in any "reportable
transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)
(and all predecessor regulations). Each of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries has disclosed on its Tax Returns all positions taken therein that
could give rise to a substantial understatement of Tax within the meaning of
Section 6662 of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign
Tax Law).

 



 

(m) All of the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries material property that
is subject to property Tax has been properly listed and described on the
property Tax rolls of the appropriate Taxing Authority for all periods prior
to Closing and no portion of the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys
property constitutes omitted property for property Tax purposes.

 



 

(n) No Seller is a foreign person within the meaning of Section 1445 of the
Code.

 



 

(o) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any
agreement, contract, arrangement or plan that, individually or in the
aggregate, has resulted, or could result as a consequence of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event, including termination of employment) in (A) the payment
of "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code,
or (B) an obligation to indemnify, gross-up or otherwise compensate any
Person, in whole or in part, for any excise Tax under Section 4999 of the Code
that is imposed on such Person or any other Person.

 



 

(p) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has distributed stock of
another Person, or had its stock distributed by another Person, in a
transaction that was purported or intended to be governed by Section 355 of
the Code.

 



 

(q) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary owns any direct interest in
real estate that as a result of the consummation of the transactions

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated by this Agreement would result in the imposition of any realty
transfer Tax or similar Tax.

 



 

(r) There is no property or obligation of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, including uncashed checks to vendors, customers or employees, non-
refunded overpayments, or unclaimed subscription balances, that is escheatable
or reportable as unclaimed property to any state, municipality or other
Governmental Body or Taxing Authority under any applicable escheatment or
unclaimed property Laws.

 



 

4.9 _Title to and Condition of Assets_. The Company has good and marketable
title to or, in the case of leased property and assets, has valid and
enforceable leasehold interests in, all of the Assets and properties necessary

licenses or other rights that are used in the Business are held by any Seller
or any Affiliate of any Seller (other than the Company or a Company
Subsidiary). The Assets and leasehold improvements of the Company are in good
operating condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted, and are adequate for

leasehold interest in each of the leased real properties (collectively with
the Company Owned Real Property, the " _Company Facilities_ ") listed in
_Schedule 4.10(b)_ , free and clear of any Encumbrances, except for the
Company Facility Leases and Permitted Encumbrances. Each Lease, including all
amendments thereto (excluding subordination and non-disturbance agreements,
which will be delivered to the Buyer on or before Closing), evidencing such
leased real property (the " _Company Facility Leases_ ") is also listed on
_Schedule 4.10(b)_. _Schedule 4.10(b)_ sets forth, in respect of each Company
Facility Lease, the date and name of the parties to such Company Facility
Lease, description of the leased premises, the commencement and expiration

amount of the security deposit, and the status of rental payments, including
any rental payments in arrears, any prepaid rent and the date through which
rent is paid as of the date hereof. The Company or a Company Subsidiary
presently occupies each of the Company Facilities free of any subleases,
occupancy agreements, licenses, concessions or other agreements granting to
any party or parties (other than the Company, a Company Subsidiary or the
applicable landlord) a right of use or occupancy of any portion of any Company
Facility. The Companys or Company Subsidiarys possession and quiet enjoyment
of the Company Facilities under each of the Company Facility Leases has not
been disturbed and there are no material disputes with respect to any of the
Company Facility Leases. Each Company Facility Lease is valid and in full
force and effect, and, to the Companys Knowledge, no default or event which
with the giving of notice or the passage of time, or both, will constitute
default has occurred under any Company Facility Lease or been claimed to have
occurred by either the landlord or the tenant thereunder. All Company
Facilities and tenant improvements located on or within such leased real
property are adequate and suitable for the purposes for which they are
currently being used and there are no deferred maintenance or repair items at
any Company Facility (other than any Company Facility located in Hawaii) in
excess of $20,000. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received
any written notice that its occupancy, use or the condition of any leased
premises is in violation of any applicable Laws, zoning ordinances or land use
restrictions. No security deposit or portion thereof deposited with respect to
any Company Facility Lease has been applied in respect of a breach of or
default under any of the Company Facility Leases that has not been re-
deposited in full. The Company does not owe and will not in the future owe any
brokerage commissions or finders fees with respect to any of the Company
Facility Leases. There are no material unsatisfied capital expenditure
requirements or remodeling obligations of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary under any of the Company Facility Leases, other than ordinary
maintenance and repair obligations. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has assigned, transferred, sublet, or granted any person the right
to use or occupy any of the Company Facilities arising under the Company
Facility Leases or granted any other security interest in any Company Facility
Lease or any interest therein. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has made any material modifications to the Company Facilities that will be
required to be restored or otherwise removed at the expiration or termination
of any Company Facility Lease.

 



 

(c) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has a leasehold interest in
any leased real property other than the Company Facilities. Prior to the date
hereof, the Company has provided the Buyer with true, correct and complete
copies of all Company Facility Leases, including all amendments and
supplements thereto. The Company Facility Leases constitute all of the written
and oral agreements of any kind for the leasing, rental, use or occupancy of
leased real property to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party. The Company Facility Leases are the result of bona fide arms length
negotiations between the parties thereto. No delivery date of any of the
Company Facilities under any of the Company Facility Leases has been
accelerated and the premises not yet delivered.

into any contract or agreement to provide compensation or benefits to any
individual or (iii) to modify, change or terminate any Benefit Plan, other
than any modification required to comply with ERISA or the Code.

 



 

(b) _Absence of Certain Types of Plans. _Neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate has ever maintained, contributed to, had an obligation to contribute
to, or incurred any liability with respect to, either (i) a multiemployer
plan, as such term is defined in sections 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA or (ii)
an employee pension benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) that is

has ever maintained, had an obligation to contribute to or incurred any
liability with respect to a voluntary employees beneficiary association that
is or was intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the
Code. Each of the Benefit Plans is subject only to the Laws of the United
States or a political subdivision thereof. No Benefit Plan provides for the

limitation, ERISA and the Code, and all "fiduciaries" of such Benefit Plans
(within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) have always acted in accordance
with the provisions of all applicable Law, including, without limitation,
ERISA and the Code. The terms of each Benefit Plan comply in all material
respects with applicable Law. The Company has performed all material
obligations required to be performed by it under any Benefit Plan and is not
in any material respect in default under or in violation thereof. The Company
has not Knowledge of any default or violation by any other party to, any
Benefit Plan. There is no litigation, action, proceeding, known investigation,
or claim asserted, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened or
contemplated, with respect to any Benefit Plan (other than the payment of
benefits in the normal course) nor any issue resolved adversely to the Company
that may subject the Company to the payment of a penalty, interest, Tax or
other amount. There exists no condition that would subject the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate to any liability under the terms of the Benefit Plans or
applicable Laws other than any payment of benefits in the normal course of
plan operation. Each asset held under any Benefit Plan may be liquidated or
terminated without the imposition of any material redemption fee or surrender
charge.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Qualification of Certain Plans. _Each Benefit Plan that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is identified in _Schedule
4.20(d)_. Each such plan either (i) has been determined by the IRS to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code or (ii) has an applicable remedial
amendment period that will not have ended before the Closing. No facts or
events have occurred that if known by the IRS could adversely affect the
qualified status of any such plan or the exempt status of any such trust
funding such plan.

 



 

(e) _ESOP_. The ESOP was validly established under applicable Law and is, and
at all times has been maintained as, a plan qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code and an employee stock ownership plan as described in Section
4975(e)(7) of the Code. The trust maintained to fund the ESOP (the " _ESOP
Trust_ ") is a trust duly formed in accordance with applicable state Law and
is, and at all times has been, a trust described in Section 501(a) of the
Code. The ESOP and the ESOP Trust have been duly authorized, organized and
established by all necessary corporate action on behalf of the Company and
constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective terms. The
shares of Stock held by the ESOP Trust constitute "employer securities," as
defined in Section 409(l) of the Code and "qualifying employer securities," as
defined in Section 407(d)(5) of ERISA. The Company has provided or made
available any documents that provide for indemnification of the fiduciaries of
the ESOP within the preceding six (6) years. The Trustee of the ESOP (the "
_ESOP Trustee_ ") possesses the full power and authority to execute, deliver,
and perform the ESOPs obligations under and ancillary to this Agreement. To
the Knowledge of the Company, the ESOP Trustee has complied in all material
respects with all of the responsibilities and duties imposed on the ESOP
Trustee under the ESOP in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The performance of the ESOP Trustees duties hereunder, will
not violate any provision of the ESOP or ERISA, including any of the ESOP
Trustees fiduciary obligations under ERISA. The ESOP Trustee has obtained
from an independent third party a written opinion that the Purchase Price
represents "adequate consideration," as that term is defined under Section
3(18) of ERISA, and that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
fair to the ESOP and its participants and beneficiaries from a financial
perspective, a true and correct copy of which has been provided to the Buyer.
The ESOP Trustee has made an independent determination that the Purchase Price
represents "adequate consideration" as that term is defined under Section
3(18) of ERISA, and that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
fair to the ESOP and its participants and beneficiaries from a financial
perspective. The Company shall ensure, and direct the ESOP Trustee if
necessary, that the Purchase Price will, immediately upon Closing, be applied,
pursuant to the terms of the ESOP, first for the payment of any then-
outstanding principal balance of all "exempt loans" (as defined in the ESOP),
plus any accrued interest, and then for allocation to the accounts of all
individuals who, immediately prior to the Closing Date, were participants in,
or beneficiaries under, the ESOP.

 



 

(f) _Absence of Certain Liabilities and Events. _Neither the Company nor any
of its ERISA Affiliates, partners, officers, employees or agents, or any
"party in interest" or "disqualified person," as such terms are defined in
Section 3 of ERISA, and Section 4975 of the Code has, with respect to any
Benefit Plan, engaged in or been a party to any nonexempt "prohibited
transaction," as such term is defined, respectively, in Section 4975(e)(2) of
the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, in connection with which, directly or
indirectly, the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors or
employees or any Benefit Plan or any related funding medium could be subject
to either a

 



      
 

 



 

penalty assessed pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA or a Tax imposed by
Section 4975 of the Code. The Company has not engaged in, and to the Knowledge
of the Company, no ERISA Affiliate or other Person has engaged in, any
transaction or acted or failed to act in any manner that would subject the
Company to any liability for a breach of fiduciary duty under section 409 of
ERISA, a civil penalty assessed pursuant to section 502 of ERISA, a Tax
imposed pursuant to Chapter 43 of Subtitle D of the Code or a penalty assessed
pursuant to Section 6652 of the Code, and no fact or event exists which could
give rise to any such liability. The Company does not have and has never had
any liability for any (i) supplemental retirement benefits or other non-
qualified deferred compensation, (ii) severance pay relating to any
termination of employment which occurs on or prior to the Closing Date, (iii)
for non-qualified deferred compensation or incentive or contingent
compensation relating to any Benefit Plan as in effect, or commitment made,
prior to the date hereof (to the extent related to periods prior to the date
hereof), (iv) for uninsured health, medical, disability or workers
compensation claims incurred prior to the date hereof, regardless of whether
such claims are reported prior to the date hereof or are not so reported, or
(v) the payment of accrued bonuses to the extent related to periods prior to
the date hereof and not accrued or reflected in the Financial Statements.

 



 

(g) _Plan Contributions and Funding. _All contributions, premiums or payments
required to be made with respect to any Benefit Plan have been made on or
before their due dates. All such contributions for years prior to tax year
2014 have been fully deducted for income Tax purposes and no such deduction
has been challenged or disallowed by any Governmental Body and no fact or
event exists which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such
challenge or disallowance. All premiums required to be paid for each insurance
policy funding all or any portion of the benefits under any Benefit Plan have
been timely paid in full.

 



 

(h) _Plan Reporting and Disclosures. _All reports and disclosures relating to
the Benefit Plans required to be filed with or furnished to a Governmental
Body or plan participants or beneficiaries have been filed or furnished in
accordance with applicable Laws in a timely manner.

 



 

(i) _Retiree Medical Benefits. _No Benefit Plan provides medical, surgical,
hospitalization or life insurance benefits (whether or not insured) for
employees, former employees, partners or any other Person for periods
extending beyond their retirements or other terminations of service or
relationship with the Company, other than coverage mandated by Section 4980B
of the Code and the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as
amended (" _COBRA_ ") and other similar applicable Law, and neither the
Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has made any commitment to provide retiree
medical, surgical, hospitalization or life insurance coverage for any current
or former employee or partner of the Company or other Person (except as
required by COBRA and other similar applicable Law). To the extent applicable,
all Benefit Plans have been operated in compliance with COBRA and other
similar applicable Laws _._

 



 

(j) _No Implied Rights. _Nothing contained herein, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any employee or former employee or partner of
the Company any right or remedy of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, including any rights of continued employment for any
period _._

 



      
 

 



 

(k) _No Severance, Accelerated Vesting or Parachute Payments. _There is no
contract, agreement, plan, or arrangement covering any Person that,
individually or in the aggregate, as a consequence of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event, such as termination of employment) could give rise to
the payment of any amount that would be either subject to an excise Tax under
Section 4999 of the Code or not be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the
Code. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
either alone or in conjunction with another event (such as a termination of
employment), will not (A) entitle any current or former employee, consultant,
independent contractor, director or partner of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to severance pay or any other payment, or the forgiveness of
indebtedness, (B) accelerate the time of payment, funding or vesting of
benefits under a Benefit Plan or other employment arrangement, (C) increase
the amount of compensation due any current or former employee, consultant,
independent contractor, director or partner of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or (D) result in any violation or breach of or default under, or
limit the ability of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to amend, modify or
terminate, any Benefit Plan or other employee benefit arrangement.

under the Securities Act or under any state securities Laws and, therefore,

transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Buyer and MFRM is knowledgeable
about the industry in which the Company and the Company Subsidiaries operate

5.11 _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Except for the representations
and warranties contained in this _ARTICLE 5_ and any certificates, agreements
or other documents to be delivered by the Buyer or MFRM pursuant to this

the Company Subsidiaries) or any of their respective agents or
representatives. If any Seller is requested or required (by oral question or
request for information or documents in any action or proceeding) to disclose
any of the Confidential Information, such Seller will, to the extent legally
permissible, notify the Buyer promptly of the request or requirement so that

contempt, such Seller may disclose the Confidential Information to the
Governmental Body, court, arbitrator, or mediator; _provided_ , _however_ ,

request and sole expense of the Buyer, an order or other assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion of the Confidential

supplements thereto, and the Sellers and the Buyer shall promptly execute such
amended form and the Buyer shall timely file such amended form, and any

as follows:

 



 

(i) In the case of any Tax of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that is
based on income, sales, revenue, production or similar items, or any other
Taxes not described in _Section 6.2(b)(ii)_, the amount of such Tax
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period of such Straddle Period shall be
determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that any and all Taxes
(including Section 1374 Taxes) attributable to, or arising or resulting from,
the

 



       
 

 



 

Section 338(h)(10) Elections shall be allocable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods;
_provided further_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the Section 1374 Taxes
being allocable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, the Buyer shall be responsible for
the payment of the Section 1374 Taxes; and

 



 

(ii) In the case of any liability for any real property, personal property and
ad valorem Taxes (" _Property Tax_ "), the amount of such Property Tax
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of
such Property Tax for the entire Straddle Period, multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period ending on
and including the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of
days in such Straddle Period.

 



 

(c) _Preparation of Tax Returns._

 



 

(i) _In General_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 6.2(c)(ii)_, and
with respect to each Tax Return covering either a Straddle Period or a Pre-
Closing Tax Period that is required to be filed for, by, on behalf of or with
respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary after the Closing Date, the
Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared, at the Buyers sole cost and
expense, and in a manner consistent with past practice, applicable Law and
this Agreement, each such Tax Return and shall determine the portion of the
Taxes shown as due on such Tax Return that is (A) allocable to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period and the amount thereof, if any, for which the Sellers are
responsible under this Agreement (which amount, if any, shall be paid by the
Sellers to the Buyer prior to the due date (including any extensions thereof)
for filing such Tax Return), and (B) allocable to the Tax period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, which determination shall be set
forth in a statement (" _Statement_ ") prepared by the Buyer. The Buyer shall
deliver a copy of such Tax Return and the Statement related thereto (including
related work papers) to the Shareholder Representative for his review and
approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the due date (including
any extensions thereof) for filing such Tax Return; _provided, however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer shall not be required to make such
delivery earlier than ten (10) calendar days following the close of the
applicable taxable period covered by such Tax Return. Within five (5) calendar
days of such delivery, the Shareholder Representative shall deliver to the
Buyer a written statement describing any objections to such Tax Return or the
Statement. If the Buyer and the Shareholder Representative are unable to
resolve any such objection within the five (5) calendar day period after the
delivery of such objections, such Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by the
Buyer, as adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect the resolution of any
such objections mutually agreed to by the Buyer and the Shareholder
Representative. Any remaining objections with respect to such Tax Return or
the Statement shall be submitted to an independent accounting firm mutually
agreed upon by the parties for resolution and such independent accounting firm
will determine those matters in dispute and will render a written report as to
the disputed matters, which report shall be conclusive and binding on the
parties. The fees and expenses of the independent accounting firm in respect
of such report shall be paid one-half by the Buyer and one-half by the
Sellers. If necessary to reflect such resolution, the Buyer and the
Shareholder

 



      
 

 



 

Representative shall cause such Tax Return to be amended and filed with the
appropriate Taxing Authority. With respect to each Tax Return described in
this _Section 6.2(c)(i)_ and in _Section 6.2(c)(ii)_, the Buyer and each
Seller, as applicable, will join in the execution and filing of such Tax
Return and other documentation as required by applicable Law.

 



 

(ii) _Pre-Closing Income and Franchise Tax Returns_.

 



 

(1) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of _Section 6.2(c)(i)_, the
Shareholder Representative shall cause to be timely prepared, at the Sellers
sole cost and expense, and in a manner consistent with past practice,
applicable Law and this Agreement all Tax Returns for income and franchise
Taxes with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary for all taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date that are due after the Closing
Date, including for those jurisdictions and Taxing Authorities that permit or
require a short period Tax Return for income or franchise Taxes for the period
ending on and including the Closing Date (including an IRS Form 1120S, U.S.
Income Tax Return for an S Corporation, for the Company covering the taxable
period beginning on January 1, 2014, and ending on and including the Closing
Date). The Shareholder Representative shall provide the Buyer with copies of
completed drafts of each such Tax Return at least forty-five (45) days prior
to the due date (including extensions) for filing thereof, along with
supporting workpapers, for the Buyers review and approval. Within twenty-five
(25) days of such delivery, the Buyer shall deliver to the Shareholder
Representative a written statement describing any objections to such Tax
Return. If the Shareholder Representative and the Buyer are unable to resolve
any such objection within the twenty (20) day period after the delivery of
such objections, such Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by the Shareholder
Representative, as adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect the resolution
of any such objections mutually agreed to by the Shareholder Representative
and the Buyer and to conform such Tax Return in all respects with the
Allocation Statement and the Extra Tax Cost/Benefit Statement (including the
calculation of the Section 1374 Taxes reflected thereon) that have become
final and binding pursuant to _Section 2.10_ and the agreement of the Buyer
and the Sellers contained in _Section 2.5(a)_ and _Section 2.5(b)_ that any
loss and/or deduction attributable to the Section 1374 Taxes under Section
1366(f)(2) and/or other applicable Tax Law shall be claimed in the applicable
income Tax Returns of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the period
ending on and including the Closing Date. Any remaining objections with
respect to such Tax Return shall be submitted to an independent accounting
firm mutually agreed upon by the parties for resolution and such independent
accounting firm will determine those matters in dispute and will render a
written report as to the disputed matters, which report shall be conclusive
and binding on the parties. The fees and expenses of the independent
accounting firm in respect of such report shall be paid one-half by the Buyer
and one-half by the Sellers. If necessary to reflect such resolution, the
Buyer and the Shareholder Representative shall cause such Tax Return to be
amended and filed with the appropriate Taxing Authority. For the avoidance of

 



      
 

 



 

doubt, the Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of any Section 1374
Taxes due with respect to any Tax Return described in this _Section
6.2(c)(ii)(1)_.

 



 

(2) In addition to the provisions of _Section 6.2(c)(ii)(1)_, if the
Shareholder Representative or the Buyer expects that the original due date of
any Tax Return described in _Section 6.2(c)(ii)(1)_ will be extended and that
such Tax Return will reflect a liability for Section 1374 Taxes, then the
Shareholder Representative shall provide the Buyer with a statement (each, an
" _Estimated Section 1374 Taxes Statement_") setting forth the Shareholder
Representatives calculation of the estimate of such liability for Section
1374 Taxes, along with supporting workpapers, at least thirty (30 days) prior
to such original due date. Such Estimated Section 1374 Taxes Statement shall
be prepared in a manner consistent with the principles reflected in the
illustrative calculation set forth in _Schedule 2.5_. Within fifteen (15) days
of such delivery, the Buyer shall deliver to the Shareholder Representative a
written statement describing any objections to such Estimated Section 1374
Taxes Statement. If the Shareholder Representative and the Buyer are unable to
resolve any such objection within the ten (10) day period after the delivery
of such objections, the amount of Section 1374 Taxes to be paid to the
appropriate Taxing Authority in connection with the filing of the extension of
the original due date for such Tax Return shall be as determined by the Buyer,
as adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect the resolution of any such
objections mutually agreed to by the Shareholder Representative and the Buyer.

 



 

(d) _Assistance and Cooperation_. From and after the Closing Date, the Sellers
and the Buyer shall:

 



 

(i) assist (and cause their respective Affiliates to assist), to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in preparing any Tax Returns which
such other party is responsible for preparing and filing;

 



 

(ii) cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
party in preparing for any audit, litigation, contest, dispute, negotiation,
or other proceeding (each a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") regarding Taxes of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary;

 



 

(iii) make available to the other party and to any Taxing Authority, as
reasonably requested, all relevant information, records, and documents
relating to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(including information necessary to file Tax Return extensions and make
estimated Tax payments); and

 



 

(iv) furnish the other party, upon such partys reasonable request, with
copies of all correspondence received from any Taxing Authority in connection
with any Tax Proceeding with respect to any Taxes imposed on the Company or
any Company Subsidiary with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Transfer Taxes_. The parties do not anticipate that any transfer, sales,
use, value added, excise, filing, recording, documentary, stamp or other
similar Taxes will arise as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (" _Transfer Taxes_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any Transfer Taxes arise as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the payment of any and all such
Transfer Taxes shall be borne equally by the Sellers, on the one hand, and the
Buyer, on the other hand. The parties agree to cooperate fully with each other
to minimize any such liability for Transfer Taxes to the extent legally
permissible, and the parties shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and
filing of all Tax Returns regarding any Transfer Taxes that become payable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(f) _Tax Refunds_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 6.2(h)_, the
amount or economic benefit of any refund (whether in cash or as a credit
against or offset to any Tax) of any Tax received by the Buyer, the Company,
any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates and attributable
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or the
portion of any Straddle Period of the Company or any Company Subsidiary ending
on and including the Closing Date shall be for the account of the Sellers to
the extent such refund was not reflected in the computation of the Final Net
Working Capital that has become final and binding pursuant to _Section 2.3_.
Except as otherwise provided in _Section 6.2(h)_, in the case of a Straddle
Period, the amount or economic benefit of any refund (whether in cash or as a
credit against or offset to any Tax) received by the Buyer, the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates shall be apportioned
between the Sellers and the Buyer in accordance with _Section 6.2(b)_. The
amount of any such refund (including any interest thereon) owing to the
Sellers as provided in this _Section 6.2(f)_ shall be paid by the Buyer to
the Shareholder Representative within thirty (30) days after such refund is
received, credited or applied as an offset. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, the amount or economic benefit of any refund (whether
in cash or as a credit against or offset to any Tax) of any Section 1374 Taxes
(including any interest thereon) shall be for the account of the Buyer and
shall be paid to the Buyer within thirty (30) days after such refund is
received, credited or applied as an offset by, to or with respect to any
Seller.

 



 

(g) _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. The Sellers shall cause any and
all Tax sharing or allocation agreements, intercompany agreements or other
agreements or arrangements among the Company or any Company Subsidiary and any
other Person(s) relating to any Tax matters to be terminated with respect to
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, as the case may be, as of the day
before the Closing Date, and from and after the Closing Date, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be bound thereby or have any
liability thereunder for any taxable period (whether past, current or future
taxable periods).

 



 

(h) _Certain Tax Refund Matters_. If for any reason (including a breach of any
representation or warranty contained in _Section 4.8(j)_ or _Section
4.8(k)_) there is a "determination" (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code
and including any comparable determination under applicable state or local Tax
law), or other determination that becomes final, that (i) the Company has not,
at any time during the period from and including October 1, 2009, through and
including the Closing Date, had in effect a valid election under Section 1362
of the Code to be treated as an "S corporation" within the meaning of Section
1361 of the Code or had in effect a valid, corresponding election for

 



      
 

 



 

each state during the periods in which the Company has engaged or does engage
in business in such state and was required or is required to file Tax Returns
with respect to its income, or (ii) any of the Company Subsidiaries has not,
at any time during such period, been treated as a Disregarded Entity, then
each of the Sellers shall pay to Buyer the amount or economic benefit of any
refund (whether in cash or as a credit against or offset to any Tax) of any
Tax (including any interest thereon) received by such Seller resulting or
arising from any such "determination" (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the
Code and including any comparable determination under applicable state or
local Tax law), or other proposed determination that becomes final, as reduced
by any reasonable expenses of obtaining such refund. Any such refund shall be
paid by a Seller to Buyer within thirty (30) days after such refund is
received, credited or applied as an offset by such Seller. Each of the Sellers
shall take all actions reasonably necessary or advisable to claim and obtain
any such refund, including causing the appropriate Tax Returns to be amended
and filed with the appropriate Taxing Authorities with respect to all
applicable taxable periods affected by any such determination; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, at the request of any Seller or the Buyer, the Buyer shall
prepare such amended Tax Returns of such Seller at the Buyers sole cost and
expense.

 



 

(i) _Survival_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, rights and
obligations of the Buyer and each of the Sellers with respect to any Tax or
Tax matter covered by this Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall not
terminate until sixty (60) days after the expiration of all statutes of
limitations (including any and all extensions thereof) applicable to such Tax
(or the assessment thereof) or Tax matter.

 



 

(j) _Conflict_. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this
_Section 6.2_ and any other provision of this Agreement, the provisions of
this _Section 6.2_ shall control.

 



 

6.3 _Obtaining of Consents, Waivers and Releases_. Each party will use its
reasonable commercial efforts to take all actions and to do all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate, make effective and comply with
all terms of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and to
obtain the consents and waivers necessary if any asset, property, contract,
license, lease, sales order, permit, right or other agreement or commitment of
the Company is impaired due to the sale of the Stock to the Buyer, and the
parties hereto will use their commercially reasonable efforts to bring about
the satisfaction as soon as possible of all of the conditions contained in
_ARTICLE_ 7 and to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) deliver to the Buyer
those consents and approvals that are expressly required under the terms of
any Company Facility Lease to consummate the transactions contemplated herein,
in each case in form reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer and (ii) provide
estoppel certificates with respect to each such Company Facility Lease for
which such consent is required, executed by the landlord under such Company
Facility Lease and confirming the validity and completeness of such Company
Facility Lease, the current rental costs, the existing security deposits and
that no defaults are existing. In no event shall any Seller be required to
modify or personally guaranty any Company Facility Lease in connection with
obtaining the landlords consent to the transactions contemplated herein.
Unless otherwise agreed by the Buyer and the Company, the Sellers shall seek
required landlord consents using the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_. The
Sellers shall pay, or prior to the Closing Date cause the Company to pay, all
landlord fees or expenses, including any transfer premiums, that are expressly
required under any Company Facility Lease in connection with obtaining the
consents and approvals of such landlords to the transactions contemplated
herein, whether

 



      
 

 



 

incurred before or after the Closing Date (the " _Landlord Fees_ "), and shall
reimburse, or prior to the Closing Date cause the Company to reimburse, the
Buyer for any such Landlord Fees paid by the Buyer. Any Landlord Fees not paid
or reimbursed in accordance herewith prior to the Closing Date shall be deemed
to be Current Liabilities of the Company. The Buyer and MFRM acknowledge that
certain consents to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
required from parties to certain contracts, leases, licenses, other agreements
or permits to which the Company or a Company Subsidiary is a party or subject
and have not been obtained as of the date hereof and may not be obtained as of
the Closing (collectively, " _Non-Obtained Consents_ "). Each of the Buyer and
MFRM agrees that after the Closing neither the Company nor any Seller shall
have any liability whatsoever to the Buyer or MFRM (and neither the Buyer nor
MFRM shall be entitled to assert any claims) arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any Non-Obtained Consents that may have been or may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
because of the default, acceleration or termination of or loss of right under
any such contract, lease, license, other agreement or permit as a result
thereof.

 



 

6.4 _Notices to Suppliers, Vendors and Customers_. To the extent not satisfied
prior to the Closing Date, each of the Sellers shall cooperate with the Buyer
in notifying suppliers, vendors, customers and other third parties having a
business relationship with the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

6.5 _Restrictive Covenants_. The Key Shareholders, Carlsen, and Killgore agree
that the Company transacts and carries on its Business in areas in which there
are no Company Facilities, and in addition to retail sales and carrying on its
Business through the Company Facilities located in the states of California,
Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington, the Company also maintains a
website through which it advertises, makes internet sales, and delivers
mattresses, bedding, and related products throughout the continental United
States. The parties acknowledge the highly competitive nature of the Business
of the Company. Since each of Carlsen and Killgore, through the Carlsen Trust
and the Killgore Trust, respectively, is personally benefitting from the sale
to the same extent as if he were a Seller, the Buyer requires that each of
Carlsen and Killgore be bound, and each of Carlsen and Killgore agrees to be
bound by the provisions of this _Section 6.5_ as a Key Shareholder to the
same extent as if he were a Seller that was a Key Shareholder. The Key
Shareholders further acknowledge that absent the agreement to the terms of
this _Section 6.5_, the Buyer would either have not purchased the Stock or
would have paid a substantially lower purchase price for such Stock.
Accordingly, for the consideration in this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the acquisition of the Companys goodwill:

 



 

(a) _Non-Competition_.

 



 

(i) For a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the earlier of
(A) five (5) years after the Closing Date or (B) two (2) years after the date
of termination of Carlsens employment with the Buyer, if Carlsens employment
is terminated by the Buyer without Cause or Carlsen terminates his employment
by the Buyer for Good Reason, neither Carlsen nor the Carlsen Trust shall,
directly or indirectly (whether as an owner, proprietor, partner, shareholder,
officer, employee, independent contractor, director, joint venturer,
consultant, lender or investor), own, maintain, engage in, or participate or
have any interest in the operation of, any retail or internet business engaged
in selling mattresses, bedding or related products, including over the
internet, (collectively, the " _Restricted Activities_ ," and each
individually, a " _Restricted Activity_ ") within the geographic area set
forth in _Schedule 6.5(a)_ , listing (A) any county in which a

 



      
 

 



 

Company Facility is located as of the Closing Date and (B) any state in which
the Company has made sales through the internet as of the Closing Date,
including California. Further, the Key Shareholders agree that the Company
carries on and transacts Business on the internet, including marketing,
advertising, and providing delivery services to anywhere in the continental
U.S. As such, Carlsen and the Carlsen Trust further agree not to engage in any
Restricted Activities within any state in the continental U.S. whether or not
listed in _Schedule 6.5(a)_ (collectively with _Schedule 6.5(a)_ , the "
_Restricted Territory_ ").

 



 

(ii) For a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the earlier of
(A) five (5) years after the Closing Date or (B) two (2) years after the date
of termination of Killgores employment with the Buyer, if Killgores
employment is terminated by the Buyer without Cause or Killgore terminates his
employment by the Buyer for Good Reason, neither Killgore nor the Killgore
Trust shall, directly or indirectly (whether as an owner, proprietor, partner,
shareholder, officer, employee, independent contractor, director, joint
venturer, consultant, lender or investor), own, maintain, engage in, or
participate or have any interest in any Restricted Activity within the
Restricted Territory.

 



 

(iii) For a period of two (2) years after the Closing Date, no Key Shareholder
other the Carlsen Trust or the Killgore Trust shall, either directly or
indirectly (whether as an owner, proprietor, partner, shareholder, officer,
employee, independent contractor, director, joint venturer, consultant, lender
or investor), for himself or on behalf of or in conjunction with any other
Person, own, maintain, engage in, or participate or have any interest in any
Restricted Activity within the Restricted Territory.

 



 

(iv) The running of any time period referred to in _Section 6.5(a)(i), (ii),
(iii)_ or _6.5(c)_ with respect to any Key Shareholder, Carlsen, or Killgore,
shall be tolled during any period of time during which such Key Shareholder
violates this _Section 6.5_.

 



 

(v) This _Section 6.5(a)_ does not, in any way, restrict or impede any Key
Shareholder, Carlsen or Killgore from exercising protected rights to the
extent that such rights cannot be waived by agreement or from complying with
any applicable Law.

 



 

(vi) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.5(a)_, a Key
Shareholder, Carlsen and Killgore may (x) participate in the above activities
as an employee of the Buyer or the Company, (y) own, maintain, engage in, or
participate or have any interest in any Person as to which no more than 5% of
its aggregate annual revenues are derived from bedding sales and (z) own
securities in any publicly held Person that is covered by the restrictions set
forth in this _Section 6.5(a)_, but only to the extent that such Key
Shareholder, Carlsen or Killgore does not own, of record or beneficially, more
than five percent (5%) of the outstanding beneficial ownership of such Person.

 



 

(b) _Reasonableness_. The Key Shareholders, Carlsen, and Killgore acknowledge
that the Company transacts and carries on Business in the Restricted Territory
and further acknowledge and agree that the limitations imposed by _Section
6.5(a)_ as to time, geographical area, and scope of activity being restrained
are reasonable

 



      
 

 



 

and do not impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the
goodwill or other business interests of the Buyer.

 



 

(c) _Non-Solicitation_. For a period of five (5) years from and after the
Closing Date, the Key Shareholders, Carlsen, and Killgore shall not, directly
or indirectly, for itself, himself, herself, or on behalf of or in conjunction
with any other Person, hire, solicit, or engage the services of any employee,
independent contractor, or consultant of the Company or its Affiliates as of
the Closing Date, induce or cause any such individual to leave such employment
or engagement, or interfere with any such relationship of the Company and its
Affiliates; _provided, however_ , the running of such time period shall be
tolled during any period of time during which any Key Shareholder, Carlsen or
Killgore violates this _Section 6.5(c)_.

 



 

(d) _Severability_. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision of this _Section 6.5_ is invalid or
unenforceable, the parties agree that the court making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope,
duration or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this _Section 6.5_ shall be enforceable as so modified after the
expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

 



 

6.6 _Governmental Approvals_.

 



 

(a) In addition to their obligations under _Section 6.3_, each party shall
use its best efforts to obtain all consents of any Governmental Body required
to be obtained to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and to allow the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to continue to conduct
the Business after the Closing as currently conducted.

 



 

(b) Within ten (10) Business Days after the execution of this Agreement, each
party shall file with the Antitrust Division of the United States Department
of Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ ") and the United States Federal Trade
Commission (the " _FTC_ ") the pre-merger notification and report form
required pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby, together with a request for early termination of the waiting period
under the HSR Act. The parties hereto covenant and agree with each other that
with respect to such filing each shall: (i) furnish to the other such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in
connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary
under the HSR Act; (ii) after any request by the FTC or the Antitrust
Division, promptly file any information or documents requested by the FTC or
the Antitrust Division and (iii) subject to applicable Laws regarding
confidentiality, furnish each other with any correspondence from or to, and
notify each other of any other communications with, the FTC or the Antitrust
Division that relates to the transactions contemplated hereunder, and to the
extent practicable, permit the other to participate in any conferences with
the FTC or the Antitrust Division.

 



 

(c) From the date hereof through the date of termination of the required
waiting period under the HSR Act or any other applicable antitrust Law, no
party shall take any action that could reasonably be expected to hinder or
delay the obtaining of

 



      
 

 



 

clearance or the expiration of the required waiting period under the HSR Act
or any other applicable antitrust Law. Each party shall use its respective
commercially reasonable efforts to vigorously defend, lift, mitigate and
rescind the effect of any litigation or administrative proceeding adversely
affecting this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company
and the Sellers shall on the request of the Buyer take all reasonable steps
necessary to avoid or eliminate impediments under any antitrust, competition
or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by the FTC, the Antitrust
Division or any other Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably
possible.

 



 

6.7 _Cooperation_.

 



 

(a) Following execution of this Agreement, the Company shall cooperate with
the Buyer and its independent public accountant as and when reasonably
requested by the Buyer from time to time. Such cooperation shall include
providing the necessary information to complete an audit of the Company and
providing appropriate responses, requested information and representation
letters to the auditors and otherwise facilitating the ability of the auditors
to issue their audit opinion without qualification in connection with the
preparation of such audited balance sheets, income statements and statements
of cash flows with respect to the Company, all to the extent necessary to
provide any necessary audited financial statements with respect to the Company
as may be determined and requested by the Buyer, to be (i) useful in the
business of the Buyer or its Affiliates; (ii) necessary to assist the Buyer or
any of its Affiliates in complying with certain covenants contained in
agreements or contracts by which the Buyer or any of its Affiliates is bound;
or (iii) required by state or federal Law, rules or regulations. The Company
and the Sellers expressly acknowledge and agree that if the Buyers
independent public accountant requests that the Company or the Sellers provide
financial data and supporting documentation related to the Company in order to
successfully perform or facilitate its audit and review procedures applicable
to the Company, the Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with such accountant
and shall provide such financial data and supporting documentation to such
accountant. The Company and the Sellers hereby agree to use their commercially
reasonable efforts (without any obligation to pay any additional fees or other
amounts not reimbursed by Buyer) to cause the Companys accountant (x) to
permit its audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements of the
Company for fiscal years 2011, 2012 and 2013 to be included in a Current
Report on Form 8-K that is required to be filed by MFRM in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or other
filing by MFRM with the SEC or (y) to perform reviews of the Companys
quarterly financial statements and issue comfort letters as may be required in
connection with any filing by MFRM with the SEC. In the event the Companys
accountant refuses to permit the inclusion of its audit opinion in any filing
by MFRM with the SEC, the Buyer shall bear the costs of any re-audit of such
financial statements by a public accounting firm of Buyers choice, and the
Company and the Sellers shall use their best efforts to provide all
information and assistance required to complete the re-audit as is reasonably
requested.

 



 

(b) Following execution of this Agreement, the Company and the Sellers shall
cooperate with the Buyer as and to the extent reasonably requested by the
Buyer in connection with obtaining insurance for the Buyer against any risks
associated with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
risks related to Taxes; provided that the Company and the Sellers shall not be
required to make any payment or expenditure in providing any cooperation in
accordance with this _Section 6.7(b)_.

 



      
 

 



 

6.8 _Operation in Ordinary Course_. From the date hereof until the earlier of
the Closing or the date on which this Agreement terminates, the Company shall
(i) conduct the Business only in the ordinary course, in substantially the
same manner in which it has been previously conducted and not to undertake any
business activities outside the ordinary course without the Buyers consent,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld; (ii) use its commercially reasonable
efforts to preserve intact its business organization and goodwill and keep
available the services of its officers and employees as a group; (iii) confer
on a regular and frequent basis, at the Buyers reasonable request, with
representatives of the Buyer to report operational matters and the general
status of ongoing operations; (iv) notify the Buyer of any change in its

termination or other disposition of the PSP.

 



 

(f) All of the assets of the ESOP received in connection with the Closing

transferred to the PSP, will be allocated to the accounts of the ESOP
participants, beneficiaries and alternate payees no later than one hundred and
twenty (120) days following the Closing Date, and, with respect to any Escrow
Amount or Secondary Escrow Amount, to the accounts of the ESOP or PSP

all affected participants, beneficiaries and alternate payees.

and _Section 7.3_ were satisfied, the Buyer shall be obligated to and shall
pay to the Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds Five
Million Dollars ($5,000,000) (the " _Buyer Antitrust Termination Fee_ ") no
later than five (5) Business Days after such termination. The Buyer Antitrust
Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Sellers, the
Company and their respective Affiliates in the event of a termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_.

 



 

(b) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Sellers pursuant
to _Section 8.1(e) _and__ (ii) contemporaneously with such termination, the
Sellers elect to make an irrevocable written demand to receive the Buyer
Funding Termination Fee, the Buyer shall be obligated to and shall pay to the
Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000) (the " _Buyer Funding Termination Fee_ ") no later than five (5)
Business Days after such termination. If and only if the Sellers elect to
provide such contemporaneous irrevocable written demand to receive the Buyer
Funding Termination Fee upon a termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(e)_, the Buyer Funding Termination Fee shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Sellers, the Company and their respective Affiliates
in the event of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_.
Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Sellers shall be entitled to
enforce all of their rights under this Agreement (other than their right to
demand or cause the Company to receive a Buyer Funding Termination Fee) in the
event that the Sellers do not deliver an irrevocable demand to receive the
Buyer Funding Termination Fee in connection with a termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_.

 



 

(c) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) in the
case of a termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_ and (ii) in the case of a
termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ in which the Sellers elect to
provide an irrevocable demand to receive the Buyer Funding Termination Fee,
the Buyer Antitrust Termination Fee and the Buyer Funding Termination Fee,
respectively (each, a " _Buyer Liability Limitation_ "), shall constitute the
maximum aggregate liability of MFRM and the Buyer for any Sellers/Company
Termination Damages arising from a termination of this Agreement where a Buyer
Liability Limitation applies. In no event shall the Sellers, the Company or
any Company Subsidiaries seek any Sellers/Company Termination Damages or any
other recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including consequential,
indirect, or punitive damages, against MFRM, the Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates in excess of the applicable Buyer Liability Limitation
in connection with the termination of this Agreement in which a Buyer
Liability Limitation applies, and, in such case, each of the Sellers and the
Company acknowledges and agrees that it has no right of recovery against, and
no personal liability shall attach to, in each case with respect to
Sellers/Company Termination Damages, the former, current or future
stockholders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners or assignees of
MFRM or the Buyer or any former,

 



      
 

 



 

current or future stockholder, controlling person, director, officer,
employee, general or limited partner, member, manager, Affiliate, agent or
assignee of any of the foregoing (each an " _MFRM Affiliate_ "), through MFRM,
the Buyer or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the
corporate veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of MFRM or the Buyer
against any MFRM Affiliate, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any
legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or
applicable Law, or otherwise. The Sellers and the Company shall have no right
to, and hereby waive any right to, specific performance of this Agreement
against MFRM or the Buyer in the case of any termination of this Agreement in
which a Buyer Liability Limitation applies pursuant to this _Section 8.3_.

 



 

9. _SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AND INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS_. The representations and warranties and indemnity and other obligations of the Buyer and MFRM and the Sellers contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing for a period of eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the representations and warranties made in _Section 3.1_ (Authority; Capacity), _Section 3.2_ (Title to Stock), _Section 3.5_ (Brokers Fees), _Section 4.1_ (Organization and Qualifications), _Section 4.3_ (Capitalization), _Section 4.5_ (Authority), _Section 4.27_ (Brokers Fees), _Section 5.1_ (Organization and Good Standing), _Section 5.2_ (Authority), _Section 5.5_ (MFRM Stock Consideration), or _Section 5.8_ (Brokers Fees), the indemnity and other obligations arising under _Section 10.1(b)_, _10.1(c)_ , _10.1(e)_ , _10.2(b)_ , _10.2(c)_ or _10.2(e)_ , and the indemnity and other obligations arising under _Section 10.1(a)_, _10.1(g)_ , _10.2(a)_ or _10.2(g)_ to the extent related to any of the foregoing, shall survive the Closing indefinitely; _provided further, however_ , that the representations and warranties made in _Section 4.19_ (Labor and Employment Matters), and the indemnity and other obligations arising under _Section 10.1(a)_ or _10.1(g)_ to the extent related to any of the foregoing, shall survive the Closing for a period of thirty (30) months; and _provided further, however_ , that the representations and warranties made in _Section 4.8_ (Tax Matters) or _Section 4.20_ (Employee Benefit Plans) and the indemnity and other obligations arising under _Section 10.1(d)_, _10.1(f)_ , _10.2(d)_ or _10.2(f)_ , and the indemnity and other obligations arising under _Section 10.1(a)_, _10.1(g)_ , _10.2(a)_ or _10.2(g)_ to the extent related to any of the foregoing, shall survive the Closing until sixty (60) days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, any representation or warranty or indemnity or other obligation in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement will survive the time at which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence if written (i) notice of the inaccuracy or breach thereof giving rise to such right of indemnity and (ii) demand for indemnification shall have been given to the party against whom such indemnity may be sought prior to such time; _provided, however_ , that the applicable representation or warranty and indemnity or other obligation will survive only with respect to the particular inaccuracy or breach specified in such written notice. All covenants and agreements of the parties contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing for the duration of the applicable covenant or agreement or, if no duration is specified in such covenant or agreement, for so long as such covenant or agreement is enforceable under applicable Law.

(a) The maximum aggregate liability of the Sellers for Buyer Damages for any
matter described under _Section 10.1_ shall not exceed in the aggregate (in
each case taken together with any other matters under _Section 10.1_ that may
have been subject to indemnification hereunder) Fifteen Million Dollars
($15,000,000); _provided, however_ , that, with respect to Buyer Damages
arising out of a breach of the representations and warranties under _Section
4.8_ or _4.20_ or any matter described under _Section 10.1(d)_ or _10.1(f)_ ,
or, to the extent relating to the breach or non-performance of any of the
foregoing, _Section 10.1(a)_ or _10.1(g)_ , the maximum aggregate liability
of the Sellers for such Buyer Damages shall not exceed in the aggregate (in
each case taken together with any other matters under _Section 10.1(a)_ that
may have been subject to indemnification hereunder) Thirty Million Dollars
($30,000,000); _provided further, however_ , that, with respect to Buyer
Damages arising out of a breach of the representations and warranties under
_Section 3.1_, _3.2_ , _3.5_ , _4.1_ , _4.3_ , _4.5_ , or _4.27_ , a breach
of the covenants under _Section 6.5_ or any matter described under _Section
10.1(b)_, _10.1(c)_ or _10.1(e)_ , or, to the extent relating to the breach
or non-performance of any of the foregoing, _Section 10.1(a)_ or _10.1(g)_ ,
the maximum liability of any Seller for such Buyer Damages shall not exceed
the portion of the Closing Price actually received by the applicable Seller.
Except with respect to Buyer Damages arising out of fraud or a breach of the

_4.3_ , _4.5_ , _4.8_ , _4.20,_ or _4.27_ , which shall not be subject to the
Minimum Claim Amount or the Deductible, the Sellers shall not have any
liability to the Buyer Indemnified Persons with respect to Buyer Damages
arising out of any of the matters referred to in _Section 10.1(a)_ until such
time as the amount of all such liability shall exceed in the aggregate One
Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (the " _Deductible_ "), in which case the Sellers
shall thereafter, subject to the limits on liability provided in this _Section
10.3(a)_, be liable for all such Buyer Damages in excess of the

 



      
 

 



 

Deductible; _provided, however_ , that no claim or series of related claims
for Buyer Damages arising out of any of the matters referred to in _Section
10.1(a)_ which are subject to the Deductible shall be applied against the
Deductible unless the amount of liability to the Buyer Indemnified Persons
arising out of any such claim or series of related claims is in excess of
Twenty Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) (the " _Minimum Claim Amount_ ").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the maximum
liability of any Seller for Buyer Damages for any matter described under
_Section 10.1_ shall not exceed the lesser of (i) the respective amounts set

such Seller.

 



 

(b) The maximum liability of the Buyer for Seller Damages for any matter
described under _Section 10.2_ shall not exceed in the aggregate (in each
case taken together with any other matters under _Section 10.2_ that may have
been subject to indemnification hereunder) Fifteen Million Dollars
($15,000,000); _provided, however_ , that, with respect to Seller Damages

5.1_, _5.2_ , _5.5_ or _5.8_ , which shall not be subject to the Minimum Claim
Amount or the Deductible, the Buyer shall have no liability to the Seller
Indemnified Persons with respect to Seller Damages arising out of any of the
matters referred to in _Section 10.2(a)_ until such time as the amount of all
such liability of the Buyer shall collectively exceed the Deductible, in which
case the Buyer shall thereafter, subject to the limits on liability provided
in this _Section 10.3(b)_, be liable for all such Seller Damages in excess of
the Deductible; _provided, however_ , that no claim or series of related
claims for Seller Damages arising out of any of the matters referred to in
_Section 10.2(a)_ which are subject to the Deductible shall be applied
against the Deductible unless the amount of liability to the Seller
Indemnified Persons arising out of any such claim or series of related claims
is in excess of the Minimum Claim Amount.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither any
Seller or the Buyer or MFRM shall be liable for any breach of the

respectively, except in connection with a claim alleging a violation of

shall be entitled to recover more than once for any Damages that may have
resulted from the breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement from the occurrence of a single event.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the foregoing
limitations shall not apply in the case of a determination of fraud by a final
and non-appealable order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) Damages in each case shall be net of the amount of any insurance proceeds
actually recovered by a party.

 



 

10.4 _Indemnification Procedure_.

 



 

(a) Promptly after receipt by a party entitled to indemnification hereunder
(the " _Indemnified Party_ ") of written notice of the institution of any
legal proceeding, or of any other claim, asserted by a third party (a " _Third
Party Claim_ ") against the Indemnified Party with respect to which a claim
for indemnification is to be made pursuant to _Section 10.1_ or _10.2_
herein, the Indemnified Party shall give written notice to the other party
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to participate in and to assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party, and after notice from the Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party
of such assumption of defense, and provided that the Indemnifying Party
continues to diligently pursue such defense, the Indemnifying Party shall not
be liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses incurred
by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof. No
Indemnifying Party will enter into any settlement with respect to such Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party unless
such settlement (i) requires solely the payment of money damages by the
Indemnifying Party and (ii) does not (A) include injunctive or equitable
relief, (B) impose any restrictions or other obligations on any Indemnified
Party or (C) contain any factual findings with respect to the Company, the
Buyer or MFRM. If the settlement does not include an unconditional release by
the claimant or the plaintiff of the Indemnified Party and the Persons for
whom the Indemnified Party is acting or who are acting on behalf of the
Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of the proceeding or claim
giving rise to the Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall continue to
diligently pursue the defense of any such Third Party Claim.

 



 

(b) Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of Damages which does not
result from a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") will be asserted by
giving the Indemnifying Party written notice thereof. Such notice by the
Indemnified Party will describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail. The
Indemnifying Party will have a period of sixty (60) days within which to
respond in writing to such Direct Claim (the " _Direct Claim Response Period_
"). If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within the Direct Claim
Response Period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have accepted such
claim, in which event the Indemnifying Party will be required to pay such
amounts in accordance with _Section 10.5_ hereof.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
provisions of this _Section 10.4_ shall not apply to Tax Proceedings, which
shall be controlled by the Company; _provided_ that the Company shall not
agree to settle or compromise any such Tax Proceeding involving Taxes
attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior written consent of
the Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed.

 



 

10.5 _Payment_. Payment of any amounts due pursuant to this _ARTICLE 10_
shall be made within five (5) Business Days after (i) notice of a final, non-
appealable judgment is sent by the Indemnified Party, (ii) a mutually agreed
upon resolution is reached by the third party and the Indemnified Party, and
the Indemnifying Party has approved such resolution, (iii) a mutually agreed
upon resolution is reached by the third party and the Indemnifying Party, and
the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnified Party has approved in writing such resolution, (iv) the expiration
of the Direct Claim Response Period, unless the Indemnified Party has disputed
the Direct Claim in a written response in accordance with _Section 10.4(b)_
before the end of the applicable Direct Claim Response Period or (v) a
mutually agreed upon written resolution is reached by the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party (each such date, a " _Final Determination Date_ ").
Payment of any amounts due pursuant to this _ARTICLE 10_ shall be treated as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price, including for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, any amounts owing from the Sellers pursuant to this
_ARTICLE 10_ shall be satisfied first from any insurance proceeds that are
actually received by the Buyer or its Affiliates, and then from funds in the
Escrow Account until such funds are exhausted and thereafter shall be made
directly by the Sellers in accordance with the terms of this _Section 10.5_.

 



 

10.6 _Escrow_. The funds contained in the Escrow Account shall be distributed
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement. Up to
$1,000,000 of funds in the Escrow Account shall be available to pay any
amounts due to the Buyer pursuant to _Section 2.3(d)_. The funds in the
Escrow Account shall be the primary source of recovery of the Buyer
Indemnified Persons for any amounts owed by the Sellers under _ARTICLE 10_
unless and until such funds are exhausted.

 



 

10.7 _Failure to Pay Indemnification or Instruct Escrow Agent_. Subject to
_Section 10.5_, if and to the extent the Indemnified Party shall make written
demand upon the Indemnifying Party for indemnification pursuant to this
_ARTICLE 10_ and the Indemnifying Party shall refuse or fail to pay in full
within ten (10) Business Days of such written demand the amounts demanded
pursuant hereto and in accordance herewith, then the Indemnified Party may
utilize any legal or equitable remedy to collect from the Indemnifying Party
the amount of its Damages. Interest shall accrue on any amounts owed to an
Indemnified Party and not timely paid by the Indemnifying Party at an annual
rate of eighteen percent (18%) or, if less, the maximum rate permitted by
under applicable Law (the " _Default Rate_ ") and shall constitute additional
Damages payable to the Indemnified Party. If either the Sellers or the Buyer
shall fail to deliver joint written instructions with the other party pursuant
to _Section 10.5_ by the date required to do so, such party shall be liable
to the other party for interest on the amount not timely distributed to the
other party as a result of such failure, which interest shall accrue at the
Default Rate from the date of such failure until the date when such joint
written instructions are delivered.

 



 

10.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. The remedies provided for in this _ARTICLE 10_ and
in _Sections 2.3_ and _6.2_ shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedies
from and after the Closing for any claims made for breach of the
representations and warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement or any
of the Schedules or Exhibits attached hereto or in any of the certificates or
other instruments or documents furnished by any party pursuant to this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that this limitation shall not apply in the
event of fraud or with respect to claims for specific performance or
injunctive or other equitable relief. NO PARTY NOR ANY OF ITS RESPECTIVE
OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, MANAGERS, MEMBERS, PARTNERS, SHAREHOLDERS, TRUSTEES,
EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR AFFILIATES SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE
DAMAGES OF ANY TYPE, OR ANY DAMAGES THAT ARE SPECULATIVE OR REMOTE, WHETHER
SUCH CLAIMS ARISE IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT
ANY SUCH DAMAGES ARE INCLUDED WITHIN A CLAIM AGAINST AN INDEMNIFIED PARTY WITH
RESPECT TO A THIRD PARTY CLAIM FOR WHICH INDEMNIFICATION IS AVAILABLE UNDER
THIS _ARTICLE 10_.

 



      
 

 



 

10.9 _No Double Recovery_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 10.3_, no
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover more than its recoverable
Damages for any claim even though such Damages may have resulted from the
breach of more than one of the representations, warranties, covenants or
obligations of the Indemnifying Party in this Agreement.

 



 

10.10 _Equitable Relief_. The parties mutually agree that if a violation or
threatened violation of any covenant contained in _Section 6.1_ or _6.5_
occurs by the Sellers, such violation or threatened violation may cause
irreparable injury to the Buyer and the remedy at law for any such violation
may be inadequate. The parties further agree that if any Seller violates
_Section 6.1_ or _6.5_ , it would be difficult to determine the entire cost,
damage or injury which the Buyer and its Affiliates would sustain. The parties
agree that, upon any breach or anticipated breach by any Seller of any
covenant contained in _Section 6.1_ or _6.5_ , the Buyer and/or its
Affiliates shall have the right, in addition to any other rights that may be
available to them, to obtain in any court of competent jurisdiction injunctive
relief to restrain any violation by any Seller of such Section(s) or to compel
specific performance by any Seller of one or more of his obligations under
such Section(s) (any requirements for posting of bonds for injunction shall be
satisfied by posting bond in the amount of $500.00). The seeking or obtaining
by the Buyer or its Affiliates of such injunctive relief shall not foreclose
or in any way limit the right of the Buyer to obtain a money judgment against
such Seller for any damage to the Buyer or its Affiliates that may result from
any breach by any Seller of _Section 6.1_ or _6.5_.

of any subsequent breach or failure of the same term or condition, or a waiver
of any other term or condition of this Agreement.

 



 

11.5 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the

 



      
 

 



 

economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



 

11.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the Annexes, Exhibits and
the Disclosure Schedules and other Schedules attached hereto, constitutes the
entire agreement and supersedes all other prior agreements and undertakings,
both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter thereof.

 



 

11.7 _Shareholder Representative_.

 



 

(a) The Shareholder Representative will act as the agent of the Sellers in
connection with, and to facilitate the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by, this Agreement and the other documents contemplated hereby,
and in connection with the activities to be performed on behalf of the Sellers
under this Agreement, and will have the full power and authority to settle and
resolve any disputes which may arise hereunder and to agree to or modify the
methodology or timeframe by which such disputes are to be resolved. Each of
the Sellers hereby authorizes the Shareholder Representative to take any
action on the Sellers behalf in connection with the Sellers performance or
enforcement of this Agreement, including (i) negotiating, settling or
compromising any adjustment to the Purchase Price, including under _Section
2.3_, (ii) performing all covenants to be performed by the Sellers hereunder,
(iii) negotiating, asserting, prosecuting, settling or compromising on behalf
of the Sellers any claim for indemnification against MFRM or the Buyer, (iv)
negotiating, defending, settling or compromising on behalf of the Sellers any
claims against any Seller arising under this Agreement or (v) entering into
the Escrow Agreement and negotiating, asserting, prosecuting, defending,
settling or compromising on behalf of the Sellers any disputes or claims that
may arise under the Escrow Agreement. MFRM and the Buyer shall be entitled to
rely exclusively upon the communications of the Shareholder Representative
relating to the foregoing matters and such communications shall be deemed to
be made on behalf of any or all Sellers and neither MFRM nor the Buyer shall
be required to comply with any instructions or communications from a Seller
even if such instructions or communications are contrary to the instructions
or communications of the Shareholder Representative.

 



 

(b) Neither MFRM nor the Buyer (a) need be concerned with the authority of the
Shareholder Representative to act on behalf of all Sellers as provided
hereunder, or (b) shall be held liable or accountable in any manner for any
act or omission of the Shareholder Representative in such capacity.

 



 

(c) The Sellers agree to, jointly and severally, indemnify the Shareholder
Representative and hold the Shareholder Representative harmless against any
losses or damages incurred by the Shareholder Representative (including
reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Shareholder
Representative) arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the Shareholder Representatives duties hereunder. The
Shareholder Representative shall not have any liability to any Seller or other
Person arising out of or relating to the Shareholder Representatives actions
under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other

 



      
 

 



 

certificate, exhibit, annex, schedule or other document or agreement delivered
or entered into in connection with this Agreement, or with respect to any
other matter in this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other certificate,
exhibit, annex, schedule or other document or agreement delivered or entered
into in connection with this Agreement, including any of his negligent acts or
omissions.

 



 

(d) Unless a Seller or other Person entitled to receive payments from or at
the direction of the Shareholder Representative hereunder has provided in
writing wire transfer instructions to the Shareholder Representative, the
Shareholder Representative shall pay any amounts due to such Person from the
Shareholder Representative by check payable to the order of such Person and
mailed to such Persons last known address. The Shareholder Representative may
rely on the wire transfer instructions or notice address provided by each
Seller in writing until such time as such Seller provides written notice of
new wire transfer instructions or notice address to the Shareholder
Representative (which shall be effective only upon the receipt thereof by the
Shareholder Representative). The Shareholder Representative shall not be
responsible or otherwise liable for any misdirected payments (or to see that
any Person receives any such payment) under this Agreement because such
Persons wire transfer instructions or notice address is incorrect, illegible
or outdated.

 



 

(e) Dale R. Carlsen shall serve as the Shareholder Representative until he
resigns or is otherwise unable or unwilling to serve. In the event that a
Shareholder Representative resigns from such position or is otherwise unable
or unwilling to serve, the Sellers shall select, by the vote or consent of
Sellers whose aggregate Allocation Percentages immediately prior to the
Closing exceed 50%, a successor representative to fill such vacancy, shall
provide prompt written notice to the Buyer of such change and such substituted
representative shall then be deemed to be the Shareholder Representative for
all purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

11.8 _Assignment_. This Agreement, and all rights and powers granted hereby,
will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, but neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests, or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer shall have an absolute right to
assign its rights under this Agreement in whole or in part at any time to an
Affiliate of the Buyer without the Companys, any Sellers or the Shareholder
Representatives prior written approval; _provided, however_ , that such
assignment shall not relieve the Buyer of, and the Buyer shall remain jointly
and severally liable with the assignee for, all obligations hereunder.

 



 

11.9 _Disclosure Schedules_. Notwithstanding the fact that the Disclosure
Schedules are arranged by sections corresponding to the section in this
Agreement or that a particular section of the Agreement makes reference to a
specific Disclosure Schedule and notwithstanding that a particular
representation and warranty may not make a reference to a Disclosure Schedule,
a disclosure made in the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed made in any
other section of the Disclosure Schedule to which the relevance of such
disclosure is readily apparent from the text of such disclosure. The inclusion
of information in the Disclosure Schedules shall not be construed as or
constitute an admission or agreement that a violation, right of termination,
default, liability or other obligation of any kind exists with respect to any
item, nor shall it be construed as or constitute an admission or agreement
that such information is material to the Company or any Seller. In addition,
matters reflected in the Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily limited to
matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in the Disclosure
Schedules. Such additional

 



      
 

 



 

matters are set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily
include other matters of a similar nature. Neither the specifications of any
dollar amount in any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in the Disclosure Schedules
is intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item
so included or other items, are or are not material, and no Person shall use
the fact of the setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such
item in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the Disclosure
Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. Further,
neither the specification of any item or matter in any representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any
specific item in the Disclosure Schedules is intended to imply that such item
or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course of
business, and no Person shall use the fact of setting forth or the inclusion
of any such items or matter in any dispute or controversy between the parties
as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included
in the Disclosure Schedules is or is not in the ordinary course of business
for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

11.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to
principles of conflicts of laws, as to all matters, including matters of
validity, construction, effect, performance and remedies. In respect of any
action, suit or other proceeding relating to this Agreement, each party hereby
irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court
located in Delaware and waives any objection that such venue is an
inconvenient forum.

 



 

11.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts
(including by means of facsimile signature pages), each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which shall constitute one and
the same agreement. Minor variations in the form of the signature page,
including footers from earlier versions of this Agreement or any other
document, shall be disregarded in determining any partys intent or the
effectiveness of such signature.

 



 

11.12 _No Third Party Beneficiaries or Amendments_. This Agreement shall not
confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Indemnified
Parties solely in respect of _ARTICLE 10_, the parties hereto and their
respective permitted successors and assigns. In addition, no provision in this
Agreement shall modify or amend any other agreement, plan, program, or
document (including, for example, a retirement plan) unless this Agreement
explicitly states that the provision amends such other agreement, plan,
program, or document. The foregoing shall not prevent the parties entitled to
enforce this Agreement from enforcing any provision in this Agreement, but no
other party shall be entitled to enforce any provision in this Agreement on
the grounds that it is an amendment to another agreement, plan, program, or
document unless the provision is explicitly designated as such in this
Agreement, and the person is otherwise entitled to enforce the other
agreement, plan, program, or document. If a party not entitled to enforce this
Agreement brings an Action to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an
amendment to another agreement, plan, program, or document and that provision
is construed to be such an amendment despite not being explicitly designated
as an amendment in this Agreement, that provision shall lapse retroactively,
thereby precluding it from having any amendatory effect..

 



 

11.13 _Injunction; Specific Performance_. The parties acknowledge and agree
that the Buyer, the Company or the Sellers, as applicable, would be damaged
irreparably if any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or is otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties
agree that the Buyer, the Company and the Sellers, as applicable, will be

 



       
 

 



 

entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breach of the provisions
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and its terms and
provisions, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages
as a remedy, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled, at
law or in equity.

11.16 _Procedures for Disbursements from Primary Escrow Account._ If any Buyer

or Representative on or before the Initial Release Date (the " ** _Initial
Damages Amount_** "). Buyer hereby covenants and agrees on the written request

Representative to Escrow Agent, promptly after its delivery of the Initial
Damages Amount, directing Escrow Agent to release from the Primary Escrow
Account and deposit into the Secondary Escrow Account an amount equal to (i)
Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($7,500,000), less (ii) aggregate
amounts previously paid from the Primary Escrow Account to Buyer Indemnified
Persons and less (iii) subject to _Section 5(d)_ below, the Initial Damages

_Initial Release_**

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _Amount_** "). On or prior to the second Business Day after the eighteen
(18) month anniversary after the Closing Date (the " ** _Secondary Release
Date_** "), Buyer shall quantify and deliver to Representative one or more of
its good faith estimates of the maximum aggregate amount of Buyer Damages that
Buyer Indemnified Persons may suffer from Direct Claims or Third Party Claims
of which Buyer notified the Sellers or Representative on or before the
Secondary Release Date (the " ** _Secondary Damages Amount_** "). Buyer hereby
covenants and agrees on the written request of Representative to execute and
deliver joint written instructions with Representative to Escrow Agent,
promptly after its delivery of the Secondary Damages Amount, directing Escrow
Agent to release from the Primary Escrow Account and deposit into the
Secondary Escrow Account an amount equal to (x) the amount then held in the
Primary Escrow Account, less (y) subject to _Section 5(d)_ below, the
Secondary Damages Amount (the aggregate of (x) and (y) being collectively the
" ** _Secondary Release Amount_** "). The funds remaining in the Primary
Escrow Account after the release from escrow and payment of the Secondary
Release Amount are referred to as the " ** _Remaining Balance_**." The Parties
agree that the Escrow Agent shall continue to hold the Remaining Balance
pending the final resolution of the Direct Claims or Third Party Claims until
the applicable Final Determination Date with respect to such Direct Claim or
Third Party Claim, whereupon, as and when such Direct Claims or Third Party
Claims are resolved from time to time, Buyer and Representative shall direct
Escrow Agent to release and deposit appropriate amounts of such Remaining
Balance to the Secondary Escrow Account, as directed by Representative or
Buyer (or its designee(s)), as the case may be.

 



 

11.17 _Right to Dispute._ Representative shall have the right to dispute any
estimate of Buyers determination of the Initial Damges Amount or the
Secondary Damages Amount. Upon the issuance of an Order determining that any
portion of Buyers determination of the Initial Damages Amount or the
Secondary Damages Amount was not made in good faith, Representative may
deliver a copy of an Order of such court instructing Escrow Agent to release
any amount from the Primary Escrow Account as specified in such Order.

 



 

11.18 _Disbursements from the Secondary Escrow Account._

 



 

(a) If the amount of the Final Net Working Capital determined pursuant to
Section 2.3 of the Purchase Agreement is more than One Million Dollars
($1,000,000) less than the Estimated Net Working Capital (any such amount
above $1,000,000, the " ** _Excess Amount_** "), Representative may instruct
Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer, from the Secondary Escrow Account, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to such Excess Amount.

 



 

(b) If any amount is required to be paid by Sellers to Buyer in connection
with any Closing Price adjustment pursuant to Section 2.3(e) of the Purchase
Agreement, Representative may instruct Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer, from the
Secondary Escrow Account, by wire transfer of immediately available funds such
amount due to Buyer.

 



 

(c) If any Company Vendor Payments become due pursuant to Section 2.4 of the
Purchase Agreement, Representative may instruct Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer,

funds an amount equal to such Company Vendor Payment.

 



 

(d) If any amount is due and payable by the Sellers to Buyer under Section 2.5

Buyer, from the Secondary Escrow Account, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds such amount due to Buyer.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) If any other amount is due and payable by the Sellers to Buyer under the
Purchase Agreement, Representative may instruct Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer,
from the Secondary Escrow Account, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds such amount due to Buyer.

 



 

(f) The Representative shall have sole control of the disbursements from the
Secondary Escrow Account and may elect, in his sole discretion at any time
from and after the date hereof, to transfer the funds in the Secondary Escrow
Account to a separate account held by the Escrow Agent or by any other banking
institution.

 



 

(g) The terms of Section 11.7 of the Purchase Agreement regarding the
Representative, including but not limited to the liability, indemnification
and authority provisions contained therein, are incorporated herein by
reference and made a part hereof. The Shareholder Representative has the
authority to negotiate, assert, prosecute, settle or compromise on behalf of
the Sellers any claim for indemnification. The Representative may direct the
Escrow Agent to release Secondary Escrow Funds to settle any such claims.

 



 

(h) After the thirty-month anniversary of the Closing Date and on or prior to
the fifth Business Day after the thirty-month anniversary of the Closing Date,
the Representative shall direct the Escrow Agent to release the funds
remaining in the Secondary Escrow Account to the Sellers; provided that the
Representative may direct the Escrow Agent to retain a portion of the
remaining Secondary Escrow Account (the " ** _Secondary Escrow Remaining
Balance_** ") to cover the amount determined by the Representative as
necessary or appropriate to satisfy any indemnification claims communicated to
the Representative on or prior to the thirty-month anniversary of the Closing
Date. The Parties agree that the Escrow Agent will continue to hold any such
Secondary Escrow Remaining Balance pending the final resolution of the
indemnification claims, whereupon, as and when such claims are resolved, the
Representative will direct the Escrow Agent to release and pay the Secondary
Escrow Remaining Balance to the Sellers on a pro rata basis.

 



 

(i) In connection with disbursements pursuant to clauses (i)-(vi) of this
_Section 5(e)_ or as otherwise required by the Representative pursuant to the
Purchase Agreement, upon receipt of the Shareholder Representative Notice (as
defined in Section 6(b)), Escrow Agent will release the amount in the
Shareholder Representative Notice, without further investigation, inquiry or
examination.

Escrow Agent of its responsibilities hereunder is subject to the following
terms and conditions, which the Parties agree shall govern and control with
respect to Escrow Agents rights, duties and liabilities hereunder:

 



 

8.1 _Documents_. Escrow Agent shall be protected in acting upon any written
notice, request, waiver, consent, receipt or other paper or document furnished
to it, not only as to its due execution and validity and the effectiveness of
its provisions, but also as to the truth and accuracy of any information
therein contained, which Escrow Agent in good faith believes to be genuine and
what it purports to be. Should it be necessary for Escrow Agent to act upon
any instructions, directions, documents or instruments issued or signed by or
on behalf of any corporation, partnership, fiduciary or individual acting on
behalf of a Party hereto, it may be necessary for Escrow Agent to inquire into
such corporations, partnerships, fiduciarys or individuals authority;
_provided_ that Escrow Agent believes in good faith that the authority of such
entity or individual is genuine. Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any
Party, any beneficiary or other person for refraining from acting upon any
instruction setting forth, claiming, containing, objecting to, or related to
the transfer or distribution of the Deposit, or any portion thereof, unless
such instruction shall have been delivered to Escrow Agent in accordance with
_Section 26_ below and Escrow Agent has been able to satisfy any applicable
security procedures as may be required thereunder.

 



 

8.2 _Liability_. Escrow Agent shall not be liable for action taken, suffered
or omitted to be taken in good faith, except to the extent that a final
adjudication of a court of competent jurisdiction determines that Escrow
Agents gross negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct or fraud was the cause
of any loss to either Party. No party to this Agreement is liable to any other
party for losses due to, or if it is unable to perform its obligations under
the terms of this Agreement because of, acts of God, fire, war, terrorism,
floods, strikes, electrical outages, equipment or transmission failure, or
other similar causes reasonably beyond its control. Escrow Agent shall have
only those duties as are specifically and expressly provided herein, which
shall

 



      
 

 



 

be deemed purely ministerial in nature, and no other duties, including but not
limited to any fiduciary duty, shall be implied. Escrow Agent may execute any
of its powers and perform any of its duties hereunder directly or through
affiliates or agents. In the event that Escrow Agent shall be uncertain or
believe there is some ambiguity as to its duties or rights hereunder or shall
receive instructions, claims or demands from any Party hereto which, in its
opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement, or, with
respect to the Primary Escrow Account, if Escrow Agent receives conflicting
instructions from the Parties, it shall be entitled to (a) refrain from taking
any action and its sole obligation shall be to keep safely all property held
in escrow until it shall be given (i) joint written instructions executed by
an Authorized Representative of each of Buyer and Representative, which
eliminate such ambiguity or uncertainty to the satisfaction of Escrow Agent or
(ii) an Order (it being understood that Escrow Agent shall be entitled
conclusively to rely and act upon any such Order and shall have no obligation
to determine whether any such Order is final); or (b) file an action in
interpleader. With respect to the Primary Escrow Account, the Parties agree to
pursue any redress or recourse in connection with any dispute between them
without making Escrow Agent a party to the same. Anything in this Agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall Escrow Agent be liable for
special, incidental, punitive, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any
kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if Escrow
Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless
of the form of action.

 



 

8.3 _Legal Counsel_. Escrow Agent may consult with, and obtain advice from,
legal counsel in the event of any question as to any of the provisions hereof
or its duties hereunder, and, except as provided in _Section 8.2_ hereof, it
shall incur no liability and shall be fully protected in acting in good faith
in accordance with the opinion and instructions of such counsel.

 



 

8.4 _Limitation of Duties_. Escrow Agent shall have no duties except those
which are expressly set forth herein and it shall not be bound by any
agreement of the Parties (whether or not it has any knowledge thereof) other
than this Agreement.

 



 

8.5 _Resignation or Termination of Escrow Agent_. Escrow Agent shall have the
right to resign at any time by giving 30 days advance written notice of such
resignation to the Parties, and the Parties shall have the right to terminate
the services of Escrow Agent hereunder at any time by giving 30 days advance
written notice (with such written notice being signed by Buyer and
Representative) of such termination to Escrow Agent, in each case specifying
the effective date of such resignation or termination. With respect to the
Primary Escrow Funds, within five (5) Business Days after receiving or
delivering such notice, as the case may be, the Parties agree to appoint a
successor Escrow Agent to which Escrow Agent shall disburse the Primary Escrow
Funds then held hereunder. With respect to the Secondary Escrow Funds, within
five (5) Business Days after receiving or delivering such notice, as the case
may be, the Representative agrees to appoint a successor Escrow Agent to which
Escrow Agent shall disburse the Secondary Escrow Funds then held hereunder.
If a successor Escrow Agent has not been appointed or has not accepted such
appointment by the end of such 30-day period, Escrow Agent may (i) to the
extent there are Primary Escrow Funds remaining at such time, interplead the
Primary Escrow Funds with a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of
Delaware for the appointment of a successor Escrow Agent, and as between the
Parties, the costs, expenses and reasonable attorneys fees which are incurred
in connection with any such proceeding shall be shared equally by Buyer, on
the one hand, and Representative, on the other hand; (ii) to the extent there
are Secondary Escrow Funds remaining at such time, interplead the Secondary
Escrow Funds with a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware
for the appointment of a successor Escrow Agent, and the costs, expenses and
reasonable attorneys fees which are incurred in

 



       
 

 



 

connection with any such proceeding shall be borne by Representative; or (iii)
appoint a successor escrow agent of its own choice. Any appointment of a
successor escrow agent shall be binding upon the Parties and no appointed
successor escrow agent shall be deemed to be an agent of Escrow Agent. Except
as otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties, no Primary Escrow Funds
shall be released from the Primary Escrow Account following the resignation or
termination of Escrow Agent unless and until a successor Escrow Agent has been
appointed in accordance with this _Section 8.5_ or in accordance with the
directions of an Order, at which time of delivery Escrow Agents obligations
hereunder shall cease and terminate, subject to the provisions of _Section
ARTICLE X_. Except as otherwise agreed to in writing by the Representative and
Escrow Agent, no Secondary Escrow Funds shall be released from the Secondary
Escrow Account following the resignation or termination of Escrow Agent unless
and until a successor Escrow Agent has been appointed in accordance with this
_Section 8.5_ or in accordance with the directions of an Order, at which time
of delivery Escrow Agents obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate,
subject to the provisions of _Section ARTICLE X_.

 



 

8.6 _Discharge of Escrow Agent_. Upon disbursement of all of the Deposit
pursuant to the terms of _Sections ARTICLE V_ and ARTICLE VI above or
delivery thereof to a successor escrow agent in accordance with this
Agreement, Escrow Agent shall thereafter be discharged from any further
obligations hereunder, except pursuant to _Section 8.2_. With respect to the
Primary Escrow Account, Escrow Agent is hereby authorized, in any and all
events, to comply with and obey any and all Orders and, if it shall so comply
or obey, it shall not be liable to any other person or entity by reason of
such compliance or obedience.

 



 

ARTICLE IX **Income Tax Allocation and Reporting; Tax Distributions**.

 



 

9.1 The Parties agree that only for U.S. federal and all applicable state tax
purposes the Deposit deposited by Buyer with Escrow Agent pursuant to this
Agreement shall be treated as being held for the benefit of the Sellers. The
Parties further agree that all income earned from the investment of the
Deposit shall be allocated to the Sellers, in accordance to their respective
percentage allocation in Exhibit A hereto, for tax purposes whether or not
such income is distributed during such year. Escrow Agent shall report to the
Internal Revenue Service (" ** _IRS_** "), or any other taxing authority, as
of each calendar year-end on IRS Form 1099 or 1042-S (or other appropriate
form), all income earned from the investment of the Deposit for the account of
the Sellers (whether or not such income has been distributed during such
year), as and to the extent required under the provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " ** _Code_** "), and the Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder, as amended. For the avoidance of doubt, in
no event shall the income earned from the investment of the Deposit be
reported as earned for the account of Buyer. The Parties hereby represent to
Escrow Agent that no other tax reporting of any kind is required to be made by
the Escrow Agent given the underlying transaction giving rise to this
Agreement.

 



 

9.2 As an agreement with which Escrow Agent need not be concerned with respect
to the underlying transaction, (i) at the time any amounts are distributed by
Escrow Agent to the Sellers or Buyer (except for amounts attributable to
income earned from the investment of the Deposit), Representative and Buyer
shall jointly prepare a detailed schedule indicating the allocation of the
disbursement amount from the Primary Escrow Amount, and Representative shall
prepare a detailed schedule indicating the allocation of the disbursement
amount from the Secondary Escrow Amount, between (1) principal, (2) imputed
interest to be reported on IRS Form 1099-INT, (3) Original Issue Discount ("
** _OID_** ") to be reported on IRS Form 1099-OID, and/or (4) the portion of
the Primary Escrow Amount or the Secondary Escrow Amount delivered

 



      
 

 



 

to Buyer, along with the relevant payee tax information, documentation, and
proportionate interest thereof, and (ii) based upon the schedule so prepared,
Buyer shall issue Form(s) 1099 to the Sellers reflecting such imputed interest
and/or OID set forth on such schedule.

 



 

9.3 The Parties agree with Escrow Agent that no withholding under Section 1445
of the Code is required in connection with the underlying transaction because
each Seller (i) is not a nonresident alien for purposes of U.S. federal income
taxation, (ii) is not a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign
trust, or foreign estate (as those terms are defined in the Code and the
Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder), and (iii) is not a disregarded
entity as defined in Treasury regulations Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii).

 



 

9.4 Any taxes payable on income earned from the investment of the Deposit
shall be paid by the Sellers, as and to the extent required under the
provisions of the Code and its regulations, whether or not the income was
distributed by Escrow Agent during any particular year. In order to permit the
Sellers to satisfy their tax obligations attributable to the taxable income
and gain earned from the investment of the Deposit, within ten (10) days after
the end of each calendar quarter (a " ** _Quarter_** ") during which any
Primary Escrow Funds or Secondary Escrow Funds are on balance in the Primary
Escrow Account or the Secondary Escrow Account, Escrow Agent shall distribute
to Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, to the account or accounts
designated by Representative, an amount equal to 52% of all income earned on
the investment of the Deposit during such Quarter (the " ** _Tax
Distribution_** ").

 



 

9.5 Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility for the preparation or filing of
any tax or information return with respect to any transaction, whether or not
related to this Agreement (or a related agreement), that occurs outside the
escrow created by this Agreement.

 



 

9.6 Buyer and Representative shall each furnish Escrow Agent with an IRS Form
W-8 or IRS Form W-9, as applicable, and Representative shall deliver or cause
to be delivered to Escrow Agent on or prior to the execution of this
Agreement, a properly completed Form W-9 from each Seller. Escrow Agent shall
withhold any taxes it deems appropriate in the absence of proper tax
documentation or as required by law, and shall remit such taxes to the
appropriate authorities.

 



 

9.7 Except as otherwise required by applicable law, neither any Seller, any
Party nor Escrow Agent shall take any position for U.S. federal or applicable
state income tax purposes that is inconsistent with the provisions of this
_Section ARTICLE_ IX.

 



 

ARTICLE X **Indemnification**. The Parties shall jointly and severally
indemnify and defend Escrow Agent and its affiliates and their respective
successors, assigns, directors, agents and employees (" ** _Indemnitees_** ")
from and to hold them harmless against any losses, damages, claims,
liabilities, penalties, judgments, settlements, litigation, investigations,
costs, and reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) (other than the normal administrative and other costs associated
with acting as an escrow agent, for which Escrow Agent shall be compensated in
accordance with _Section ARTICLE_ XI) (collectively " ** _Losses_** ")
arising out of or in connection with (i) Escrow Agents performance of this
Agreement, tax reporting or withholding, the enforcement of any rights or
remedies under or in connection with this Agreement, or as may arise by reason
of any act, omission or error of any Indemnitee, or (ii) Escrow Agents
following any instructions or directions in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, except in the case of any Indemnitee to the extent that such Losses
are finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been
caused by the bad faith, fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such
Indemnitee. The indemnity obligations set forth in this

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section ARTICLE_ X shall survive the resignation, replacement or removal of
Escrow Agent or the termination of this Agreement.

 



 

ARTICLE XI **Escrow Costs**.

 



 

(a) Escrow Agent shall be paid reasonable fees for the services to be rendered
hereunder and shall be reimbursed for certain reasonable, out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in accordance with the performance of such services, which
fees and reimbursable expenses are set forth on _Schedule B_ attached hereto.
Buyer will pay 50% of such fees and expenses and Representative (on behalf of
the Sellers) shall pay the other 50% of such fees and expenses; _provided_
that after disbursement of the entire Primary Escrow Amount, Representative
(on behalf of the Sellers) shall pay 100% of such fees and expenses.

 



 

(b) Each of the Parties further agrees to the disclosures and agreements set
forth in _Schedule B_.

 



 

ARTICLE XII **Limitations on Rights to Escrow Funds**. Neither of the Parties
shall have any right, title or interest in or to, or possession of, the
Deposit and therefore shall not have the ability to pledge, convey,
hypothecate or grant as security all or any portion of the Deposit, unless and
until such Deposit has been disbursed pursuant to _Sections ARTICLE V_ above.

 



 

ARTICLE XIII **Notices**. Except as otherwise provided in Section 26 below,
all communications hereunder shall be in writing or set forth in a PDF
(hereinafter defined) attached to an email, and all such communications from a
Party to another Party or from a Party or the Parties to Escrow Agent shall be
executed by an Authorized Representative, and shall be delivered in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement by facsimile, to the extent one is provided
below (with delivery confirmation), email (with delivery confirmation) or
overnight courier (providing proof of delivery) only to the appropriate fax
number, email address, or notice address set forth for each party as follows:

Any party hereto may change the address to which notices, requests, claims,
and other communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other
parties hereto prior written notice thereof in the manner herein set forth in
this _Section 13_.

 



 

ARTICLE XIV **Entire Agreement; Amendments**. This Agreement contains the
entire understanding of the Parties, on the one hand, and Escrow Agent, on the
other hand, with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior
understandings or agreements by or between the Parties, on the one hand, and
Escrow Agent, on the other hand, whether written or oral, that may have
related to the subject matter hereof in any way. This Agreement may be
amended, or any provision of this Agreement may be waived, so long as such
amendment or waiver is set forth in a writing executed by each of the Parties
and Escrow Agent. No course of dealing between the Parties shall be deemed
effective to modify, amend or discharge any part of this Agreement or any
rights or obligations of any party hereto under or by reason of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, as
between the Parties, if there is an inconsistency between the provisions of
this Agreement and the provisions of the Purchase Agreement, the provisions of
the Purchase Agreement will control.

 



      
 

 



 

ARTICLE XV **Assigns and Assignment**. This Agreement may not be assigned
without the prior consent of Escrow Agent and each of the Parties, but all
actions taken hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and shall be binding
upon the Parties and Escrow Agent and upon all of their respective successors
and assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that Escrow Agent shall not be permitted
to assign its obligations hereunder except as provided in _Section 8.5_
hereof and except to any entity into which Escrow Agent may be merged or
consolidated or to any entity to whom Escrow Agent may transfer all or
substantially all of its escrow business as long as such entity assumes in
writing all of the obligations of Escrow Agent hereunder. Furthermore, Escrow
Agent must be satisfied with all required Patriot Act, Know Your Customer
("KYC") Anti-Money Laundering ("AML"), and other information delivered by the
assigning Party, including new contact information for notices, new funds
transfer instructions and an updated _Schedule C_ , prior to such assignment
becoming effective and allow a reasonable amount of time for Escrow Agent to
perform its due diligence involving the review of such information.

 



 

ARTICLE XVI **Withholding**. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
herein, Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
disbursements of the Deposit hereunder such amounts as may be required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code, or under any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable legal
requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid to the Party in respect of which Escrow Agent made such withholding or
deduction.

 



 

ARTICLE XVII **No Other Third Party Beneficiaries**. Nothing herein expressed
or implied is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or to give any
party other than Escrow Agent, the Parties and their permitted assigns any
rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

ARTICLE XVIII **Interpretation**. The headings in this Agreement are inserted
for convenience of reference only and shall not be a part of or control or
affect the meaning hereof.

 



 

ARTICLE XIX **No Waiver**. No waiver by any party hereto of any default by any
other party hereto in the performance of any provision, condition, or
requirement herein shall be deemed to be a waiver of, or in any manner release
the defaulting party from, performance of any other provision, condition, or
requirement herein, nor shall such waiver be deemed to be a waiver of, or in
any manner a release of, the defaulting party from future performance of the
same provision, condition, or requirement. Any delay or omission of any party
hereto to exercise any right hereunder shall not impair the exercise of any
such right, or any like right, accruing to it thereafter. The failure of any
party hereto to perform its obligations hereunder shall not release the other
parties hereto from the performance of such obligations.

 



 

ARTICLE XX **Severability**. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof,
_provided_ that any provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation or in any jurisdiction will not affect the
enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in
any other jurisdiction.

 



 

ARTICLE XXI **No Strict Construction**. The language used in this Agreement
shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express
their collective mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be
applied against any party hereto. The term "including" as used herein shall be
by way of example, and shall not be deemed to constitute a limitation of any
term or provision contained herein. Each defined term used in this Agreement
has a comparable meaning when used in its plural or singular form.

 



      
 

 



 

ARTICLE XXII **Disbursements on Non-Business Days**. In the event that a
disbursement of the Deposit hereunder is required to be made on a date that is
not a Business Day, such release may be made on the next succeeding Business
Day with the same force and effect as if made when required. " ** _Business
Day_** " means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or other day on which
commercial banks in Houston, Texas are authorized or required by law to close.

 



 

ARTICLE XXIII **Governing Law**. The legal relations between the Parties, on
the one hand, and Escrow Agent, on the other hand, with respect hereto shall
be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State
of Delaware without regard or giving effect to any choice or conflict of law
provision or rule (whether of such state or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than such state.
Escrow Agent and the Parties further hereby waive any right to a trial by jury
with respect to any lawsuit or judicial proceeding arising under this
Agreement that involves Escrow Agent, on the one hand, and either or both of
the Parties, on the other hand.

 



 

ARTICLE XXIV **Choice of Forum**. Any dispute, controversy, claim, or action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement involving Escrow Agent, on the
one hand, and either or both of the Parties, on the other hand, each as
amended from time to time, including regarding the validity or effect of this
Agreement or the performance, validity, interpretation, application, or
termination hereof, shall be brought in the federal or state courts located in
the City of Wilmington, State of Delaware. With respect to all such disputes,
controversies, claims, or actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement
involving Escrow Agent, on the one hand, and either or both of the Parties, on
the other hand, each of the Parties and Escrow Agent (a) irrevocably submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any such dispute,
controversy, claim, or action, (b) waives any objection it may now or
hereafter have to venue or to an inconvenient forum, (c) agrees that all such
disputes, controversies, claims, and actions shall be heard and determined
only in such courts, and (d) agrees not to bring any dispute, controversy,
claim, or action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any documents
contemplated hereby in any other court. To the extent that in any jurisdiction
either Party may now or hereafter be entitled to claim for itself or its
assets, immunity from suit, execution, attachment (before or after judgment)
or other legal process, such Party shall not claim, and hereby irrevocably
waives, such immunity.

 



 

ARTICLE XXV **Counterparts**. This Agreement and any joint instructions may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument. The exchange of copies of this Agreement and of signature pages by
facsimile transmission (whether directly from one facsimile device to another
by means of a dial-up connection or whether otherwise transmitted via
electronic transmission), by electronic mail in "portable document format" ("
** _PDF_** ") form, or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the
original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, or by a combination
of such means, shall constitute effective execution and delivery of this
Agreement as to the Parties and Escrow Agent and may be used in lieu of an
original Agreement for all purposes. Signatures of the Parties and Escrow
Agent transmitted by facsimile or other electronic transmission shall be
deemed to be original signatures of each party whose signature it reproduces
and shall be binding upon such party for all purposes. Minor variations in the
form of signature pages of this Agreement, including footers from earlier
versions of this Agreement, shall be disregarded in determining any intent of
a Party or Escrow Agent or the effectiveness of such signature.

 



 

ARTICLE XXVI **Security Procedures**. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in _Section 13_, any instructions setting forth, claiming,
containing, objecting to, or in any way related to the transfer or
distribution of funds, must be in writing or set forth in a PDF attached to an
email, executed by the appropriate Party or Parties in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, may be given to Escrow Agent only by confirmed
facsimile or by emailed PDF and no instruction for or related to the transfer
or

 



      
 

 



 

distribution of the Deposit, or any portion thereof, shall be deemed delivered
and effective unless Escrow Agent actually shall have received such
instruction by facsimile or by emailed PDF at the number or email provided to
the Parties by Escrow Agent in accordance with _Section 13_ and as further
evidenced by a confirmed transmittal to that number or email address and
Escrow Agent has been able to satisfy any applicable security procedures as
may be required hereunder. Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any Party or
other person for refraining from acting upon any instruction for or related to
the transfer or distribution of the Deposit if delivered to any other fax
number or email address including but not limited to a valid email address of
any employee of Escrow Agent other than in accordance with _Section 13_.

 



 

26.1 In the event funds transfer instructions are so received by Escrow Agent
by facsimile or emailed PDF, which has been executed by the appropriate Party
or Parties as evidenced by the signature of the person or persons executing
this Agreement or one of their designated persons set forth on the Designation
of Authorized Representatives attached hereto as _Schedules C-1_ and _C-2_
(each an " ** _Authorized Representative_** "), Escrow Agent is authorized to
seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to the person or
persons designated on such _Schedule C-1_ and _C-2_ hereto, and Escrow Agent
may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be an Authorized
Representative. Each Designation of Authorized Representatives shall be signed
by the Secretary, any Assistant Secretary or other duly authorized officer of
the named Party. The person(s) executing this Agreement on such Partys behalf
and certifying Authorized Representatives in the applicable _Schedule C-1_ and
_C-2_ have been duly and properly authorized to do so, and each Authorized
Representative of such Party has been duly and properly authorized to take the
actions specified for such person in the applicable _Schedule C-1_ and _C-2_.
A Party may change its respective persons and telephone numbers for call-backs
only in a writing actually received and acknowledged by Escrow Agent. Escrow
Agent, any intermediary bank and the beneficiarys bank in any funds transfer
may rely upon the identifying number of the beneficiarys bank or any
intermediary bank included in the funds transfer instruction provided by the
relevant Party or Parties and confirmed by an Authorized Representative.
Further, the beneficiarys designated bank in the funds transfer instructions
may make payment on the basis of the account number provided in such Partys
or the Parties instruction and confirmed by an Authorized Representative,
even though it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary. No
funds will be disbursed until an Authorized Representative is able to confirm
such instructions by telephone callback.

 



 

26.2 Buyer acknowledges that Escrow Agent is authorized to use the following
funds transfer instructions to disburse any funds due to Buyer under this
Agreement without a verifying call-back as set forth in _Section 26.1_ above:

writing by the Representative.

 



      
 

 



 

26.3 In addition to their respective funds transfer instructions as set forth
in _Section 26.2_ above, the Parties acknowledge that repetitive funds
transfer instructions may be given to Escrow Agent for one or more
beneficiaries where only the date of the requested transfer, the amount of
funds to be transferred, and/or the description of the payment shall change
within the repetitive instructions (" ** _Standing Settlement Instructions_**
"). Accordingly, the Parties shall deliver to Escrow Agent such specific
Standing Settlement Instructions only for each respective beneficiary, by
facsimile in accordance with this _Section ARTICLE XXVI_. Any such Standing
Settlement Instructions shall be set up in writing in advance of any actual
transfer request and shall contain complete funds transfer information (as set
forth above) for the beneficiary. Any such set-up of Standing Settlement
Instructions (other than those established concurrently with the execution of
this Agreement), and any changes in existing set-up, shall be confirmed by
means of a verifying callback to an Authorized Representative. Standing
Settlement Instructions will continue to be followed until cancelled by the
Parties jointly in a writing signed by an Authorized Representative and
delivered to Escrow Agent in accordance with this Section. Once set up as
provided herein, Escrow Agent may rely solely upon such Standing Settlement
Instructions and all identifying information set forth therein for each
beneficiary. Escrow Agent may rely solely upon such Standing Settlement
Instructions and all identifying information set forth therein for each
beneficiary. Escrow Agent and the Parties agree that such Standing Settlement
Instructions shall be effective as the funds transfer instructions of the
Parties, without requiring a verifying callback, whether or not authorized, if
such Standing Settlement Instructions are consistent with previously
authenticated Standing Settlement Instructions for that beneficiary.

 



 

26.4 The Parties acknowledge that there are certain security, corruption,
transmission error and access availability risks associated with using open
networks such as the internet and the Parties hereby expressly assume such
risks. Furthermore, the Parties acknowledge that the security procedures set
forth in this _Section ARTICLE XXVI_ are commercially reasonable.

 



 

ARTICLE XXVII **Compliance with Court Orders**. In the event that any escrow
property shall be attached, garnished or levied upon by any court order, or
the delivery thereof shall be stayed or enjoined by an order of a court, or
any order, judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any court order
affecting the property deposited under this Agreement, Escrow Agent is hereby
expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to obey and comply with all
writs, orders or decrees so entered or issued, which it is advised by legal
counsel of its own choosing is binding upon it, whether with or without
jurisdiction, and in the event that Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any
such writ, order or decree it shall not be liable to any of the Parties or to
any other person, entity, firm or corporation, by reason of such compliance
notwithstanding such writ, order or decree be subsequently reversed, modified,
annulled, set aside or vacated.

 



 

ARTICLE XXVIII **Patriot Act Disclosure**. Section 326 of the Uniting and
Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and
Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (" ** _USA PATRIOT Act_** ") requires Escrow
Agent to implement reasonable procedures to verify the identity of any person
that opens a new account with it. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge that
Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and Escrow Agents identity verification
procedures require Escrow Agent to obtain information which may be used to
confirm the Parties identities including name, address and organizational
documents (" ** _identifying information_** "). The Parties agree to provide
Escrow Agent with and consent to Escrow Agent obtaining from third parties any
such identifying information required as a condition of opening an account
with or using any service provided by Escrow Agent.

 



      
 

 



 

ARTICLE XXIX **Information**. The Parties authorize the Escrow Agent to
disclose information with respect to this Agreement and the account(s)
established hereunder, the Parties, or any transaction hereunder if such
disclosure is: (i) necessary or desirable, in the Escrow Agents opinion, for
the purpose of allowing the Escrow Agent to perform its duties and to exercise
its powers and rights hereunder; (ii) to a proposed assignee of the rights of
Escrow Agent; (iii) to a branch, affiliate, subsidiary, employee or agent of
the Escrow Agent or to their auditors, regulators or legal advisers or to any
competent court; (iv) to the auditors of any of the Parties; or (v) permitted
or required by applicable law, regardless of whether the disclosure is made in
the country in which each Party resides, in which the escrow account is
maintained, or in which the transaction is conducted. The Parties agree that
such disclosures by the Escrow Agent and its affiliates may be transmitted
across national boundaries and through networks, including those owned by
third parties.

 **Disclosures and Agreements**

 



 

 **Representations Relating to Section 15B of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (Rule 15Ba1-1 et seq.) (the "Municipal Advisor Rule)**. Each Party
represents and warrants to the Escrow Agent that for

 



 

 _Schedule B to 
Escrow Agreement_

      
 

 



 

purposes of the Municipal Advisor Rules, none of the funds (if any) currently
invested, or that will be invested in the future, in money market funds,
commercial paper or treasury bills under this Agreement constitute or contain
(i) proceeds of municipal securities (including investment income therefrom
and monies pledged or otherwise legally dedicated to serve as collateral or a
source or repayment for such securities) or (ii) municipal escrow investments
(as each such term is defined in the Municipal Advisor Rule). Each Party also
represents and warrants to the Escrow Agent that the person providing this
certification has access to the appropriate information or has direct
knowledge of the source of the funds to be invested to enable the forgoing
representation to be made. Further, each Party acknowledges that the Escrow
Agent will rely on this representation until notified in writing otherwise.

 



 

 **Patriot Act Disclosure.** Section 326 of the Uniting and Strengthening
America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct
Terrorism Act of 2001 ("USA PATRIOT Act") requires Escrow Agent to implement
reasonable procedures to verify the identity of any person that opens a new
account with it. Accordingly, you acknowledge that Section 326 of the USA
PATRIOT Act and Escrow Agents identity verification procedures require Escrow
Agent to obtain information which may be used to confirm your identity
including without limitation name, address and organizational documents
("identifying information"). You agree to provide Escrow Agent with and
consent to Escrow Agent obtaining from third parties any such identifying
information required as a condition of opening an account with or using any
service provided by Escrow Agent.

 



 

 **OFAC Disclosure**. Escrow Agent is required to act in accordance with the
laws and regulations of various jurisdictions relating to the prevention of
money laundering and the implementation of sanctions, including but not
limited to regulations issued by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control.
Escrow Agent is not obligated to execute payment orders or effect any other
transaction where the beneficiary or other payee is a person or entity with
whom Escrow Agent is prohibited from doing business by any law or regulation
applicable to Escrow Agent, or in any case where compliance would, in Escrow
Agents opinion, conflict with applicable law or banking practice or its own
policies and procedures. Where Escrow Agent does not execute a payment order
or effect a transaction for such reasons, Escrow Agent may take any action
required by any law or regulation applicable to Escrow Agent including,
without limitation, freezing or blocking funds. Transaction screening may
result in delays in the posting of transactions.

 



 

 **Abandoned Property**. Escrow Agent is required to act in accordance with
the laws and regulations of various states relating to abandoned property and,
accordingly, shall be entitled to remit dormant funds to any state as
abandoned property in accordance with such laws and regulations.

 



 

 **THE FOLLOWING DISCLOSURES ARE REQUIRED TO BE PROVIDED UNDER APPLICABLE U.S.
REGULATIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATION D.
WHERE SPECIFIC INVESTMENTS ARE NOTED BELOW, THE DISCLOSURES APPLY ONLY TO
THOSE INVESTMENTS AND NOT TO ANY OTHER INVESTMENT.**

 



 

 **Demand Deposit Account Disclosure**. Escrow Agent is authorized, for
regulatory reporting and internal accounting purposes, to divide an escrow
demand deposit account maintained in the U.S. in which the Deposit is held
into a non-interest bearing demand deposit internal account and a non-interest
bearing savings internal account, and to transfer funds on a daily basis
between these internal accounts on Escrow Agents general ledger in accordance
with U.S. law at no cost to the Parties. Escrow Agent will record the internal
accounts and any transfers between them on Escrow Agents books and records
only. The internal accounts and any transfers between them will not affect the
Deposit, any investment or disposition of the Deposit, use of the escrow
demand deposit account or any other activities under this

      
 

 



 

Agreement, except as described herein. Escrow Agent will establish a target
balance for the demand deposit internal account, which may change at any time.
To the extent funds in the demand deposit internal account exceed the target
balance, the excess will be transferred to the savings internal account,
unless the maximum number of transfers from the savings internal account for
that calendar month or statement cycle has already occurred. If withdrawals
from the demand deposit internal account exceeds the available balance in the
demand deposit internal account, funds from the savings internal account will
be transferred to the demand deposit internal account up to the entire balance
of available funds in the savings internal account to cover the shortfall and
to replenish any target balance that Escrow Agent has established for the
demand deposit internal account. If a sixth transfer is needed during a
calendar month or statement cycle, it will be for the entire balance in the
savings internal account, and such funds will remain in the demand deposit
internal account for the remainder of the calendar month or statement cycle.

 



 

 **Money Market Deposit Account Disclosure and Agreement**. If a Money Market
Deposit Account ("MMDA") is the investment for the escrow deposit as set forth
above or anytime in the future, you acknowledge and agree that U.S. law limits
the number of pre-authorized or automatic transfers or withdrawals or
telephonic/electronic instructions that can be made from an MMDA to a total of
six (6) per calendar month or statement cycle or similar period. Escrow Agent
is required by U.S. law to reserve the right to require at least seven (7)
days notice prior to a withdrawal from a money market deposit account.

 



 

 **Unlawful Internet Gambling**. The use of any account to conduct
transactions (including, without limitation, the acceptance or receipt of
funds through an electronic funds transfer, or by check, draft or similar
instrument, or the proceeds of any of the foregoing) that are related,
directly or indirectly, to unlawful Internet gambling is strictly prohibited.

 **RELEASE AND WAIVER**

 



 

THIS RELEASE AND WAIVER (this " ** _Release and Waiver_** ") dated [
], 2014 (the " ** _Effective Date_** ") is given in connection with and in
reliance upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by that
certain Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated September 3, 2014 (the " **
_Purchase Agreement_** "), by and among Mattress Firm, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" ** _Buyer_** "), Mattress Firm Holding Corp., a Delaware
corporation (" ** _MFRM_** "), The Sleep Train, Inc., a California corporation
(the " ** _Company_** "), the undersigned shareholder of the Company (the " **
_Seller_** "), the other shareholders of the Company signatory thereto, Dale
R. Carlsen, individually, solely for the purposes of Sections 3.6 and 6.5
therein, Robert D. Killgore, individually, solely for purposes of Sections 3.7
and 6.5 therein, and Dale R. Carlsen, in his capacity as the representative of
the shareholders of the Company, and in consideration of the payments and
other consideration received by the undersigned thereunder. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Seller represents and acknowledges that in executing this
Release and Waiver, the Seller does not rely and has not relied upon any
representation or statement, oral or written, not set forth herein or in the
Purchase Agreement made by Buyer, MFRM, the Company, or any of their
respective agents, representatives or attorneys with regard to the subject
matter, basis or effect of this Release and Waiver or otherwise.

 



 

1. As of the Effective Date, the Seller hereby unconditionally, irrevocably, completely, and forever RELEASES, DISCHARGES and ACQUITS the Company and its shareholders, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors and assigns, together with their past and present directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, and any other party associated with the Company (collectively with the Company, the " ** _Company Parties_** "), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from any and all claims, obligations, costs, losses, expenses (including attorneys fees), causes of action, rights, demands, debts, liens, liabilities or damages of any nature whatsoever, whether known or unknown, pending or threatened, direct or contingent, suspected or unsuspected, including, without limitation, rights arising out of alleged violations of any contracts, express or implied, any covenant of good faith and fair dealing, express or implied, or any tort which the Seller has now or at any time hereafter may have by reason of any matter, cause, thing, act, occurrence, omission or any other factor, situation or event whatsoever that has arisen, occurred or accrued on or prior to the Effective Date against any of the Company Parties, including, without limitation, any claims (i) that arise out of the management or control of, or services provided to, the Company, (ii) that arise, whether in contract or in tort, based upon fraud or misrepresentation, breach of duty or common law, or (iii) that arise under or by virtue of any judicial decision, statute or regulation, for past, present, known, and unknown injuries, property or economic damage, and all other losses and damages of any kind, _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing, the releases granted herein shall not be deemed to release or waive any claim, demand, or cause of action, or damages and remedies related thereto, arising out of or in connection with: (A) the contracts listed on Exhibit A attached hereto, (B) any accrued and unpaid remuneration (including any bonus earned but as yet unpaid) or unreimbursed expenses, but solely to the extent accrued as a current liability of the Company as of the Effective Date, (C) any claims that cannot be released or waived by law, including without limitation any unemployment compensation claim or workers compensation claim (the settlement of which would require approval by the California Workers Compensation Appeals Board), (D) any rights relating exclusively to employee welfare or pension benefits as governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1976, as amended, (E) any right of any Seller in any item listed on Schedule 4.20(a) of the Disclosure Schedule to the Purchase Agreement that remains outstanding as of the Effective Date, (F) any right of any Seller under any insurance policy that was in effect on or prior to the Effective Date or the proceeds thereof (G) any right of any Seller to indemnification in his, her or its capacity as a director or an officer of the Company to the extent provided in any written agreement or the articles of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of any of the Company Parties, in each case as in effect as of the Effective Date. In addition, the Seller hereby waives all rights and benefits afforded by any state laws, including 

      
 

 



 

but not limited to California Civil Code section 1542, which provide in
substance that a general release does not extend to claims which a person does
not know or suspect to exist in his, her or its favor at the time of executing
the release which, if known by the Seller, must have materially affected the
Sellers settlement with the other party. The Seller acknowledges that the
Seller is assuming the risk of such unknown claims, understands that this
Release and Waiver applies thereto and expressly intends to waive such claims
to the full extent that the Seller may lawfully do so. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Company Parties as defined and used herein shall not include the
Buyer or MFRM and the Buyer and MFRM shall not be entitled to rely on or
enforce this Agreement in their own right.

 



 

2. The Seller hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain from, directly or indirectly, asserting any claim or demand, or commencing, instituting or causing to be commenced any proceeding of any kind against any of the Company Parties based upon any claim released hereby.
