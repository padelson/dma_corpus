agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I** ** 
THE MERGER**

 



 

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company at the
Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the

259 of the DGCL.

 



 

1.2 _The Closing_. The Closing shall take place at the offices of Wilmer

(b) the Buyer and Merger Sub shall deliver to the Company the various
certificates, instruments and documents referred to in _Section 6.2_;

 



 

(c) the Buyer shall cause the Certificate of Merger to be filed with the

(d) the Buyer shall:

 



 

(i) pay (in accordance with the applicable wire transfer instructions
accompanying the Pre-Closing Certificate) the Company Expenses identified in
the Pre-Closing Certificate to the Persons to whom such Company Expenses are
owed (as set forth in the Pre-Closing Certificate);

 



 

(ii) pay (in accordance with the applicable wire transfer instructions
accompanying the Pre-Closing Certificate) the Company Debt identified in the
Pre-Closing Certificate to the Persons to whom such Company Debt is owed (as
set forth in the Pre-Closing Certificate);

 



 

(iii) pay (in accordance with the Surviving Corporations standard payroll

Employee Obligations identified in the Pre-Closing Certificate to the Persons
to whom such Employee Obligations are owed (as set forth in the Pre-Closing
Certificate);

 



 

(iv) deposit the General Escrow Amount and the Adjustment Escrow Amount with
the Escrow Agent to be held in accordance with and subject to the terms and
conditions of the Escrow Agreement;

 



     

 

 



 

(v) deliver the Company Equityholder Representative Expense Amount to the
Company Equityholder Representative in accordance with the applicable wire
transfer instructions accompanying the Pre-Closing Certificate; and

 



 

(vi) pay (by wire transfer) to the Payment Agent an amount in cash equal to
the portion of the Closing Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section
1.5_.

 



 

1.4 _Additional Actions_. The Surviving Corporation may, at any time after the
Effective Time, take any action, including executing and delivering any
document, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, in
order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

1.5 _Conversion of Company Shares; Conversion of Merger Sub Shares_. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
any Party or the holder of any Company Share:

 



 

(a) _Conversion of Company Shares_. All Company Shares that are issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Dissenting Shares and Company Shares referenced in _Section 1.5(b)_) shall be
cancelled and converted, in the aggregate, into the right of the holders
thereof to receive their respective portions, without interest and subject to
_Section 1.14_, of (i) the Closing Merger Consideration, such portions to be
as shown on the Allocation Schedule, and (ii) any Future Payment that may
become payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, such portions to be as shown on the Allocation Schedule.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock_. Any Company Shares held in the Companys
treasury immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
retired without payment of any consideration therefor.

 



 

(c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, $0.001 par
value per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and thereafter evidence one share of
common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

1.6 _Dissenting Shares_.

 



 

(a) Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive the amounts payable, if any, in respect of such Company Shares
pursuant to _Section 1.5_ unless the holder holding such Dissenting Shares
shall have forfeited his, her or its right to appraisal under the DGCL or
properly withdrawn his, her or its demand for appraisal. If such holder has so
forfeited or withdrawn his, her or its right to appraisal of Dissenting
Shares, then, as of the occurrence of such event, such holders Dissenting
Shares shall cease to be Dissenting Shares and shall be converted into and
represent the right to receive pursuant to _Section 1.10_ the amounts payable
(or that may become payable), if any, in respect of such Company Shares
pursuant to _Section 1.5_.

 



 

(b) The Company shall give the Buyer (i) prompt notice of any written demands
for appraisal of any Company Shares, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments

 



     

 

 



 

that relate to such demands received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity
to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of the Buyer, make voluntarily any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisal of Company Shares or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

 



 

1.7 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws; Directors and Officers_.

 



 

(a) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time shall be amended to read in its entirety in the
form attached as _Exhibit C_.

 



 

(b) The By-laws of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the
Effective Time shall be the same as the By-laws of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of the corporation set forth
therein shall be changed to the name of the Company.

 



 

(c) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with
the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

1.8 _No Further Rights_. From and after the Effective Time, no Company Shares
shall be deemed to be outstanding, and holders of certificates formerly
representing Company Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except as provided herein or by Law.

 



 

1.9 _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of Company Shares shall
thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, certificates formerly
representing Company Shares are presented to the Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the applicable amounts
payable, if any, in respect of such Company Shares pursuant to _Section 1.5_,
subject to the provisions of _Article VII_ and subject further to applicable
Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

 



 

1.10 _Appointment of Payment Agent; Exchange of Shares_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer shall appoint a payment agent (the
" _Payment Agent_ ") to effect the payment and distribution of the Aggregate
Merger Consideration that becomes payable pursuant to _Section 1.5_ or
_Section 1.13(c)_, in exchange for Company Shares or Company Warrants.
Promptly (and in no event more than five (5) business days) following the
Effective Time, the Buyer shall cause the Payment Agent to send a notice and a
letter of transmittal in the form of _Exhibit D_ (a " _Letter of Transmittal_
") to each holder of Company Shares whose address appears in the Companys
stock books advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and the
procedure, if applicable, for surrendering to the Payment Agent any Company
Certificate held by such holder in exchange for the amounts payable (or that
become payable) to such holder pursuant to _Section 1.5_.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) Each holder of Company Shares upon submission to the Payment Agent of a
properly completed and signed Letter of Transmittal, and, if applicable,
proper surrender of a Company Certificate, in each case in accordance with the
instructions set forth therein, shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (subject to _Section 1.14_) (i) any portion of the Closing Merger
Consideration payable to such holder pursuant to _Section 1.5_ and (ii) any
portion of any Future Payment that becomes payable under this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement to such holder pursuant to _Section 1.5_. Until properly
surrendered, each Company Certificate shall be deemed for all purposes to
evidence only the right to receive the cash amounts payable pursuant to
_Section 1.5_.

 



 

(c) If any payment is to be made to or in the name of a Person other than the
Person in whose name the applicable Company Shares appear on the Companys
share register, including, if applicable, the Company Certificate surrendered
in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) the Company Shares so surrendered shall be transferable, and, if
applicable, the Company Certificate shall be properly assigned, endorsed or
accompanied by appropriate stock powers, (ii) such transfer shall otherwise be
proper, and (iii) the Person requesting such transfer shall pay to the Payment
Agent any transfer or other Taxes payable by reason of the foregoing or
establish to the satisfaction of the Payment Agent that such Taxes have been
paid or are not required to be paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
the Payment Agent nor any Party shall be liable to a Company Stockholder for
any amount payable to such Company Stockholder pursuant to _Section 1.5_ that
is delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws.

 



 

(d) In the event any Company Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon (i) the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, (ii)
delivery by such Person of an agreement to indemnify the Buyer against any
claim that may be made against the Buyer with respect to the Company
Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed and (iii) if so
requested, delivery by such Person of a bond in such sum as the Buyer may
reasonably direct the Payment Agent to require, the Payment Agent shall
deliver to the holder of Company Shares formerly represented by such lost,
stolen or destroyed Company Certificate the cash amounts payable (or that
become payable), if any, pursuant to _Section 1.5_.

 



 

(e) Any amount made available to the Payment Agent in accordance with this
Agreement that remains unclaimed by the Person entitled to such amount six (6)
months after such amount is made available to the Payment Agent shall be
returned to the Buyer and any Person who has not completed the exchange
procedures set forth in this _Section 1.10_ shall thereafter look only to the
Buyer for delivery of the portion of the consideration that such Person is
entitled to received pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the maximum extent
permitted by law, (i) the Payment Agent and Buyer shall be entitled to rely
conclusively on the Allocation Schedule as in effect from time to time, (ii)

relating to claims for indemnification pursuant to _Article VII_ and any
other actions required or permitted to be taken by the Company Equityholder
Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, the Company
Equityholders, by the terms of this Agreement and their execution and

under _Article VII_, and to take any and all additional action as is
contemplated to be taken by or on their (or any of their) behalf or by the
Company Equityholder Representative by the terms of this Agreement and/or the
Escrow Agreement. All such actions shall be deemed to be facts ascertainable
outside this Agreement and shall be binding on the Company Equityholders.

 



 

(b) In the event that Bryan E. Laulicht becomes unable to perform the Company
Equityholder Representatives responsibilities hereunder or resigns from such
position, the position of Company Equityholder Representative shall thereafter
be filled by a majority in interest of the Company Equityholders, voting

representative shall be deemed to be the Company Equityholder Representative
for all purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and the documents
delivered pursuant hereto or thereto.

 



 

(c) Upon any replacement of the Company Equityholder Representative, the
Company Equityholder Representative being replaced shall transfer, or shall
deem to transfer, to the new Company Equityholder Representative the balance
of any unexpended Company Equityholder Representative Expense Amount.

 



 

(d) All decisions and actions by the Company Equityholder Representative in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, including the resolution and disposition of any disputes regarding
the determination of Closing Net Working Capital or any Milestone Payment or
the achievement of any Milestone and claims for indemnification pursuant to
_Article VII_ and any other actions required or permitted to be taken by the
Company Equityholder Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, shall be binding upon each Company Equityholder, and no Company
Equityholder shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise
contest the same.

 



 

(e) Any decision, act, consent, waiver or instruction of the Company
Equityholder Representative in connection with this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement shall constitute a decision of all the Company Equityholders and
shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each Company Equityholder, and the
Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled

 



     

 

 



 

to rely conclusively on the decisions, acts, consents, waivers and
instructions of the Company Equityholder Representative as to any
determination relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement as being the decision, act, consent, waiver or
instruction of every Company Equityholder, including the resolution and
disposition of any disputes regarding the determination of Closing Net Working
Capital, any Milestone Payment or the achievement of any Milestone and claims
for indemnification pursuant to _Article VII_, the disbursement of all or any
portion of the General Escrow Fund or the Adjustment Escrow Fund and any other
actions required or permitted to be taken by the Company Equityholder
Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, all of which
shall be final, conclusive and binding upon each Company Equityholder; no
Person shall have any cause of action against the Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents
or Affiliates for any action taken by the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation
in reliance upon any decision, act, consent, waiver or instruction of the
Company Equityholder Representative; and the Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation are each hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any
acts done by it in accordance with such decision, act, consent, waiver or
instruction of the Company Equityholder Representative.

 



 

(f) None of the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any Company Equityholder
shall have any cause of action against the Company Equityholder Representative
for any action taken, decision made or instruction given by the Company
Equityholder Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement,
except in cases of Fraud, gross negligence or bad faith.

 



 

(g) The provisions of this _Section 1.11_ are independent and severable, are
irrevocable and coupled with an interest, and shall be enforceable
notwithstanding any rights or remedies that the Buyer or any Company
Equityholder may have in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(h) The Company Equityholders shall, in accordance with their Pro Rata Share,
severally, but not jointly, indemnify and reimburse the Company Equityholder
Representative for any reasonable expense incurred without Fraud, gross
negligence or bad faith on the part of the Company Equityholder Representative
and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of
its duties hereunder (" _Representative Reimbursable Expenses_ "). Any such
claim for indemnification shall be satisfied first from any then available
portion of the remaining Company Equityholder Representative Expense Amount
and, if such amount is insufficient to satisfy any such Representative
Reimbursable Expense, from the first proceeds from any Future Payments
otherwise available for distribution to the Company Equityholders. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company Equityholder Representative shall have the
right to engage legal counsel and other professional advisers to assist it in
the administration of Company Equityholder Representatives duties hereunder,
and any and all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel and advisers
shall be deemed Representative Reimbursable Expenses. In no event shall the
Buyer or the Surviving Corporation (or any of their respective Affiliates) be
obligated to reimburse the Company Equityholder Representative for any costs
or expenses of the Company Equityholder Representative, whether or not such
costs or expenses constitute Representative Reimbursable Expenses.

 



     

 

 



 

(i) At the Effective Time, the Buyer shall (in accordance with _Section
1.3(d)(v)_) pay the Company Equityholder Representative Expense Amount to the
Company Equityholder Representative, which Company Equityholder Representative
Expense Amount shall be maintained by the Company Equityholder Representative
in a segregated account. Upon the determination of the Company Equityholder
Representative that retaining any portion of the Company Equityholder
Representative Expense Amount is no longer necessary, the Company Equityholder
Representative shall deliver any then remaining portion of the Company
Equityholder Representative Expense Amount (the " _Company Equityholder
Representative Account Payment_ ") to the Buyer for further payment in
accordance with the Allocation Schedule.

 



 

1.12 _Post-Closing Adjustment_. The Closing Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted after the Closing as follows:

 



 

(a) As soon as practicable, but in any event within one hundred and twenty
(120) days following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall deliver, or cause to be
delivered, to the Company Equityholder Representative an unaudited balance
sheet of the Company (the " _Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ") as of
the close of business on the Closing Date prepared in accordance with GAAP
(applied on a basis consistent with the application thereof to the Financial
Statements) and in the form and format of _Exhibit E_.

 



 

(b) Subject to the resolution of any disputes pursuant to this _Section
1.12_, within five (5) business days after the determination of the Final
Closing Date Balance Sheet (as defined below):

 



 

(i) (A) if the sum of the Estimated Net Working Capital and the Estimated
Closing Cash exceeds (B) the sum of the Closing Net Working Capital and the
Closing Cash (such amount resulting from subtracting the amount described in
the foregoing clause (ii) from the amount described in the foregoing clause
(i) being referred to hereinafter as the " _Closing Shortfall_ "), the Buyer
shall be entitled to a payment from the Company Equityholders in an amount
equal to the Closing Shortfall, which shall be treated as a downward
adjustment to the Closing Merger Consideration payable to the Company
Equityholders for Tax purposes; and

 



 

(ii) (A) if the sum of the Closing Net Working Capital and the Closing Cash
exceeds (B) the sum of Estimated Net Working Capital and the Estimated Closing
Cash (such amount resulting from subtracting the amount described in the
foregoing clause (ii) from the amount described in the foregoing clause (i)
being referred to hereinafter as the " _Closing Excess_ "), the Company
Equityholders shall be entitled to a payment from the Buyer, in accordance
with _Section 1.16_, in an amount equal to the Closing Excess, which shall be
treated as an upward adjustment to the Closing Merger Consideration payable to
the Company Equityholders for Tax purposes.

 



 

(c) In the event of a Closing Shortfall, the Buyer and the Company
Equityholder Representative shall, within five (5) business days after the
determination of the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet, deliver to the Escrow
Agent a joint instruction letter signed by each such Party instructing the
Escrow Agent to disburse from the General Escrow Fund an amount in cash equal
to the Closing Shortfall to one or more accounts designated by the Buyer. If
the Closing Shortfall exceeds the available General Escrow Fund (as reduced by
claims for indemnification

 



     

 

 



 

pursuant to _Article VII_ which have previously been satisfied from the
General Escrow Amount or which are then pending), the excess shall be deducted
from the first proceeds of any Future Payments otherwise available for
distribution to the Company Equityholders.

 



 

(d) As of the thirtieth (30th) day following the delivery thereof to the
Company Equityholder Representative, the Preliminary Closing Date Balance
Sheet shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties and all Company
Equityholders for purposes of this _Section 1.12_ unless, prior to such
thirtieth (30th) day, the Company Equityholder Representative shall have
notified the Buyer in writing of each item on the Preliminary Closing Date
Balance Sheet disputed by the Company Equityholder Representative, specifying
the amount thereof in dispute and setting forth, in reasonable detail, the
basis for such dispute. In the event of such a dispute, the Buyer and the
Company Equityholder Representative shall attempt to reconcile their
differences. If the Buyer and the Company Equityholder Representative are
unable to reach a resolution within twenty (20) days after receipt by the
Buyer of the Company Equityholder Representatives written notice of such
dispute, the Buyer and the Company Equityholder Representative shall submit
the items remaining in dispute for resolution to the Neutral Accountant, which
shall, within thirty (30) days of such submission, determine and report to the
Company Equityholder Representative and the Buyer upon such remaining disputed
items, and such report shall be final, binding and conclusive on all Parties
and the Company Equityholders. In resolving any disputed items, the Neutral
Accountant shall apply the accounting principles described in _Section
1.12(a)_. The Neutral Accountant shall act as an expert and not as an
arbitrator. The Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet that has not been
challenged, has been reconciled, or has been determined by the Neutral
Accountant pursuant to this _Section 1.12_ is referred to herein as the "
_Final Closing Date Balance Sheet_ " and shall be final, binding and
conclusive on all Parties and the Company Equityholders for purposes of this
_Section 1.12_. The fees and disbursements of the Neutral Accountant shall be
allocated equally between the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Company
Equityholders, on the other hand. The Parties agree that the procedures set
forth in this _Section 1.12(d)_ for resolving disputes with respect to the
Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Closing Shortfall, the Closing
Excess, the Closing Net Working Capital or the Closing Cash shall
(notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement) be the
sole and exclusive procedures for resolving any such disputes, provided that
nothing herein shall preclude any Party from instituting litigation in a court
of competent jurisdiction to enforce the determination of the Neutral
Accountant or any agreement of the Parties with respect to the resolution of
any such dispute.

 



 

(e) Within five (5) business days after the determination of the Final
Adjustment Amount (as defined in _Schedule 1.12(e)_ ): (i) if the Final
Adjustment Amount is greater than zero, (A) the Buyer shall be entitled to a
payment in an amount equal to the Final Adjustment Amount, which shall be
treated as a downward adjustment to the Closing Merger Consideration payable
to the Company Equityholders for Tax purposes, and (B) the Buyer and the
Company Equityholder Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint
instruction letter signed by each such Party instructing the Escrow Agent to
disburse from the Adjustment Escrow Fund an amount in cash equal to the Final
Adjustment Amount to one or more accounts designated by the Buyer and, to
extent the Final Adjustment Amount exceeds the available Adjustment Escrow
Fund, from the General Escrow Fund (it being agreed that, if the Final
Adjustment Amount exceeds the amount of the then available Adjustment Escrow
Fund and the then available General Escrow Fund, the Buyer may deduct the
Final Adjustment Amount from the first proceeds of any Future Payments
otherwise available for distribution to the Company Equityholders); and (ii)
the Buyer

 



     

 

 



 

and the Company Equityholder Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent
a joint instruction letter signed by each such Party instructing the Escrow
Agent to disburse, for the benefit of the Company Equityholders in accordance
with _Section 1.16_, from the Adjustment Escrow Fund an amount in cash equal
to the amount, if any, by which the Adjustment Escrow Fund exceeds the Final
Adjustment Amount. The Parties shall comply with their respective obligations
set forth on _Schedule 1.12(e)_.

Warrants_.

 



 

(a) _Company Options_. As of the Effective Time, each Company Option that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether

holder of such Company Option in consideration for the right to receive,
subject to the execution and delivery by the holder of such Company Option of
an Option Surrender Agreement with respect thereto and to any withholding in
accordance with _Section 1.14_, in full satisfaction of the rights of such
holder with respect thereto, (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the Effective Time (but in no event earlier than the first ordinary
payroll of the Company that is at least ten (10) business days after the
Effective Time), the cash amount (without interest) equal to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock that are subject to such Company Option
(whether or not exercisable), multiplied by the amount by which (A) the

share of Company Common Stock, as shown on the Allocation Schedule, exceeds
(B) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Option, plus (ii) as promptly as practicable after any Future Payment
becomes payable in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement
(but in no event earlier than the first ordinary payroll of the Company that
is at least ten (10) business days after such Future Payment becomes payable),
the cash amount (without interest) equal to the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that are subject to such Company Option (whether or not
exercisable), multiplied by the amount by which (A) the portion of such Future
Payment allocable to one (1) share of Company Common Stock, as shown on the
Allocation Schedule exceeds (B) (to the extent not previously deducted) any
portion of the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Option. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
actions necessary or desirable in connection with the treatment of Company
Options contemplated by this _Section 1.13(a)_.

(c) _Company Warrants_. As of the Effective Time, each Company Warrant that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
canceled without any action on the part of any holder of such Company Warrant
in consideration for the right to receive, subject to the execution and
delivery by the holder of such Company Warrant of a Warrant Surrender
Agreement with respect thereto and to any withholding in accordance with
_Section 1.14_, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with
respect thereto, (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time, the cash amount (without interest) equal to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series B-1 Preferred Stock, as
applicable, that are subject to such Company Warrant, multiplied by the amount
by which (A) the portion (if any)

 



      

 

 



 

of the Closing Merger Consideration allocable to one (1) share of Company
Common Stock or Company Series B-1 Preferred Stock, as applicable, as shown on
the Allocation Schedule, exceeds (B) the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock or Company Series B-1 Preferred Stock, as applicable, subject to
such Company Warrant, plus (ii) as promptly as practicable after any Future
Payment becomes payable in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, the cash amount (without interest) equal to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Series B-1 Preferred Stock, as applicable,
that are subject to such Company Warrant, multiplied by the amount by which
(A) the portion of such Future Payment allocable to one (1) share of Company
Common Stock or Company Series B-1 Preferred Stock, as applicable, as shown on
the Allocation Schedule exceeds (B) (to the extent not previously deducted)
any portion of the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock or Company
Series B-1 Preferred Stock, as applicable, subject to such Company Warrant.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary or
desirable in connection with the treatment of Company Warrants contemplated by
this _Section 1.13(c)_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain prior to the Closing a Warrant Surrender Agreement signed by

of a Company Warrant pursuant to this Agreement shall be deposited with the
Paying Agent to be disbursed in accordance with this _Section 1.13(c)_ and
the Allocation Schedule.

 



 

1.14 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, each of
the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent and the Escrow Agent
will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person, such amounts as may be
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or any other Law. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted or withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts will be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect
of which such deduction or withholding was made.

 



 

1.15 _Milestone Payments_. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, including
_Section 1.15(b)_ hereof, the Company Equityholders shall be entitled to

(b) _Certain Limitations_.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 1.15_, (A) from
and after the occurrence of any Triggering Event, (1) none of the Regulatory
Milestones set forth in subsections _(A)_ through _(F)_ of _Section
1.15(a)(i)_ that has not yet been paid as of such occurrence shall be payable
and (2) if a Triggering Event shall occur after a Regulatory Milestone Payment
has been paid, the amount of such Regulatory Milestone Payment shall be
credited against fifty percent (50%) of any future Milestone Payment that
otherwise becomes payable and

 



     

 

 



 

the amount of such future Milestone Payment shall be reduced by the amount so
credited and (B) without limitation of the foregoing clause _(A)_ , if a
Designated Event occurs, the Designated Event Adjustment Amount shall be
credited against any future Milestone Payment (or portion thereof) that
otherwise becomes payable hereunder and the amount of such future Milestone
Payment (or portion thereof) shall be reduced by the amount so credited. In
the event that both of the foregoing clauses _(A)_ and _(B)_ apply to any
Milestone Payment, clause _(A)_ shall be applied before clause _(B)_.

 



 

(ii) Each of the Milestone Payments shall only be payable once with respect to
the Product, upon the first occurrence of the corresponding Milestone Event,
and no additional payment will be due in the event of any repeated occurrence
of such Milestone Event with respect to the Product or to any product
developed by the Buyer as a follow-on product to the Product. The Buyers
maximum aggregate liability for any and all breaches by the Buyer of its
obligations under this _Section 1.15_ shall be limited to the unpaid portion,
if any, of any Milestone Consideration.

 



 

(iii) Nothing herein or elsewhere shall constitute a guarantee by the Buyer of
the achievement of any or all of the Milestones or the payment of any or all
of the Milestone Consideration. Neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates or
any of its or their respective representatives has made any representation or
warranty whatsoever, express or implied, regarding the Milestone
Consideration, the Milestones or the achievement thereof, and no Person has
relied on any projections, estimates, forecasts, business plans or other
information provided by the Buyer with respect to any of the foregoing or
otherwise.

 



 

(iv) Each of the Company Equityholders, by his, her or its execution of a
Written Consent, a Surrender Agreement, a Warrant Surrender Agreement, a
Letter of Transmittal and/or receipt of Aggregate Merger Consideration
hereunder, acknowledges and agrees that, subject to the final sentence of this
_Section 1.15(b)(iv)_, (A), Buyer shall be entitled to conduct the business
of Buyer and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company and
including with respect to the Product) in a manner that is in the best
interests of Buyer and its stockholders and Buyer shall have the absolute
right and sole and absolute discretion to operate and otherwise make decisions
with respect to the conduct of the business of Buyer and its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Company and including with respect to the
Product) and to take or refrain from taking any action with respect thereto;
(B) the Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer currently or may in the future
offer products or services that compete, either directly or indirectly, with
the Product and may make decisions with respect to such products and services
that may adversely affect the achievement of the Milestones; and (C) neither
the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall have any liability whatsoever to any
Company Equityholder or any other Person for any claim, loss or damage of any
nature that arises out of or relates in any way to any decisions or actions
affecting whether or not or the extent to which the Milestone Consideration
becomes payable in accordance with this _Section 1.15._ Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer agrees that, within the United States and the Major European
Countries, (i) for a period of four (4) years following the Closing, it will
act in good faith and use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain the
Regulatory Approvals, and (ii) following receipt of the Regulatory Approvals,
it will act in good faith and use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
commercialize (or cause to be commercialized) the Product with the aim of
achieving the Regulatory Milestones and the Sales Milestones; provided that
the Buyers obligations under this clause (ii) shall terminate upon the

 



     

 

 



 

earlier of the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date and the payment in
full of all Sales Milestone Payments.

 



 

(v) The right of any Company Equityholder to receive any amounts with respect
to Milestone Consideration (A) shall not be evidenced by a certificate or
other instrument, (B) shall not be assignable or otherwise transferable by
such Company Equityholder, except by will, upon death or by operation of Law,
and (C) does not represent any right other than the right to receive the
consideration set forth in this _Section 1.15_. Any attempted transfer of the
right to any amounts with respect to Milestone Consideration by any holder
thereof (other than as specifically permitted by the immediately preceding
sentence) shall be null and void.

 



 

(vi) Until the payment of all Milestone Payments, any direct or indirect sale,
transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Buyer and its Subsidiaries related to the Product, or the exclusive license or
other disposition of substantially all of the worldwide rights (or all or
substantially all of the United States rights) to the Product by the Buyer (a
" _Product Line Sale_ "), shall be made expressly subject to the provisions of
this _Section 1.15_, which obligations shall be assumed by the purchaser,
transferee, acquirer, or licensee in such Product Line Sale (the " _Product
Line Transferee_ "), and in the event of any such assumption, " _Net Sales_ "
shall thereafter be the net sales of the Product by such Product Line
Transferee. " _Product Line Sale_ " shall exclude any transaction or series of
related transactions that results in the direct or indirect transfer of all or
a majority of the capital stock of the Buyer. Anything to the contrary herein
notwithstanding, without the consent of the Company Equityholder
Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the
Buyer shall not enter into any Product Line Sale (other than in connection
with the sale or transfer of all or majority of the consolidated assets of the
Buyer) if the Product Line Transferee then commercially sells in the United
States an anti-coagulant reversal agent that competes with the Product.

 



 

(vii) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the Buyers
obligations to pay any Milestone Consideration hereunder is subject to

met its obligations with respect to each Company Plan and has timely made all
required contributions thereto. The Company, each ERISA Affiliate and each
Company Plan has been in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws related to
Company Plans. All filings and reports as to each Company Plan required to
have been submitted to the IRS or to the DOL have been timely submitted. There
is no written plan or commitment, whether legally binding or not, to create
any additional Company Plans or to modify any existing Company Plans, nor, to
the Companys knowledge, any such unwritten plan or commitment.

 



 

(c) There are no Legal Proceedings (except claims for benefits payable in the
normal operation of the Company Plans and proceedings with respect to
qualified domestic relations orders) against or involving any Company Plan or
asserting any rights or claims to benefits under any Company Plan that could
give rise to any liability. No Company Plan is or since December 31, 2012 has
been the subject of, or has received or provided notice that it is the subject
of, examination by a Governmental Entity or a participant in a government
sponsored amnesty, voluntary compliance or similar program.

 



 

(d) All Company Plans that are intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code have received determination, opinion, or advisory letters from the
IRS to the effect that such Company Plans are qualified and the plans and the

401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code or are based on

 



     

 

 



 

prototype or volume submitter documents that have received such letters, no
such determination, opinion, or advisory letter has been revoked and
revocation has not been threatened, and no such Company Plan has been amended
since the date of its most recent determination, opinion, or advisory letter,
or application therefor in any respect, and no act or omission has occurred,
that would reasonably be likely to adversely affect its qualification or
increase its cost. Except as required under this Agreement, there has been no
termination or partial termination of such a Company Plan under Code Section
411(d).

 



 

(e) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained or
contributed or had any actual or potential liability to an Employee Benefit
Plan that was ever subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA. At
no time has the Company or any ERISA Affiliate maintained, been obligated to
contribute to, or had any actual or potential liability with respect to, any

and Affordable Care Act, and any other comparable domestic or foreign Laws.
The Company has not maintained any arrangement for paying or reimbursing
medical premiums that would constitute an employer payment plan as described
in IRS Notice 2015-17. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has any
material liability or obligation under or with respect to COBRA for its own
actions or omissions, or those of any predecessor other than to provide health
care continuation coverage to COBRA qualified beneficiaries at their own, and
not at the Companys, expense. No employee, officer, director or manager, or
former employee, officer, director, or manager (or beneficiary of any of the
foregoing) of the Company is entitled to receive any welfare benefits,
including death or medical benefits (whether or not insured) beyond retirement
or other termination of employment, other than as required by applicable Law
or as cash severance, and there have been no written or oral commitments
inconsistent with the foregoing.

 



 

(h) No act or omission has occurred and no condition exists with respect to
any Company Plan that would subject the Buyer or the Company to (i) any
material fine, penalty, Tax or liability of any kind imposed under ERISA, the
Code or any other applicable Law or (ii) any contractual indemnification or
contribution obligation protecting any fiduciary, insurer or service provider
with respect to any Company Plan, nor will the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement give rise to any such liability.

 



     

 

 



 

(i) Each Company Plan (other than bilateral agreements with individuals) is
amendable and terminable unilaterally by the Company at any time without
liability or expense to the Company or such Company Plan as a result thereof
(other than for benefits accrued through the date of termination or amendment
and reasonable administrative expenses related thereto) and no Company Plan,
plan documentation or agreement, summary plan description or other written
communication distributed generally to employees by its terms prohibits the
Company from amending or terminating any such Company Plan, or in any way
limits such action. The investment vehicles used to fund any Company Plan
described in Section 401(k) of the Code may be changed at any time without
incurring a sales charge, surrender fee, or other similar expense other than
customary charges imposed on transactions within participant-directed
accounts.

 



 

(j) No Company Plan or other contract, agreement, plan or arrangement covering
any one or more individuals contains any provision that, in connection with
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or upon related,
concurrent or subsequent employment termination, or in combination with any
other event, would (i) increase, accelerate or vest any compensation or
benefit, except as required by Law with respect to the termination of any
Company Plan pursuant to _Section 4.10_, (ii) require severance, termination
or retention payments, (iii) provide any term of employment or compensation
guaranty, (iv) forgive any Indebtedness, (v) require or provide any payment or
compensation subject to Section 280G of the Code (and no such payment or

director of the Company has been promised or paid any bonus or incentive
compensation related to the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company has

that may be disallowed under Section 280G of the Code in connection with any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(k) There are no loans or extensions of credit from the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate to any Company Employee or any independent contractor to the Company
(other than advances of business expenses in the Ordinary Course of Business).
There is no corporate-owned life insurance (COLI), split-dollar life insurance
policy or any other life insurance policy on the life of any Company Employee.

 



 

(l) Each Company Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as
defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been operated since January 1,
2005 in compliance with then applicable guidance under Code Section 409A and
has been in documentary compliance since January 1, 2009. No event has
occurred that would be treated by Section 409A(b) of the Code as a transfer of
property for purposes of Section 83 of the Code. No stock option or stock
appreciation right granted by the Company has any feature for the deferral of
compensation other than the deferral of recognition of income until the later
of exercise or disposition of such option or right within the meaning of the
Treasury Regulations and other applicable IRS guidance under Section 409A of
the Code. The Company has made available to the Buyer all valuation or similar

(a) The Company, at its expense, shall prepare and timely file or shall cause
to be prepared and timely filed all Tax Returns of the Company required to be
filed (taking into account extensions) prior to the Closing Date. Such Tax
Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the Companys past
practice, except as required by applicable Law.

 



 

(b) The Buyer shall prepare and timely file or shall cause to be prepared and
timely filed all Tax Returns for the Company that are due after the Closing
Date. The Buyer shall make all payments required with respect to any such Tax
Returns; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer shall be indemnified in
accordance with _Section 7.1(d)_ to the extent any payment the Buyer is
required to make relates to the operations of the Company for any period (or
portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date to the extent such Taxes
are not accounted for in determining the Closing Net Working Capital.

 



 

(c) Any Tax Return to be prepared and filed for taxable periods that include
any period before the Closing Date shall be prepared on a basis consistent
with the last previous similar Tax Return, except as required by applicable
Law. The Buyer shall provide the Company Equityholder Representative with a
copy of each proposed income Tax Return including any period prior to the
Closing Date (and such additional information regarding such Tax Return as may
reasonably be requested by the Company Equityholder Representative) for review
and comment at least forty-five (45) days prior to the filing of such Tax
Return. The Buyer shall consider in good faith all comments of the Company
Equityholder Representative with respect to the portion of the period ending
on the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) The Buyer shall be indemnified for any transfer, sales, use, stamp,
conveyance, value added, recording, registration, documentary, filing and
other non-income Taxes and administrative fees (including notary fees) arising
in connection with the consummation of the

 



     

 

 



 

transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") to the
extent provided in _Section 7.1(d)_. The Company Equityholder Representative,
on behalf of the Company Equityholders, and the Buyer will cooperate in filing

5.2 _Allocation of Certain Taxes_.

 



 

(a) The Buyer and the Company Equityholders agree that if the Company is
permitted but not required under applicable foreign, state or local Tax Laws
to treat the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period, the Buyer and
the Company Equityholders shall treat such day as the last day of a taxable
period.

 



 

(b) The portion of any Taxes for a taxable period beginning before and ending
after the Closing allocable to the portion of such period ending on the
Closing Date shall be deemed to equal (i) in the case of Taxes that (x) are
based upon or related to income or receipts or (y) imposed in connection with
any sale or other transfer or assignment of property, other than Taxes
described in _Section 5.1(d)_, the amount which would be payable if the
taxable year ended with the Closing Date, and (ii) in the case of other Taxes
imposed on a periodic basis (including property Taxes), the amount of such
Taxes for the entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of calendar days in the period ending with the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period. For
purposes of computing the Taxes attributable to the two portions of a taxable
period, the amount of any item that is taken into account only once for each
taxable period (e.g., the benefit of graduated tax rates, exemption amounts,
etc.) shall be allocated between the two portions of the period in proportion
to the number of days in each portion.

reasonably require the assistance of the other Party in obtaining any
necessary information.

 



 

(b) The Buyer shall have the right to control any Tax audit, initiate any
claim for refund, and contest, resolve and defend against any assessment,
notice of deficiency, or other adjustment or proposed adjustment relating to
Taxes with respect to the Company; _provided_ that, with respect to any item
the adjustment of which may cause the Company Equityholders to become
obligated to make any payment pursuant to this Agreement, the Buyer shall
consult with the Company Equityholder Representative with respect to the
resolution of any issue that would affect the Company Equityholders, and not
settle any such issue without the consent of the Company Equityholder
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

 



 

5.4 _Refunds_. Any refund (or credit against Tax in lieu of a refund) received
by the Company (or the Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates on behalf
of the Company), of Taxes of the Company for taxable periods, or portions
thereof, ending on or before the Closing Date,

 



     

 

 



 

shall be for the account of the Company Equityholders to the extent such
refund is not accounted for in determining the Closing Net Working Capital and
is not attributable to the carryback of a net operating loss of the Company
from a period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, and Buyer
shall promptly pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company Equityholder
Representative, an amount equal to such refund.

 



 

5.5 _Amendment of Tax Returns_. Except as required by applicable Law, neither
Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall amend, refile, revoke or otherwise
modify any Tax Return or Tax election of the Company with respect to a taxable
period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date without the

constitute any such inaccuracy or breach; or

 



 

(b) any breach or nonperformance of (or noncompliance with) any covenant or
agreement of the Buyer contained in this Agreement or any agreement or

7.3 _Indemnification Claims_.

 



 

(a) The Indemnified Party shall give written notification to the Indemnifying
Party of the commencement of any Third-Party Action that the Indemnified Party
expects may result in a claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Article
VII_. For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Indemnifying Party_ " shall mean
(A) in the case of a claim for indemnification by the Buyer,

 



     

 

 



 

the Company Equityholder Representative on behalf of the Company Equityholders
and (B) in the case of a claim for indemnification by any Company
Equityholder, the Buyer and (ii) " _Indemnified Party_ " shall mean (A) in the
case of a claim for indemnification against the Buyer, the Company
Equityholder Representative on behalf of the applicable Company Equityholder
or Company Equityholders and (B) in all other cases, the Buyer. Such
notification shall be given within twenty (20) calendar days after receipt by
the Indemnified Party of notice of such Third-Party Action, and shall describe
in reasonable detail (to the extent known by the Indemnified Party) the facts
constituting the basis for such Third-Party Action and the amount of the
claimed damages; _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay or failure on the part
of the Indemnified Party in so notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve
the Indemnifying Party of any liability or obligation hereunder except to the
extent of any damage or liability caused by or arising out of such failure.

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, at its own and sole expense, to
participate in any defense of such Third-Party Action, or by giving written
notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after delivery of the
written notification described in _Section 7.3(a)_, to assume the defense of
any Third-Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys expense and by the
Indemnifying Partys own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in
good faith in such defense (it being understood that, prior to and during such
thirty (30) day period, the Indemnified Party is hereby authorized (but not
obligated) to file any motion, answer or other pleading and to take any other
action which the Indemnified Party shall deem necessary or appropriate to
protect the Indemnified Partys interests in connection with such Third-Party
Action); _provided_ that (i) the Indemnifying Party may only assume control of
such defense if (A) it acknowledges in writing to the Indemnified Party that
any damages, fines, costs or other liabilities that may be assessed against
the Indemnified Party in connection with such Third-Party Action constitute
Losses for which the Indemnified Party shall be indemnified fully pursuant to
this _Article VII_, (B) if the Buyer is the Indemnified Party, the _ad
damnum_ in such Third-Party Action, taken together with the estimated costs of
defense thereof and the Claimed Amount with respect to any unresolved claims
for indemnification then pending, is less than or equal to the current balance
of the General Escrow Fund, and (C) if the Buyer is the Indemnified Party, an
adverse resolution of the Third-Party Action would not have a material adverse
effect on the goodwill or reputation of the Buyer or the business, operations
or future conduct of the Buyer, as reasonably determined by the Buyer, and
(ii) if the Buyer is the Indemnified Party, the Company Equityholder
Representative may not assume control of the defense of any Third-Party Action
involving Taxes, any Governmental Entity or criminal liability or in which
equitable relief is sought against the Buyer or any of its Affiliates. If the
Indemnifying Party does not, or is not permitted under the terms hereof to, so
assume control of the defense of a Third-Party Action, the Indemnified Party
shall control such defense. The Non-controlling Party may participate in such
defense at its own expense. The Controlling Party shall thereafter from time
to time promptly provide to the Non-controlling Party copies of all pleadings
filed and all orders issued in such Third-Party Action, and shall consult in
good faith with the Non-controlling Party at reasonable periodic intervals on
matters regarding the defense of such Third-Party Action. The reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party with respect to a Third-Party
Action shall be considered Losses for purposes of this Agreement if (x) the
Indemnified Party controls the defense of such Third-Party Action pursuant to
the terms of this _Section 7.3(b)_ or (y) the Indemnifying Party assumes
control of such defense and the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes that
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests or
different defenses available with respect to such Third-Party Action (in which
case the fees and expenses of counsel to the

 



     

 

 



 

Indemnified Party will only be considered Losses to the extent they relate to
or are incurred as a result of those matters involving such conflicting
interests or different defenses). The Indemnifying Party shall not agree to
any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third-Party
Action without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ that the
consent of the Indemnified Party shall not be required if the Indemnifying
Party agrees in writing to pay any amounts payable pursuant to such settlement
or judgment and such settlement or judgment includes a complete release of the
Indemnified Party from further liability and imposes no obligation on the
Indemnified Party. Except as provided in _Section 7.3(g)_, the Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable for any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment
arising from, any such Third-Party Action without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, to the extent there is any conflict between the provisions of this
_Section 7.3(b)_ and _Section 5.3(b)_ with regard to any Third-Party Action
involving Taxes, _Section 5.3(b)_ shall govern.

 



 

(c) In order to seek indemnification under this _Article VII_, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(d) Within thirty (30) days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying
Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a Response, in which the
Indemnifying Party shall either: (i) agree that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to receive the Claimed Amount or the Agreed Amount or (ii) dispute
that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the Claimed Amount.
If no Response is delivered by the Indemnifying Party within such thirty (30)
day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have agreed that all of
the Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnified Party. Acceptance by the
Indemnified Party of partial payment of any Claimed Amount shall be without
prejudice to its right to claim the balance of any such Claimed Amount.

 



 

(e) Except in cases of disputes regarding the determination of the Closing Net
Working Capital or the Closing Cash (which shall be resolved exclusively in
accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 1.12_), any Dispute
shall be resolved in accordance with _Section 10.12_. The Indemnifying Party
shall deliver to the Indemnified Party, promptly following the resolution of
the Dispute (whether by mutual agreement, arbitration, judicial decision or
otherwise), payment of any amount required to be paid to the Indemnified Party
consistent with the terms of the resolution of the Dispute. If the Buyer seeks
to enforce any claim that is the subject of the Dispute pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement, the Company Equityholder Representative and the Buyer shall deliver
to the Escrow Agent, promptly following the resolution of the Dispute (whether
by mutual agreement, judicial decision or otherwise), a written notice
executed by both Parties instructing the Escrow Agent as to what (if any)
portion of the General Escrow Fund shall be distributed to the Buyer (which
notice shall be consistent with the terms of the resolution of the Dispute).

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this _Section 7.3_, if a third
party asserts (other than by means of a lawsuit) that the Indemnified Party is
liable to such third party for a monetary or other obligation which may
constitute or result in Losses for which the Indemnified Party may be entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this _Article VII_, and the Indemnified Party
reasonably determines that it has a valid business reason to fulfill such
obligation, then (i) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to satisfy such
obligation, without prior

 



     

 

 



 

notice to or consent from the Indemnifying Party, (ii) the Indemnified Party
may subsequently make a claim for indemnification in accordance with the
provisions of this _Article VII_, and (iii) the Indemnified Party shall be
reimbursed, in accordance with the provisions of this _Article VII_, for any
such Losses for which it is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
_Article VII_ (subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to dispute the
Indemnified Partys entitlement to indemnification, or the amount for which it
is entitled to indemnification, under the terms of this _Article VII_).

 



 

(g) Without limitation of _Section 1.11_, (i) the Company Equityholder
Representative shall have full and exclusive power and authority on behalf of
each Company Equityholder to take any and all actions on behalf of, execute
any and all instruments on behalf of, and execute or waive any and all rights
of, the Company Equityholders under this _Article VII_; and (ii) the Company
Equityholder Representative shall have no liability to any Company
Equityholder for any action taken or omitted on behalf of the Company
Equityholders pursuant to this _Article VII_. For the avoidance of doubt, no
Person other than a Party may assert a claim for indemnification under this
_Article VII_.

 



 

7.4 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. Each Partys representations
and warranties in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall expire at
11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the representations and warranties
contained in _Sections 2.1_ (Organization, Qualification and Corporate Power),
_2.2_ (Capitalization), _2.3_ (Authorization of Transaction), _2.4(a)_ (Non-
Contravention), _2.5_ (Subsidiaries), _2.9_ (Tax Matters), _2.12_
(Intellectual Property), _2.24_ (Certain Business Relationships With
Affiliates) and _2.25_ (Brokers Fees) (the " _Fundamental Representations_ ")
shall survive the Closing until one hundred eighty (180) days following the
expiration of all statutes of limitation applicable to the matters referred to
therein. If an Indemnified Party delivers to the Indemnifying Party, before
expiration of a representation or warranty a Claim Notice based upon a breach
of such representation or warranty, then the applicable representation or
warranty shall survive until, but only for purposes of, the resolution of any
claims arising from or related to the matter covered by such notice. The
rights to indemnification set forth in this _Article VII_ shall not be
affected by any investigation or due diligence conducted by or on behalf of
the Indemnified Party or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired)
by the Indemnified Party, whether before or after the date of this Agreement
or the Closing Date, with respect to the inaccuracy or noncompliance with any
representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or otherwise which is the
subject of indemnification hereunder. Nothing in this _Section 7.4_ shall be
construed to limit the survival of covenants, agreements and obligations that
by their terms are to be performed or observed after the Effective Time or for
which another time period is specified in this Agreement.

7.5_.

 



 

(b) Other than for claims asserting Fraud, the Escrow Agreement shall be the

_provided_ , that in the case of a breach of any Fundamental Representation,
the exclusive means for the Buyer to collect any such Losses for which it is
entitled to indemnification under _Section 7.1(a)_ shall be the Escrow
Agreement together with the rights of Buyer under _Section 7.6_. Other than
for claims asserting Fraud, the Escrow Agreement together with the rights of
Buyer under _Section 7.6_ shall be the exclusive means for the Buyer to
collect any Losses for which it is entitled to indemnification under _Section
7.1(b)_ through _Section 7.1(m)_ from any Company Equityholder. In the case
of claims asserting Fraud, and except as set forth in _Section 7.5(c)_ or in

Losses payable by the Company Equityholder to the Buyer; provided, that,

under this _Article VII_, each such representation or warranty (other than
the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 2.7_ and in _Section
2.30_) shall be deemed to have been made without any qualifications or
limitations as to materiality (including any qualifications or limitations
made by reference to a Company Material Adverse Effect).

any Loss shall be limited to the amount of any Loss that remains after

MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

10.1 _Press Releases and Announcements_. Neither the Company Equityholder
Representative nor, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall issue any
press release or make any public statement relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement without the prior written approval of Buyer. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Buyer shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
furnish to the Company the proposed text of any press release or public
disclosure proposed to be issued by the Buyer relating to the subject matter
of this Agreement and will

 



     

 

 



 

consider in good faith the reasonable comments of the Company thereon, except
that this sentence shall not apply to any press release that is limited to
information that previously has been disclosed publicly.

 



 

10.2 _Further Assurances; Post-Closing Cooperation_. At any time or from time
to time after the Closing, at the request of any Party, the other Parties
shall execute and deliver to the requesting Party such other documents and
instruments, provide such materials and information and take such other
actions as the requesting Party may reasonably request to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to cause the other
Party or Parties to fulfill its or their respective obligations under this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

10.3 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. The terms and provisions of this Agreement
are intended solely for the benefit of the Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Company Equityholder Representative and their respective successors or
permitted assigns, and it is not the intention of the parties to confer third-
party beneficiary rights, and this Agreement does not confer any such rights,
upon any other Person. For the avoidance of doubt, no Person other than a
Party may assert any claim or initiate any Legal Proceeding to enforce any
provision of this Agreement.

 



 

10.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents referred to
herein) constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties and supersedes any
prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the Parties,
written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof; _provided_ that

the Buyer and the Company shall remain in effect until the Effective Time, at
which time it shall expire and (b) the Convertible Note shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and remain in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms.

 



 

10.5 _Succession and Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. No Party may assign any of its rights or
delegate any of its performance obligations hereunder without the prior
written approval of the other Parties; _provided_ that (a) Merger Sub may
assign its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to an Affiliate of the
Buyer and (b) Buyer may assign all of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement to a Product Line Transferee pursuant to a Product Line Sale, in
which case Buyer shall be released from all Liabilities hereunder, including
with respect to payment of the Milestone Payments. Any purported assignment of
rights or delegation of performance obligations in violation of this _Section
10.5_ is void.

 



 

10.6 _Counterparts and Facsimile Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement
may be executed by facsimile or pdf signature and a facsimile or pdf signature
shall constitute an original for all purposes.

 



 

10.7 _Headings_. The section headings contained in this Agreement are inserted

Any Party may give any notice, request, demand, claim or other communication
hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery, expedited
courier, messenger service, or ordinary mail), but no such notice, request,
demand, claim or other communication that is given by such other means shall

forth.

 



      

 

 



 

10.9 _Amendments and Waivers_. The Parties may mutually amend any provision of
this Agreement at any time; _provided_ , _however_ , that any amendment
effected subsequent to the effectiveness of the Written Consent and prior to
the Closing shall be subject to any restrictions contained in the DGCL. No
amendment of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless the same
shall be in writing and signed by all of the Parties. No waiver of any right
or remedy hereunder shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and
signed by the Party giving such waiver. No waiver by any Party with respect to
any default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder
shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default,
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any
way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.
No amendment or waiver effected subsequent to the Closing shall be effective
against any Company Equityholder unless such amendment or waiver (a) is signed
by the Company Equityholder Representative and (b) either (i) is consented to
in writing by such Company Equityholder or (ii) such amendment or waiver
applies to all Company Equityholders.

 



 

10.10 _Severability; Invalid Provisions_. If any provision of this Agreement
is finally judicially determined to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under
any present or future Law, and if the rights or obligations of any Party under
this Agreement will not be materially and adversely affected thereby, (a) such
provision shall be fully severable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and
enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never
comprised a part hereof, (c) the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom, and (d) in
lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there shall be added
automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable
provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision as may be possible.

 



 

10.11 _Governing Law_. All matters arising out of or relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including its
interpretation, construction, performance and enforcement) shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of Laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of
Delaware.

 



 

10.12 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each Party (a) consents to submit itself
to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware, New Castle County, or, if that court does not have jurisdiction,
a federal court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such
action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court, (c) agrees
that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (d) agrees not to
bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any other court.
Each Party waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any
action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security
that might be required of any other party with respect thereto. Any Party may
make service on another Party by sending or delivering a copy of the process
to the Party to be served at the address and in the manner provided for the
giving of notices in _Section_

 



     

 

 



 

 _10.8_. Nothing in this _Section 10.12_, however, shall affect the right of
any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 



 

10.13 _WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING HEREFROM, THE PARTIES HERETO CONSENT TO TRIAL
WITHOUT A JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY
HERETO OR ITS SUCCESSORS AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO OR ITS SUCCESSORS IN
RESPECT OF ANY MATTER ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT,
REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION OR PROCEEDING.

 



 

10.14 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case without
posting a bond or undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that
it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief on the basis that (a) the Party seeking such remedy has
an adequate remedy at Law or (b) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity.

 



 

10.15 _Construction_.

 



 

(a) The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language
chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any Party.

 



 

(b) Any reference to any federal, state, local or foreign statute or Law shall
be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
unless the context requires otherwise.

 



 

(c) Any reference to any Article, Section or paragraph shall be deemed to
refer to an Article, Section or paragraph of this Agreement, unless the
context clearly indicates otherwise.

 



 

(d) The Parties hereto agree that this Agreement is the product of negotiation
between sophisticated parties and individuals, all of whom were represented by
counsel, and each of whom had an opportunity to participate in and did
participate in the drafting of each provision hereof. Accordingly, ambiguities
in this Agreement, if any, shall not be construed strictly or in favor of or
against any Party but rather shall be given a fair and reasonable construction
without regard to the rule of _contra proferentem_.

 



 

(e) Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires, (i) words of
either gender or the neuter include the other gender and the neuter, (ii)
words using the singular number also include the plural number and words using
the plural number also include the singular number, (iii) the terms "hereof,"
"herein," "hereby" and derivative or similar words refer to this entire
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular Article, Section or other
subdivision, (iv) the words

 



     

 

 



 

"include," "includes," "including" and other similar words shall be deemed to
be followed by the phrase "but not limited to," (v) when a reference is made
in this Agreement to Exhibits, such reference shall be to an Exhibit to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated, (vi) for any document or other item to
have been "delivered," "provided" or "made available" to the Buyer or prior to
the execution or date of this Agreement such document or other item must be
deposited at least one business day prior to the date hereof (or if deposited
more recently, provided such notice of such deposit and a copy of thereof was
given to the Buyer) into the data room heretofore established by the Company
with written notice of such deposit and a copy of such deposit was made to the
Buyer, (vii) all references to "dollars" or "$" shall mean United States
dollars and (viii) "business day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday,
Sunday or other day on which banks in Boston, Massachusetts or New York, New
York are required or permitted by Law to be closed. All accounting terms used
herein and not expressly defined herein shall have the meanings given to them
under GAAP, unless otherwise expressly stated. When used herein, the terms
"third party," "third-party" or "third parties" refers to any Persons other
than the Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company and their respective Affiliates.

 



 

(f) The drafting and negotiation of the representations, warranties, covenants
and conditions to the obligations of the Company, the Buyer and Merger Sub
herein reflect compromises, and certain provisions may overlap with other
provisions or may address the same or similar subject matters in different
ways or for different purposes. It is the intention of the parties that, to
the extent possible, unless provisions are by their terms mutually exclusive
and effect cannot be given to both or all such provisions, (i) the
representations, warranties, covenants and closing conditions in this
Agreement shall be construed to be cumulative, (ii) each representation,
warranty, covenant and closing condition in this Agreement shall be given full
separate and independent effect, and (iii) no limitation in or exception to
any representation, warranty, covenant or closing condition shall be construed
to limit or apply to any other representation, warranty, covenant or closing
condition unless such limitation or exception is expressly made applicable to
such other representation, warranty, covenant or closing condition. Subject to
_Section 7.5(e)_, all remedies, either under this Agreement or by law or
otherwise afforded, shall be cumulative and not alternative.
