ARTICLE II

_THE MERGER_

 

Section 2.01 _The Merger_.

(a) At the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation
(the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

(b) Subject to the provisions of _Article X_ , the closing of the Merger (the
" _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Shearman and Sterling LLP,
Commerce Court West, Suite 4405, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, as soon as
practicable, but in no event later than the second Business Day
after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all
conditions to the Merger, or at such other place or time as Parent and the
Company may mutually agree. In connection with the Closing, the Company and
Merger Sub shall file a certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of
State. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the " _Effective Time_
") as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of
State (or at such later time as is set forth in the certificate of merger).

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and immunities and be
subject to all of the duties and liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of
the Company and Merger Sub, all as provided under Delaware Law.

Section 2.02 _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time,

(a) except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.04_, each share of Company
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any
shares of Company Stock canceled pursuant to _Section 2.02(b)_ and any shares
of Company Stock with respect to which appraisal rights are properly asserted
in accordance with Delaware Law) shall be canceled and converted into the
right to receive $25.60 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), upon surrender thereof in the manner provided in _Section
2.03_;

(b) each share of Company Stock owned by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; and

(c) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the
shares so converted and from and after the Effective Time shall constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.



 

11 Section 2.03 _Surrender and Payment_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging the (i) certificates representing
shares of Company Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") or (ii) uncertificated shares
of Company Stock (the " _Uncertificated Shares_ "), in each case, for the
aggregate Merger Consideration payable to each holder of shares of Company
Stock. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event
within one Business Day after the Closing Date), Parent shall deliver to the
Paying Agent the cash necessary to pay the full amount of the Merger
Consideration in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares as
such Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares are surrendered for payment
pursuant to this _Section 2.03_. Promptly after the date of the Closing,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to send to each Person who held of record
shares of Company Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time a letter of
transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent)
for use in such exchange.

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon
(i) surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent, together with a properly
completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents
as may be required by the Paying Agent, or (ii) receipt of an "agents
message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as
the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer
of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the shares
of Company Stock represented by such Certificate or book entry and, upon
payment therefor, such shares of Company Stock will be canceled. No interest
shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender
of any Certificate or Uncertificated Share for the benefit of the holder of
such Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred,
as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall
represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive
such Merger Consideration and shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such shares of Company Stock, except as otherwise provided herein or by
Applicable Law.

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Paying Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent
that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration
of transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth,
in this _Article II_.



 

12 (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to _Section 2.03(a)_ that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Stock nine months after the Effective Time shall be returned
to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of
Company Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section
2.03_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent, as general
creditors thereof, for payment of the Merger Consideration, and any dividends
and distributions with respect thereto, in respect of such shares without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to
any holder of shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid over to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock two
years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to
such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

Section 2.04 _Appraisal Rights_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
share of the Company Stock that, as of the Effective Time, is held by a holder
who properly asserts and perfects such holders appraisal rights under
Section 262 of Delaware Law with respect to such share, shall not be converted
into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with _Section 2.02(a)_, and the holder of such share instead shall be
entitled only to such rights as may be granted to such holder pursuant to
Section 262 of Delaware Law with respect to such share; _provided_ , _however_
, that if such appraisal rights shall not be perfected or the holder of such
share shall otherwise lose such holders appraisal rights with respect to such
share, then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the time of the failure
to perfect such rights or the loss of such rights, such share
shall automatically be converted into and shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive (upon the surrender of any Certificate representing such
share) the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, in accordance
with  _Section 2.02(a)_.

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demand for
appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
Section 262 of Delaware Law and of any similar demand, notice or instrument
delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Delaware Law
and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company shall not make any payment or
settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand
unless Parent shall have consented in writing to such payment or settlement
offer or unless required by a final, non-appealable order, decree, ruling or
injunction of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Section 2.05 _Stock Options and Awards_. At or immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each option or award (a " _Company Stock Award_ ") to
purchase shares of Company Stock granted under the 1997 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the " _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_ "), the 1990 Directors
Stock Option Plan, the 1994 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the 1997 Long-Term
Incentive Plan and the Acquisition Stock Option Plan (each, a " _Company
Equity Incentive Plan_ "), whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be
canceled, and Parent shall, or shall  



 

13  cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay each holder of any such option or
award at or promptly after the Effective Time for each such option or award
an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration per share of Company Stock over the applicable exercise
price of such option or award by (ii) the number of shares of Company Stock
such holder could have purchased (assuming full vesting of such option or
award) had such holder exercised such option or award in full immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary under each such
Company Equity Incentive Plan and any agreement relating to each such Company
Stock Award to effect the foregoing treatment of such option or award. For the
purposes of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the offering period in effect
at the Effective Time shall terminate as of the Effective Time, each
participant shall be deemed to have options equal to the amount such
participant is entitled to based on such participants accumulated
payroll deductions as of the Effective Time, and such options shall be cashed
out pursuant to this _Section 2.05_.

Section 2.06  _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this _Article II_ such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds such
amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Stock or any Company
Stock Award pursuant to _Sections 2.02(a)_ and _2.05_ in respect of which the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

Section 2.07 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by
this _Article II_.

Section 2.08  _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
Company Stock shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period
(but excluding any change that results from any exercise of Company Stock
Awards outstanding as of the date hereof under Company Equity Incentive
Plans), the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted; _provided_
that, in the event of such adjustment, the aggregate amount of Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to this _Article II_ shall not be adjusted. 

ARTICLE III

_THE SURVIVING CORPORATION_



 

14 Section 3.01 _Certificate of Incorporation_. The certificate of incorporation
of the Merger Sub in effect at the Effective Time, attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_, shall be the certificate of incorporation of Surviving

Surviving Corporation, and (ii) the directors and officers of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be officers or
directors, as the case may be, as of and effective upon, the Effective Time.

the holders of any Company Securities necessary in connection with the
consummation of the Merger. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed

bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws in effect
which affect the enforcement of creditors rights generally and equitable
principles.

and the Companys Board of Directors has (i) determined that this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best interests

authorization or other action by or in respect of, or filing with or
notification to, any Governmental Authority other than (i) the filing of the
certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and appropriate
documents with the relevant authorities of other states in which the Company

_Schedule 4.03_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (v) any actions or
filings on behalf of the Company the absence of which would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.04 _Non-Contravention and Consents_. The execution, delivery

to be acted on, in each case, at the 2007 annual meeting or any special
meeting of the stockholders of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
no event shall the Company be permitted to take or propose to take any action
enumerated in this _Section 6.01_ in connection with such solicitation in
opposition unless such actions are reasonably related to such solicitation in
opposition, such as retaining proxy solicitors and public relation firms.

Section 6.02 _Stockholder Meeting; Proxy Material_. The Company shall cause a
meeting of its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholder Meeting_ ") to be
duly called and held as soon as reasonably practicable to allow the Company
stockholders to vote on the adoption of this Agreement and the Merger. Subject
to  _Section 6.03_, the Special Committee and Board of Directors of the
Company shall recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger
by the Companys stockholders and the Company Proxy Statement shall include
such  



 

38  recommendation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
unless this Agreement is theretofore terminated in accordance with  _Section

the Company shall (i) (A) promptly, in consultation with Parent, prepare and
file the Company Proxy Statement with the SEC, (B) notify Parent promptly
following the receipt of any comments from the SEC and of any request by the

Section 6.03 _No Solicitation; Other Offers_.

(a) Subject to  _Section 6.03(b)_, from the date hereof until the earlier of
(i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, neither the Company (whether acting through its
Board of Directors, the Special Committee or otherwise) nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, nor shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries authorize
or permit any of its or their officers, directors, employees, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants or other agents or advisors to,
directly or indirectly, (w) solicit, initiate or take any action to facilitate
or encourage any inquiries relating to (or which may reasonably be expected to
lead to), or the submission of, any Acquisition Proposal, (x) enter into,
continue or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any
nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to,
or assist, facilitate, participate in or knowingly encourage any effort by,
any Third Party that is seeking to make, has indicated an interest or
intention in making, or has made or may reasonably be expected to make an
Acquisition Proposal, (y) recommend a Superior Proposal or withdraw, qualify
or modify the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub (any of the foregoing in this clause (y), an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (z) enter into any (or amend or modify any
existing) agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet,
confidentiality agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement or
instrument (whether or not binding) relating to an Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may extend the expiration of the
confidentiality agreements currently in effect between the Company and each of
Steven G. Mihaylo and Vector Capital Corporation. The Company shall
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
solicitation, encouragement, discussion, negotiation or other action
conducted by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of its or their
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants,
consultants or other agents or advisors with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall not release any third party from, or waive any
provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a
party and the Company also agrees to promptly request each person that has
executed a confidentiality agreement within 12 months prior to the date hereof
(other  



 

39  than Steven G. Mihaylo or Vector Capital Corporation) in connection with its
consideration of acquiring (whether by merger, acquisition of stock or assets
or otherwise) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, if any, to return (or
if permitted by the applicable confidentiality agreement, destroy) all
confidential information heretofore furnished to such person by or on behalf
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and, if requested by Parent, to
enforce such persons obligation to do so. The Company shall not take any
action to make the provisions of Section 203 of Delaware Law inapplicable to
any transaction other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 6.03(a)_ (except as set forth in
clause (i) below), but subject to _Sections 6.03(c)_ and _6.03(e)_ below,
from the date hereof and prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, the Board
of Directors of the Company may, directly or indirectly through advisors,
agents or other intermediaries, (i) engage in negotiations or discussions
with any Third Party that, subject to the Companys compliance with _Section
6.03(a)_, has made a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that the Board of
Directors of the Company, acting in good faith (after considering the advice
of the Companys outside legal advisor and financial advisor) has determined
to be, or reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal, (ii) furnish to
such Third Party information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to an appropriate confidentiality agreement (which shall
be (i) with respect to Vector Capital Corporation, on the terms as set forth
in the confidentiality agreement currently in effect between the Company and
Vector Capital Corporation or (ii) with respect to any other Third Party, on
terms no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (as defined below) and it being understood that
such confidentiality agreement and any related agreements shall not include
any provision calling for an exclusive right to negotiate with such Third
Party or having the effect of prohibiting the Company from satisfying
its obligations under this Agreement) and (iii) make an Adverse
Recommendation Change but, in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses
(i) through (iii), only if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith by a majority vote (exclusive of any members of the Board of
Directors of the Company that are not independent of the Third Parties making
such Superior Proposal), after considering advice from outside legal counsel
to the Company and the financial advisor to the Company, that such action is
reasonably necessary to comply with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

(c) The Company shall notify Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable
following receipt by the Company (or any of its advisors) of any Acquisition
Proposal (or any inquiry or contact with any Person with respect thereto),
which notice shall include the identity of such Person and the material terms
and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent
informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of any Acquisition
Proposal, including with respect to the material terms of any such proposal
and whether such proposal has been withdrawn or rejected. The Board of
Directors of the Company shall not take any of the actions referred to in
clauses (i) or (ii) of Section _6.03(b)_  or clauses (i) or (ii) of _Section
6.03(e)_ unless the Company shall have first delivered to Parent written
notice advising Parent that it intends to take such action, which written
notice shall state the material terms and conditions of the applicable
Superior Proposal (including material amendments or proposed material
amendments). The Company shall provide to Parent any material information
regarding the Company (not theretofore provided or made available to
Parent) that it provides to any Third Party pursuant to Section
_6.03(b)(ii)_ or Steven E. Mihaylo, his affiliates or his  



 

40  potential sources of debt or equity financing pursuant to _Section 6.03(e)_
as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Company provides
such information to such Person. The Company shall provide Parent with 24
hours prior notice (or such shorter prior notice as is provided to the
members of the Board of Directors of the Company) of any meeting of the Board
of Directors of the Company at which it is reasonably expected that an
Acquisition Proposal will be considered. The parties hereto agree that, in the
event that the Board of Directors of the Company determines it is reasonably
necessary to take the action referred to in clause (iii) of _Section
6.03(b)_, the Board of Directors of the Company may take such action, but only
(i) after providing written notice to Parent (a " _Notice of Superior
Proposal_ ") advising Parent that the Company has received a Superior
Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal and identifying the person making such Superior Proposal and
indicating that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to effect
an Adverse Recommendation Change, and (ii) if Parent does not, within four
Business Days after Parents receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal, make
an offer that the Board of Directors of the Company determines, in its good
faith judgment (after considering the advice of its financial advisor) to be
at least as favorable to the Companys stockholders as such Superior Proposal.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company shall
be permitted to take any action necessary to comply with Rule 14d-9 or Rule
14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal and to
make any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if, in the good faith
judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, after considering the
advice of outside counsel, such disclosure is required to comply with its
fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company or the Companys
public disclosure obligations under Applicable Law, and provided that such
disclosure states that no action will be taken by the Board of Directors of
the Company in violation of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
fact that a disclosure or other action may be deemed permissible by virtue of
this sentence does not in and of itself mean that any such disclosure or other
action constitutes an Adverse Recommendation Change unless such disclosure
has the effect of withdrawing, qualifying or modifying the Company Board
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub or recommending an
Acquisition Proposal.

(e) Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.03_ by any officer, director,
employee, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants,
intermediaries, or other agents or advisors of the Company (whether on behalf
of or at the direction of the Board of Directors of the Company or otherwise)
or any of its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section
6.03_ by the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company, as the case may
be. Notwithstanding anything in _Section 6.03(b)_ or this  _Section
6.03(e)_ to the contrary, but subject to _Section 6.03(c)_, in the event of a
submission of an Acquisition Proposal by Steven G. Mihaylo or his Affiliates,
from the date hereof and prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, the Board
of Directors of the Company may, directly or indirectly through advisors,
agents or other intermediaries, (i) engage in negotiations or discussions with
Mr. Mihaylo and his Affiliates concerning an Acquisition Proposal or (ii)
furnish to Mr. Mihaylo, his Affiliates and his potential sources of debt and
equity financing information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to an appropriate confidentiality agreement (which shall
be either (i) on the terms as set forth in the confidentiality agreement
currently in effect between the Company and Mr. Mihaylo, or (ii) on terms no
less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement (as defined below) and it being  



 

41  understand that such confidentiality agreement and any related agreements
shall not include any "standstill" provision or provision calling for
an exclusive right to negotiate with Mr. Mihaylo or his Affiliates or having
the effect of prohibiting the Company from satisfying its obligations under
this Agreement in accordance with its terms).

(f) For the purposes of this _Section 6.03_ and the definition of "Company
Triggering Event" in Section 1.01, the Board of Directors of the Company
shall be deemed to include any committee thereof (including the Special
Committee) authorized to act on behalf of the Board of Directors of the
Company with respect to the matters set forth in this  _Section 6.03_.

Section 6.04 _Access to Information, etc_. From the date hereof and until the
earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall communicate
with any customer of the Company or its Subsidiaries without the prior consent
of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall prohibit
Parent or Merger Sub from communicating with its customers, including such
customers that are also customers of the Company or its Subsidiaries. From the
date hereof until the Effective Time and subject to Applicable Law and the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of March 1, 2007, between the Company and
Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and _Section 8.06_ of this
Agreement, the Company shall (i) give Parent, its counsel, financial
advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours, and after reasonable advance notice, to the
offices, properties, books and records of the Company and the
Subsidiaries, (ii) furnish to Parent, its counsel, financial advisors,
auditors and other authorized representatives such financial and operating
data and other information as such Persons may reasonably request and (iii)
instruct the executive officers, counsel, financial advisors, auditors and
other authorized representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
cooperate with all reasonable requests of Parent in its investigation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the foregoing
obligation shall not apply to information which would reasonably be expected
to jeopardize any legally recognized privilege otherwise relating to such
information. Any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall be
conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The parties acknowledge and
agree that any confidential or proprietary documents or information disclosed
or provided pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered subject to and
protected from improper or unauthorized use or disclosure by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 6.05 _Nasdaq Global Market System and SEC Filings_.

(a) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the continued
trading and listing of the Company Stock on the Nasdaq Global Market System
during the term of this Agreement; and

(b) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to file with the SEC its
quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2007 in a
form compliant with, and within the time period required by, the applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC.

Section 6.06 _Stockholder Litigation_. Each party shall give the other party
prompt notice of any actual or potential stockholder litigation against the
Company and/or its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the Company shall provide Parent with the opportunity to
participate in the defense of any such litigation. The Company  



 

42  shall not make any payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time
with respect to any such litigation without the prior consent of the
Company.

(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving
Corporation hereby agrees, to do the following:

(i) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the Companys current officers
and directors liability insurance policy with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time (provided that the Surviving Corporation may
substitute for such current insurance policies replacement policies
with financially sound and recognized insurance carriers so long as the scope
of coverage, deductibles, and coverage amounts and exclusions are not
materially less favorable to the officers and directors of the Company at the
time of the Merger than those under the policies in effect on the date
hereof); _provided_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend pursuant to this _Section 7.01(a)_ more than an amount per
year equal to 200% of the current annual premium paid by the Company for such
insurance (which premiums the Company represents and warrants to be $496,300
in the aggregate per year, as of the date hereof). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing (and notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement), prior to the Effective Time and with the prior consent of Parent,
the Company shall be entitled to obtain prepaid (or "tail") insurance policies
providing for the coverage contemplated by this Section. If such prepaid (or
"tail") policies are obtained prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not cancel, amend or otherwise change such
policies or permit such policies to be canceled, amended or changed. 

(ii) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary or
appropriate, proper provision shall be made prior to such transaction so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 7.01_.

(iii) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall include provisions for exculpation and indemnification of directors and
officers equivalent in all material respects to those set forth in the
Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws in effect as of the date
hereof, which provisions shall not be amended for a period of six years after
the Effective Time except as required by changes in Applicable Law or except
to make changes permitted by Applicable Law that would enlarge the scope of
the indemnified persons indemnification rights thereunder.



 

43 (b) Parent hereby unconditionally and irrevocably covenants and agrees to
guarantee the obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this _Section
7.01_. The officers and directors of the Company are intended as express third
party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.01_, and shall be entitled to seek
enforcement of such provisions the foregoing guarantee of Parent as if an
express party hereto.

Section 7.02 _Employee Benefits_.

Employees_ ") with base salary or wage rates, an annual cash bonus opportunity
and employee benefits (other than benefits of the type described in _clause
(d)_ below) that are no less than those provided by Parent or its Subsidiaries
to other similarly tenured and positioned employees of Parent and such
Subsidiaries from time to time and, until the later of (i) December 31, 2007
and (ii) six months after the Closing Date, no less than what each Company
Employee received in the past year (after giving effect to any increases in
compensation in effect as of the Closing Date and made in compliance with
Section 6.01).

(b) Each Company Employee will receive service credit for all periods of
employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any predecessor
thereof prior to the Effective Time for purposes of vesting, eligibility and
benefit levels under any employee benefit plan of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Company) in which such employee participates
after the Effective Time, to the extent that such service was recognized under
any analogous plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that no such service credit shall be
given for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan,
any equity incentive plan or where such credit would result in a duplication
of benefits.

(c) Until the later of (i) December 31, 2007 and (ii) six months after the
Closing Date, Parent shall maintain in effect all employee benefit plans of
the Company providing medical, dental, health, pharmaceutical, vision or other
similar benefits for Company Employees. Thereafter, Company Employees shall be
entitled to participate in the benefit plans offered by or on behalf of
Parent, and in effect subsequent to December 31, 2007, providing medical,
dental, health, pharmaceutical, vision or other similar benefits, which
participation shall be on the same basis as other similarly tenured and
positioned employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries from time to time except
that any replacement plan which is a welfare benefit plan (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA) shall not impose any pre-existing condition exclusions
or limitations, eligibility waiting periods or required physical examinations
with respect to any Company Employee and their eligible dependents to the
extent waived (or inapplicable) under the corresponding Employee Plan in which
the applicable Company Employees participated immediately prior to the date
of replacement and provided that any covered expenses incurred on or before
the date of replacement but within the current plan year of the replacement
plan by any Company Employee and their eligible dependents shall be taken
into account by the replacement plan for purposes of satisfying applicable
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions applicable for
such plan year under the replacement plan.



 

44 (d) Parent shall make available up to an aggregate of $150,000 in cash
retention bonuses to be paid to individuals and in amounts and upon the terms
and conditions as to be mutually agreed by Parent and the Company.

(e) No Company Employee shall have any third party beneficiary rights under
this _Section 7.02_ nor shall any part of this _Section 7.02_ be construed
to constitute an amendment of any Employee Benefit Plan or plan of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries.

Section 7.03 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement
and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this

this Agreement, and (iii) cooperating in responding to inquiries from, and
making presentations to, any Governmental Authorities in connection with the
foregoing; _provided_ that the parties hereto understand and agree that the

entering into any settlement, undertaking, consent decree, stipulation or
agreement with any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby or (ii) divesting or otherwise holding separate (including
by establishing a trust or otherwise), or taking any other action (or
otherwise agreeing to do any of the foregoing) with respect to any of its or
the Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates businesses, assets or properties.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
as promptly as practicable and in any event within ten Business Days after the
date hereof, and each of Parent and the Company shall supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act and otherwise take all other actions
reasonably necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods under the HSR  



 

45  Act as soon as practicable. In addition, each party agrees to make promptly
any filing that may be required with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement under any applicable antitrust, competition or trade
regulation law, and to promptly supply any additional information or
documentary material that may be requested by any other Governmental
Authority.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing,

(i) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to arrange and consummate the Financing on substantially the terms
and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letters, including using reasonable
best efforts to (A) satisfy on a timely basis all terms, conditions,
representations and warranties applicable to Parent or Merger Sub in
the Commitment Letters, (B) enter into definitive agreements with respect to
the Financing as promptly as practicable but in any event at the Effective
Time on terms and conditions no less certain than those contained in the
Commitment Letters and (C) obtain the funds under the Commitment Letters.

(ii) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed with respect to all
material activity concerning the status of the Financing and shall give the
Company prompt notice of any material adverse change or material delay with
respect to the Financing. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall notify
the Company promptly, and in any event within one Business Day, if at any
time prior to the date of Closing (A) the Debt Commitment Letter or Equity
Commitment Letter shall be breached in any material respect or expire or be
terminated for any reason or (B) any financing source that is a party to the
Commitment Letters notifies Parent or Merger Sub that such source no longer
intends to provide financing to Parent or Merger Sub on the terms set forth
therein. Without the prior written consent of the Company, neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall knowingly take any action or omit to take any
action that reasonably would be expected to materially impair, delay or
prevent Parents or Merger Subs ability to timely obtain the proceeds of the
Financing or to enter into and timely consummate any alternate financing
arrangement. Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Company, terminate, amend or alter, or agree to terminate, amend or
alter, the Commitment Letters in a manner that reasonably would materially
impair, delay or prevent the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(iii) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide Parent with
such cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Financing,
including (A) reasonably participating in meetings, due diligence sessions
and management presentation sessions and similar presentations with lenders,
(B) providing and assisting with the preparation of financial statements
(including pro forma financial statements) and other information
(financial or otherwise) regarding the Company for the purpose of preparing
offering memoranda, private placement memoranda and similar documents or
complying with the Debt Disclosed Conditions relating to the Company, and (C)
reasonably facilitating the pledge of collateral to secure the repayment of
any indebtedness resulting from the Financing after the Effective Time.



 

46 Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee in connection
with the Financing prior to the Effective Time.

(iv) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letters, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (A) arrange alternate financing (on terms and
conditions no less favorable in any material respect than those contained in
the Commitment Letters) and, if obtained, shall promptly provide the Company
with a copy of the new financing commitments, (B) enter into definitive
agreements with respect to any such alternate financing arrangements as
promptly as practicable but in any event prior to the Effective Time and (C)
obtain funds under such alternate financing arrangements to the extent
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
without undue delay.

Section 8.02 _Certain Filings_. The Company and Parent shall cooperate with
one another (i) in connection with the preparation of the Company Disclosure
Documents, (ii) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or
filing with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any actions, consents,
approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any material
contracts, in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) in taking such actions or making any
such filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith or with
the Company Disclosure Documents and seeking timely to obtain any such
actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

Section 8.03  _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release, making any other public
statement or scheduling any press conference or conference call with investors
or analysts with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and, except as may be required by Applicable Law or any listing
agreement with or rule of any automated quotation system or national
securities exchange or association, shall not issue any such press release,
make any such other public statement or schedule any such press conference or
conference call before such consultation, if practicable.

Section 8.04 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things
to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

Section 8.05 _Notice of Certain Events_. Each of the Company, on the one hand,
and Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall promptly notify the other
if it receives or becomes aware of:

(a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;



 

47 (b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(c) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced
or threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, as
the case may be, that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have
been required to have been disclosed pursuant to _Articles IV_ or _V_ , as
the case may be, or that relate to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

(d) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty that could reasonably be
expected to cause any of the conditions set forth in  _Section 9.02_ or
_9.03_ not to be satisfied; and

(e) any failure of any party hereto to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 8.05_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving that notice.

Section 8.06 _Company Disclosure Schedule_. A disclosure or statement in the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed as indicating that such
matter is material, has resulted in or could have resulted in a Company
Material Adverse Effect or is necessarily required to be disclosed by the
Company. No disclosure in the Company Disclosure Schedule relating to any
possible breach or violation of any agreement, law or regulation shall be
construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or violation
exists or has actually occurred.

may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time (notwithstanding any
approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company):

(a) by mutual written agreement of the Company and Parent;

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if:

(i) the Merger has not been consummated on or before September 30, 2007 (the "
_End Date_ "); _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this  _Section 10.01(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any party
whose breach of any provision of this Agreement results in the failure of the
Merger to be consummated by such time;

(ii) consummation of the Merger would violate any nonappealable final order,

best efforts to resist, resolve or lift) of any Governmental Authority having

(iii) the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the
Company Stockholder Meeting (including any adjournment or postponement

(c) by Parent, if a Company Triggering Event has occurred;

case such that the conditions set forth in _Section 9.02(a)_ and _Section
9.02(b)_ would not be satisfied (" _Terminating Company Breach_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if such Terminating Company Breach is curable
by the Company, Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this Section

to cure such breach, unless such breach is not cured within 15 days after
notice of such breach is provided by Parent to the Company;

or if any representation or warranty of Parent and Merger Sub shall have
become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in _Section
9.03(a)_ and _Section 9.03(b)_ would not be satisfied  



 

50  (" _Terminating Parent Breach_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that, if such
Terminating Parent Breach is curable by Parent and Merger Sub, the Company
may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section 10.01(f)_ for so long as

other writing delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the Effective Time.



 

52 Section 11.03 _Amendments and Waivers_.

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the
Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is
signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in
the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be
effective; _provided_ that, after the Company Stockholder Approval and without
the further approval of the stockholders of the Company, no such amendment or
waiver shall reduce the amount or change the kind of consideration to be paid
or received pursuant to _Section 2.02_, _Section 2.03_ or  _Sections 2.05_
through _2.08_.

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power
or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single

herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

Section 11.04 _Fees and Expenses_. 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost
or expense.

(b) If a Parent Payment Event occurs, the Company shall pay Parent a fee
of $20,000,000 less the amount of Parent Expenses, if any, reimbursed by the
Company to Parent in connection with a Parent Reimbursement Event (the "
_Parent Termination Fee_ ") on the earlier of (i) simultaneously with
the Companys termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.01(e)_,
(ii) immediately prior to the execution of a definitive agreement with respect
to an Alternative Transaction in the event that this Agreement is
terminated under the circumstances described in the proviso in the definition
of "Parent Payment Event", or (iii) within one Business Day after the Parent
Payment Event relating to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to 
_Section 10.01(c)_. If a Parent Reimbursement Event occurs, the Company shall
reimburse Parent and Merger Sub within five Business Days after the Parent
Reimbursement Event for all Parent Expenses in an amount not to exceed
$6,000,000. In no event shall the Company pay more than one Parent
Termination Fee hereunder and in no event shall the Company be obligated to
reimburse Parent for Parent Expenses resulting from more than one Parent
Reimbursement Event.

(c) If a Company Payment Event occurs, Parent shall within one Business Day
following such Company Payment Event pay the Company (by wire transfer of
immediately available funds) a fee of $20,000,000 (the " _Company Termination
Fee_ "). In no event shall Parent pay more than one Company Termination Fee
hereunder.

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
_Section 11.04_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Parent
Termination Fee or any Parent Expenses when due, the term "Parent Termination
Fee" and "Parent Expenses", as the case may be, shall be deemed to include
the costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by Parent (including,
without limitation, fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the
collection under and  



 

53  enforcement of this _Section 11.04_, together with interest on such unpaid
Parent Termination Fee and Parent Expenses, commencing on the date that the
Parent Termination Fee or such Parent Expenses became due, at a rate equal to
the rate of interest publicly announced by Citibank, N.A., from time to time,
in The City of New York, as such banks Prime Rate plus 1.00%. In the event
that Parent shall fail to pay the Company Termination Fee when due, the term
"Company Termination Fee" shall be deemed to include the costs and expenses
actually incurred or accrued by the Company (including, without limitation,
fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and
enforcement of this _Section 11.04_, together with interest on such unpaid
Company Termination Fee, commencing on the date that the Company Termination
Fee became due, at a rate equal to the rate of interest publicly announced by
Citibank, N.A., from time to time, in The City of New York as such banks
Prime Rate plus 1.00%. The parties further acknowledge and agree that in the
event of the circumstances giving rise to the payment of the Parent
Termination Fee or any Parent Expenses or the Company Termination Fee, damages
from such circumstances will be difficult to quantify. Therefore the parties
have agreed that the payment of such amounts represents a reasonable estimate
of the amount of such damages in such contexts and that such payments shall be
deemed to constitute liquidated damages and not in the nature of a penalty.
The parties acknowledge and agree that the sole and exclusive remedy in the
circumstances giving rise to the payment of the Parent Termination Fee, any
Parent Expenses or the Company Termination Fee, as the case may be, shall be
the payment of such agreed amounts, and no party shall have any other or
further liability to any other party arising out of the circumstances
triggering payment of such fees and reimbursement of expenses.

(e) Payment of one-half the Company Termination Fee, to the extent due and
payable hereunder, is and shall be separately guaranteed pursuant to the
Limited Guarantee entered into by Francisco Partners II, L.P. on the date
hereof.

Section 11.05 _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_.

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and the third party beneficiaries identified
in _Section 7.01_ and their respective successors and assigns. Except as
provided in _Section 7.01_, no provision of this Agreement is intended to
confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder
upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns. Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to amend any
benefit plan or to limit any rights that any parties may have under a benefit
plan to amend or terminate that plan.

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that Parent or Merger Sub may transfer or assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to
(i) one or more of their Affiliates at any time and (ii) on or after
the Effective Time, to any Person (including lenders in connection with the
Financing for collateral security purposes); _provided_ that no such transfer
or assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub from any of its obligations
hereunder. 

Section 11.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York,
without regard to the conflict of law  



 

54  provisions thereof, provided that the Merger shall be effected in accordance
with the applicable provisions of Delaware Law.

Section 11.07 _Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto agree that any suit, action
or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought in any federal court or state court
located in the City of New York in the State of New York, and each of the
parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and
of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or
proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,
action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided for notices in 
_Section 11.01_ shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

Section 11.08 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until
and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any
right or obligation hereunder.

Section 11.09 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement and any other written agreements executed and delivered by the
parties hereto on the date hereof constitute the entire agreement between the
parties with respect to their collective subject matter and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the
parties with respect to such subject matter.

Section 11.10 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

Section 11.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage would occur if any obligation of the Company under
provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms
hereof and that, prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 10.01 hereof, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by the Company
in any federal or state court  



 

55  located in the City of New York in the State of New York, in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

Section 11.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.
