First Majestic is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good

of the options referred to above, no First Majestic Shares are held in treasury

      in such Superior Proposal ceasing to be a Superior Proposal. If the

      Silvermex Board continues to believe, in good faith and after consultation
      with financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Superior
      Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and therefore rejects First
      Majestic&#146;s amended proposal, Silvermex may terminate this Agreement

      any, payable to First Majestic under Section 6.3 and must prior to or
      concurrently with such termination enter into a binding agreement,

<B>Liquidated Damages</B>. Silvermex acknowledges that the damages set forth in
this Article 6 are a genuine pre-estimate of the damages First Majestic will
suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise to those damages and are
not penalties. Silvermex irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise as a
defence in any proceedings that any such damages are excessive, punitive or
abusive.</P>
<P align=justify>6.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>Remedies</B>. Subject to Section 6.6, the Parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that an award of money damages would be inadequate for any breach of this
Agreement by any Party or its representatives and any such breach would cause
the non-breaching Party irreparable harm. Accordingly, the Parties hereto agree
that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by one
of the Parties, the non-breaching Party will also be entitled, without the
requirement of posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief, including
injunctive relief and specific performance. Such remedies will not be the
exclusive remedies for any breach of this Agreement but will be in addition to
all other remedies available at law or equity to the Parties.</P>
<P align=justify>6.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>Effect of Termination Payment</B>. For greater certainty, the Parties agree
that the payment of the amount pursuant to Section 6.3 is the sole monetary
remedy as a result of the occurrence of any of the events referred to in Section
6.3. Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, nothing in this Agreement
shall preclude a Party from seeking damages in respect of losses incurred or
suffered by such Party as a result of any breach of this Agreement by the other
Party, seeking injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach of
the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or the Confidentiality
Agreement or otherwise, or seeking specific performance of any of such covenants
or agreements, without the necessity of posting bond or security in connection
therewith.</P>
