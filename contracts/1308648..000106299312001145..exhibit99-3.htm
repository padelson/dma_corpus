Plan of Arrangement. In addition, Silvermex will not object to legal counsel
to First Majestic making such submissions on the hearing of the motion for
the Interim Order and the application for the Final Order as such counsel
considers appropriate; provided, however, that Silvermex is advised of the
nature of any submissions prior to the hearing and such submissions are

to this Agreement or the Arrangement without the consent of the other Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
provided, however, that the foregoing shall be subject to each Partys
overriding obligation to make any disclosure required under applicable Laws,
and the Party making such disclosure shall use all commercially reasonable

Arrangement will be carried out with the intention that all First Majestic
Shares and Replacement Warrants issued under the Arrangement to the United
States holders of Silvermex Shares and Silvermex Warrants will be issued in
reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S.
Securities Act provided by Section 3(a)(10) of the U.S. Securities Act (the

      |   | 
      | (c)   |  

the Court will be required to satisfy itself as to the  fairness of the
Arrangement to the Silvermex Securityholders subject to  the Arrangement; 

      |   | 
      | (d)   |

      |   | 
      | (e)   |  

the order approving the Arrangement that is obtained from  the Court will
expressly state that the Arrangement is approved by the  Court as being fair
to the Silvermex Securityholders pursuant to the  Arrangement; 

      |   | 
      | (f)   |  

Silvermex will ensure that each Person entitled to First  Majestic Shares or
Replacement Warrants pursuant to the Arrangement will  be given adequate
notice advising them of their right to attend the  hearing of the Court to
give approval of the Arrangement and providing  them with sufficient
information necessary for them to exercise that  right; and 

      |   | 
      | (g)   |  

the Interim Order will specify that each Person entitled  to First Majestic
Shares or Replacement Warrants pursuant to the  Arrangement will have the
right to appear before the Court so long as they  enter an appearance within
a reasonable time. 

 2.10  United States Tax Matters. The Arrangement is intended to
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
United States Internal Revenue Code and this Agreement is intended to be a

promulgated under Section 368 of the United States Internal Revenue Code.
Provided that the Arrangement meets the requirements of a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the United States Internal Revenue
Code, each Party hereto agrees to treat the Arrangement as a reorganization

all United States federal income tax purposes, and agrees to treat this
Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of the United
States Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 368 of the United
States Internal Revenue Code, and to not take any position on any United
States Tax Return or otherwise take any tax reporting position inconsistent
with such treatment, unless otherwise required by applicable law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, First Majestic and Silvermex make no
representation, warranty or covenant to any other party or to any Silvermex
Securityholder regarding the United States tax treatment of the Arrangement,
including, but not limited to, whether the Arrangement will qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the United
States Internal Revenue Code or as a tax deferred transaction for purposes of
any United States state or local income tax Law.

 2.11  Effective Date Matters. The Effective Date shall be the date
the Final Order is deposited at the registered office of Silvermex, which
shall be (a) the date that is the earlier of: (i) the date that is three
Business Days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Laws)
of the conditions set forth in Article 5 (other than the delivery of items to

provided that the conditions set forth in Article 5 have been satisfied or

permitted, waiver of those conditions as of the Effective Time) set forth in
Article 5, the Arrangement will, from and after the Effective Time, have all

and is in good standing as a foreign corporation or organization authorized
to do business in all jurisdictions in which the character of the properties
owned, leased or operated or the nature of the business conducted by it would
make such qualification or licensing necessary. No proceedings have been
instituted or are pending for the dissolution or liquidation of Silvermex or

right or privilege under convertible securities, warrants or convertible
obligations of any  nature) for the purchase, subscription, allotment or
issuance of, or  conversion into, any of the unissued shares or any other
securities of  Silvermex or the purchase or other acquisition from Silvermex
of any of  its undertakings, business or assets. \- 20-

incorporated under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, is validly
subsisting, has full corporate or legal power and authority to own, lease and
operate the properties currently owned, leased and operated by it and to
conduct its business as currently conducted, and is in good standing with
respect to the filing of annual returns. First Majestic is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation or
organization authorized to do business in all jurisdictions in which the
character of the properties owned, leased or operated or the nature of the
business conducted by it would make such qualification or licensing
necessary. No proceedings have been instituted or are pending for the
dissolution or liquidation of First Majestic.

 

3.2.2 _Capitalization_. The authorized share structure of First Majestic
consists of an unlimited number of First Majestic Shares, of which, as of the
date hereof, 105,567,272 First Majestic Shares were issued and outstanding.
Except for employee stock options granted by First Majestic pursuant to
employment compensation plans, there are no options, warrants, conversion
privileges or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments
(contingent or otherwise) obligating First Majestic to issue or sell any
shares or securities or obligations of any kind convertible into or
exchangeable for any shares of First Majestic. Other than 49,515
First Majestic Shares authorized for issuance to former shareholders of First
Silver Reserve Inc. and First Majestic Shares reserved for issuance upon the
exercise of the options referred to above, no First Majestic Shares are held
in treasury or authorized or reserved for issuance. There are no outstanding
bonds, debentures or other evidences of indebtedness of First Majestic having
the right to vote (or that are convertible for or exercisable into securities
having the right to vote) with the holders of the First Majestic Shares on
any matter. The First Majestic Shares to be issued pursuant to the
Arrangement or upon the exercise from time to time of the Replacement
Warrants in accordance with their respective terms, will, when issued and
delivered be duly and validly issued by First Majestic on their respective
dates of issue as fully paid and non-assessable shares and will not be issued

issued in compliance with the constating documents of First Majestic and all
applicable Laws. As of the Effective Date, all of the Replacement Warrants
will be outstanding as duly authorized and validly existing warrants to
acquire First Majestic Shares, which will not be issued in violation of the

the time at which they are issued and will be issued in compliance with the
constating documents of First Majestic and all applicable Laws.

of any event occurring subsequent to the date of this  Agreement that would
render any representation or warranty of First  Majestic contained in this

date prior to the occurrence of such event),  if made on or as of the date of
such event or the Effective Date, untrue  or inaccurate in any material
respect; 

      |   |   |   | 
      |   |   | (B)   |  

of any Material Adverse Change in respect of First  Majestic; and \- 52-

contained in this Agreement. 

 

4.4  Covenants Regarding Non-Solicitation.

        | (a)   |  

Subject to Section 4.5 , Silvermex shall not, directly or  indirectly,
through any officer, director, employee, representative or  agent of
Silvermex or any Silvermex Subsidiary: 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (i)   |  

solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of  furnishing information
or entering into any form of agreement, arrangement  or understanding) the
initiation of any inquiries or proposals regarding  an Acquisition Proposal; 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (ii)   |

Proposal; 

      |   |   |

      |   | (iv)   |  

approve or recommend or propose publicly to approve or  recommend any
Acquisition Proposal or remain neutral with respect to an  Acquisition
Proposal which has been publicly announced (it being  understood that
publicly taking no position or a neutral position with  respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, or any material amendment thereto,  until five Business
Days following the public announcement of such  Acquisition Proposal shall
not be considered a violation of this section);  or 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (v)   |  

enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,  agreement,
arrangement or understanding related to any Acquisition  Proposal (except as
permitted by Section 4.4(d)). 

 

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence of this Section 4.4(a) and any other
provision of this Agreement, nothing shall prevent the Silvermex Board prior
to the Silvermex Meeting from considering, participating in any discussions
or negotiations, or entering into a confidentiality agreement and providing
information pursuant to Section 4.4(d), regarding an unsolicited _bona fide_
written Acquisition Proposal that did not otherwise result from a breach of
this Section 4.4 and that the Silvermex Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with financial advisors and outside legal counsel, is reasonably
likely to constitute a Superior Proposal. Silvermex shall not consider,
negotiate, accept or recommend an Acquisition Proposal after the date of the
Silvermex Meeting. Silvermex shall, and shall cause its officers, directors
and employees and any financial advisors or other advisors, representatives
or agents retained by it, to cease immediately upon execution of this
Agreement all discussions and negotiations regarding any proposal that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal. To the extent it has not already done so, Silvermex shall deny
access to all parties other than First Majestic and its advisors,
employees and agents to any and all data rooms which may have been opened.
Silvermex shall immediately request the  return of all confidential non-
public information provided to any third  parties (other than First Majestic
and its advisors, employees and agents)  who have entered into a
confidentiality agreement with Silvermex relating  to a potential Acquisition
Proposal, shall use all reasonable efforts to  ensure that such requests are
honoured and shall immediately advise First  Majestic orally and in writing
of any responses or action (actual or  threatened) by any recipient of such
request which could hinder, prevent,  delay or otherwise adversely affect the
completion of the Arrangement. \- 53-

       | (b)   |  

Silvermex shall not amend, modify, waive or fail to  enforce on a timely
basis any obligation under any confidentiality or  standstill agreement or
amend any such agreement or other conditions  included in any agreement
between Silvermex and a third party, except to  allow such Person to
confidentially propose to the Silvermex Board an  unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a  breach of Section 4.4(a) by
Silvermex or any of its representatives) that  the Silvermex Board
determines, after receipt of written advice from its  legal and financial
advisors, constitutes or is reasonably likely to  constitute a Superior
Proposal. 

      |   | 
      | (c)   |  

Silvermex shall promptly notify First Majestic, at first  orally and then in
writing, of any Acquisition Proposal and any enquiry  that could lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, or any amendments to the  foregoing, or any request for
non-public information relating to Silvermex  in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal or for access to the  properties, books or records of
Silvermex by any Person that informs  Silvermex that it is considering
making, or has made, a proposal that  constitutes, or may reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition  Proposal. Such notice shall include a
description of the material terms  and conditions of any proposal, the
identity of the Person making such  proposal, enquiry or contact, a copy of
any written form of Acquisition  Proposal and provide such other details of
the proposal, enquiry or  contact as First Majestic may reasonably request.
Silvermex  shall: 

  
        | (i)   |  

keep First Majestic fully informed of the status  including any change to the
material terms of any such Acquisition  Proposal or enquiry; and 

      |   | 
      | (ii)   |  

provide to First Majestic as soon as practicable after  receipt or delivery
thereof with copies of all correspondence and other  written material sent or
provided to Silvermex from any Person in  connection with any Acquisition
Proposal or sent or provided by Silvermex  to any Person in connection with
any Acquisition  Proposal. 

 
        | (d)   |  

If Silvermex receives a request for material non-public  information from a
Person who has made an unsolicited _bona fide _ written Acquisition Proposal
and Silvermex is permitted, as  contemplated under the second sentence of
Section 4.4(a) to negotiate the  terms of such Acquisition Proposal, then,
and only in such case, the  Silvermex Board may, subject to the execution by
such Person of a  confidentiality agreement on terms substantially similar to
the  Confidentiality Agreement, provide such Person with access to
information  regarding Silvermex; provided, however, that Silvermex sends a
copy of any  such confidentiality agreement to First Majestic promptly upon
its  execution and concurrently provides First Majestic with a list of or 
copies of the information provided to such Person and access to similar
information  which was provided to such Person. \- 54-

       | (e)   |  

Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the  termination of this
Agreement, Silvermex shall not, except with the prior  written consent of
First Majestic, take any action to terminate, amend,  extend the "Separation
Time" under or waive the Shareholder Rights Plan,  or the application of the
Shareholder Rights Plan to, any Acquisition  Proposal, or any Person making
an Acquisition Proposal, not subject to the  Shareholder Rights Plan
(including redemption of any rights created under  the Shareholder Rights
Plan) unless the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a  Superior Proposal and
Silvermex has complied with the provisions of  Section 4.4 and Section 4.5
and provided further that any such  termination, amendment, extension, waiver
or redemption cannot be  effective until after the Silvermex Meeting. In the
event that any Person  requests any Governmental Entity to invalidate or
cease trade the  Shareholder Rights Plan, Silvermex shall oppose any such
application  unless the Silvermex Board determines, after consultation with
outside  legal counsel, that to do so is not consistent with its fiduciary 
duties. 

      |   | 
      | (f)   |  

Silvermex shall ensure that its officers, directors and  employees and any
financial advisors or other advisors, representatives or  agents retained by
it are aware of the provisions of this Section 4.4, and  it shall be
responsible for any breach of this Section 4.4 by any such  Person. 

 

4.5  Notice by Silvermex of Superior Proposal Determination.

        | (a)   |  

Notwithstanding Section 4.4 Silvermex may accept,  approve, recommend or
enter into any agreement, understanding or  arrangement in respect of an
Acquisition Proposal if, and only  if: 

      |   |   |   | 
      |   | (i)   |  

Silvermex shall have complied with all of its other  obligations under
Section 4.4; 

      |   |   |   | 
      |   | (ii)   |  

such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior  Proposal; 

      |   |   |   | 
      |   | (iii)   |  

the Silvermex Meeting has not occurred; 

      |   |   |   | 
      |   | (iv)   |  

Silvermex has provided First Majestic with: 

      |   |   |   | 
      |   |   | (A)   |  

a copy of the Superior Proposal document and all related  documents; 

      |   |   |   | 
      |   |   | (B)   |  

written notice advising First Majestic of the  determination of the Silvermex
Board that the Acquisition Proposal is a  Superior Proposal and that the
Silvermex Board has resolved, subject only  to compliance with this Section
4.5 and termination of this Agreement, to  accept, approve, recommend or
enter into an agreement in respect of such  Superior Proposal, specifying the
terms and conditions of such Superior  Proposal and identifying the Person
making such Superior Proposal;  and 

      |   |   |   | 
      |   |   | (C)   |  

written notice from the Silvermex Board regarding the  value in financial
terms that the Silvermex Board has, in  consultation with its financial
advisors, determined should be ascribed to any non-cash consideration offered
under the Superior Proposal; \- 55-

        | (v)   |  

five Business Days shall have elapsed from the date First  Majestic received
the documentation referred to in Section 4.5(a)(iv) (the  "Match Period");
and 

      |   |   | 
      | (vi)   |  

Silvermex has previously or concurrently will  have: 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (A)   |  

paid to First Majestic the Termination Payment, if any,  payable under
Section 6.3; and 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (B)   |  

terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section  6.2. 

 

Any information provided by Silvermex to First Majestic pursuant to this
Section 4.5 or pursuant to Section 4.4 shall be subject to the provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement.

        | (b)   |  

During the Match Period Silvermex agrees that First  Majestic shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to offer to amend  the terms of this Agreement
and Silvermex shall co-operate with First  Majestic with respect thereto,
including negotiating in good faith with  First Majestic during the Match
Period. The Silvermex Board will review  any offer by First Majestic to amend
the terms of this Agreement in order  to determine, in good faith and in the
exercise of its fiduciary duties,  whether First Majestics offer upon
acceptance by Silvermex would result  in such Superior Proposal ceasing to be
a Superior Proposal. If the  Silvermex Board so determines, it will enter
into an amended agreement  with First Majestic reflecting First Majestics
amended proposal. If the  Silvermex Board continues to believe, in good faith
and after consultation  with financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that such Superior  Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and therefore
rejects First  Majestics amended proposal, Silvermex may terminate this
Agreement  pursuant to Section 6.2(a)(iv); provided, however, that Silvermex
must  concurrently therewith pay to First Majestic the Termination Payment,
if  any, payable to First Majestic under Section 6.3 and must prior to or 
concurrently with such termination enter into a binding agreement, 
understanding or arrangement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal. 
Silvermex acknowledges and agrees that payment of the Termination Payment, 
if any, payable under Section 6.3 is a condition to valid termination of 
this Agreement under Section 6.2(a)(iv) and this Section 4.5. 

      |   | 
      | (c)   |  

The Silvermex Board shall promptly reaffirm its  recommendation of the
Arrangement by press release: (i) after any  Acquisition Proposal (which is
determined not to be a Superior Proposal)  is publicly announced or made;
(ii) after the Silvermex Board determines  that a proposed amendment to the
provisions of this Agreement would result  in the Acquisition Proposal not
being a Superior Proposal; or (iii) as  soon as practicable after receipt of
any reasonable request from First  Majestic to do so. First Majestic and its
legal advisor shall be given a  reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on the form and content of  any such press release and Silvermex shall
incorporate all reasonable  comments made by First Majestic and its counsel.
Such press release shall  state that the Silvermex Board has determined that
such Acquisition  Proposal is not a Superior Proposal. \- 56-

        | (d)   |  

If, less than six Business Days before the Silvermex  Meeting, Silvermex has
provided First Majestic with a notice under Section  4.5(a)(iv), an
Acquisition Proposal has been publicly disclosed or  announced and the Match
Period has not elapsed, then, subject to  applicable Laws, at First
Majestics request, Silvermex will postpone or  adjourn the Silvermex Meeting
to a date acceptable to First Majestic and  Silvermex, acting reasonably,
which shall not be less than five Business  Days and not more than 10
Business Days after the scheduled date of the  Silvermex Meeting and shall,
in the event that First Majestic and  Silvermex amend the terms of this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 4.5,  ensure that the details of such
amended Agreement are communicated to the  Silvermex Securityholders at or
prior to the resumption of the adjourned  Silvermex Meeting. 

      |   | 
      | (e)   |  

Silvermex acknowledges and agrees that each successive  modification of any
Acquisition Proposal shall constitute a new  Acquisition Proposal for
purposes of the requirement under Section  4.5(a)(v) to initiate an
additional five Business Day notice  period. 

 

4.6  Access to Information. Subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement and applicable Laws, upon reasonable notice,
Silvermex shall afford First Majestics officers, employees, counsel,
accountants and other authorized representatives and advisors
("Representatives") access, during normal business hours in the Pre-Effective
Date Period to such properties, books, contracts and records and other
documents, information or data relating to Silvermex and the Silvermex
Subsidiaries which First Majestic or its Representatives deem necessary or
advisable to review in making an examination of Silvermex, the Silvermex
Subsidiaries and the Business, as well as to its management personnel, and,
during such period, Silvermex shall furnish promptly to First Majestic all
information concerning Silvermex, the Silvermex Subsidiaries and their
respective Business, properties and personnel as First Majestic or its
Representatives may reasonably request. Subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement and applicable Laws, upon reasonable notice,
First Majestic shall afford Silvermexs Representatives access, during normal
business hours in the Pre-Effective Date Period to such of First Majestics
management personnel as First Majestic may determine, acting reasonably, and,
during such period, First Majestic shall furnish promptly to Silvermex all
information respecting material changes in First Majestics business,
properties and personnel as Silvermex may reasonably request. At the request
of First Majestic, Silvermex will execute or cause to be executed such
consents, authorizations and directions as may be necessary to enable First
Majestic or its Representatives to obtain full access to all files and
records relating to Silvermex, the Silvermex Subsidiaries or their respective
assets maintained by any Governmental Entity.

 

4.7  Covenant Regarding Representations and Warranties. Each of
Silvermex and First Majestic covenants that it will use all reasonable
efforts to ensure that the representations and warranties given by it and
contained in Article 3 are true and correct on and as at the Effective Date
(except as affected by transactions contemplated or permitted by this
Agreement or otherwise consented to by the other Party) or if not true, do
not have a Material Adverse Effect on such Party.

 

4.8  Indemnification, Insurance and Mutual Releases.

        | (a)   |  

First Majestic hereby covenants and agrees that, unless  prohibited by
applicable Laws, all rights to indemnification or  exculpation in favour of
the current and former directors and officers of  Silvermex and any Silvermex
Subsidiary provided in the current articles or  by-laws (or the equivalent)
of Silvermex or any Silvermex Subsidiary, or  in any agreement to the extent
disclosed in Schedule 4.8 to the Silvermex Disclosure Letter, and any
directors  and officers insurance now existing in favour of the directors
or  officers of Silvermex and any Silvermex Subsidiary shall survive the 
completion of the Arrangement (or be replaced with substantially  equivalent
coverage from another provider of at least equivalent standing  to the
current provider) and shall continue in full force and effect  (either
directly or via run-off insurance or insurance provided by an  alternative
provider of at least equivalent standing to the current  provider) for a
period of not less than six years from the Effective Date  and First Majestic
undertakes to ensure that this covenant shall remain  binding upon its
successor and assigns. First Majestic acknowledges that  Silvermex may
purchase run-off directors and officers liability  insurance for a period
of up to six years from the Effective Date on terms  acceptable to First
Majestic acting reasonably. \- 57-

       | (b)   |  

Silvermex shall act as agent and trustee of the benefits  of the foregoing
for its directors and officers and those of the Silvermex  Subsidiaries for
the purpose of this Section 4.8 and this Section 4.8  shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the  completion of the
Arrangement and shall be enforceable against First  Majestic by the Persons
described in subsection (a) hereof. 

      |   | 
      | (c)   |  

First Majestic acknowledges and agrees that Silvermex may  enter into
indemnification agreements with each director and officer of  Silvermex and
each of the Silvermex Subsidiaries prior to the Effective  Date, such
agreements to be in a form acceptable to First Majestic, acting  reasonably.
First Majestic agrees that from and after the Effective Date  it will cause
Silvermex to honour all rights to indemnification or  exculpation in such
agreements in favour of present and former officers  and directors of
Silvermex and acknowledges that such rights will survive  the Effective Date
and will continue in full force and effect for a period  of not less than six
years from the Effective Date. 

      |   | 
      | (d)   |  

First Majestic and Silvermex shall use all reasonable  efforts to enter into
a mutual release on or before the Effective Date  with each director and
officer of Silvermex and each of the Silvermex  Subsidiaries, such release to
be effective as at the Effective Time and in  a form acceptable to First
Majestic, acting reasonably. 

 

4.9   **Employment Arrangements**. First Majestic acknowledges and
agrees that completion of the Arrangement will be treated as triggering the
Change of Control Payments and that immediately prior to the Effective Time,
Silvermex shall make the Change of Control Payments in a lump sum (less
applicable statutory deductions).

for a material default by First Majestic in complying with its obligations
hereunder.

 

5.3  Additional Conditions Precedent to the Obligations of
Silvermex. The obligations of Silvermex to complete the transactions

or before the Effective Date, of each of the following conditions precedent

representations and warranties, all "Material Adverse  Effect" qualifications
and other materiality qualifications contained in  such representations and
warranties shall be disregarded) as of the date  of this Agreement and as of
Effective Date as if made on and as of such  date (except to the extent such
representations and warranties speak as of  a specified date which is earlier
than the date of this Agreement, in  which event such representations and
warranties shall be true and correct  in all material respects as of such
earlier specified date, or except as affected by  transactions contemplated
or permitted by this Agreement) and Silvermex  shall have received a
certificate of First Majestic addressed to Silvermex  and dated the Effective
Date, signed on behalf of First Majestic by two  senior executive officers of
First Majestic confirming the same as at the  Effective Date; \- 61-

       | (c)   |  

between the date hereof and the Effective Date, there  shall not have
occurred, in the judgment of Silvermex, acting reasonably,  a Material
Adverse Change to First Majestic; and 

      |   | 
      | (d)   |  

the board of directors of First Majestic shall have  adopted all necessary
resolutions, and all other necessary corporate  action shall have been taken
by First Majestic to permit the consummation  of the Arrangement and the
issue of First Majestic Shares pursuant to the  Arrangement and upon the
exercise from time to time of the Replacement  Warrants. 

 

Silvermex may not rely on the failure to satisfy any of the above conditions
precedent as a basis for noncompliance by Silvermex with its obligations
under this Agreement if the condition precedent would have been satisfied but
for a material default by Silvermex in complying with its obligations
hereunder.

 

5.4  Notice and Cure Provisions. Each Party will give prompt notice
to the other of the occurrence, or failure to occur, at any time from the
date hereof until the Effective Date, of any event or state of facts which
occurrence or failure would, or would be likely to:

        | (a)   |  

cause any of the representations or warranties of such  Party contained
herein to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect  between the date
hereof and the Effective Date; 

      |   | 
      | (b)   |  

result in the failure to comply with or satisfy any  covenant or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by such Party  hereto prior to the Effective
Date; or 

      |   | 
      | (c)   |  

result in the failure to satisfy any of the conditions  precedent in favour
of the other Party hereto contained in Section 5.1,  5.2 and 5.3, as the case
may be. 

 

Subject as herein provided, a Party may elect not to complete the
transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the conditions
precedent contained in Sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 in favour of such Party, or
exercise any termination right arising therefrom, if forthwith, and in any
event prior to the Effective Date, such Party has delivered a written notice
to the other specifying in reasonable detail all breaches of covenants,
representations and warranties or other matters which the Party delivering
such notice is asserting as the basis for the non-fulfillment of the
applicable condition precedent or the exercise of the termination right, as
the case may be. If any such notice is delivered and the Party receiving such
notice is proceeding diligently to cure such matter, if such matter is
susceptible to being cured, the Party delivering such notice may not
terminate this Agreement until the earlier of the Outside Date and the
expiration of a period of ten Business Days from such notice. If such notice
has been delivered prior to the date of the Silvermex Meeting, such meeting
shall be postponed until the expiry of such period. If such notice has been
delivered prior to the making of the application for the Final Order,
such application shall be postponed until the expiry of such period. For
greater certainty, in the event that such matter is cured within the time
period referred to herein, this Agreement may not be terminated as a result
of such matter.

 

5.5  Satisfaction of Conditions. The conditions precedent set out in
Sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 shall be conclusively deemed to have been
satisfied, waived or released when, with the approval of First Majestic and
Silvermex, the Arrangement is completed. \- 62-

 

ARTICLE 6 
AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

 

6.1  Amendment. This Agreement may, at any time and from time to
time before or after the holding of the Silvermex Meeting but not later than

not invalidate any required approval of the Silvermex Securityholders to the

Governmental Entity shall have issued any injunction,  order, decree or
ruling enjoining First Majestic or Silvermex from  consummating the

decree or ruling shall become final and  non-appealable; 

      |   |   |   | 
      |   |   | (B)   |  

subject to Section 5.4, the other Party is in default of  a covenant or
obligation hereunder, provided the Party seeking to  terminate this Agreement
is not then in breach of this Agreement so as to  cause any condition in
favour of both Parties or in favour of the other  Party not to be satisfied;
or 

      |   |   |   | 
      |   |   | (C)   |  

subject to Section 5.4, any representation or warranty of  the other Party
under this Agreement is untrue or incorrect and shall have  become untrue or
incorrect such that the condition contained in Section  5.2(b) or 5.3(b), as
applicable, would be incapable of satisfaction,  provided that the Party
seeking to terminate this Agreement is not then in  breach of this Agreement
so as to cause any condition in favour of both  Parties or in favour of the
other Party not to be satisfied;

Order; or \- 63-

        | (C)   |  

the Silvermex Board shall have failed to reaffirm its  recommendation of the
Arrangement and this Agreement as promptly as  practicable after receipt of
any reasonable request from First Majestic to  do so and in any event within

        | (iv)   |

pursuant to Section 6.3(a); or 

      |   | 
      | (v)   |  

be terminated by either Silvermex or First Majestic if  the Arrangement shall
not have been approved by the Silvermex  Securityholders on or before the
Meeting Deadline in the manner provided  for in Article 2 and in the Interim
Order. 

 
        | (b)   |

occur on or prior to the Outside Date, then this  Agreement shall terminate
without further action by either Party. 

      |   | 
      | (c)   |  

If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the  foregoing provisions
of this Section 6.2, no Party shall have any further  liability to perform
its obligations hereunder, except as provided for in  Section 6.3, which
shall survive the termination of this Agreement or as  otherwise contemplated
hereby, and provided that, subject to Section 6.5,  neither the termination
of this Agreement nor anything contained in this  Section 6.2(c) shall
relieve any Party from any liability for any breach  by it of this Agreement,
including from any inaccuracy in its  representations and warranties and any
non-performance by it of its  covenants made herein.

Days after consummation of an Acquisition  Proposal, 

 
        | (b)   |  

For greater certainty, Silvermex shall not be obligated  to make more than
one payment pursuant to Section 6.3(a). 

 

6.4  Liquidated Damages. Silvermex acknowledges that the damages set
forth in this Article 6 are a genuine pre-estimate of the damages First
Majestic will suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise to those
damages and are not penalties. Silvermex irrevocably waives any right it may
have to raise as a defence in any proceedings that any such damages are
excessive, punitive or abusive.

 

6.5  Remedies. Subject to Section 6.6, the Parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that an award of money damages would be inadequate for
any breach of this Agreement by any Party or its representatives and any such
breach would cause the non-breaching Party irreparable harm. Accordingly, the
Parties hereto agree that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of
this Agreement by one of the Parties, the non-breaching Party will also be
entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to
equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance. Such
remedies will not be the exclusive remedies for any breach of this Agreement
but will be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to
the Parties.

 

6.6  Effect of Termination Payment. For greater certainty, the
Parties agree that the payment of the amount pursuant to Section 6.3 is the
sole monetary remedy as a result of the occurrence of any of the events
referred to in Section 6.3. Subject to the immediately preceding sentence,
nothing in this Agreement shall preclude a Party from seeking damages in
respect of losses incurred or suffered by such Party as a result of any
breach of this Agreement by the other Party, seeking injunctive relief to
restrain any breach or threatened breach of the covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement or otherwise, or
seeking specific performance of any of such covenants or agreements, without
the necessity of posting bond or security in connection therewith. \- 65-

at, and be binding at and after, the Effective Time on:

        | (a)   |  

Silvermex; 

      |   | 
      | (b)   |  

the Silvermex Securityholders; and 

      |   | 
      | (c)   |  

First Majestic. \- 5-

 

2.3  Arrangement. Commencing at the Effective Time, the following
shall occur and shall be deemed to occur in the following order without any
further act or formality:

        | (a)   |  

the Shareholder Rights Plan shall be cancelled and shall  have no further
force or effect and each of the rights thereunder shall be  deemed to be
cancelled for no consideration; 

      |   |   | 
      | (b)   |  

five minutes after the steps contemplated in Section  2.3(a), each
outstanding Silvermex Warrant held by a Silvermex  Warrantholder who has
delivered an Election Notice prior to the date which  is at least two
business days before the Effective Date will be exchanged  by the holder
thereof, without any further act or formality and free and  clear of all
liens, claims and encumbrances, for a warrant (a  "Replacement Warrant") to
purchase a number of First Majestic  Shares equal to the product of the
Exchange Ratio multiplied by the number  of Silvermex Shares issuable on
exercise of such Silvermex Warrant for an  exercise price per First Majestic
Share equal to the Adjusted Exercise  Price rounded up to the nearest whole
cent (provided that, if the  foregoing calculation results in a Replacement
Warrant being exercisable  for a fraction of a First Majestic Share, then the
number of First  Majestic Shares subject to such Replacement Warrant shall be
rounded down  to the next whole number of First Majestic Shares), and such
Silvermex  Warrants shall thereupon be cancelled. The term of expiry,
conditions to  and manner of exercise and other terms and conditions of each
of the  Replacement Warrants shall be the same as the terms and conditions of
the  Silvermex Warrant for which they are exchanged and any certificate 
previously evidencing the Silvermex Warrant shall thereafter evidence and  be
deemed to evidence such Replacement Warrant. The Replacement Warrants  will
not be exercisable by or on behalf of a U.S. Person unless an  exemption from

law is available;

subject (whether by contract, the conditions of  a grant, or applicable law):

      |   | (i)   |  

the outstanding Silvermex Warrants held by a Silvermex  Warrantholder who has
not delivered an Election Notice at least two  business days prior to the
Effective Date will, without any further action  by or on behalf of such
Silvermex Warrantholder, be deemed to be exercised  for the Warrant
Consideration, if any, and the Silvermex Shares issuable  in connection
therewith will be deemed to be issued to such Silvermex  Warrantholder as
fully paid and non-assessable common shares in the  authorized share
structure of Silvermex provided that no share  certificates shall be issued
with respect to such shares; and 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (ii)   |  

with respect to each Silvermex Warrant, the holder  thereof will cease to be
the holder of such Silvermex Warrant, will cease  to have any rights as a
holder in respect of such Silvermex Warrant, such  holders name will be
removed from the register of Silvermex Warrants, and  all agreements, grants
and other similar instruments relating thereto will  be cancelled; 

      |   |   |     |   | (d)   |

      |   |   | 
      |   | (i)   |

issued to such Silvermex Optionholder as fully paid and  non-assessable
common shares in the authorized share structure of  Silvermex provided that

      |   | 
      | (f)   |

      | (g)   |

with Section 2.3(e) or Section  2.3(f): 

 
        | (i)   |

from the register of Silvermex Shareholders as of  the Effective Time; 

      |   | 
      | (ii)   |  

the registered holder thereof shall be deemed to have  executed and delivered

required to transfer and assign such Silvermex  Share; and 

      |   | 
      | (iii)   |

2.4   **Post-Effective Time Procedures.**

        | (a)   |  

Following receipt of the Final Order and prior to the  Effective Date, First
Majestic shall deliver or arrange to be delivered to  the Depositary the
Share Consideration, including certificates  representing the First Majestic
Shares required to be issued to the  Silvermex Shareholders in accordance
with Section 2.3 hereof, which  certificates shall be held by the Depositary
as agent and nominee for such  former Silvermex Shareholders for distribution
to such former Silvermex  Shareholders in accordance with the provisions of
Article 4  hereof. 

      |   | 
      | (b)   |  

Subject to the provisions of Article 4 hereof, and upon  return of a properly
completed Letter of Transmittal by a registered former Silvermex  Shareholder
together with certificates, if any, which, immediately prior  to the
Effective Date, represented Silvermex Shares and such other  documents as the
Depositary may require, former Silvermex Shareholders  shall be entitled to
receive delivery of the certificates representing the  First Majestic Shares
and cheques representing the cash to which they are  entitled pursuant to
Section 2.3(f). Notwithstanding the foregoing,  holders of Silvermex Options
and Silvermex Warrants who received Silvermex  Shares pursuant to Section
2.3(c) or Section 2.3(d) shall not receive  certificates representing such
Silvermex Shares and, accordingly, shall  not be required to deliver any such
certificates pursuant to this Section  2.4(b); \- 7-

       | (c)   |  

An Eligible Holder whose Silvermex Shares are exchanged  for the Share
Consideration pursuant to the Arrangement shall be entitled  to make an
income tax election, pursuant to section 85 of the ITA (and any  analogous
provision of provincial income tax law) (a "Section 85  Election") with
respect to the exchange by providing the necessary  information in accordance
with the procedures set out in the tax  instruction letter on or before the
date 90 days after the Effective Date.  Neither Silvermex, First Majestic nor
any successor corporation shall be  responsible for the proper completion of
any election form nor, except for  the obligation to sign and return duly
completed election forms which are  received within 90 days of the Effective
Date, for any taxes, interest or  penalties resulting from the failure of an
Eligible Holder to properly  complete or file such election forms in the form
and manner and within the  time prescribed by the ITA (or any applicable
provincial legislation). In  its sole discretion, First Majestic or any
successor corporation may  choose to sign and return an election form
received by it more than 90  days following the Effective Date, but will have
no obligation to do  so. 

      |   |   | 
      | (d)   |  

Upon receipt of a Letter of Transmittal in which an  Eligible Holder has
indicated that such holder wishes to receive a tax  instruction letter, First
Majestic will promptly deliver a tax instruction  letter to such holder. The
tax instruction letter will provide general  instructions on how to make the
Section 85 Election with First Majestic in  order to obtain a full or partial
tax deferred rollover for Canadian  income tax purposes in respect of the
sale of the Eligible Holders  Silvermex Shares to First Majestic. 

 

2.5  Entitlement to Cash Consideration. In any case where the
aggregate cash consideration payable to a particular Silvermex Shareholder
under this Arrangement would, but for this provision, include a fraction of a
cent, the consideration payable shall be rounded down to the nearest whole
cent.

 

2.6  No Fractional First Majestic Shares. In no event shall any
holder of Silvermex Shares be entitled to a fractional First Majestic Share.
Where the aggregate number of First Majestic Shares to be issued to a former
Silvermex Shareholder as consideration under this Arrangement would result in
a fraction of a First Majestic Share being issuable, the number of First
Majestic Shares to be received by such Silvermex Shareholder shall be rounded
down to the nearest whole First Majestic Share.

 

2.7  Adjustments to the Exchange Ratio. The Exchange Ratio shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into First Majestic Shares, other than stock dividends paid in lieu of
ordinary course dividends), consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization
or other like change with respect to First Majestic Shares occurring after
the date of the Arrangement Agreement and prior to the Effective Time. \- 8-

("Dissent Rights") with respect to such shares  pursuant to and in the manner
set forth in Section 237 to 247 of the  Business Corporations Act and this

further that Dissenting  Shareholders who: 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (i)   |  

are ultimately entitled to be paid fair value for their  Silvermex Shares
shall be deemed to have transferred such Silvermex Shares  to First Majestic
as of the Effective Time without any further act or  formality and free and
clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances, in  consideration for the
payment by First Majestic of the fair value thereof,  in cash; or 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (ii)   |  

are ultimately not entitled, for any reason, to be paid  fair value for their
Silvermex Shares shall be deemed to have participated  in the Arrangement on
the same basis as a non-dissenting holder of  Silvermex Shares and shall
receive Share Consideration on the basis  determined in accordance with
Section 2.3(f); 

      |   |   | 
      |   |   |  

but in no case shall First Majestic, Silvermex or any  other Person be
required to recognize such Persons as holders of Silvermex  Shares after the
Effective Time, and the names of such Persons shall be  deleted from the
registers of holders of Silvermex Shares at the Effective  Time. 

      |   |   |     |   | (b)   |  

In addition to any other restrictions set forth in the  Business Corporations
Act, none of the following shall be entitled to  exercise Dissent Rights: 

      |   |   |

Silvermex Optionholders; 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (ii)   |  

Silvermex Warrantholders; and 

      |   |   | 
      |   | (iii)   |  

Silvermex Shareholders who vote in favour of the  Arrangement Resolution. 

 

ARTICLE 4 
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES AND DELIVERY OF CASH

  **4.1 **   **Delivery of First Majestic Shares and Cash.**

        | (a)   |  

Upon surrender to the Depository for cancellation of a  certificate that
immediately before the Effective Time represented one or  more outstanding
Silvermex Shares that were exchanged for the Share  Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.3(f) hereof together with such  other documents and
instruments as would have been required to effect  the transfer of the
Silvermex Shares formerly represented by  such certificate under the Business
Corporations Act and the articles of  Silvermex and such additional documents
and instruments as the Depository  may reasonably require, the holder of such
surrendered certificate shall  be entitled to receive in exchange therefor,
and the Depository shall  deliver to such holder following the Effective
Time, a certificate  representing the First Majestic Shares and a cheque
representing the cash  that such holder is entitled to receive in accordance
with Section 2.3(f)  hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, holders of
Silvermex Options and  Silvermex Warrants who received Silvermex Shares
pursuant to Section  2.3(c) or Section 2.3(d) shall not receive certificates
representing such  Silvermex Shares and, accordingly, shall not be required
to deliver any  such certificates. \- 9-

       | (b)   |  

After the Effective Time and until surrendered for  cancellation as
contemplated by Section 4.1(a) hereof, each certificate  that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented one or more  Silvermex Shares shall
be deemed at all times to represent only the right  to receive in exchange
therefor the Share Consideration that the holder of  such certificate is
entitled to receive in accordance with Section 2.3(f)  hereof. 

 

4.2  Distributions with Respect to Unsurrendered Certificates. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to First Majestic Shares with a record date after the Effective
Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Silvermex
Shares that were exchanged pursuant to Section 2.3 unless and until the
holder of record of such certificate shall surrender such certificate in
accordance with Section 4.1. Subject to applicable law, at the time of such
surrender of any such certificate (or in the case of clause (ii) below, at
the appropriate payment date), there shall be paid to the holder of record of
the certificates formerly representing whole Silvermex Shares, without
interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole
First Majestic Share and (ii) on the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable
with respect to such whole First Majestic Share.

 

4.3  Lost Certificates. In the event any certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented one or more outstanding
Silvermex Shares that were exchanged pursuant to Section 2.3(f) shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Depositary will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, one or more certificates representing one or more First Majestic
Shares (and any dividends or distributions with respect thereto) deliverable
in accordance with such holders Letter of Transmittal. When authorizing such
payment in exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Person
to whom certificates representing First Majestic Shares are to be issued
shall, as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, give a bond
satisfactory to First Majestic and its transfer agent in such sum as First
Majestic may direct or otherwise indemnify First Majestic in a manner
satisfactory to First Majestic against any claim that may be made against
First Majestic with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

 

4.4  Extinction of Rights. Any certificate which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented outstanding Silvermex Shares that were
exchanged pursuant to Section 2.3(f) and not deposited, with all other
instruments required by Section 4.1 on or prior to the third anniversary of
the Effective Date shall cease to represent a claim or interest of any kind
or nature as a shareholder of First Majestic. On such date, the First
Majestic Shares to which the former registered holder of the certificate
referred to in the preceding sentence was ultimately entitled shall be deemed
to have been surrendered to First Majestic together with all entitlements to
dividends, distributions and interest thereon held for such former registered
holder. None of First Majestic, Silvermex or the Depositary shall be liable
to any person in respect of any First Majestic Shares (or dividends,
distributions and interest in respect thereof) delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. \- 10-

 

4.5  Withholding and Sale Rights. Each of First Majestic and the
Depositary shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from (i) any First
Majestic Shares or other consideration otherwise issuable or payable pursuant
to this Plan of Arrangement to any holder of Silvermex Shares, or (ii) any
dividend or consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Silvermex Shares
or First Majestic Shares such amounts as First Majestic or the Depositary,
respectively, is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such
issuance or payment, as the case may be, under the ITA, the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code or any provision of provincial, state, local or foreign tax law,
in each case as amended. To the extent that the amount so required to be
deducted or withheld from the First Majestic Shares, dividends or
consideration otherwise issuable or payable to a holder exceeds the cash
portion of the consideration otherwise payable to such holder, each of First
Majestic and the Depositary is hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose
of, at such times and at such prices as it determines, in its sole
discretion, such portion of the First Majestic Shares otherwise issuable or
payable to such holder as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to First
Majestic or the Depositary, as the case may be, to enable it to comply with
such deduction or withholding requirement, and shall notify the
holder thereof and remit to such holder any unapplied balance of the net
proceeds of such sale or disposition (after deducting applicable sale
commissions and any other reasonable expenses relating thereto) in lieu of
the First Majestic Shares or other consideration so sold or disposed of. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld or First Majestic Shares or other
consideration are so sold or disposed of, such withheld amounts, or shares or
other consideration so sold or disposed of, shall be treated for all purposes
as having been paid to the holder of the shares in respect of which such
deduction, withholding, sale or disposition was made, provided that such
withheld amounts, or the net proceeds of such sale or disposition, as the
case may be, are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority.
Neither of First Majestic or the Depositary shall be obligated to seek or
obtain a minimum price for any of the First Majestic Shares or
other consideration sold or disposed of by it hereunder, nor shall any of
them be liable for any loss arising out of any such sale or disposition.

 

4.6  Paramountcy. From and after the Effective Time:

        | (a)   |  

this Plan of Arrangement shall take precedence and  priority over any and all
Silvermex Shares, Silvermex Options and  Silvermex Warrants issued prior to
the Effective Time; and 

      |   | 
      | (b)   |  

the rights and obligations of the holders of Silvermex  Shares, Silvermex

Arrangement.
