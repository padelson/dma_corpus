 **ARTICLE III 
 CONSIDERATION; ELECTION AND EXCHANGE PROCEDURES AND 
 ALLOCATIONS**

  

 3.01 _Conversion of Stock in Merger_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of MB or First SecurityFed:

  

 (a) _MB Common Stock_. The shares of MB Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding.

  

 (b) _First SecurityFed Common Stock_. Subject to Sections 3.02, 3.03 and 3.04, the shares of First SecurityFed Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be outstanding and shall be converted into either:

  

 (i) the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $35.25 per share (the "Cash Distribution"), or

  

 (ii) the right to receive a number of shares of MB Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the number of shares of First SecurityFed Common Stock to be converted ("Stock Distribution"); and any shares of Treasury Stock shall be cancelled. The aggregate of the Cash Distributions and the Stock Distributions payable or issuable pursuant to the Merger (or the aggregate Cash Distributions payable pursuant to the Cash-Out Merger, if applicable) is sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Merger Consideration").

  

 3.02 _Election and Exchange Procedures and Allocations Relating to Merger_.

  

 (a) _Election Form and Election Options_. Within 5 business days after the date of the mailing of the Proxy Statement and at least 30 days prior to the anticipated Effective Date, MB shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail or make available to each holder of record of First SecurityFed Common Stock as of the record date of the First SecurityFed Meeting (i) an election form in such form as the Parties shall mutually agree (the "Election Form") and (ii) transmittal materials (the "Transmittal Materials") for the surrender to the Exchange Agent of certificates representing shares of First SecurityFed Common Stock (the "First SecurityFed Share Certificates") with the Election Form. The Election Form shall permit the holder of First SecurityFed Common Stock (or in the case of nominee recordholders, the beneficial owners through proper instructions and documentation) to elect to receive (x) the Cash Distribution for all or a portion of the holder\'s shares of First SecurityFed Common Stock (the "Cash Election Shares") or (y) the Stock Distribution for all or a portion of the holders shares of First SecurityFed Common Stock (the "Stock Election Shares"). The holder of any First SecurityFed Share Certificates, representing shares acquired through the exercise of an "incentive stock option" that have been held for less than 1 year as of the Election Deadline (the "ISO Certificates"), may in his Election Form designate his ISO Certificates for priority allocation of any Stock Distribution to which such holder is entitled to receive. MB and the Exchange Agent shall use

   13 Next Page  
  
     reasonable best efforts to honor such priority allocation to the
extent that the holder of such ISO Certificates is entitled to the Stock
Distribution. MB shall cause the Exchange Agent to use commercially
reasonable efforts to make the Election Form and Transmittal Materials
available to all Persons who become recordholders of First SecurityFed Common
Stock subsequent to the record date of the First SecurityFed Meeting and
prior to the second business day before the Election Deadline. The "Election
Deadline" means 5:00 p.m., Central Time, on the fifth business day next
preceding the anticipated Effective Date or 5:00 p.m., Central Time, on such
other date as the Parties shall agree (which date shall be specified as a
date certain in the Election Form). An Election Form may be revoked or
changed by the Person submitting such Election Form or any other Person to
whom the subject shares are subsequently transferred by written notice by
such Person to the Exchange Agent at or prior to the Election Deadline. All
Election Forms will be deemed to be revoked if the Exchange Agent is notified
in writing by either MB or First SecurityFed that this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with its terms, in which case the Exchange Agent
shall return the First SecurityFed Share Certificates possessed by it to their
respective holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Election Form shall be
provided with respect to Cash Election Designated ESOP Shares (as such shares
shall be automatically converted to the right to receive the Cash
Distribution) or Unvested RRP Shares (as such shares shall be automatically
converted to the right to receive the Stock Distribution). Nevertheless,
Transmittal Materials shall be provided with respect to such shares so that
First SecurityFed Share Certificates representing Cash Election Designated
ESOP Shares and Unvested RRP Shares may be surrendered to the Exchange Agent
by the Election Deadline. ****

  

 (b) _Non-Election Shares_. Any holder of First SecurityFed Common Stock who does not submit a properly completed and signed Election Form (accompanied by such holder\'s First SecurityFed Share Certificates surrendered in accordance with the Transmittal Materials) that is received by the Exchange Agent at or prior to the Election Deadline, and any holder who has failed to perfect or has effectively withdrawn or lost the right to payment for Dissenting Shares, will be deemed to hold "Non-Election Shares" for the purposes of Section 3.02. MB will have the discretion, which it may delegate in whole or in part to the Exchange Agent, to determine whether Election Forms are in proper form and to disregard immaterial defects in Election Forms. If MB or the Exchange Agent determines that any purported election for Cash Election Shares or Stock Election Shares was not properly made, such purported election will be deemed to be of no force and effect and the holder making such election will be deemed to have Non-Election Shares for the purposes of Section 3.02. The decision of MB or the Exchange Agent as to such matters will be conclusive and binding. Neither MB nor the Exchange Agent will be under any obligation to notify any holder of any defect in an Election Form submitted to the Exchange Agent.

  

 (c) _Allocations_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Date, MB will cause the Exchange Agent to allocate among the holders of First SecurityFed Common Stock the rights to receive the Cash Distribution or the Stock Distribution as follows:

  

 (i) _Excess Cash Election Shares_. If the number of Cash Election Shares, when aggregated with the Cash Election Designated ESOP Shares and Dissenting Shares, exceeds the Calculated Cash Election Number, then:\t

 (B) All Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Distribution;

  

 (C) Cash Election Designated ESOP Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Distribution;

  

 (D) Dissenting Shares shall be deemed converted into the right to receive the Cash Distribution; and

  

 (E) The Exchange Agent shall convert a sufficient number of Cash Election Shares (the "Reallocated Stock Shares") on a pro rata basis (based upon the number of Cash Election Shares owned by each holder, as compared with the total number of Cash Election Shares owned by all of such holders) such that the remaining Cash Election Shares (after reduction for Reallocated Stock Shares), when aggregated with the Cash Election Designated ESOP Shares and Dissenting Shares, equals the Calculated Cash Election Number; and the Cash Election Shares which are not Reallocated Stock Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Distribution and the Reallocated Stock Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Distribution.

  

 (ii) _Excess Stock Election Shares_. If the number of Stock Election Shares, when aggregated with the Unvested RRP Shares, exceeds the Calculated Stock Election Number, then:

  

 (A) All Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Distribution;

  

 (B) All Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Distribution; 

  

 (C) Cash Election Designated ESOP Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Distribution;

  

 (D) Dissenting Shares shall be deemed converted into the right to receive the Cash Distribution;

  

 (E) All Unvested RRP Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Distribution; and

  

 (F) The Exchange Agent shall convert a sufficient number of Stock Election Shares (the "Reallocated Cash Shares") on a pro rata basis (based upon the number of Stock Election Shares owned by each holder, as compared with the total number of Stock Election Shares owned by all of such holders) such that the remaining Stock Election Shares (after reduction for Reallocated Cash Shares), when aggregated with the Unvested RRP Shares, equals the Calculated Stock Election Number; and the Stock Election Shares which are not Reallocated Cash Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Distribution and the Reallocated Cash Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Distribution.

  15 Next Page  
  
   

 (iii) _No Excess_. If neither clauses (i) or (ii) above is applicable, all Cash Election Shares will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Distribution, all Stock Election Shares will be converted into the right to receive the Stock Distribution, and the Non-Election Shares will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Distribution and/or the Stock Distribution as follows:

  

 (A) Non-Election Shares shall first be converted to a right to receive the Cash Distribution until the aggregate of the Non-Election Shares, when aggregated with the Cash Election Shares, Cash Election Designated ESOP Shares and Dissenting Shares, equals the Calculated Cash Election Number; and

  

 (B) Any excess Non-Election Shares shall then be converted to a right to receive the Stock Distribution.

  

 (C) All allocations pursuant to this clause (iii) shall be made on a pro rata basis, if applicable.

  

 (iv) _Pro Rata Computations_. The pro rata computations performed by the Exchange Agent pursuant to this subsection (c) shall be binding and conclusive as to the allocation of the Merger Consideration among the holders of First SecurityFed Common Stock.

  

 3.03 _Cash-Out Merger_. In the Cash-Out Merger, the sole consideration to be received for each issued and outstanding share of First SecurityFed Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) shall be the Cash Distribution. In the event of the Cash-Out Merger, Sections 3.01, 3.02 and 3.05 shall not be applicable.

  

 3.04 _Dissenting Shares_. Each outstanding share of First SecurityFed Common Stock the holder of which has perfected his right to dissent under Section 262 of the DGCL and has not effectively withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective Time (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the Cash Distribution and/or Stock Distribution in the Merger pursuant to Sections 3.01 and 3.02 or the Cash Distribution in the Cash-Out Merger pursuant to Sections 2.05 and 3.03, and the holder thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by applicable law. First SecurityFed shall give MB prompt notice upon receipt by First SecurityFed of any such demands for payment of the fair value of such shares of First SecurityFed Common Stock and of withdrawals of such notice and any other instruments provided pursuant to applicable law (any stockholder duly making such demand being hereinafter called a "Dissenting Stockholder"). First SecurityFed shall not, except with the prior written consent of MB, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment, or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or the taking of any other action by such Dissenting Stockholder as may be necessary to perfect appraisal rights under applicable law. Any payments made with respect to Dissenting Shares shall be made by the Surviving Corporation. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) his right to such payment, such holder\'s shares of First SecurityFed Common Stock shall be converted into a right to receive the Cash Distribution and/or Stock Distribution in the Merger pursuant to Sections 3.01 and 3.02 or the Cash Distribution in the Cash-Out Merger pursuant to Sections 2.05 and 3.03.

  16 Next Page  
  
   

 3.05 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no fractional shares of MB Common Stock and no certificates or scrip therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the Merger; instead, MB shall pay to each holder of First SecurityFed Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of MB Common Stock (after taking into account all First SecurityFed Share Certificates for which the holder is entitled to receive the Stock Distribution) an amount in cash determined by multiplying such fraction by the Average Closing Price.

  

 3.06 _Rights as First SecurityFed Stockholders; Stock Transfers_. At the Effective Time, holders of First SecurityFed Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, stockholders of First SecurityFed, other than to receive any dividend or other distribution with respect to such First SecurityFed Common Stock permitted under this Agreement with a record date occurring prior to the Effective Date and the consideration to be received in the Merger or the Cash-Out Merger, whichever is applicable, or in the case of a Dissenting Stockholders the right to receive the fair value of his Dissenting Shares as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL. After the Election Deadline, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of First SecurityFed or the Surviving Corporation of shares of First SecurityFed Common Stock, other than Non-Election Shares which may be transferred at any time prior to the Effective Date.

  

 3.07 _Delivery of Merger Consideration to Exchange Agent; Payment of Merger Consideration Relating to Surrendered First SecurityFed Share Certificates_. At or prior to the Effective Time, MB shall deliver to the Exchange Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration (less the Cash Distribution applicable to Dissenting Shares) which shall consist (a) in the case the consummation of the Merger, of (i) certificates representing the Fixed Number of MB Shares and (ii) cash in an amount equal to Calculated Cash Election Number multiplied by $35.25 less the Cash Distribution applicable to Dissenting Shares; or (b) in the case the Cash-Out Merger is consummated, of the Cash Distributions less the Cash Distribution applicable to Dissenting Shares (in either case, collectively, the "Exchange Fund"). On an "as required" basis, MB shall promptly and timely tender to the Exchange Agent additional cash funds required for the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares in the Merger, which amounts when paid shall constitute a part of the Exchange Fund. In the event the Merger is consummated, then as soon as practicable after the Exchange Agent has made the allocations set forth in Section 3.02(c), but not later than the 5th business day after the Effective Date, the Exchange Agent shall tender to each stockholder of First SecurityFed, who surrendered First SecurityFed Share Certificates to the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline in accordance with the Transmittal Materials, the Cash Distribution/Stock Distribution applicable to the shares of First SecurityFed Common Stock evidenced by such First SecurityFed Share Certificates (as determined in accordance with Section 3.02) plus cash in lieu of any fractional share interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Stock Distribution shall be paid to a First SecurityFed Affiliate until MB has received a written agreement from such Person as contemplated by Section 7.07(b). In the event the Cash-Out Merger is consummated, then as soon as practicable after the Effective Date, but not later than 3 business days thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall tender to each stockholder of First SecurityFed, who surrendered First SecurityFed Share Certificates to the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline in accordance with the Transmittal Materials, the Cash Distribution applicable to the shares of First SecurityFed Common Stock evidenced by such First SecurityFed Share Certificates..

Upon proper delivery to the Exchange Agent of First SecurityFed Share Certificates representing shares of First SecurityFed Common Stock (or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to MB and the Exchange Agent, if any of such certificates are lost, stolen or destroyed) owned by such stockholder, the Exchange Agent shall promptly deliver to such stockholder the Stock Distribution and/or Cash Distribution applicable thereto, and if appropriate, a check for any cash in lieu of a fractional share interest. No interest will be paid with respect to any of the foregoing. First SecurityFed Share Certificates surrendered for exchange by any Person identified by First SecurityFed pursuant to Section 7.07 as a First SecurityFed Affiliate shall not be exchanged for the Stock Distribution until MB has received a written agreement from such Person as specified in Section 7.07. MB and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of First SecurityFed to establish the identity of those Persons entitled to receive the consideration pursuant to this Article III, which books shall be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of stock represented by any First SecurityFed Share Certificate, MB or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deposit any consideration in respect thereof in escrow with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto.

  

 (b) _Escheat_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Exchange Agent or any Party shall be liable to any former holder of First SecurityFed Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

  18 Next Page  
  
   

 (c) _Restrictions on the Payment of Dividends_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to MB Common Stock to be issued in the Merger with a record date occurring after the Effective Time shall be paid with respect to any unsurrendered or improperly surrendered First SecurityFed Share Certificate until the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Stock Distribution in exchange therefor in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 3.08. After becoming so entitled in accordance with this Section 3.08, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofor had become payable with respect to shares of MB Common Stock such holder had the right to receive upon the proper surrender of the applicable First SecurityFed Share Certificate. A registered holder of unsurrendered or improperly surrendered First SecurityFed Share Certificates shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of MB stockholders with a record date after the Effective Time the number of whole shares of MB Common Stock that would be issued to such holder in exchange for such First SecurityFed Share Certificates, regardless of whether such holder has exchanged such First SecurityFed Share Certificates.

  

 (d) _Return of Exchange Fund to MB_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of First SecurityFed for six months after the Effective Date shall be delivered to MB. Any stockholder of First SecurityFed who has not theretofor complied with this Section 3.08 shall thereafter look only to MB for payment of the Stock Distribution and/or Cash Distribution, whichever is applicable, cash in lieu of any fractional share interest and unpaid dividends and distributions on MB Common Stock deliverable with respect to the Stock Distribution, in each case, without any interest thereon.

 (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, MB or one of its Subsidiaries shall be substituted for First SecurityFed or a First SecurityFed Subsidiary under the First SecurityFed Employee Plans as Previously Disclosed and in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and MB or one of its Subsidiaries shall assume and be vested with all of the powers, rights, duties, obligations and liabilities previously vested in First SecurityFed or the applicable First SecurityFed Subsidiary with respect to each such First SecurityFed Employee Plan.

  52 Next Page  
  
   

whichever is applicable, which is generally available to its full time
employees on a uniform and non-discriminatory basis, provided that with
respect to such plans maintained by MB or an MB Subsidiary, whichever is
applicable, Continuing Employees shall be given credit for their past service
with First SecurityFed or a First SecurityFed Subsidiary in determining
eligibility for participation and vesting in benefits thereunder, and only
with respect to severance and vacation plans, accrual of benefits. Continuing
Employees shall not be subject to any waiting periods under the group health
plan of MB or any applicable MB Subsidiary to the extent that such periods
are longer than the periods imposed under the applicable First SecurityFed
group health plan and MB shall use its reasonable efforts to cause its health
insurance carrier to cover pre-existing conditions that were previously
covered for a Continuing Employee under the First SecurityFed health plan. To
the extent that the initial period of coverage for Continuing Employees under
any plan of MB or a MB Subsidiary, whichever is applicable, that is an
"employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA is not a
full 12-month period of coverage, Continuing Employees shall be given credit
under the applicable welfare plan for any deductibles and co-insurance
payments made by such Continuing Employees under the corresponding First
SecurityFed welfare plan during the balance of such 12-month period of
coverage. Nothing contained herein shall obligate MB or any MB Subsidiary to
provide or cause to be provided any benefits duplicative to those provided
under any benefit or welfare plan continued pursuant to Section 7.15(a),
including extending participation in any plan which is a qualified plan
relative to any period of time with respect to which allocations are made to
Continuing Employees under any qualified plan maintained or sponsored by
First SecurityFed or a First SecurityFed Subsidiary. Nothing herein shall
alter the power of MB or any MB Subsidiary to amend or terminate any benefit
or welfare plans of MB, First SecurityFed or their respective Subsidiaries.
Moreover, this subsection 7.15(c) shall not confer upon any
Continuing Employee any rights or remedies hereunder and shall not constitute
a contract of employment or create any rights, to be retained or otherwise,

 7.20 _First SecurityFed Stock Options_. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger or the Cash-Out Merger, whichever is applicable, and without any action on the part of any holder of a First SecurityFed Stock Option, each First SecurityFed Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into and become an option to purchase MB Common Stock (each an "Assumed Option") on the same terms and conditions as are in effect with respect to the First SecurityFed Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (a) each such Assumed Option may be exercised solely for shares of MB Common Stock, (b) the number of shares of MB Common Stock subject to such Assumed Option will be equal to the number of shares of First SecurityFed Common Stock subject to such First SecurityFed Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, the product being rounded, if necessary, up or down to the nearest whole share, and (c) the per share exercise price under each such Assumed Option will be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price of the First SecurityFed Stock Option by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding up or down to the nearest cent. It is intended that the foregoing assumption shall be undertaken consistent with and in a manner that will not constitute a "modification" under Section 424 of the Code as to any First SecurityFed Stock Option which is an "incentive stock option". As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, MB shall file an appropriate registration statement with respect to the shares of MB Common Stock subject to Assumed Options and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such options remain outstanding.

 7.22 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of First SecurityFed and MB shall give prompt written notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that (a) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to it, or (b) has caused or constituted, or could reasonably cause or constitute, a breach of (i) any of its representations or warranties as of the date of this Agreement, or (ii) any of its covenants or agreements contained herein; provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties under this Agreement; and provided further that a failure to comply with this Section 7.22 shall not constitute a failure to satisfy any condition set forth in Article VIII unless the underlying untruth, inaccuracy, failure to comply or satisfy, or change or event would independently result in a failure to satisfy a condition set forth in Article VIII.

First SecurityFed agrees to promptly furnish MB with all requisite information necessary for MB to take the actions contemplated by this Section 7.25.

  

 7.26 _Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Branch_. MB does not have any present intention to close or relocate the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania branch office of First Security Federal Savings Bank.
