later than the Effective Time) (the "Election Deadline"). An Election Form
shall be deemed properly completed by a holder of Hudson United Common Stock
only if accompanied by one or more Certificates (or customary affidavits and
indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such Certificates or the
guaranteed delivery of such Certificates) representing all shares of Hudson
United Common Stock, held by such holder, or by an appropriate guarantee of
delivery of such Certificates from a member of any registered national
securities exchange or of the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc. or by a commercial bank or trust company in the United States as set

United Cash Election Shares is greater than the quotient of (x)
$941,790,000 (the "Aggregate Cash Consideration") divided by (y) the Cash
Election Price (such quotient, the "Cash Conversion Shares"), then:

 (2) each Hudson United Cash Election Share will be converted into the right to receive TD Banknorth Common Stock and cash in the following manner:    

 (A) a proration factor (the "Cash Proration Factor") shall be determined by dividing (x) the Aggregate Cash Consideration by (y) the product of the number of Hudson United Cash Election Shares and the Cash Election Price;    

 (B) the number of Hudson United Cash Election Shares held by each holder of shares of Hudson United Common Stock that will be converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the terms of Section 3.1(a)(iv) shall be determined by multiplying the Cash Proration Factor by the number of Hudson United Cash Election Shares held by such holder; and    ##### 

  

   

 (C) all Hudson United Cash Election Shares other than those shares converted into the right to receive cash in accordance with the preceding subparagraph (B) shall be converted into the right to receive TD Banknorth Common Stock in accordance with the terms of Section 3.1(a)(iii).   

       | (ii)  |   | In the event the aggregate number of Hudson
United Cash Election Shares is less than the Cash Conversion Shares, then:  
---|---|---|--- 
      

 (1) all Hudson United Cash Election Shares will be converted into the right to receive cash in accordance with Section 3.1(a)(iv), and    

 (2) each Hudson United Stock Election Share will be converted into the right to receive TD Banknorth Common Stock and cash in the following manner:    

 (A) a proration factor (the "Stock Proration Factor") shall be determined by dividing the Stock Conversion Shares by the aggregate number of Hudson United Stock Election Shares. The "Stock Conversion Shares" shall mean the difference between (x) the total number of shares of Hudson United Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Cash Conversion Shares;    

 (B) the number of Hudson United Stock Election Shares held by each holder of shares of Hudson United Common Stock that will be converted into the right to receive shares of TD Banknorth Common Stock pursuant to the terms of Section 3.1(a)(iii) shall be determined by multiplying the Stock Proration Factor by the number of Hudson United Stock Election Shares held by such holder; and    

 (C) all Hudson United Stock Election Shares other than those shares converted into the right to receive TD Banknorth Common Stock in accordance with the preceding subparagraph (B) shall be converted into the right to receive cash in accordance with the terms of Section 3.1(a)(iv).   

       | (iii)  |   | If the number of Hudson United Stock
Election Shares is equal to the number of Stock Conversion Shares and the
number of Hudson United Cash Election Shares is equal to the number of
Cash Conversion Shares, then subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above shall not
apply and all Hudson United Stock Election Shares will be converted into
the right to receive TD Banknorth Common Stock and all Hudson United
Cash Election Shares will be converted into the right to receive cash.  
---|---|---|--- 
      

 (b) If the tax opinions referred to in Sections 8.2(d) and 8.3(c) cannot be rendered because a counsel charged with providing such an opinion reasonably determines that the Merger may not satisfy the continuity of interest requirements applicable to reorganizations under Section 368(a) of the Code, then TD Banknorth shall reduce the amount of Cash Conversion Shares and correspondingly increase the amount of Stock Conversion Shares to the minimum extent necessary to enable such tax opinions to be rendered.    ##### 

  

  

 3.4. _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of TD Banknorth Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder of Hudson United Common Stock who otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a share of TD Banknorth Common Stock shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying the fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all shares of Hudson United Common Stock owned by such holder at the Effective Time) by the Average TD Banknorth Closing Price. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share.    

 3.5. _Exchange Procedures_.    

 (a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, TD Banknorth shall deliver to the Exchange Agent (i) evidence in book-entry form of the number of shares of TD Banknorth Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 3.3 and (ii) TD Banknorth shall deliver, or cause TD Banknorth, NA to deliver, to the Exchange Agent an estimated amount of cash sufficient to make all payments pursuant to Sections 3.3 and 3.4, in exchange for Certificates representing outstanding shares of Hudson United Common Stock in accordance with this Article III (such cash and evidence in book-entry form of shares of TD Banknorth Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, are hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall invest such deposited cash as directed by TD Banknorth, provided that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $500 million. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments will be payable to TD Banknorth. The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the shares of TD Banknorth Common Stock held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such shares for the account of the Persons entitled thereto.    

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates who has not previously surrendered such Certificate or Certificates with an Election Form, a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Hudson United Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to Section 3.3. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) evidence in book-entry form of the number of shares of TD Banknorth Common Stock (if any) to which such former holder of Hudson United Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) a check representing that amount of cash     ##### 

  

     

(if any) to which such former holder of Hudson United Common Stock shall have
become entitled pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) a check representing the
amount of cash (if any) payable in lieu of a fractional share of TD Banknorth
Common Stock which such former holder has the right to receive hereunder in
respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to this Agreement, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Following the
issuance of shares of TD Banknorth Common Stock in book-entry form pursuant
to this Agreement, each recipient of such shares will receive a
Direct Registration System Stock Distribution Statement from TD Banknorths
transfer agent evidencing the credit of shares of TD Banknorth Common Stock
to an account for such shareholder and containing instructions on how a
shareholder may, if desired, request a physical certificate for shares of
TD Banknorth Common Stock. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
3.5(b), each Certificate (other than Certificates representing Treasury
Stock) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration provided in
Sections 3.1 and 3.3 and any unpaid dividends and distributions thereon as
provided in paragraph (c) of this Section 3.5. No interest shall be paid or
accrued on any cash constituting Merger Consideration (including any cash in
lieu of fractional shares) and any unpaid dividends and distributions, if
any, payable to holders of Certificates.    

 (c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to TD Banknorth Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.5. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.5, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of TD Banknorth Common Stock represented by such Certificate.    

 (d) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate form of assignment separate from the Certificate) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or otherwise establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not payable.    

 (e) At and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Hudson United shall be closed and there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Hudson United of the shares of Hudson United Common Stock which were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, holders of Hudson United Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of Hudson United other than to receive the consideration provided under this Article III. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to TD Banknorth or the Exchange Agent for transfer shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided herein.     ##### 

  

     

 (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of Hudson United for 12 months after the Effective Time (as well as any proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to TD Banknorth. Any shareholders of Hudson United who have not theretofore complied with Section 3.5(b) shall thereafter look only to TD Banknorth for the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of each share of Hudson United Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case without any interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates for shares of Hudson United Common Stock are not surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed prior to the date on which the applicable Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned property and any other applicable law, become the property of TD Banknorth (and to the extent not in its possession shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled to such property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of stock represented by any Certificate for any consideration paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. TD Banknorth and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of Hudson United to establish the identity of those Persons entitled to receive the Merger Consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of stock represented by any Certificate, TD Banknorth and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration represented thereby in escrow with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto.    

 (g) TD Banknorth (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Hudson United Common Stock such amounts as TD Banknorth or the Exchange Act are required to deduct and withhold under applicable law. Any amounts so withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Hudson United Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by TD Banknorth.    

 (h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by TD Banknorth, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as TD Banknorth may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.    

 (i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Certificates surrendered for exchange by an affiliate of Hudson United shall not be exchanged for certificates representing shares of TD Banknorth Common Stock to which such Hudson United affiliate may be entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement until TD Banknorth has received a written agreement from such person as specified in Section 7.6.     ##### 

  

     

 3.6. _Treatment of Hudson United Stock Options_.    

 (a) At the Effective Time, each Hudson United Stock Option which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested and exercisable, shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Hudson United Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into an option to purchase shares of TD Banknorth Common Stock, and TD Banknorth shall assume each Hudson United Stock Option, in accordance with the terms of the applicable Hudson United Stock Plan and stock option or other agreement by which it is evidenced, except that from and after the Effective Time, (i) TD Banknorth and the Human Resources Committee of the TD Banknorth Board shall be substituted for Hudson United and the committee of the Hudson United Board (including, if applicable, the entire Hudson United Board) administering such Hudson United Stock Option Plan, (ii) each Hudson United Stock Option assumed by TD Banknorth may be exercised solely for shares of TD Banknorth Common Stock, (iii) the number of shares of TD Banknorth Common Stock subject to such Hudson United Stock Option shall be equal to the number of shares of Hudson United Common Stock subject to such Hudson United Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional shares of TD Banknorth Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest share, and (iv) the per share exercise price under each such Hudson United Stock Option shall be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price under each such Hudson United Stock Option by the Exchange Ratio, provided that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest cent. Notwithstanding clauses (iii) and (iv) of the preceding sentence, each Hudson United Stock Option which is an "incentive stock option" shall be adjusted as required by Section 424 of the Code, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, so as not to constitute a modification, extension or renewal of the option within the meaning of Section 424(h) of the Code. TD Banknorth and Hudson United agree to take all necessary steps to effect the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.6(a).    

 (b) Within one Business Day after the Effective Time, TD Banknorth shall file a registration statement on Form S-3 or Form S-8, as the case may be (or any successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the shares of TD Banknorth Common Stock subject to the options referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section 3.6 and shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein for so long as such options remain outstanding in the case of a Form S-8 or, in the case of a Form S-3, until the shares subject to such options may be sold without a further holding period under Rule 144 under the Securities Act.

 (d) Each of Hudson United and TD Banknorth shall, upon request, furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any other statement, filing, notice or application to be made by or on behalf of any Party or any of its Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Hudson United further agrees to cooperate with TD Banknorth and TD Banknorths counsel and accountants in requesting and obtaining appropriate opinions, consents and letters from its financial advisor and independent registered public accounting firm in connection with the Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and any other such statement, filing, notice or application.    

 Section 7.2. _Access to Information_.    

 (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, Hudson United shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of TD Banknorth access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and to its officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives, in each case in a manner not unreasonably disruptive to the operation of the business of Hudson United and its Subsidiaries, and, during such period, Hudson United shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to TD Banknorth (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state banking, mortgage lending, real estate or consumer finance or protection laws (other than reports or documents which Hudson United is not permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as TD Banknorth may reasonably request. Neither Hudson United nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information or contravene any law, rule or regulation applicable to the institution in possession or control of such information. Hudson United and TD Banknorth shall make appropriate substitute     ##### 

  

     

disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply.    

 (b) TD Banknorth agrees that upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, it shall afford Hudson United and its authorized Representatives such access to its executive officers and such appropriate information relating to TD Banknorth and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably necessary to confirm the accuracy of the representations and warranties of TD Banknorth herein as Hudson United may reasonably request.    

 (c) TD Banknorth shall hold all non-public information furnished by Hudson United, and Hudson United shall hold all non-public information furnished by TD Banknorth, pursuant to Section 7.2(a) or (b) or Section 7.9, or so furnished by TD Banknorth or Hudson United, as applicable, prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Confidential Information"), in confidence and shall not, without TD Banknorths or Hudson Uniteds, as the case may be, prior written consent, disclose such Confidential Information to any Person, and shall not use such Confidential Information other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided, however, that TD Banknorth or Hudson United, as the case may be, may disclose any of such Confidential Information to its affiliates, directors, executives, officers, employees, agents, or legal, financial, accounting or other advisors (collectively, "Representatives") who need to know such Confidential Information in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and who are advised of the provisions of this Section 7.2(c). Each of TD Banknorth and Hudson United, as the case may be, shall be responsible for any breach of its obligations under this Section 7.2(c) by its Representatives (it being understood that such responsibility shall be in addition to and not by way of limitation of any right or remedy TD Banknorth or Hudson United, as the case may be, may have against such Representatives with respect to any such breach). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term "Confidential Information" shall not include, and the provisions of this Section 7.2(c) shall not apply to, information that (i) is or becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section 7.2(c) by TD Banknorth or its Representatives or Hudson United or its Representatives, as the case may be; (ii) was within the possession of TD Banknorth or its Representatives or Hudson United or its Representatives, as the case may be, prior to its being furnished to TD Banknorth by or on behalf of Hudson United, or to Hudson United by or on behalf of TD Banknorth, as the case may be, provided that the source of such information was not known by TD Banknorth or Hudson United, as the case may be, to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual or legal obligation of confidentiality to, TD Banknorth or Hudson United, as the case may be, with respect to such information; or (iii) is or becomes available to TD Banknorth or any of its Representatives or Hudson United or any of its Representatives, as the case may be, on a non-confidential basis from a source other than, in the case of TD Banknorth, Hudson United or any of its Representatives, and in the case of Hudson United, TD Banknorth or any of its Representatives, provided that such source was not known to TD Banknorth or Hudson United, as the case may be, to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual or legal obligation of confidentiality to, in the case of TD Banknorth, Hudson United, and in the case of Hudson United, TD Banknorth, with respect to such information; or (iv) is independently developed by or on behalf of TD Banknorth or Hudson United, as the case may be, without violating any of its respective obligations under this Section 7.2(c). In the event that TD Banknorth or Hudson     ##### 

  

     

United, as the case may be, or anyone to whom it transmits the Confidential
Information pursuant to this Section 7.2(c), is requested or required (by
oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in any
legal proceeding, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar
process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information, TD Banknorth will
provide Hudson United, or Hudson United will provide TD Banknorth, as the
case may be, with prompt written notice of such requirement (unless
prohibited by law or court order from doing so). TD Banknorth further agrees
that, to the extent practicable, it will consult with Hudson United, and
Hudson United agrees that, to the extent practicable, it will consult with TD
Banknorth, so that the other Party may, at its own expense, seek a protective
order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions
of this Section 7.2(c). Each of TD Banknorth and Hudson United also agrees
that if it must disclose any of the Confidential Information pursuant to
applicable law or legal process or pursuant to any rule, regulation or
disclosure obligation of a securities exchange, securities market or self-
regulatory agency on which such partys securities are then listed or
admitted for trading, a bank regulatory authority, the SEC or any applicable
Canadian securities regulatory authority, and no injunction has been granted
restraining such disclosure, it may do so without violating this Section
7.2(c) provided that it furnishes only (a) that portion of the Confidential
Information which it determines is legally required after consultation
with counsel (which may be its internal counsel) and exercises its reasonable
efforts (at the other partys expense) to obtain reliable assurance that the
Confidential Information will be treated as confidential or (b) such
Confidential Information to which Hudson United or TD Banknorth, as the case
may be, agrees in writing. The provisions of this Section 7.2(c) shall survive
any termination of this Agreement and shall survive the Effective
Time.    

 (d) No investigation by TD Banknorth or Hudson United or its respective Representatives shall constitute a waiver of or otherwise affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of such party set forth herein.    

 Section 7.3. _Shareholder Approvals_.    

 (a) Hudson United shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders as promptly as practicable following the date upon which the Registration Statement becomes effective (the "Hudson United Shareholders Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the Required Hudson United Vote and the Additional Hudson United Votes and, subject to Section 7.3(b), shall take all lawful action to solicit the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Additional Hudson United Proposals by such shareholders. The Hudson United Board shall recommend approval of this Agreement and approval of the Additional Hudson United Proposals by the shareholders of Hudson United (the "Hudson United Recommendation") and shall not (x) withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to TD Banknorth such recommendation or (y) take any other action or make any other public statement in connection with the Hudson United Shareholders Meeting inconsistent with such recommendation (collectively, a "Change in Hudson United Recommendation"), except as and to the extent expressly permitted by Section 7.3(b). Notwithstanding any Change in Hudson United Recommendation, this Agreement and the Additional Hudson United Proposals shall be submitted to the shareholders of Hudson United at the Hudson United Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of approving this Agreement and nothing contained in this Section 7.3 or Section 7.4 shall be deemed to relieve Hudson United of such obligation. In addition to the foregoing,     ##### 

  

     

Hudson United shall not submit to the vote of its shareholders
any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger.    

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to obtaining the Required Hudson United Vote and the Additional Hudson United Votes, Hudson United and the Hudson United Board may effect a Change in Hudson United Recommendation if and only to the extent that:    

       | (i)  |   | Hudson United has complied in all material
respects with its obligations under Section 7.4,  
---|---|---|--- 
      
     | (ii)  |   | the Hudson United Board, after consultation
with its outside counsel, determines in good faith that failure to take
such action would result in a violation of its fiduciary duties
under applicable law, and  
      
     | (iii)  |   | Hudson United or the Hudson United Board (A)
has received an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal from
a third party which the Hudson United Board concludes in good
faith constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of
the adjustments which may be offered by TD Banknorth pursuant to clause
(C) below, (B) has notified TD Banknorth, at least five Business Days
in advance, of its intention to effect a Change in Hudson
United Recommendation, specifying the material terms and conditions of any
such Superior Proposal and furnishing to TD Banknorth a copy of the
relevant proposed transaction agreements, if such exist, with the Person
making such Superior Proposal and (C) during the period of not less than
five Business Days following Hudson Uniteds delivery of the notice
referred to in clause (B) above and prior to effecting such a Change in
Hudson United Recommendation, has negotiated, and has used reasonable
best efforts to cause its financial and legal advisors to negotiate, with
TD Banknorth in good faith (to the extent that TD Banknorth desires
to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute
a Superior Proposal.  
     

 (c) TD Banknorth shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders as promptly as practicable following the date upon which the Registration Statement becomes effective (the "TD Banknorth Shareholders Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the Required TD Banknorth Vote and the Additional TD Banknorth Votes. The TD Banknorth Board shall recommend approval and adoption of the Agreement and the Additional TD Banknorth Proposals by the shareholders of TD Banknorth.    

 Section 7.4. _Acquisition Proposals_.    

 (a) Hudson United agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries employees, agents and representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly     ##### 

  

     

or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect
to, or a transaction that could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) have any discussions with or provide
any confidential information or data to any person relating to an Acquisition
Proposal, or engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal,
or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve
or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) approve or recommend, or
propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, asset purchase or share
exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement related to
any Acquisition Proposal or propose or agree to do any of the
foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.4(a),
in the event that, prior to obtaining the Required Hudson United Vote and the
Additional Votes, Hudson United receives an unsolicited _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal and the Hudson United Board concludes in good faith
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
lead to a Superior Proposal, Hudson United may, and may permit its
Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, furnish or cause to be
furnished confidential information or data to the third party making
such Acquisition Proposal and participate in negotiations or discussions with
such third party regarding such Acquisition Proposal to the extent that the
Hudson United Board concludes in good faith (after consultation with its
outside counsel) that failure to take such actions would result in
a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, provided that prior
to providing (or causing to be provided) any confidential information or data
permitted to be provided pursuant to this sentence, Hudson United shall have
entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no
less favorable to Hudson United than the Confidentiality Agreement, and
provided further that Hudson United also shall provide to TD Banknorth a copy
of any such confidential information or data that it is providing to any
third party pursuant to this Section 7.4 to the extent not previously
provided or made available to TD Banknorth.    

 (b) Hudson United will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their employees, agents and representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any Person other than TD Banknorth with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce (and will not release any third party from its obligations under) any standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal, including by requiring the other parties thereto to promptly return or destroy any confidential information previously furnished by Hudson United thereunder and by using its reasonable best efforts to obtain injunctions or other equitable remedies to prevent or restrain any breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof in a court of competent jurisdiction. Hudson United will promptly (within one Business Day) following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal advise TD Banknorth of the substance thereof (including the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal), and will keep TD Banknorth apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations (including the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal) on a current basis (and, in any event, within 48 hours of the occurrence of such developments, discussions or negotiations).    

 (c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Hudson United or the Hudson United Board from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act     ##### 

  

     

with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, provided that such Rules will in no
way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules
would otherwise have under this Agreement, and provided further that any such
disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of
the type contemplated by Rule 14-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed
to be a Change in Hudson United Recommendation for purposes of Article IX
hereof unless the Hudson United Board expressly reaffirms the Hudson United
Recommendation in such disclosure.    

 (d) Hudson United agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 7.4 by any director, officer, employee, agent or representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained Representative) of Hudson United or its Subsidiaries, at the direction or with the consent or prior Knowledge of Hudson United or its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 7.4 by Hudson United.    

 Section 7.5. _Legal Conditions to the Merger_.    

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on such Party or its Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VIII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other Parties to obtain) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party which is required to be obtained by any Party or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided, however, that no Party shall be required to take any action pursuant to the foregoing sentence if the taking of such action or the obtaining of such consents, authorizations, orders, approvals or exemptions is reasonably likely to result in a condition or restriction having an effect of the type referred to in Section 8.2(c).    

 (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the proviso in Section 7.5(a)), each Party agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) modify or amend any contracts, plans or arrangements to which it is a party (to the extent permitted by the terms thereof) if necessary in order to satisfy the conditions to closing set forth in Article VIII hereof, (ii) lift or rescind any injunction or restraining order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) defend any litigation seeking to enjoin, prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or seeking material damages in connection therewith (in which litigation Hudson United shall provide TD Banknorth the reasonable opportunity to participate).    

 Section 7.6. _Affiliates_. Hudson United shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each director, executive officer and other person who is an "affiliate" (for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of Hudson United to deliver to TD Banknorth, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in any event prior to the date of the Hudson     ##### 

  

     

United Shareholders Meeting, a written agreement, in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit B, relating to required transfer restrictions on the shares of TD
Banknorth Common Stock that may be received by them in the Merger pursuant to
Rule 145.   

 Section 7.7. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.    

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, TD Banknorth shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director, officer and employee of Hudson United or a Subsidiary of Hudson United, as applicable, determined as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of or pertaining to the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer or employee of Hudson United or, while a director, officer or employee of Hudson United, is or was serving at the request of Hudson United as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, association, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including without limitation matters related to the negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, to the fullest extent which such Indemnified Parties would be entitled under the Hudson United Certificate as of the date hereof (which right to indemnification shall include the advancement of reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation upon receipt from an Indemnified Party of any required undertaking).    

 (b) Without limitation of the foregoing, TD Banknorth agrees that all rights to indemnification and all limitations on liability existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties in the respective certificate of incorporation, bylaws or similar organizational documents of Hudson United or any of its Subsidiaries as in effect as of the date of this Agreement with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect from and after the Effective Time, provided, that nothing contained in this Section 7.7(b) shall be deemed to preclude any liquidation, consolidation or merger of TD Banknorth or any of its Subsidiaries, in which case all of such rights to indemnification and limitations on liability shall be deemed to so survive and continue notwithstanding any such liquidation, consolidation or merger. Without limiting the foregoing, in any case in which approval by TD Banknorth, one of its Subsidiaries or the board of directors thereof is required to effect any indemnification, at the election of the Indemnified Party, the determination of any such approval shall be made by a majority of the independent directors then in office or, if no such directors are then in office, by independent counsel mutually agreed upon between TD Banknorth and the Indemnified Party.    

 (c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 7.7, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify TD Banknorth, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve TD Banknorth of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent that such failure actually prejudices TD Banknorth. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) TD Banknorth shall have the right to assume the     ##### 

  

     

defense thereof and TD Banknorth shall not be liable to such Indemnified
Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the
defense thereof, except that if TD Banknorth elects not to assume such defense
or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which
raise conflicts of interest between TD Banknorth and the Indemnified Parties,
the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel which is reasonably satisfactory
to TD Banknorth, and TD Banknorth shall pay, promptly as statements therefor
are received, the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Parties (which may not exceed one firm in any jurisdiction), (ii)
TD Banknorth and the Indemnified Parties will cooperate reasonably in the
defense of any such matter, (iii) TD Banknorth shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent and (iv) TD Banknorth
shall have no obligation hereunder to the extent that indemnification of an
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable laws and regulations or by an applicable federal or state banking
agency or a court of competent jurisdiction.    

 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, TD Banknorth shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the persons serving as directors and officers of Hudson United immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered by the directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained by Hudson United (provided that TD Banknorth may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing comparable terms and conditions as such policy or single premium tail coverage with policy limits equal to Hudson Uniteds existing coverage limits and which is not less advantageous to such directors and officers) for a six-year period following the Effective Time with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time which were committed by such directors and officers in their capacities as such, provided that in no event shall TD Banknorth be required to expend for any one year more than an amount equal to 200% of the current annual amount expended by Hudson United to maintain such insurance (the "Insurance Amount"), and further provided that if TD Banknorth is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section 7.7(d) as a result of the preceding provision, TD Banknorth shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount.    

 (e) If after the Effective Time TD Banknorth or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of TD Banknorth shall assume the obligations of TD Banknorth set forth in this Section 7.7 and under Section 7.13.    

 (f) Following the Effective Time, TD Banknorth shall not knowingly take, directly or indirectly, any action that would or would reasonably be expected to materially impair the ability of TD Banknorth to fulfill its obligations under this Section 7.7 or under Section 7.13.    

 (g) The provisions of this Section 7.7 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.    

 Section 7.8. _Advice of Changes_. Each of Hudson United and TD Banknorth shall promptly advise the other of any change or event which, individually or in the aggregate      ##### 

  

     

with other such changes or events, has or would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on it or which it believes would or would be
reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained herein, provided, however,
that any noncompliance with the foregoing shall not constitute the failure to
be satisfied of a condition set forth in Article VIII or give rise to any
right of termination under Article IX unless the underlying breach shall
independently constitute such a failure or give rise to such a right.    

 Section 7.9. _Financial Statements and Other Current Information_. As soon as reasonably practicable after they become available, but in no event more than 30 days after the end of each calendar month ending after the date of this Agreement, Hudson United shall furnish to TD Banknorth (a) consolidated and consolidating financial statements (including balance sheets, statements of operations and stockholders equity) of Hudson United and each of its Subsidiaries as of and for such month then ended, (b) internal management financial control reports showing actual financial performance against plan and previous period and (c) any reports provided to the Hudson United Board or any committee thereof relating to the financial and risk performance of Hudson United. In addition, Hudson United shall furnish TD Banknorth with a copy of each report filed by Hudson United or any of its Subsidiaries with a Governmental Entity within three Business Days following the filing thereof. As soon as practicable after they become available, but in no event more than 30 days after the end of each calendar month ending after the date of this Agreement, TD Banknorth shall furnish to Hudson United consolidated financial statements (including a balance sheet and statement of operations) of TD Banknorth and its Subsidiaries as of and for such month then ended. All information furnished by Hudson United or TD Banknorth pursuant to this Section 7.9 shall be held in confidence to the same extent as the receiving partys obligations under Section 7.2(c).    

 Section 7.10. _Stock Exchange Listing_. TD Banknorth shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of TD Banknorth Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and pursuant to the TD Banknorth Stock Sale to be approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.    

 Section 7.11. _Directors of TD Banknorth_. TD Banknorth shall take all action necessary to elect two non-employee members of the current Hudson United Board selected by Hudson United who are reasonably acceptable to TD Banknorth and meet its director eligibility requirements as Class A directors of TD Banknorth as of the Effective Time.    

 Section 7.12. _Transition Matters_.    

 (a) Commencing following the date hereof, TD Banknorth and Hudson United shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts to facilitate the integration of the businesses and operating systems of Hudson United and its Subsidiaries with those of TD Banknorth and its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time.    

 (b) Hudson United shall use its reasonable best efforts to close, on terms and conditions which are reasonably satisfactory to TD Banknorth, accounts of such money service operations, pursuant to which Hudson United, Hudson United Bank or their respective customers provide check cashing, money transfer, travelers check, foreign exchange and similar services to     ##### 

  

     

non-customers, as may be requested by TD Banknorth, effective immediately
prior to the Effective Time.    

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, Hudson United shall (i) continue to use all reasonable efforts to comply with the terms of all agreements with, commitments to or orders of any Governmental Entity, including any related action plan, in accordance with their terms, and (ii) use all reasonable efforts to obtain the termination of the order to cease and desist issued by the FDIC against Hudson United Bank and related parties in May 2004 and any other such agreement, commitment or order as soon as practicable after the date hereof.    

 (d) Hudson United shall (i) timely inform TD Banknorth of all material developments relating to the matters referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Section 7.12 and consult and cooperate with TD Banknorth with respect thereto and (ii) in the case of the matters referred to in paragraph (c) of this Section 7.12, take such actions as may be reasonably requested by TD Banknorth to enhance compliance with the enforcement actions identified therein and to obtain their termination as soon as practicable after the date hereof, including without limitation permitting TD Banknorth to test compliance with applicable requirements and provide Hudson United with employee and other resources to enhance such compliance.    

 Section 7.13. _Employee Benefit Plans_.    

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, TD Banknorth shall take all reasonable action so that employees of Hudson United and its Subsidiaries who become employees of TD Banknorth and its Subsidiaries (the "Continuing Employees") shall be entitled to participate, effective as soon as administratively practicable following the Effective Time, in each TD Banknorth Benefit Plan of general applicability to the same extent as similarly-situated employees of TD Banknorth and its Subsidiaries (it being understood that inclusion of the employees of Hudson United and its Subsidiaries in the TD Banknorth Benefit Plans may occur at different times with respect to different plans and that any grants to any former employee of Hudson United or its Subsidiaries under any equity compensation plan of TD Banknorth shall be discretionary with TD Banknorth). To the extent that Continuing Employees are not entitled to participate in any TD Banknorth Benefit Plan effective as of the Effective Time, such employees shall continue to participate in the corresponding employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of Hudson United and its Subsidiaries so as to ensure that there is not a lapse in participation or coverage (but in no event to provide duplicate participation or coverage), as applicable, prior to participation in such TD Banknorth Benefit Plan, provided that in no event shall TD Banknorth be required to continue any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of Hudson United for which there is no corresponding TD Banknorth Benefit Plan. TD Banknorth shall cause each TD Banknorth Benefit Plan in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate to take into account for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals under the TD Banknorth Benefit Plans (other than for benefit accruals under TD Banknorths defined benefit pension plan, supplemental retirement plan and supplemental retirement agreements) the service of such employees with Hudson United and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities) to the same extent as such service was credited generally for such purpose by Hudson United and its Subsidiaries, provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service.     ##### 

  

     

 (b) If Continuing Employees become eligible to participate in a medical, dental, health or disability plan of TD Banknorth or its Subsidiaries, TD Banknorth shall cause each such plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions are covered under the applicable medical, health, dental or disability plans of TD Banknorth, (ii) honor under such plans any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the employees and their beneficiaries during the portion of the plan year prior to such participation and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such employee on or after the Effective Time, unless such employee had not yet satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Hudson United Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time.    

 (c) An employee of TD Banknorth or any of its Subsidiaries who was an employee of Hudson United or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any employee who is party to an employment agreement, change-in-control agreement or any other agreement which provides for severance payments, provided such individual did not agree on or after December 1, 2004 to have the terms of the Hudson United Severance Plan apply in lieu of the severance benefits provided under such agreement) whose employment terminates under circumstances entitling him or her to benefits under the terms of the Hudson United Severance Plan during the one-year period following the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive severance payments in accordance with, and to the extent provided in, the Hudson United Severance Plan, as may be amended on or after the date hereof with the prior written consent of TD Banknorth. The general release, and non-compete agreement where applicable, for payments made under the Hudson United Severance Plan as of the Effective Time shall be in the form set forth in Section 7.13(c) of the Hudson United Disclosure Schedule. TD Banknorth agrees to use a similar form for payments to be made after the Effective Time.    

 (d) As of the Effective Time, TD Banknorth shall assume and honor and shall cause the appropriate Subsidiaries of TD Banknorth to assume and honor in accordance with their terms all Hudson United Benefit Plans existing immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement which have been disclosed in Section 4.11(a) of the Hudson United Disclosure Schedule. TD Banknorth acknowledges and agrees that the consummation of the Merger constitutes a "Change in Control" for purposes of the Hudson United Benefit Plans.    

 (e) With respect to each Hudson United Benefit Plan subject to Section 409A of the Code, Hudson United agrees to amend each such plan or cause each such plan to be amended to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code (or to cause such plan, in whole or in part, to avoid the application of Section 409A of the Code by preserving the terms of such plan, and the law in effect, for benefits vested as of December 31, 2004) prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the deadline imposed by the IRS. Such amendments shall be provided to TD Banknorth and its counsel at least ten days prior to their proposed adoption by Hudson United or Hudson United Bank and shall be subject to the prior approval of TD Banknorth, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.    

 (f) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.13, nothing contained in this Section 7.13 shall be interpreted as preventing the Surviving Corporation from amending, modifying or terminating any Hudson United Benefit Plan, TD Banknorth Benefit Plan or other contracts, arrangements, commitments or understandings in accordance with their terms and     ##### 

  

     

applicable law, provided that no such amendment, modification or termination
shall reduce or eliminate a vested benefit.    

 (g) Hudson United will cooperate in good faith with TD Banknorth, and will use its reasonable best efforts to have its executive officers cooperate with TD Banknorth, to mitigate the effects of Sections 162(m) and 280G of the Code on Hudson United and the Surviving Corporation, and TD Banknorth will cooperate in good faith with Hudson United and certain of its executive officers to minimize the impact of "cut-back" provisions in change-of-control and/or employment agreements with such executive officers.    

 Section 7.14. _The Bank Merger_. TD Banknorth and Hudson United agree to take all action necessary and appropriate to cause Hudson United Bank to merge with and into TD Banknorth, NA in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and the terms of the Bank Merger Agreement, it being the intention of Hudson United and TD Banknorth that the Bank Merger be consummated immediately following the Merger. Without limiting the foregoing, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, (a) TD Banknorth shall (i) cause the Board of Directors of TD Banknorth, NA to approve the Bank Merger Agreement, (ii) cause TD Banknorth, NA to execute and deliver the Bank Merger Agreement and (iii) approve the Bank Merger Agreement in its capacity as the sole shareholder of TD Banknorth, NA, and (b) Hudson United shall (i) cause the Board of Directors of Hudson United Bank to approve the Bank Merger Agreement, (ii) cause Hudson United Bank to execute and deliver the Bank Merger Agreement and (iii) approve the Bank Merger Agreement in its capacity as the sole shareholder of Hudson United Bank. The Bank Merger Agreement shall contain terms that are normal and customary in light of the transactions contemplated hereby and such additional terms as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.    

 Section 7.15. _Certain Policies_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Hudson United and its Subsidiaries shall, consistent with U.S. GAAP, the rules and regulations of the SEC and applicable banking laws and regulations, modify or change its loan, OREO, accrual, reserve, tax, litigation and real estate valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves) so as to be applied on a basis that is consistent with that of TD Banknorth, provided, however, that no such modifications or changes need be made prior to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.1(a) and 8.1(b); and provided further that in any event, no accrual or reserve made by Hudson United or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 7.15 shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, condition or other provision of this Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining whether any such breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred. The recording of any such adjustments shall not be deemed to imply any misstatement of previously furnished financial statements or information and shall not be construed as concurrence of Hudson United or its management with any such adjustments.    

 Section 7.16. _Section 16 Matters_. TD Banknorth and Hudson United agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain Hudson United Insiders (as defined below) in connection with the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Hudson United Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares     ##### 

  

     

of Hudson United Common Stock into shares of TD Banknorth Common Stock and
Hudson United Stock-Based Awards into TD Banknorth Stock-Based Awards in the
Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the
provisions of this Section 7.16. Assuming that Hudson United delivers to TD
Banknorth the Section 16 Information (as defined below) in a timely fashion,
the TD Banknorth Board, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as
such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act),
shall adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by Hudson United Insiders
of TD Banknorth Common Stock in exchange for shares of Hudson United Common
Stock and of TD Banknorth Stock-Based Awards in exchange for Hudson United
Stock-Based Awards, in each case pursuant to the Merger and to the extent
such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, are intended to be
exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange
Act. "Section 16 Information" shall mean information accurate in all material
respects regarding Hudson United Insiders, the number of shares of Hudson
United Common Stock beneficially owned by each such Hudson United Insider and
expected to be exchanged for TD Banknorth Common Stock in the Merger and the
number and description of Hudson United Stock-Based Awards beneficially owned
by each such Hudson United Insider and expected to be converted into TD
Banknorth Stock-Based Awards in connection with the Merger, provided that the
requirement for a description of any Hudson United Stock-Based Awards shall
be deemed to be satisfied if copies of all Hudson United Stock Plans,
and forms of agreements evidencing grants thereunder, under which such Hudson
United Stock-Based Awards have been granted have been made available to TD
Banknorth. "Hudson United Insiders" shall mean those officers and directors
of Hudson United who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act and who will be subject to such requirements in
their capacity as officers and/or directors of TD Banknorth following the
Merger.    

 Section 7.17. _Coordination of Dividends_. From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, Hudson United shall coordinate the declaration of any dividends in respect of the Hudson United Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto with that of the TD Banknorth Common Stock, it being the intention of Hudson United and TD Banknorth that the holders of Hudson United Common Stock shall not receive more than one dividend, or fail to receive one dividend, for any single calendar quarter with respect to their shares of TD Banknorth Common Stock and/or Hudson United Common Stock and any shares of TD Banknorth Common Stock any holder of Hudson United Common Stock receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.    

 Section 7.18. _Tax Matters_. Each of Hudson United and TD Banknorth shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of Hudson United and TD Banknorth shall execute and deliver to each law firm referred to in Sections 8.2(d) and 8.3(c) certificates containing appropriate representations at such time or times as may be reasonably requested by each such law firm in connection with its delivery of the opinion referred to in Sections 8.2(d) and 8.3(c), as applicable, with respect to the tax treatment of the Merger.    

 Section 7.19. _Publicity_. TD Banknorth and Hudson United shall consult with each other before issuing any press release with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided, however, that TD     ##### 

  

     

Banknorth and Hudson United may, without the prior consent of the other (but
after prior consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances)
issue such press release or make such public statement as may upon the advice
of outside counsel be required by law or the rules and regulations of the New
York Stock Exchange. Without limiting the reach of the preceding sentence, TD
Banknorth and Hudson United shall (a) cooperate to develop all public
announcement materials and (b) make appropriate management available at
presentations related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as reasonably requested by the other. In addition, Hudson United and its
Subsidiaries shall (i) consult with TD Banknorth regarding communications
with customers, shareholders, prospective investors and employees related to
the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) provide TD Banknorth with
shareholder lists of Hudson United and (iii) use reasonable best efforts, at
the expense of TD Banknorth, to facilitate contact by TD Banknorth with
shareholders of Hudson United and other prospective investors.    

 Section 7.20. _Additional Proposals_.    

 (a) In addition to the proposal to approve this Agreement at the Hudson United Shareholders Meeting, Hudson United shall submit to its shareholders for a vote at the Hudson United Shareholders Meeting, and shall include in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and use its reasonable best efforts to solicit the votes of its shareholders in favor of, any proposal requested by TD Banknorth in writing not less than ten Business Days prior to the effective time of the Registration Statement relating to and consistent with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby as TD Banknorth may reasonably request, which proposal in the opinion of legal counsel to TD Banknorth is required in order to comply with applicable law, regulation or listing requirement (collectively, the "Additional Hudson United Proposals"). Unless otherwise required by law or mutually agreed by Hudson United and TD Banknorth, the vote required to approve any Additional Hudson United Proposal to be considered at the Hudson United Shareholders Meeting shall be the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the matter at the Hudson United Shareholders Meeting (collectively, the "Additional Hudson United Votes").    

 (b) In addition to the proposal to approve the issuances of TD Banknorth Common Stock in the Merger and pursuant to the TD Banknorth Stock Sale at the TD Banknorth Shareholders Meeting, TD Banknorth shall submit to its shareholders for a vote at the TD Banknorth Shareholders Meeting and shall include in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus any proposal relating to and consistent with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby required by applicable law, regulation or listing requirement (collectively, the "Additional TD Banknorth Proposals"). Unless otherwise required by law or mutually agreed by Hudson United and TD Banknorth, the vote required to approve any Additional TD Banknorth Proposal to be considered at the TD Banknorth Shareholders Meeting shall be the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the TD Banknorth Common Stock present in person or by proxy at the TD Banknorth Shareholders Meeting (collectively, the "Additional TD Banknorth Votes").

Agreement unless otherwise specified. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The table of contents and
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. In
this Agreement all references to "dollars" or "$" are to United States
dollars. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to require a Party
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates to take any action
which would violate or conflict with any applicable law (whether statutory or
common), rule or regulation.    

 Section 10.5. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile and in counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.    

 Section 10.6. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits and the disclosure schedules hereto and the other documents and instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, including without limitation the Confidentiality Agreement.    

 Section 10.7. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.    

 (a) This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (except to the extent that mandatory provisions of federal law are applicable). Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any court of the United States located in the State of Delaware, for any action, proceeding or investigation in any court or before any governmental authority ("Litigation") arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any such Litigation, the defense of sovereign immunity, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for any reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance with this Section 10.7, that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, that the Litigation in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such Litigation is improper, or that this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts and further irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the benefit of any defense that would hinder, fetter or delay the levy, execution or collection of any amount to which the party is entitled pursuant to the final judgment of any court having jurisdiction. Each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all rights to trial by jury in connection with any Litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.     ##### 

  

     

 (b) Hudson United hereby irrevocably designates The Corporation Trust Company, Corporate Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19801 (in such capacity, the "Hudson United Process Agent") its designee, appointee and agent to receive, for and on its behalf, service of process in such jurisdiction for any Litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement and such service shall be deemed complete upon delivery thereof to the Hudson United Process Agent; provided that in the case of any such service upon the Hudson United Process Agent, the party effecting such service shall also deliver a copy thereof to Hudson United in the manner provided in Section 10.3. Each Party irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such Litigation by the mailing of copies thereof by registered mail, postage prepaid, to such party at its address set forth in this Agreement, such service of process to be effective upon acknowledgment of receipt of such registered mail.    

 (c) Each Party expressly acknowledges that the foregoing waiver is intended to be irrevocable under the laws of the State of Delaware and of the United States of America, provided that consent by TD to jurisdiction and service contained in this Section 10.7 is solely for the purpose referred to in this Section 10.7 and shall not be deemed to be a general submission to said courts or in the State of Delaware other than for such purpose.    

 Section 10.8. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction, and if any provision of this Agreement is determined to be so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable, in all cases so long as neither the economic nor legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party or its shareholders. Upon any such determination, Hudson United and TD Banknorth shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect the original intent of the parties.    

 Section 10.9. _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of Hudson United or TD Banknorth hereunder shall be assigned by Hudson United or TD Banknorth (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the Parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder other than with respect to the provisions of Section 7.7, which shall inure to the benefit of the directors and officers of Hudson United referred to therein and their respective heirs and personal representatives, who are intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof.    

 Section 10.10. _Alternative Structure_. Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, TD Banknorth may at any time change the structure of the Merger and/or the Bank Merger (including without limitation to change the structure of the combination     ##### 

  

     

of Hudson United Bank and TD Banknorth, NA from a merger to TD Banknorth, NAs
purchase of substantially all of the assets and the assumption of
substantially all of the liabilities of Hudson United Bank), and TD Banknorth
and TD may change the terms of the TD Banknorth Stock Sale, provided that in
any such case no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of
the Merger Consideration, (ii) adversely affect the anticipated tax
consequences of the Merger to the holders of Hudson United Common Stock as a
result of receiving the Merger Consideration or (iii) materially impede
or delay consummation of the Merger. In the event TD Banknorth elects to make
such a change, the Parties agree to execute appropriate documents to reflect
the change.    

 Section 10.11. _TD Banknorth Stock Sale_.    

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, TD Banknorth hereby agrees to sell, and TD hereby agrees to purchase, pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act, 29,625,353 shares of TD Banknorth Common Stock at $31.79 per share on the Closing Date in order to provide TD Banknorth with the funds necessary to pay the cash component of the Merger Consideration (the "TD Banknorth Stock Sale"). The TD Banknorth Common Stock to be issued in the TD Banknorth Stock Sale shall be in book entry-form and be accompanied by appropriate stop-transfer instructions to ensure compliance with applicable securities laws.    

 (b) TD has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the TD Banknorth Stock Sale. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance and consummation of the TD Banknorth Stock Sale have been duly and validly approved by all requisite corporate and shareholder action of TD and no other corporate or shareholder proceedings on the part of TD are necessary to approve this Agreement or to perform or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by TD and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the other Parties) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of TD, enforceable against TD in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by general principles of equity whether applied in a court of law or a court of equity and by bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors rights and remedies generally.    

 (c) Except as set forth in Sections 4.4 and 5.4 and any required approval of the OSFI, no consents or approvals of, or filings or registrations with, any Governmental Entity, domestic or foreign, or with any other third party are necessary in connection with the execution and delivery by TD of this Agreement and the consummation by TD of the TD Banknorth Stock Sale. TD agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary applications and filings in order to obtain as promptly as practicable any required approval of the OFSI and any other Requisite Regulatory Approval required to be obtained by it.    

 (d) At the TD Banknorth Shareholders Meeting, TD, in its capacity as the holder of a majority of the outstanding TD Banknorth Common Stock, agrees to vote the shares of TD Banknorth Common Stock held by it as of the record date for the TD Banknorth Shareholders Meeting for approval and adoption of this Agreement and any Additional TD Banknorth Proposals.     #####

EXHIBIT A    

SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT    

 SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT (the "Agreement"), dated as of July 11, 2005, by and between ___, a shareholder ("Shareholder") of Hudson United Bancorp ("Hudson United"), a New Jersey corporation, and TD Banknorth Inc. ("TD Banknorth"), a Delaware corporation. All terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Merger Agreement (defined below).   

 WHEREAS, TD Banknorth and Hudson United are simultaneously entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (as may be amended from time to time pursuant to its terms, the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which Hudson United will merge with and into TD Banknorth on the terms and conditions set forth therein (the "Merger"); and   

 WHEREAS, Annex I hereto set forth all shares of Hudson United Common Stock over which the Shareholder has voting and dispositive power (such shares, together with all shares of Hudson United Common Stock subsequently acquired by Shareholder during the term of this Agreement, being referred to as the "Shares"); and   

 WHEREAS, in order to induce TD Banknorth to enter into the Merger Agreement, Shareholder, solely in such Shareholders capacity as a shareholder of Hudson United and not in any other capacity, has agreed to enter into and perform this Agreement;   

 NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:    

 1\. _Agreement to Vote Shares_. Shareholder agrees that at any meeting of the shareholders of Hudson United, or in connection with any written consent of the shareholders of Hudson United at which a proposal of the type set forth in clause (ii) below is presented for consideration by the shareholders of Hudson United, Shareholder shall:    

 (i) appear at each such meeting in person or by proxy or otherwise cause the Shares to be counted as present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum; and    

 (ii) vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, all the Shares (whether acquired heretofore or hereafter) that are beneficially owned by Shareholder or as to which Shareholder has, directly or indirectly, the right to vote or direct the voting, (x) in favor of adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger; (y) against any action or agreement that would result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of Hudson United contained in the Merger Agreement or of Shareholder contained in this Agreement; and (z) against any Acquisition Proposal or any other action, agreement or transaction that is intended, or could reasonably be expected, to materially impede, interfere or be inconsistent with, delay, postpone, discourage or materially and adversely affect consummation of the Merger or this Agreement.    ##### 

  

   

 2\. _No Transfers_. After the date hereof and prior to the Hudson United Meeting (as defined in the Merger Agreement), Shareholder agrees not to, directly or indirectly, sell transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract option, commitment or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale, transfer, pledge, assignment or other disposition of, any of the Shares if such sale, transfer, pledge, assignment or disposition could occur prior to the Hudson United Meeting, except for pledges or other transactions effected with the prior consent of TD Banknorth, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, and except the following transfers shall be permitted: (i) transfers by will or operation of law, in which case this Agreement shall bind the transferee, subject to applicable law, (ii) transfers pursuant to any pledge agreement, subject to the pledgee agreeing in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, (iii) transfers in connection with estate and tax planning purposes, including transfers to relatives, trusts and charitable organizations, subject to the transferee agreeing in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, (iv) transfers to any other shareholder of Hudson United who has executed a copy of this Agreement on the date hereof with respect to some or all of the Shares held by such shareholder, (v) pledges in connection with bona fide loans entered into in the ordinary course of business, whether entered into before or after the date hereof, and (vi) such transfers as TD Banknorth may otherwise permit in its sole discretion. Any transfer or other disposition in violation of the terms of this Section 2 shall be null and void.    

 3\. _Representations and Warranties of Shareholder_. Shareholder represents and warrants to and agrees with TD Banknorth as follows:    

 A. _Capacity_. Shareholder has all requisite capacity and authority
to enter into and perform his, her or its obligations under this
Agreement.    

 B. _Binding Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the valid and
legally binding obligation of Shareholder, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general
equity principles.    

 C. _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Shareholder does not, and the performance by Shareholder of his, her or
its obligations hereunder and the consummation by Shareholder of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not, violate or conflict with, or
constitute a default under, any agreement, instrument, contract or other
obligation or any order, arbitration award, judgment or decree to which
Shareholder is a party or by which Shareholder is bound, or any statute, rule
or regulation to which Shareholder is subject or, in the event that
Shareholder is a corporation, partnership, trust or other entity, any
charter, bylaw or other organizational document of Shareholder.    

 D. _Ownership of Shares_. Shareholder (or an affiliate of shareholder)
has good title to all of the Shares as of the date hereof, and, except as set
forth on Annex I hereto, the Shares are so owned free and clear of any liens,
security interests, charges or other encumbrances.    ##### 

  

   

 4\. _Specific Performance and Remedies_. Shareholder acknowledges that it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to TD Banknorth if Shareholder fails to comply with the obligations imposed by this Agreement and that, in the event of any such failure, TD Banknorth will not have an adequate remedy at law or in equity. Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, in addition to remedies at law or in damages, is the appropriate remedy for any such failure and will not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that TD Banknorth has an adequate remedy at law. Shareholder agrees that Shareholder will not seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in connection with TD Banknorths seeking or obtaining such equitable relief. In addition, after discussing the matter with Shareholder, TD Banknorth shall have the right to inform any third party that TD Banknorth reasonably believes to be, or to be contemplating, participating with Shareholder or receiving from Shareholder assistance in violation of this Agreement, of the terms of this Agreement and of the rights of TD Banknorth hereunder, and that participation by any such persons with Shareholder in activities in violation of Shareholders agreement with TD Banknorth set forth in this Agreement may give rise to claims by TD Banknorth against such third party.    

 5\. _Term of Agreement; Termination_.    

 A. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof.    

 B. This Agreement shall terminate at the Effective Time of the Merger or
the earlier of (i) at any time prior to consummation of the Merger by the
written consent of the parties hereto and (ii) termination of the Merger
Agreement in accordance with its terms. Upon such termination, no party shall
have any further obligations or liabilities hereunder; provided, however,
such termination shall not relieve any party from liability for any willful
breach of this Agreement prior to such termination.    

 6\. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived, except by an instrument in writing signed by each party hereto. No waiver of any provisions hereof by either party shall be deemed a waiver of any other provisions hereof by any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party. No party hereto may assign any rights or obligations hereunder to any other person, except as required by Section 2 or upon the prior written consent of each other party. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person or entity, other than the parties hereto or their respective successors, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.    

 7\. _Notices_. Notices may be provided to TD Banknorth and the Shareholder in the manner specified in the Merger Agreement, with all notices to the Shareholder being provided to him or her at the address set forth in Annex I hereto.    ##### 

  

   

 8\. _Miscellaneous_.    

 A. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the application
of such provision to any person or circumstances shall be held invalid or
unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision or
application shall be unenforceable only to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability, and the remainder of the provision held invalid or
unenforceable and the application of such provision to persons or
circumstances, other than the party as to which it is held invalid, and the
remainder of this Agreement, shall not be affected.    

 B. _Capacity_. The covenants contained herein shall apply to
Shareholder solely in his or her capacity as a shareholder of Hudson United,
and no covenant contained herein shall apply to Shareholder in his or her
capacity as a director, officer or employee of Hudson United or in any other
fiduciary capacity. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to
apply to, or limit in any manner, the obligations of the Shareholder to
comply with his or her fiduciary duties as a director of Hudson
United.    

 C. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.    

 D. _Headings_. All Section headings herein are for convenience of
reference only and are not part of this Agreement, and no construction or
reference shall be derived therefrom.    

 E. _Choice of Law_. This Agreement shall be deemed a contract made
under, and for all purposes shall be construed in accordance with, the laws
of the State of Delaware, without reference to its conflicts of law
principles.   

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed and delivered this Agreement as of the date first written above.
