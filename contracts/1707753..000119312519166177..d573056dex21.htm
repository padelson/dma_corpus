CONFIDENTIAL

 



_Section_ __ _ 1.3(b)(ix)_, if any holder of Dissenting Shares
shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise)
such holders appraisal rights under Delaware Law, then, as of the later of

an In-the-Money Company Option shall be assumed by Acquiror and shall
continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth
in the applicable Plan and the option agreement relating thereto (including
with respect to the vesting thereof), as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that such assumed Company Option shall be exercisable
(A) for that number of whole Acquiror Ordinary Shares determined by
_multiplying_ the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Option immediately before the Effective Time _by_ the Stock Award
Exchange Ratio, and (B) at an exercise price per Acquiror Ordinary Share
_equal to_ the exercise price per share of such Company Option, as applicable
immediately prior to the Effective Time, _divided by_ the Stock Award Exchange
Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) (an " _Assumed Company Option_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of any Assumed Company Option
that qualifies immediately prior to the Effective Time as an incentive stock
option for U.S. Tax purposes by reason of its qualification under Section 422
of the Code, at and following the Effective Time, it will constitute a
nonstatutory stock option for U.S. Tax purposes. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, (x) if the foregoing calculation results in an
Assumed Company Option being exercisable for a fraction of an Acquiror
Ordinary Share, then the number of Acquiror Ordinary Shares subject to such
option will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares, and (y) if
an Assumed Company Option is scheduled to vest a fraction of an Acquiror
Ordinary Share during any vesting period, the number of Acquiror Ordinary
Shares to vest during such vesting period shall be rounded down to the nearest
whole number of shares and the aggregate number of Acquiror Ordinary Shares
resulting from such fractional rounding will be added to the last vesting
period of such Assumed Company Option (rounded down to the nearest whole
number of shares).

 

(ii)  _Out-of-the-Money Company Options_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquiror, Merger Sub, the
Company, any Securityholder, or any other Person, each Out-of-the-Money
Company Option (if any) shall be terminated and cancelled without any
consideration therefor.

(iii) _Necessary Actions_. Prior to the Closing, and subject to the prior
review and approval of Acquiror (acting reasonably), the Company shall take
all actions reasonably necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by
this _Section_ __ _ 1.3(c)_ under the Plan and any Contract applicable
to any Company Option (whether written or oral, formal or informal),
including delivering all required notices and obtaining all necessary
approvals and consents.

 

(iv) _Form S-8_. Within two (2) Business Days after the Effective Time,
Acquiror shall file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor form), relating to the Acquiror Ordinary Shares

the Exchange Documents pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_), be
converted into the right to receive with respect to each share issuable upon
exercise in full of such Company Series D Preferred Warrant: (1) a number of
Acquiror Ordinary Shares equal to the quotient obtained by _dividing_ (x) the
excess of the sum of (i) the Per Series D Liquidation Preference, _plus_ (ii)
the Per Share Closing Participation Amount, _over_ the per share exercise
price of such Company Series D Preferred Warrant, _by_ (y) the Acquiror
Share Price; (2) a contingent right to receive the Per Share Adjustment
Consideration; (3) an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Per Share
Expense Contribution (which shall be deposited with the Securityholder
Representative in accordance with, and subject to the terms of _Section_ __ _
2.3(d)_); and (4) subject to _Section_ __ _ 1.3(g)_, an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to (i) the Euro Par Value, _multiplied by_  (ii) the
number of Acquiror Ordinary Shares issuable in respect of such share of
Company Series D Preferred Warrants pursuant the foregoing clauses (1) and
(2).

 

(ii) _Company Series C Preferred Warrants_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquiror, Merger Sub, the

excess of the sum of (i) the Per Series C Liquidation Preference, _plus_ (ii)
the Per Share Closing Participation Amount, _over_ the per share exercise
price of such Company Series C Preferred Warrant, _by_ (y) the Acquiror

(2).

 

(iii) _Company Series A Preferred Warrants_. At the Effective Time, by virtue

to use any efforts, or refrain from taking any action or causing any action to
be taken, as relates to the composition or fair market value of the

Escrow Agent, Acquiror shall be deemed to have contributed to the Indemnity
Escrow Fund, on behalf of each Indemnifying Party, each Indemnifying Partys
Escrow Pro Rata Portion of the Indemnity Escrow Shares. The Indemnity Escrow
Fund shall be available to compensate the Indemnified Parties for any claims

Portions, and shall be distributed in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including _Article_ __ _ IX_, and the Escrow
Agreement. Each Indemnifying Party shall have the ability to exercise all

thereof, and the right to pledge, encumber, sell, assign or transfer such
Indemnity Escrow Shares or any interest therein except as contemplated by the

cash in the amount of $350,000 (the " _Expense Fund Amount_ "), into a
segregated account designated by the Securityholder Representative in a
written notice delivered to Acquiror at least three (3) Businesses Days prior
to the Closing Date (the Expense Fund Amount in such account, together with
any income earned on the Expense Fund Amount, the " _Expense Fund_ ").
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Acquirors obligations to
make payment of all or any portion of the Expense Fund Amount shall be fully
satisfied upon deposit of the Expense Fund Amount in the Expense Fund.
The Expense Fund shall be treated as received and deposited by the
Securityholders pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.3_ at the Effective Time for Tax
purposes and be held as a trust fund for the benefit of the appropriate
Securityholders and shall not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee
process or any other judicial process of any creditor of any Person. The
Expense Fund shall be used by the Securityholder Representative as agent and
for the benefit of the Securityholders and shall be used (i) for the purposes
of paying directly or reimbursing the Securityholder Representative for any
Securityholder Representative Expenses incurred pursuant to this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement or the Securityholder Representative Engagement
Agreement, or (ii) as otherwise determined by the Advisory Group (the "
_Expense Fund_ "). The Securityholders will not receive any interest or
earnings on the Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign to the
Securityholder Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have
had in any such interest or earnings. The Securityholder Representative will
hold these funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use these
funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not
voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of
bankruptcy. The Securityholder Representative is not providing any investment
supervision, recommendations or advice and shall have no responsibility or
liability for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a result
of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Securityholder
Representative is not acting as a withholding agent or in any similar
capacity in connection with the Expense Fund, and has no tax reporting or

respect of any sale or other transaction with respect to which any commission
or other payment will accrue or otherwise become payable to any Employee at
any time after the Closing.

3.7 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
any Liability, except for those which (a) have been reflected in the Current
Balance Sheet, (b) have arisen in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practices since the Balance Sheet Date that are not material in
amount or significance, either individually or in the aggregate, and do not
result from a breach of Contract (including any representation or warranty
therein), breach of warranty, violation of Law, infringement,

3.8 _No Changes_. Since December 31, 2018 through the Agreement Date, no
Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred or arisen. Since the Balance
Sheet Date through the Agreement Date, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary

proposed to be taken or actually taken after the Agreement Date.

3.9 _Tax_ _Matters_.

 

(a) _Tax Returns_ _and Payments_. Each return (including any information
return), report, statement, declaration, estimate, schedule, notice,

Governmental Entity in connection with the determination,
assessment, collection or payment of any Tax or in connection with the
administration, implementation or enforcement of or compliance with any Law
relating to any Tax, including any schedule or amendment thereof or attachment
thereto (each, a " _Tax Return_ ") required to be filed by or on behalf of
the Company or any Subsidiary with any Governmental Entity on or before the
Closing Date (the " _Company Returns_ "): (i) has been filed on or before the
applicable due date (including any extensions of such due date); and (ii) is
true, correct and complete in all material respects and has been prepared in
compliance with all applicable Laws in all material respects. All Taxes
required to be paid by the Company or its Subsidiaries (regardless of whether

delivered or made available to Acquiror accurate and complete copies of all
Company Returns (other than immaterial information returns (e.g. Form 1099s,
W-2s, etc.)) filed for the four most recent taxable periods.

(b) _Reserves for Payment of_ _Taxes_. The Financials fully accrue all actual
and contingent liabilities for Taxes with respect to all periods through the
dates thereof. The Company or each Subsidiary, as the case may be, will
establish, in the ordinary course of business and consistent with its past
practices, reserves adequate for the payment of all Taxes for the period from
the Balance Sheet Date through the Closing Date, and the Company will disclose
the dollar amount of such reserves to Acquiror as soon as practicable and in
any event reasonably in advance of the Closing Date (other than any Taxes

paid or otherwise resolved in full. No extension or waiver of the limitation
period applicable to any Company Returns has been granted by or requested from
the Company or any Subsidiary in each case, that is still currently in effect.
No Action is currently pending or threatened against the

Subsidiary has had its stock distributed by another Person, in a transaction
that was purported or intended to be governed in whole or in part by Section

transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(f) _280G Matters_ _._ There is no agreement, plan, arrangement or other

indirectly to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant
to Section 280G of the Code or that would be reasonably characterized as a
"parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code. No
"disqualified individual" (as defined in Code Section 280G and the regulations
promulgated thereunder) with respect to the Company is entitled to any payment
of any tax "gross-up" or similar "make-whole" payments from the Company or any
Subsidiary, including as a result of excise taxes which could become payable
under Section 280G of the Code or Section 4999 of the Code. _Section_ __ _

party to any Tax sharing, indemnification or allocation agreement (other than

to any joint venture, partnership or other arrangement that could be treated
as a partnership for Tax purposes.

 

(h) _FIRPTA_. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is or has been a United

jurisdictions in which the Company or any Subsidiary is required to file a Tax
Return other than the jurisdictions in which the Company or such Subsidiary
has filed Tax Returns. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is subject to
Tax in any country other than its country of incorporation or formation by
virtue of having a permanent establishment or place of business in that other
country. No written claim has ever been made by a Governmental Entity in a
jurisdiction where the Company or any Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns

file a Tax Return in, or be subject to Tax by, that jurisdiction.

(j) _Transfer Pricing_. The prices for any property or services (or for the
use of any property) provided by or to the Company or any Subsidiary are

agreement or arrangement between the Company or any ERISA Affiliate and any
Employee that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as such term is
defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) subject to Section 409A of the Code
(or any state Law equivalent) and the regulations and guidance thereunder ("
_Section_ __ _ 409A_"). Each such nonqualified deferred compensation plan has
been operated in (a) material documentary and (b) material operational
compliance with Section 409A, such that no compensation is required by Law to
be included in the gross income of any Employee as of any date on or prior to
the Effective Time as a result of the operation of Section 409A of the Code
with respect to any Company Employee Plan. To the extent required by Law, the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries has properly reported and/or withheld and

compensation plan subject to Section 409A of the Code. There is no Contract
to which the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates is a party, including the

Affiliates to pay a Tax gross up payment to, or otherwise indemnify or
reimburse, any Employee for Tax-related payments under Section 409A. There is
no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement to which the Company or any
Subsidiary is a party which, individually or collectively, could give rise to

obligations under Section 409A of the Code.

Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(l)) (A) has an exercise price less than the fair

"service recipient stock" (within the meaning of applicable regulations under
Section 409A).

(t) _Limitations_. This  _Section_ __ _ 3.9_ and _Section_ __ _ 3.14_ (to
the extent it relates to Taxes) contain the exclusive representations and
warranties of the Company with respect to Taxes, and any claim for breach
of representation with respect to Taxes shall be based on the representations
and warranties made in this Section 3.9 and _Section_ __ _ 3.14_ (to the
extent it relates to Taxes), and shall not be based on the representations
or warranties set forth in any other provision of this Agreement. Except for
_Sections 3.9(e)_ , _(f)_ , _(g)_ , _(l)_ , _(m)_ , _(n)_ , _(o)_ , _(p)_ and
_(s)_ , no representation or warranty contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 3.9_

are not Taxes for Pre-Closing Tax Periods. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Company makes no representation as to any limitations on any net operating
losses, Tax basis, Tax credits, or other Tax attributes that it may have in
any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning on or after the Closing

property currently leased, subleased or licensed by or from the Company or
any Subsidiary or otherwise used or occupied by the Company or any Subsidiary
(the " _Leased Real Property_ "). _Section_ __ _ 3.10_ of the Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a list of all leases, lease guaranties, subleases,

CONFIDENTIAL

 



Agreements are valid and effective in accordance with their respective terms
against the Company (or its Subsidiary, as applicable), and, to the Knowledge
of the Company, the other parties thereto, and there is not, under any of such
leases, any existing default, rent past due or event of default (or event
which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) by
the Company (or its Subsidiary, as applicable), and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, the other parties thereto. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries
have received any written (or, to the Knowledge of the Company, other) notice
of a default, alleged failure to perform, or any offset or counterclaim with
respect to any such Lease Agreement, which has not been fully remedied and
withdrawn. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does
not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not,
result in any material breach of or constitute a material default (or an event
that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under,
or materially impair the rights of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
materially alter the rights or obligations of the sublessor, lessor or
licensor under, or give to others any material rights of termination,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation of any Lease Agreements, or otherwise
materially adversely affect the continued use and possession of the Leased
Real Property for the conduct of business as presently conducted. Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary owes brokerage commissions or finders fees with
respect to any such Leased Real Property or would owe any such fees if any
existing Lease Agreement were renewed pursuant to any renewal options
contained in such Lease Agreements. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries
has performed all of its obligations under any termination Contracts pursuant
to which it has terminated any leases, subleases, licenses or other occupancy
Contracts for real property that are no longer in effect and has no
continuing liability with respect to such terminated Contracts. The Leased
Real Property is in good operating condition and repair and otherwise suitable
for the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
otherwise suitable for the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. The Company expects to be able to continue to have the right to
occupy the Leased Real Property through the remainder of the term of the
applicable Lease Agreement.

 

3.11 _Property_. The Company or a Subsidiary has good and valid title to, or,
in the case of leased or licensed properties and assets, valid leasehold
interests or license rights in, all tangible properties and assets used or
held for use by the Company or any Subsidiary in their respective businesses,
free and clear of any Liens, except (a) as reflected in the Current Balance
Sheet, and (b) Permitted Liens. All such items of property owned, leased, or
licensed by the Company or any Subsidiary (i) are adequate for the conduct of

compliance with its terms and conditions and with the requirements prescribed
by applicable Laws. Furthermore, no International Employee Plan has unfunded

that would prevent the Company or Acquiror from terminating or amending any
International Employee Plan at any time for any reason without liability to
the Company or its ERISA Affiliates (other than ordinary administration
expenses or routine claims for benefits). To the extent applicable, each
International Employee Plan has been approved by the relevant taxation and
other Governmental Entities so as to enable: (i) the Company and its

the purposes of the Funded International Employee Plans, to enjoy the most
favorable taxation status possible and the Company is not aware of any ground

administration expenses or routine claims for benefits).

of the type contemplated by this Agreement, including that which is required
by applicable Law to be included in the Form S-4 so as to enable Acquiror to

the Company shall cooperate in good faith to determine the information

which is necessary to include in the Form S-4 in order to satisfy applicable
Law. Each of Acquiror and the Company shall promptly correct any information
provided by it or any of its respective Representatives for use in the Form
S-4 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect. Acquiror shall take all steps reasonably
necessary to cause the Form S-4, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and

SEC, and Acquiror shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments made by
the Company and its counsel (it being understood that the Company and its
counsel shall provide any comments thereon as soon as reasonably practicable).
Acquiror shall provide the Company and its counsel any and all material
written comments or other written material communications that Acquiror or
its counsel receives from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Form S-4 as
promptly as reasonably practicable after such receipt, and Acquiror shall
provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate
in the formulation of any response to any such comments of the SEC or its
staff (including a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such

comments made by the Company and its counsel (it being understood that the
Company and its counsel shall provide any comments thereon as soon as
reasonably practicable)) and participate in any substantive discussions with
the SEC or its staff regarding any such comments. Acquiror shall use
reasonable best efforts to as promptly as reasonably practicable respond to
any comments of the SEC or its staff regarding the Form S-4. Acquiror shall
also take any other action required to be taken under the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky" Laws

efforts to cause Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, Professional Corporation ("

In connection with such opinions, upon the request of Cooley or WSGR, officers
of each of the Company and Acquiror shall use reasonable best efforts
to deliver to Cooley or WSGR, as applicable, certificates, dated as of the

its Representatives with true, correct, and complete information regarding
the Company and its Subsidiaries that is customary in connection with the
preparation and filing of the Form S-4, including such information as may be

limiting the foregoing, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
its independent accounting firm to deliver to the Company a consent letter of
the Companys independent accounting firm, in form and substance satisfactory
to Acquiror (acting reasonably), that is customary in scope and substance for

to cause the Acquiror Ordinary Shares to be issued in the Merger to be

7.3 _Company Securityholder Approvals_.

 

(a) _Company Requisite Stockholder Approval_. Promptly (and in any event
within two (2) Business Days) following the time at which the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act (the " _S-4 Effective Time_"), the
Company shall solicit written consent from all of its Stockholders in a form

the other transactions contemplated hereby, and (iv) the unanimous
recommendation of the Companys Board of Directors that the Stockholders vote
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and not exercise their appraisal or
dissenters rights under applicable Law, including Delaware Law, in connection

CONFIDENTIAL

 



" _Information Statement_ "). The Information Statement shall be prepared and
delivered in accordance with the Companys Charter Documents, Delaware Law and
other applicable Law, and shall include any notice required to be made to the
Stockholders, including under Section 262 of Delaware Law. The
Information Statement and all other materials submitted to the Stockholders
will not contain, at or prior to the Effective Time, any untrue statement of a
material fact, and will not omit to state any material fact necessary in order
to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which made, not misleading. The Company shall promptly deliver to Acquiror a
copy of each executed Stockholder Written Consent upon receipt thereof from
any Stockholder pursuant to such solicitation. Promptly (and in any event
within two (2) Business Days) after the S-4 Effective Time, the Company will
deliver to Acquiror the Stockholder Written Consent from Stockholders pursuant
to the preceding solicitation that are sufficient to fully and irrevocably
deliver the Company Requisite Stockholder Approval. Upon receipt of the
Company Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company shall promptly deliver
notice to each Stockholder whose consent was not obtained prior to the
Companys receipt of the Company Requisite Stockholder Approval, which notice
shall include the notice to Stockholders required by Sections 228(e) and 262
of Delaware Law of the approval of the Merger. All materials submitted to the
Stockholders, including the Information Statement, shall be subject to the
review and comment of Acquiror. The Board of Directors of the Company shall
not alter, modify, change or revoke its unanimous approval of this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, nor its unanimous
recommendation to the Stockholders to vote in favor of adoption of this
Agreement and approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

(b) _280G Approvals_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall submit to
the Stockholders for approval (in a form satisfactory to Acquiror (acting
reasonably)), by such number of Stockholders as is required by the terms of
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, any payments and/or benefits that may
separately or in the aggregate, constitute "parachute payments" (which
determination shall be made by the Company and shall be subject to review and
approval by Acquiror) (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder), such that such payments and benefits
shall not be deemed to be "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code
(the " _280G Solicitations_ "). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
deliver to Acquiror evidence satisfactory to Acquiror (acting reasonably)
that (i) a Stockholder vote was solicited in conformance with Section 280G and
the regulations promulgated thereunder and the Company Requisite Stockholder
Approval was obtained with respect to any payments and/or benefits that were
subject to the Stockholder vote (the " _280G Approval_ "), or (ii) that the
280G Approval was not obtained and as a consequence, that such "parachute
payments" shall not be made or provided, pursuant to the 280G Waivers
executed by the affected individuals prior to the 280G Solicitations.

(c) _Joinders_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause each Indemnifying Party to execute and deliver to the

7.4 _Acquiror Shareholder Approval_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Agreement Date, Acquiror
shall file with the SEC a proxy statement in connection with seeking the
Acquiror Requisite Shareholder Approval (the " _Proxy Statement_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror may, in its sole and absolute
discretion, elect to file the Form S-4 contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 7.1_
together with the Proxy Statement. The Company shall furnish in writing to
Acquiror all information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that
would customarily be included in the Proxy Statement for a transaction of the
type contemplated by this Agreement, including that which is required by
applicable Law to be included in the Proxy Statement so as to enable Acquiror
to comply with its obligations 

 



61

    

CONFIDENTIAL

 



under this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(a)_. Acquiror and the Company shall cooperate
in good faith to determine the information regarding the Company that is to be
included in the Proxy Statement, including that which is necessary to include
in the Proxy Statement in order to satisfy applicable Law. Each of Acquiror
and the Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it or any
of its Representatives for use in the Proxy Statement if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect. Acquiror shall take all steps reasonably necessary to cause the
Proxy Statement, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated, in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable Law,
or by the SEC or its staff, or the NYSE. Acquiror shall provide the Company
and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy
Statement prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and Acquiror shall
consider in good faith any reasonable comments made by the Company and
its counsel (it being understood that the Company and its counsel shall
provide any comments thereon as soon as reasonably practicable). Acquiror
shall provide the Company and its counsel any and all material written
comments or other written material communications that Acquiror or its
counsel receives from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement
as promptly as reasonably practicable after such receipt, and Acquiror shall
provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate
in the formulation of any response to any such comments of the SEC or its
staff (including a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such
response, to which Acquiror shall give reasonable and good
faith consideration to any comments made by the Company and its counsel (it
being understood that the Company and its counsel shall provide any comments
thereon as soon as reasonably practicable)) and to participate in any
substantive discussions with the SEC or its staff regarding any such
comments. Acquiror shall use reasonable best efforts to as promptly as
reasonably practicable respond to any comments of the SEC or its staff
regarding the Proxy Statement.

 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, cooperate with and provide to Acquiror and
its Representatives with true, correct, and complete information regarding
the Company and its Subsidiaries customarily required in connection with the
preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement, including such information as
may be required to be included in the Proxy Statement pursuant to applicable
Law. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause its independent accounting firm to deliver to the Company a
consent letter of the Companys independent accounting firm, in form and
substance satisfactory to Acquiror (acting reasonably), that is customary in
scope and substance for letters delivered by independent public accountants in
connection with registration statements similar to the Proxy Statement.

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the S-4 Effective
Time, Acquiror shall convene a general meeting to approve the resolution of
Acquirors board of directors that Acquiror shall consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (such meeting, the " _Acquiror Shareholders_
__ ___Meeting_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror may, in its sole
and absolute discretion, elect to hold the Acquiror Shareholders Meeting at
its first annual general meeting convened after the S-4 Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Acquiror shall have the right to postpone the
convocation of the Acquiror Shareholders Meeting, or to withdraw the
convocation of the Acquirors Shareholders Meeting, if: (i) on the date that
the Acquiror Shareholders Meeting is then-scheduled, Acquiror has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes to obtain the
Acquiror Requisite Shareholder Approval; (b) on the date that the Acquiror
Shareholders Meeting is then-scheduled, there is insufficient share capital
represented at the Acquiror Shareholders Meeting (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Acquiror Shareholders Meeting; or (c) the failure to postpone the convocation
of the Acquiror Shareholders Meeting, or to withdraw the convocation of the
Acquirors Shareholders Meeting, would be a violation of applicable Law.

7.5 _Governmental Approvals_.

 

(a) In furtherance and not in limitation of the terms of _Section_ __ _ 7.7_,
each of the Company, any Subsidiary and Acquiror shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable and advisable after the Agreement Date,

notification or other document that may be necessary in order to obtain the
authorization, approval or consent of any Governmental Entity, whether
federal, state, local or foreign, that may be reasonably required, or that the
Company or Acquiror may reasonably request, in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Company and
Acquiror shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all such
authorizations, approvals and consents. To the extent permitted by Laws, each
of the Company and Acquiror shall promptly inform the other of any material
communication between the Company or Acquiror (as applicable) and any
Governmental Entity regarding the transactions contemplated hereby. If the
Company or Acquiror or any Affiliate thereof shall receive any formal or
informal request for supplemental information or documentary material from any
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, then
the Company or Acquiror (as applicable) shall make, or cause to be made, as
soon as reasonably practicable, a response in compliance with such request.
Each of the Company and Acquiror shall direct, in its sole discretion, the
making of such response, but shall consider in good faith the views of the
other.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, it is expressly understood and agreed that neither Company
nor Acquiror nor Merger Sub shall have any obligation to litigate any Action
that may be brought in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and neither Acquiror nor any Affiliate of Acquiror shall be
required to agree to any license, sale or other disposition or holding
separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise), of shares of
capital stock or of any business, assets or property of Acquiror, the Company
or any of their respective Affiliates, or the imposition of any limitation on
the ability of any of them to conduct their businesses or to own or exercise
control of such assets, properties and stock.

 

(c) Each of the Company and Acquiror shall jointly develop, consult and
cooperate with one another regarding the strategy with respect to seeking any
actions, consents, approvals or waivers of any Governmental Entity as
contemplated hereby, including CFIUS and DSS, as pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.5(d)_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.5(e)_; provided, however, if the Company and
Acquiror cannot agree on a jointly developed strategy, notwithstanding their
respective good faith attempts to do so, Acquiror shall have the final say
with respect to CFIUS or DSS strategy; _provided_ , _further_ , and without
limiting the foregoing, that Acquiror will consult with the Company and
consider in good faith the views of the Company in advance of making any
decisions with respect to such strategy. Notwithstanding Acquirors rights as
provided in the prior sentence, Acquiror shall not require the Company to,
and the Company shall not be required to, take any action with respect to any
applicable antitrust or anti-competition Law that would bind the Company or
its Subsidiaries irrespective of whether the Merger occurs.

(d) _CFIUS_.

 

(i) Acquiror and the Company will use reasonable best efforts to prepare and
pre-file, as promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable after the
Agreement Date, a draft joint voluntary notice with CFIUS pursuant to the DPA
with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. As promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt and resolution
of comments from CFIUS on the pre-filing, Acquiror and the Company shall file
with CFIUS a joint voluntary notice pursuant to the DPA with respect to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Acquiror and
the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to: (A) provide as promptly as

supplemental information and documentary material as may be necessary, proper
or advisable in connection with preparation and submission of the notice and
thereafter to achieve CFIUS Approval and permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; (B) permit the other party to review
reasonably in advance any communication (subject to mutually acceptable
appropriate redactions to maintain confidentiality of business information)

63

    

CONFIDENTIAL

 



advance of any meeting or conference with CFIUS, and, to the extent permitted
by CFIUS, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in
any such meeting or conference; and (C) keep each other timely apprised of the
status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for
additional information or documentary material from, CFIUS, in case of each
of clauses (A)(C), to the extent permitted by applicable Law and subject to
customary and mutually acceptable confidentiality practices and all applicable
privileges (including the attorney-client privilege).

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall Acquiror be obligated to accept (A) any requirement by CFIUS
to divest or hold separate (through the establishment of a trust, proxy or
otherwise) any assets or operations of Acquiror or its Subsidiaries or any
assets or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (B) any action,
restriction, or condition required by CFIUS as a condition of obtaining CFIUS
Approval if the action, restriction, or condition would reasonably be expected
to result in individually or in the aggregate, a commercially unreasonable
restriction or impairment on the Company and its Subsidiaries, or Acquiror and
its Subsidiaries, or their respective assets, products, services, business,
operations, directors, officers, or employees (any of the foregoing, a "
_CFIUS Burdensome Condition_ "); _provided_ , _however,_ that such CFIUS
Burdensome Conditions shall not include, among other things, requirements to
(1) appoint a CFIUS-approved Security Director on the board of any Subsidiary
of the Company that has a contract with the U.S. federal government, (2)
submit cybersecurity or other policies to CFIUS for approval, (3) limit access
to customer data to CFIUS-approved employees, (4) engage in CFIUS-approved
reviews of Company source code, or (5) appoint a CFIUS-approved, third-party
auditor or monitor to oversee compliance with any mitigation agreement or
condition. In the event that a CFIUS Burdensome Condition is not acceptable
to Acquiror, in its sole and absolute discretion (an " _Acquiror Rejected
CFIUS Condition_ "), Acquiror may request a withdrawal of the notice filed
with CFIUS in connection with the CFIUS Approval, with which Company shall
cooperate and comply, and no party shall have any further obligation to seek
CFIUS Approval. Each of the Company and Acquiror shall not be obligated to
agree to, commit or effect, (x) any sale, license, holding separate or other
disposition of assets or businesses, (y) terminating, relinquishing,
modifying, or waiving existing relationships, ventures, contractual rights,
obligations or other arrangements, or (z) creating any relationships,
ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements (any of the
foregoing, a " _Remedial Action_ ") by CFIUS unless such Remedial Action is
conditioned upon, or will occur subsequent to, consummation of the Merger.

 

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, in the event that CFIUS notifies Acquiror and the Company in
writing that CFIUS (A) has completed its review or investigation and has
unresolved national security concerns, and (B) intends to send a report to the
President of the United States requesting the Presidents decision because it
(i) recommends that the President act to suspend or prohibit the Merger, (ii)
is unable to reach a decision on whether to recommend that the President
suspend or prohibit the Merger or (iii) requests that the President make a
determination with respect to the Merger (a " _CFIUS Turndown_ "), each of
either Acquiror or the Company may request a withdrawal of the notice filed
with CFIUS in connection with the CFIUS Approval, with which the other party
shall cooperate and comply, and no party shall have any further obligation to
seek CFIUS Approval.

(e) _DSS FOCI_.

 

(i) Acquiror and the Company will use reasonable best efforts to submit, as

CONFIDENTIAL

 



(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Acquiror and
the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to: (A) provide as promptly as

achieve DSS Approval and permit consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby; (B) permit the other party to review reasonably in advance any
communication (subject to mutually acceptable appropriate redactions to
maintain confidentiality of business information) proposed to be given by it
to DSS or other Governmental Entities, as applicable, and consult with each
other in advance of any meeting or conference with DSS or other Governmental
Entities, as applicable, and, to the extent permitted by DSS or other
Governmental Entities, as applicable, give the other party the opportunity to

other timely apprised of the status of any communications with, and any
inquiries or requests for additional information or documentary material
from, DSS or other Governmental Entities, as applicable, in each case (A) 
(C), to the extent permitted by applicable Law and subject to customary and
mutually acceptable confidentiality practices and all applicable privileges
(including the attorney-client privilege).

(f) Acquirors reasonable best efforts as described in this _Section_ __ _
7.5_ shall include accepting any action, restriction, or condition required
by DSS or other Governmental Entities pursuant to the NISPOM requirements,
restrictions, or other safeguards for handling classified material.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
reasonable best efforts shall not require, and in no event shall Acquiror be
required to effect, any material separation of product engineering personnel
between the FOCI mitigated entity and parent company or replication or
location of all product engineering personnel within the FOCI mitigated
entity. In the event that Acquiror does not or is unable to take an action,
restriction or condition required by DSS or another Governmental Entity as a
condition of obtaining, or DSS notifies Acquiror and the Company it will not
provide DSS Approval or another applicable Governmental Entity approval
related to national or industrial security regulation (an " _Acquiror Rejected
DSS Condition_ " or " _DSS Turndown_ ," as applicable), Acquiror or the
Company may request that DSS or another applicable Governmental Entity cease
consideration of any notice filed in connection with the DSS Approval or other
applicable Governmental Entity approval related to national or industrial
security regulations, and no party shall have any further obligation to seek
the DSS Approval or other applicable Governmental Entity approval related to
national or industrial security regulations. Each of the Company and Acquiror
shall not be obligated to agree to any Remedial Action required by DSS or
another applicable Government Entity unless such Remedial Action is
conditioned upon, or will occur subsequent to, consummation of the Merger.

for any reason, none of Acquiror or Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates shall have any liability to the Company, the Securityholders or any
other Person for any Liabilities resulting from the Company sending any such
notice or seeking to obtain any such consents, modifications, waivers and
approvals.

received by the Company or any Subsidiary.

 

7.7 _Reasonable Best Efforts_ _to Close_. __Subject to the terms and
conditions provided in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto (other than
the Securityholder Representative) shall use reasonable best efforts to take
promptly, or cause to be taken promptly, all actions, and to do promptly, or
cause to be done promptly, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, including
by using reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to satisfy all
of the conditions to the obligations of the other party or parties hereto to
effect the Merger set forth in _Article_ __ _ VII_, to obtain all necessary
waivers, consents, approvals and other documents required to be delivered
hereunder and to effect all necessary registrations and filings and to remove
any injunctions or other impediments or delays, legal or otherwise, in each
case in order to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement for the purpose of securing to
the parties hereto the benefits contemplated by this Agreement.

7.8 _Employee_ _Matters_.

 

(a) _Resignation of Officers and Directors_. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall have caused each director and officer of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to execute a resignation and release letter in a form acceptable
to Acquiror (the " _Director and Officer Resignation Letter_ "), effective as
the Effective Time.

 

(b) _Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment_ _Agreement_ _s_. Prior
to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause

(c) _Termination of_ _Employee_ _ _ _Plans_. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall terminate any Company Employee Plan intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code, as well as any Company Employee Plans that
are group welfare benefit plans or that include group severance pay or
benefits, such termination to be contingent upon the Closing and effective as
of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, unless
Acquiror provides written notice to the Company that any such
Company Employee Plan shall not be terminated. The Company shall provide
Acquiror with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror that all such
Company Employee Plans have been terminated, including, with respect to
Company Employee Plans intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code or as reasonably requested by Acquiror, resolutions of the board of
directors (or similar body) of the Company or its ERISA Affiliates, as the
case may be, terminating such Company Employee Plans. The form and substance
of such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Acquiror
(acting reasonably). In the event that termination of such a Company Employee
Plan in connection with the Closing triggers liquidation charges,
surrender charges or other fees, then such charges and/or fees shall be
included in Third Party Expenses and shall be the responsibility of the
Company, and the Company shall take such actions as are necessary to
reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees and provide such
estimate in the Statement of Expenses. The Company also shall take such other,
commercially reasonable actions in furtherance of terminating any such Company
Employee Plan as Acquiror may reasonably require.

Company shall, in compliance with applicable Law, use reasonable best efforts
to cause each Employee who is employed or engaged by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as of or after the Agreement Date and who is not a Continuing

general release agreement (which shall not have been revoked) approved by
Acquiror (acting reasonably) (each, a " _Separation_  

 



66

    

CONFIDENTIAL

 



_Agreement_ "), effective as of no later than one (1) Business Day prior to
the Closing Date (except with respect to any legally required longer time
period that is required for an effective release of federal age discrimination
claims, in which case such Separation Agreements shall become effective no
later than one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date with respect to all
matters other than the release of federal age discrimination claims (the "
_ADEA Release_ "), which ADEA Release shall become effective no later than the
maximum period required by law, and for which additional consideration of
$500 will be offered (the " _ADEA Consideration_ ")), and the Company shall
pay all severance pay or benefits (other than the ADEA Consideration) required
to be paid to such Non-Continuing Employees prior to the Closing in compliance
with all applicable Contracts and applicable Law, all of which shall be Third
Party Expenses; _provided_ that in no event shall the Company agree to any
severance pay or benefits, excluding the ADEA Consideration, in an amount
greater than the applicable Employees average four (4) week cash compensation
except to the extent required by any applicable Contracts and applicable
Law;  _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that Acquiror shall bear all
Excluded Severance Costs. The Company shall ensure that all such separations
shall be in compliance with applicable Law.

the reasonable prior review and approval of Acquiror, the Company shall take
all actions reasonably necessary to provide for the payment of all unpaid

obligated under the terms of this Agreement to cause the continuation of any
employment relationship with any Employee for any specific period of time.

(g) _No Employment Commitment or _ _Plan_ _Amendments_. Unless expressly
stated in this Agreement, no provision of this Agreement is intended, or shall
be interpreted, to provide or create any third party beneficiary rights or any
other rights of any kind or nature whatsoever in any Securityholder, Key
Employee or other Employee, consultant, contractor or any other Person,
including any rights of employment for any specified period and/or any
employee benefits, in favor of any Person, union, association, Key Employee,
other Employee, consultant or contractor or any other Person, other than
Acquiror or Merger Sub, the Company, and the Securityholder Representative and
their respective successors and permitted assigns, and all provisions of this
Agreement will be personal solely among such parties. In addition, no
provision of this Agreement is intended, or shall be interpreted, to
establish, amend or modify any term or condition of any employee related plan,
program or policy of the Company or any Subsidiary.

7.9 _Tax_ _Matters_.

 

(a) _Tax Returns_ _Filed On or Prior to_ _Closing_. The Company and its
Subsidiaries shall prepare, or shall cause to be prepared, all Tax Returns of
the Company and its Subsidiaries required to be filed under applicable Law on
or prior to the Closing Date and shall be responsible for the timely filing
(taking into account any extensions received from the relevant
Tax authorities) of such Tax Returns. The Tax Returns described in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.9(a)_ shall be prepared on a basis consistent with those
prepared for prior taxable periods unless otherwise required by Law. The
Company shall provide Acquiror with a copy of each such Tax Return for its
review, comment and approval no less than twenty (20) days prior to the
earlier of the due date (taking into account valid extensions thereto) for
such Tax Return, the Company shall revise such Tax Returns to reflect
Acquirors reasonable comments, and the Company shall timely file the
foregoing unless Acquiror withholds its consent thereto, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(b) _Tax Returns_ _Filed After_ _Closing_. Acquiror shall prepare or shall
cause to be prepared all Tax Returns with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
required by Law to be filed by the Company or its Subsidiaries after the

 



67

    

CONFIDENTIAL

 



Closing Date. If such Tax Return is a federal income Tax Return or reports a
material Liability for Taxes for which indemnification by the Securityholders
could be required hereunder, Acquiror will, at least twenty (20) days prior to
the due date for filing such Tax Return (taking into account valid extensions
thereto), provide the Securityholder Representative with a copy of such
proposed Tax Return (and such additional information regarding such Tax Return
as may reasonably be requested by the Securityholder Representative in
writing) for review and comment. Acquiror will consider in good faith any
reasonable comments or suggestions made by the Securityholder Representative.
All Taxes that are due and payable with respect to Tax Returns described in
this _Section_ __ _ 7.9(b)_ shall be the responsibility of the
Securityholders to the extent they constitute Pre-Closing Taxes, and shall,
for the avoidance of doubt be subject to indemnification pursuant to _Article_
__ _ IX_, including _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(ix)_. The Tax Returns described
in this _Section_ __ _ 7.9(b)_ with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall
be prepared on a basis consistent with those prepared for prior taxable
periods unless otherwise required by Law.

(c) _Tax_ _Assistance_. The Securityholder Representative agrees to furnish
or cause to be furnished to Acquiror and its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation), and Acquiror agrees to furnish or cause to be
furnished, and to cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) to furnish to Securityholder Representative at any time after the
Closing Date, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information
(including access to books and records) and assistance relating to the Company
and its Subsidiaries, as is reasonably requested for the filing of any Tax
Returns, for the preparation of any audit and for the prosecution or defense
of any pending or threatened audit or assessment, suit, proposed adjustment,
deficiency, dispute, administrative or judicial proceeding or other similar
claim. Each of Acquiror, the Company, their Subsidiaries and the
Securityholder Representative shall retain all books and records in their
possession with respect to Taxes for a period of at least seven (7) years
following the Closing Date.

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes imposed on the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne 50% by the
Securityholders and 50% by Acquiror. The party required by applicable Law to
file any Tax Return relating to such Transfer Taxes shall be responsible for
filing such Tax Return.

 

(e) _Straddle Period Apportionment_. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever
it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of the Company or its
Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period, the determination of the Taxes of the
Company or its Subsidiaries for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
and including the Closing Date, and the portion of the Straddle Period
beginning after the Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the
Straddle Period consisted of two taxable years or periods, one of which ended
at the close of the Closing Date and the other of which began at the beginning
of the day following the Closing Date. The amount of any Taxes based on or
measured by income, receipts or payroll of the Company for the Straddle Period
shall be allocated between such two taxable years or periods on a "closing of
the books basis" by assuming that the books of the Company were closed at the
close of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including
depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be the amount of such
allowances or deductions for the Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the number of calendar days from the beginning of
the period up to and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which
shall be the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. The amount
of other Taxes of the Company for a Straddle Period that relates to the
portion ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the amount of such
Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.
The Company and Acquiror agree to allocate all deductions of the Company
accruing on the Closing Date to the Companys taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending on the Closing Date pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A)(1) (and not pursuant to the "next day" rule under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) or pursuant to the
ratable allocation method under Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) or 1.1502-76(b)(2)(iii)) to the extent permissible under
the Code. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company and Acquiror agree that all
Tax deductions

 



68

    

CONFIDENTIAL

 



and credits attributable to the transactions made pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
1.3_ hereof shall be allocated to the Companys taxable periods (or portion
thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date to the extent permissible under
the Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations.

 

(f) _Post-Closing Actions_. Neither Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation, nor
any Indemnified Party shall (i) amend, refile or otherwise modify any Tax
Returns of the Company with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, other than
as required to correct a position on any such Tax Return that is not in
accordance with applicable Law; provided, Acquiror shall provide the
Securityholder Representative with reasonable advanced notice and an
opportunity to review and provide reasonable comments to such Tax Return
before Acquiror takes any action pursuant to this clause (i) (ii) make or
change any Tax election (including an election under Section 338 of the Code)
that has retroactive effect to any Tax Return of the Company for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period; or (iii) agree to extend or waive the statute of limitations with
respect to Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company, , except, in
each case, (A) as permitted by _Section_ __ _ 7.9(b),_ (B) with the prior
written consent of the Securityholder Representative, which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, or (C) if such action would not
increase the liability of the Securityholders for Taxes. If Acquiror,
the Surviving Corporation, or any Indemnified Party initiates or files any
voluntary disclosure or similar agreements with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company, Securityholder
Representative shall be given the opportunity to review and provide reasonable
comments to such voluntary disclosure or other agreement prior to filing,
which reasonable comments Acquiror shall consider in good faith.

 

7.10 _Payoff Letters and Release of Liens_.

 

(a) _Payoff Letters_. No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall obtain from each holder of Indebtedness of
the Company or any Subsidiary, and deliver to Acquiror, an executed payoff
letter, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Acquiror (acting
reasonably), setting forth (i) the amounts required to pay off in full on
the Closing Date the Indebtedness owing to such holder of Indebtedness
(including the outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest and
prepayment and other penalties) and, other than with respect to the Company
Convertible Notes, wire transfer information for such payment, and, with
respect to Company Convertible Notes, the number of Acquiror Ordinary Shares
to be issued in respect of such Company Convertible Note, (ii) upon payment of
such amounts, a release of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (iii) upon
payment of such amounts, a release of all Liens, if any, that the holder may
hold on any of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and an
agreement that the Company or its Representatives may file UCC-3 termination
statements and such other documents necessary or desirable to evidence the
release of any and all such Liens, and attaching duly completed and executed
copies of any necessary Tax forms, including IRS Form W-9 or the appropriate
series of IRS Form W-8, as applicable (each, a " _Payoff Letter_ ").

 

(b) _Release of_ _Liens_. At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall cause
to be filed all agreements, instruments, certificates and other documents, in
form and substance satisfactory to Acquiror (acting reasonably), that are
necessary or appropriate to effect the release of all Liens set forth in
_Schedule_ __ _ 7.10(b)_.

 

7.11 _Third Party Expenses_.

 

(a) Whether or not the Merger are consummated, each party shall be responsible
for its own expenses and costs that it incurs (and whether paid prior to, at
or after the Effective Time) with respect to the negotiation, execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement, other than the Securityholder
Representative to the extent the Securityholders are responsible for such
amounts pursuant to this Agreement or any Securityholder Representative
Engagement Agreement. Without limiting or expanding the foregoing, the
Securityholders shall be responsible for all Third Party Expenses, which will
be payable at the Closing pursuant to a dollar-for-dollar adjustment to the
Merger Consideration otherwise payable hereunder. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Third Party Expenses_ " means all fees and expenses incurred by
or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary (or any

 



69

    

CONFIDENTIAL

 



of their successors), whether or not paid or payable prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including: (i) all legal, accounting,
financial advisory, consulting, finders and all other fees and expenses of
third parties incurred by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary in
connection with the negotiation and effectuation of the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to
agreements entered into by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time; (ii) any bonus, severance,
change-in-control payments, accelerated commissions, or similar payment
obligations (including payments with either "single-trigger" or "double-
trigger" provisions (other than "double-trigger" provisions in Contracts Made
Available and set forth in the Disclosure Schedule)) of the Company or any
Subsidiary to Employees resulting from, or in connection with, the
transactions contemplated hereby (in each case, that are adopted by the
Company (and not Acquiror or any of its Affiliates) at or prior to the
Closing); (iii) any payments in connection with any change in control
obligations resulting from or in connection with the Merger or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any payment or consideration
arising under or in relation to obtaining any consents, waivers or approvals
of any party under any Contract of the Company or any Subsidiary as are
required in connection with the Merger for any such Contract to remain in full
force and effect following the Closing or resulting from agreed-upon
modification or early termination of any such Contract, in each case, pursuant
to any Contract entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at or
prior to the Closing; (iv) the costs and expenses of the Company DandO Tail
Policy to the extent not paid by the Company prior to the Closing Date; and
(v) the Required Financials Expenses; _provided_ , _however_ , that Third
Party Expenses shall exclude (A) Excluded Severance Costs, (B) any fees and
expenses of the Exchange Agent and the Escrow Agent, and (C) the Retention
Bonus Pool Awards. For the avoidance of doubt, no fees and expenses shall be
double counted when calculating Third Party Expenses. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to (x) pay or cause to be paid all Third Party
Expenses at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing and, (y) to the
extent such amounts are not so paid, arrange for the payment, contemporaneous
with the Closing, by or on behalf of the Company of all Third Party Expenses.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, and for the avoidance of
doubt, if the lessor or licensor under any Lease Agreement conditions its
grant of a consent (including by threatening to exercise a "recapture" or
other termination right) upon, or otherwise requires in response to a notice
or consent request regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, the payment of a consent fee, "profit sharing" payment or other
consideration (including increased rent payments), or the provision of
additional security (including a guaranty), the Company shall be solely
responsible for making all such payments or providing all such additional
security and the terms thereof shall be subject to Acquirors approval.

(b) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, (i) the Company
shall provide Acquiror with a statement, in a form satisfactory to Acquiror
(acting reasonably), certified by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer of the Company, setting forth all paid and unpaid Third
Party Expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary as of
the Closing Date, or anticipated to be incurred or payable by or on behalf of
the Company or any Subsidiary (or any of their successors) after the Closing
(the " _Statement of Expenses_ "), and (ii) the Company shall obtain from each
advisor, counsel, accountant, or other professional service provider owed
Third Party Expenses, and deliver to Acquiror, a final invoice or other final
statement indicating that such amounts reflected thereon are all amounts owed
to such Person in respect of Third Party Expenses, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Acquiror, setting the amounts required to pay off in
full on the Closing Date the Third Party Expenses owing to such Person and
wire transfer information for such payment, and attaching duly completed and
executed copies of any necessary Tax forms, including IRS Form W-9 or the
appropriate series of IRS Form W-8, as applicable (each a " _Final Invoice_
"). The Company shall take all necessary action to ensure that Third
Party Expenses shall not be incurred by the Surviving Corporation after the
Closing Date without the express prior written consent of Acquiror. No
Subsidiary shall incur any Third Party Expenses.

 

7.12 _Pre-Closing Actions_. Prior to Closing, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to perform the actions described on _Schedule_ __ _
7.12_ (the " _Pre-Closing Actions_").

 



70

    

CONFIDENTIAL

 



7.13 _Access to Information_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall
afford Acquiror and its Representatives access to, upon reasonable notice
during business hours, (i) all of the Employees, customers, suppliers, assets,
properties, Books and Records and Contracts of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and (ii) all other information concerning the business, assets,
properties and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Acquiror may
reasonably request. The Company agrees to provide to Acquiror and its
accountants, counsel and other Representatives copies of its internal
financial statements (including Tax Returns and supporting documentation)
promptly upon request. Acquiror shall hold any such information provided by
or on behalf of the Company to Acquiror or its representatives in accordance
with the provisions of the Non-Disclosure Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not have any obligation to provide Acquiror with
any such access or information if providing such access or information would
(i) be prohibited under applicable Law or fiduciary duty or (ii) cause the
Company to waive any attorney-client or other legal privilege. 

7.14 _Notification of Certain Matters_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the
Company shall give prompt notice to Acquiror of: (a) the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which results in
in the failure of any representation or warranty of the Company contained in
this Agreement to be true or accurate at or prior to the Effective Time such
that the condition in _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)(ii)_ cannot be satisfied;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the failure of the Company to give such notice
shall not be deemed to be a breach of a covenant hereunder but instead shall
only constitute a breach of the underlying representation or warranty that was
the subject of such failure to give such notice, and (b) any failure of the
Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.14_ shall not (i) limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to the
party receiving such notice or (ii) constitute an acknowledgment or admission
of a breach of this Agreement. No disclosure by or on behalf of the Company
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.14_ or otherwise of any breach, inaccuracy,
failure to be true, or failure to comply (or any waiver thereof) shall affect
or be deemed to qualify, limit, waive, modify, amend or supplement any
representation, warranty, or covenant contained herein or in the Disclosure
Schedule, the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the
Merger in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement, or the
rights of Acquiror or any Indemnified Party under this Agreement, except to
the extent set forth in the Disclosure Schedule or expressly waived pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement.

 

7.15 _Closing Date Balance Sheet_.

 

(a) No later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Acquiror a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, in a form reasonably acceptable to
Acquiror and certified by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer of the Company, that has been prepared in accordance with
the Accounting Principles and that fairly presents an estimate by the Company
in good faith based on reasonable assumptions of the consolidated balance
sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date, after giving effect to the
Closing (the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "). The Closing Date Balance
Sheet shall also include a good faith calculation, in reasonable detail, of
the Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount (the " _Estimated Closing
Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount_ ") and each of the components and
subcomponents thereof. The Company shall not take or fail to take any action
with the intention or for the purpose of manipulating the Closing Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount (it being understood that efforts to maximize
Closing Net Working Capital in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice will not be deemed to be manipulative). No later than ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
Acquiror a preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet. The Company shall consider
in good faith any of Acquirors reasonable comments to such preliminary
Closing Date Balance Sheet and the figures and calculations set forth thereon
and provide any additional supporting documentation reasonably requested by
Acquiror. The Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount shall take into account any adjustments to
the preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet requested by Acquiror in good
faith and not otherwise rejected by the Company in its good faith

 



71

    

CONFIDENTIAL

 



determination. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7.15_, including the fact that
Acquiror may provide comments or request changes to the preliminary Closing
Date Balance Sheet or any of the figures or calculations set forth thereon or
that Acquiror and the Company may agree to changes to the information or
amounts on the Closing Date Balance Sheet, shall in any way limit the right
of any Person under this _Section_ __ _ 7.15_ or _Article_ __ _ IX_.

 

(b) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Acquiror shall deliver to
the Securityholder Representative a statement (the " _Post-Closing Statement_
") setting forth Acquirors good faith calculation of (i) the Closing Net
Working Capital Adjustment Amount and each of the components and subcomponents
thereof, and (ii) proposed Closing Net Working Capital Surplus or proposed
Closing Net Working Capital Shortfall, as applicable, and each of the
components thereof. The Post-Closing Statement and Acquirors calculation of
the Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount and each of the components
thereof shall be determined in accordance with the Accounting Principles.

(c) During the forty-five (45) day period following delivery of the Post-
Closing Statement to the Securityholder Representative, Acquiror shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with the Securityholder Representative and its Representatives to
provide them with information used in preparing the Post-Closing Statement
reasonably requested by the Securityholder Representative and its
Representatives including, upon reasonable advance notice, reasonable access
during normal business hours to relevant personnel and records of Acquiror
and the Company. The Post-Closing Statement shall become final and binding at
the end of the thirtieth (30th) day following delivery thereof, unless prior
to the end of such period, the Securityholder Representative delivers to
Acquiror written notice of its disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ")
specifying the nature and amount of any disputed item. The Securityholder
Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts in
the Post-Closing Statement not specifically referenced in the Notice of
Disagreement, and such items and amounts shall not be subject to review
under  _Section_ __ _ 7.15(e)_.

(d) During the fifteen (15) day period following delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement by the Securityholder Representative to Acquiror, the parties
shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences that they may
have with respect to the matters specified therein. During such fifteen (15)
day period, the Securityholder Representative and the Company Securityholders
shall, and shall cause their Representatives to, cooperate with Acquiror and
its Representatives to provide them with information used in the preparation
of such Notice of Disagreement reasonably requested by Acquiror or its
Representatives including, upon reasonable advance notice, reasonable access
during normal business hours to relevant personnel and records of the
Securityholder Representative and its Representatives. Any disputed
items resolved in writing between the Securityholder Representative and
Acquiror within such fifteen (15) day period shall be final and binding with
respect to such items, and if the Securityholder Representative and Acquiror
agree in writing on the resolution of each disputed item specified in the
Notice of Disagreement, the amount so determined shall be final and binding on
the parties for all purposes hereunder.

 

(e) If the Securityholder Representative and Acquiror have not resolved all
such differences by the end of such fifteen (15) day period (or such later
period if extended in a writing signed by the Securityholder Representative
and Acquiror) (the " _Resolution Deadline_ "), the Securityholder
Representative and Acquiror shall submit, in writing, to a
nationally recognized public accounting firm agreed upon in writing by the
Securityholder Representative and Acquiror (each acting reasonably) (the "
_Accounting Firm_ ") their briefs detailing their views as to the correct
nature and amount of each item remaining in dispute, and the Accounting Firm
shall make a written determination as to each such disputed item and the
amount so disputed (in each case, if and to the extent disputed), which
determination shall be final and binding on the parties for all purposes
hereunder. The Accounting Firms determination of the Closing Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount, and each of the components thereof, shall be
determined in accordance with the Accounting Principles. The Accounting Firm
shall be authorized to resolve only those items remaining in dispute between
the parties in

 



72

    

CONFIDENTIAL

 



accordance with the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.15(e)_,
which resolution shall be either the amount of such disputed item as proposed
by Acquiror in the Post-Closing Statement or the amount of such disputed item
as proposed by the Securityholder Representative in the Notice of
Disagreement. The determination of the Accounting Firm shall be accompanied
by a certificate of the Accounting Firm that it reached such determination in
accordance with the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.15(e)_. The
Securityholder Representative and Acquiror shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to render a written decision
resolving the matters submitted to it within thirty (30) days following the
submission thereof. Judgment may be entered upon the written determination of
the Accounting Firm in any competent court. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the costs of any dispute resolution pursuant to
this subsection, including the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm and
of any enforcement of the determination thereof, shall be borne by Acquiror
and the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders) in
inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved by the

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Final Closing Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount_ " means the Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount,
as finally determined in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 7.15_. The

(i) If the Final Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount is less than
the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount set forth in the
Payment Spreadsheet and used to calculate the Total Closing Consideration (the
amount (if any) by which Final Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount
is less than the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount
set forth in the Payment Spreadsheet and used to calculate the Total Closing
Consideration, the " _Closing Net Working Capital Shortfall_ "), then Acquiror
shall recover the Closing Net Working Capital Shortfall from the Indemnity
Escrow Shares then-remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, which shall be
Acquirors sole recourse in case of any Closing Net Working Capital Shortfall.
Promptly after the final determination of the Final Closing Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount, Acquiror and the Securityholder Representative
shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to release to
Acquiror that number of Indemnity Escrow Shares contemplated by this _Section_
__ _ 7.15(f)(i)_, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares (with
each Indemnity Escrow Share being valued at the Acquiror Share Price).

(ii) If the Final Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount is greater
than the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount set forth in
the Payment Spreadsheet and used to calculate the Total Closing Consideration
(the amount (if any) by which Final Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment
Amount is greater than the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment
Amount set forth in the Payment Spreadsheet and used to calculate the Total
Closing Consideration, the " _Closing Net Working Capital Surplus_ "), then
Acquiror shall issue to the Indemnifying Parties that number of Acquiror
Ordinary Shares equal to the quotient obtained by _dividing_ (A) the Closing
Net Working Capital Surplus, _by _ (B) the Acquiror Share Price, rounded down
to the nearest whole number of shares, with each Indemnifying Party to receive
that number of shares contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 1.3_.

 

(iii) If the Final Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount is equal to
the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount set forth in the
Payment Spreadsheet and used to calculate the Total Closing Consideration at
the Closing, then there shall be no adjustments or further obligations under
this _Section_ __ _ 7.15_.

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.15_,

Certificate of Incorporation and Restated Bylaws, and during such six-year

in any manner except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or required
by applicable Law. Any claims for indemnification made under such
indemnification agreements or the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the

or sustained in respect of any Dissenting Shares, including all attorneys and
consultants fees, costs and expenses and including any such fees, costs and
expenses incurred in connection with investigating, defending against or
settling any claim, action or proceeding in respect of Dissenting Shares, or
(z) any Action by a third-party, including the investigation, defense, or
prosecution, but not any settlement thereof, if an adverse judgment in
connection with such Claim Action could give the Indemnified Parties a claim
for indemnification under either clause (x) or (y) of this _Section_ __ _
9.2(a)(vi)_; 

(vii) any Fraud in respect of a representation or warranty set forth in
_Article_ __ _ III_ of this Agreement, any certificate referenced in this

in this Agreement; or

(ix) any Pre-Closing Taxes. 

(b) No Indemnifying Party (including any officer or director of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries) shall have any right of contribution,
indemnification or right of advancement from Acquiror or any of its Affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation) with respect to any Loss due and payable
by such Indemnifying Party under this _Article_ __ _ IX_ in his, her, or its

(c) Any payments made to an Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification
obligations under this _Article_ __ _ IX_ will be treated as adjustments to
the Total Consideration for Tax purposes and such agreed treatment will govern
for purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise required by Laws.

(d) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, this _Article_ __ _ IX_ shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties against the Indemnifying
Parties from and after the Effective Time in connection with a claim arising
under this Agreement, including claims of any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) this _Section_ __ _ 9.2(d)_ shall not be deemed a waiver
by any party of any right to specific performance or injunctive relief as
contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 11.9_, and (ii) nothing in this Agreement
shall limit the liability of an Indemnifying Party (and this _Article_ __ _
IX _shall not be the sole and exclusive remedy in respect of
such Indemnifying Party) for Fraud committed by such Indemnifying Party or of
which Fraud such Indemnifying Party had actual knowledge.

(e) For purposes of this _Article_ __ _ IX_ only, when determining the
amount of Losses suffered by an Indemnified Party as a result of any, or
whether there occurred any, breach or inaccuracy of a representation or
warranty or any failure to perform or comply with any covenant or agreement
applicable that is qualified or limited in scope as to materiality or Company
Material Adverse Effect or similar qualification, such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement shall be deemed to be made without such
qualification or limitation.

(f) In the event an Indemnified Party has suffered a Loss which would
give rise to a right to be indemnified under more than one of the subclauses
of _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_, such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to make a
claim for such Losses under any and all such subclauses; _provided_ that, for
the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in no event shall any Indemnified Party be entitled to any double
recovery with respect to any particular Loss or claim. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall require any Indemnified Party to make
any claim under this _Article_ __ _ IX_ and, subject to the survival periods
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, no such claim shall be waived or otherwise
prejudiced as a result of any delay in making such claim.

(g) Subject to the other applicable provisions regarding indemnification
contained in this _Article_ __ _ IX_, if the Indemnifying Parties are
obligated to reimburse or compensate the Indemnified Parties for any Losses in
connection with a claim by any of the Indemnified Parties under this
_Article_ __ _ IX_, then indemnification for such Losses shall, subject to
the applicable limitations, if any, set forth in this _Article_ __ _ IX_, be
satisfied _first_ from the Indemnity Escrow Fund, and _second_ , to the
extent the Indemnity Escrow Fund is insufficient to satisfy such claims, by
asserting claims directly against one or more Indemnifying Parties, in each
case, subject to the limitations set forth in this  _Article_ __ _ IX_. For
purposes of satisfaction of indemnification claims under this _Article_ __ _
IX _and determining the limitations on liability set forth in this _Article_
__ _ IX_, the Indemnity Escrow Shares and any other Acquiror Ordinary Shares
issued pursuant to this Agreement shall be valued at the Acquiror Share Price.

 

(h) The rights of the Indemnified Parties to indemnification, compensation,
reimbursement, or payment of Losses or any other remedy under this Agreement
shall not be affected by any investigation or examination conducted with
respect to, or any knowledge possessed or acquired (or capable of being
possessed or acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, by or on behalf of any of the
Indemnified Parties or any of their Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy or breach of, or
compliance with, any representation, warranty, certification, covenant, or
any other matter. The waiver of any condition in this Agreement based on the
accuracy of any such representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any such covenant or agreement, will not affect the right to
indemnification, compensation, reimbursement, or payment of Losses, or any
other remedy based on any such representation, warranty, certification,
covenant, or agreement. Except in the case of Fraud, no

Indemnified Party shall be required to show reliance on any representation,
warranty, certification, or other agreement in order for such Indemnified
Party to be entitled to indemnification, compensation, reimbursement, or
payment hereunder.

 

9.3 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(f)_, the Indemnified Parties, as a group,
may not recover any Losses pursuant to a claim under _Section_ __ _

9.2(a)(iii)_, or _Section_ __ _ 9.5(c)_, (i) unless and until the
Indemnified Parties, as a group, shall have paid, incurred, suffered or
sustained at least $1,000,000 in Losses in the aggregate (the " _Deductible_
"), in which case, subject to the other applicable limitations herein, the
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover Losses paid, incurred,
suffered or sustained by the Indemnified Parties as a group in excess of the
Deductible, and (ii) unless such claim or series of related claims exceeds
$100,000 (the " _Per Claim Threshold_ "), in which case, subject to the other
applicable limitations herein, the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
recover all Losses, including the Per Claim Threshold, paid, incurred,
suffered or sustained by the Indemnified Parties with respect to such claim
or series of related claims. For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations set

through _(ix)_ of _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_, inclusive.

 

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(f)_, the Indemnified Parties sole and

9.2(a)(vi)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(viii)_, and  _Section_ __ _ 9.5(c)_

doubt, the limitations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_ shall not
apply to claims under subclause (x) of _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(ii)_, clauses
_(iii)_ , _(iv)_ , _(v)_ , _(vii)_ and _(ix)_ of _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_, or
clauses _(x)_ or _(y)_ of  _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(vi)_ and the Indemnified
Parties shall, subject to the other applicable limitations herein, be
permitted to recover directly from the Indemnifying Parties for claims under
subclause (x) of  _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(ii)_, clauses _(iii)_ , _(iv)_ ,
_(v)_ , _(vii)_ and _(ix)_ of _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_, or clauses _(x)_ or
_(y)_ of  _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(vi)_, in each case, only up to such
Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion of such claim.

(c) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(f)_, the aggregate liability of each
Indemnifying Party for indemnification claims recovered directly from such
Indemnifying Party under _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_ (excluding, for
the avoidance of doubt, claims recovered from the Indemnity Escrow Fund)
shall be limited, in the aggregate, to a dollar amount equal to the sum of (i)
the value of the Acquiror Ordinary Shares issued or issuable (including any
Indemnity Escrow Shares transferred from the Escrow Agent) to such
Indemnifying Party (or his, her, or its designee, assignee, transferee, or
successor in interest), _plus_ (ii) any and all amounts deducted or withheld
in respect of Taxes or any Loan Repayment Amount with respect to such
Indemnifying Party, _plus_ (iii) such Indemnifying Partys aggregate Per Share
Expense Contribution.

 

(d) The amount of any Loss payable under this _Article_ __ _ IX_ by an
Indemnifying Party shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the
Indemnified Party from insurance policies, net of the following: (i) third
party costs and expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Indemnified Party
or its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives in procuring
such recovery; (ii) any increases in premiums or premium adjustments to the
extent attributable to such recovery (applicable to any past, present or
future premiums); and (iii) deductibles and other amounts incurred in
connection with such recovery; _provided_ , _however_ that, other than with
respect to the Company DandO Tail Policy, the Indemnified Parties shall have no
obligation to seek recovery under any insurance policies or to maintain any
insurance policies for any period of time.

(e) The Indemnified Parties shall, to the extent required by applicable Law,
use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate Losses indemnifiable under
this _Article_ __ _ IX_; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything else herein to the contrary, other than with respect to
the Company DandO Tail Policy, in no event shall any of the Indemnified Parties
be required to assert any claim or otherwise

 



82

    

CONFIDENTIAL

 



seek recourse any against any current or former insurers, insurance policies,
customers, suppliers, resellers, vendors, partners, commercial
counterparties, or other Representatives of any of the Indemnified Parties or
their respective Affiliates.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement
shall limit (i) the liability of an Indemnifying Party for Fraud committed by
such Indemnifying Party or of which Fraud such Indemnifying Party had actual
knowledge, or (ii) the right of Acquiror or any other Indemnified Party to
pursue remedies under any Related Agreement against the parties
thereto. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, but subject to
_Section_ __ _ 8.3_, if the Merger is not consummated, nothing in this
_Article_ __ _ IX_ shall limit the liability of any party hereto for
any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
in this Agreement, any Related Agreement (against the parties thereto) or any
certificates or other instruments executed and delivered by any party in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

9.4 _Claim Procedures_.

 

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.3_, if an
Indemnified Party wishes to make a claim under this  _Article_ __ _ IX_,
such Indemnified Party shall deliver a written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ")
to the Securityholder Representative (i) stating that an Indemnified Party has
paid, incurred, suffered or sustained, or reasonably anticipates that it may
pay, incur, suffer or sustain Losses, and (ii) to the extent reasonably
available, specifying such Losses in reasonable detail, the date that each
such Loss was paid, incurred, suffered or sustained, or the basis for such
anticipated Losses, and, if applicable, the nature of the misrepresentation,
breach of warranty or covenant or other indemnifiable matter. Acquiror may
update a Claim Notice from time to time to reflect any change in
circumstances following the date thereof. A failure by an Indemnified Party to
give complete, accurate, or, subject to the survival periods set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 9.1_, timely notice of a Claim Notice will not affect the
rights or obligations of any party hereunder. If a claim under this _Article_
__ _ IX_ may be brought under different or multiple sections, clauses
or sub-clauses of _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_ (or with respect to different or
multiple representations, warrants or covenants), then the Indemnified Parties
shall have the right to bring such claim under any or each such section,
clause, subclauses, representation, warranty or covenant (each a " _Subject
Provision_ ") that it chooses and the Indemnified Parties will not be
precluded from seeking indemnification under any Subject Provision by virtue
of the Indemnified Parties not being entitled to seek indemnification under
any other Subject Provision.

(b) If the Securityholder Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying
Parties shall not object in writing within thirty (30) days of delivery of a
Claim Notice by delivery of a written notice of objection containing a
reasonably detailed description of the facts and circumstances supporting an
objection to the applicable claim (a " _Claim Objection Notice_ "), such
failure to so object shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment by the
Securityholder Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount of the claim for Losses set
forth in such Claim Notice (an " _Unobjected Claim_ "). In such event,
Acquiror and the Securityholder Representative shall, as promptly as
practicable thereafter (and in any event within two (2) Business Days
thereafter), deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to
release to Acquiror from the Indemnity Escrow Fund that number of Indemnity
Escrow Shares having an aggregate value equal to the amount of Losses set
forth in the Unobjected Claim. Should the Indemnity Escrow Shares then-
remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, if any, be insufficient to satisfy in
whole the full amount of Losses set forth in the Unobjected Claim, then,
subject to any applicable limitations set forth in this _Article_ __ _ IX_,
each Indemnifying Party shall, within ten (10) Business Days following the
date of such failure to so object, pay to Acquiror in cash such Indemnifying
Partys Pro Rata Portion of such shortfall.

(c) In the event that the Securityholder Representative shall deliver a Claim
Objection Notice in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.4(b)_, the
Securityholder Representative and Acquiror shall attempt in good faith to
agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such
claims. If the Securityholder

 



83

    

CONFIDENTIAL

 



Representative and Acquiror should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties (a " _Resolution
Memorandum_ "). In such event, Acquiror and the Securityholder Representative
shall, as promptly as practicable thereafter (and in any event within two (2)
Business Days thereafter), deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow
Agent to release to Acquiror from the Indemnity Escrow Fund that number of
Indemnity Escrow Shares having an aggregate value equal to the amount of
Losses set forth in the Resolution Memorandum. Should the Indemnity Escrow
Shares then-remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, if any, be insufficient to
satisfy in whole the full amount of Losses set forth in the Resolution
Memorandum, then, subject to any applicable limitations set forth in this
_Article_ __ _ IX_, each Indemnifying Party shall, within ten (10) Business
Days following the date of such Resolution Memorandum, pay to Acquiror in cash
such Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion of such shortfall.

9.5 _Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) In the event that Acquiror becomes aware of third-party written claim
against an Indemnified Party that constitutes a matter for which either (i)
an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification, compensation, or
reimbursement under _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_ or (ii) if determined adversely to
Acquiror or any other Indemnified Party, would provide a basis for a claim
under any of the matters indemnifiable under _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_ (each, a
" _Third Party Claim_ "), Acquiror shall provide the Securityholder
Representative notice of such Third Party Claim and Acquiror shall have the
right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense and prosecution of and to
settle or resolve any such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that a
failure by Acquiror to give, or a delay in giving, such notice will not
affect the liability of the Indemnifying Parties hereunder, except to the
extent and only to the extent the Securityholder Representative demonstrates
that the defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim is materially
prejudiced thereby. The Securityholder Representative shall have the right to
receive copies of all pleadings, material written notices, and material
written communications with respect to any Third Party Claim to the extent
that receipt of such documents does not affect any privilege of or relating
to any Indemnified Party, subject to the execution by the Securityholder
Representative of Acquirors (and, if required, such third partys)
standard non-disclosure agreement, and shall be entitled, at the expense of
the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of Indemnifying Parties), to
participate in, but not to determine or conduct, any defense or prosecution
of the Third Party Claim or settlement negotiations with respect to the Third
Party Claim.

(b) Except with the consent of the Securityholder Representative, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed, and which shall be
deemed to have been given unless the Securityholder Representative shall have
objected in writing within ten (10) Business Days after a written request for
such consent by Acquiror, the amount paid in the settlement or resolution of
any such Third Party Claim to the third-party claimant shall not be
determinative of the amount of Losses relating to such matter or whether such
Losses are indemnifiable under this _Article_ __ _ IX_. In the event that the
Securityholder Representative has consented to (or shall have been deemed to
have consented to) any such settlement or resolution: (i) neither the
Securityholder Representative nor the Indemnifying Parties shall have any
power or authority to object under any provision of this _Article_ __ _ IX_
to the amount of any claim by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party
against the Indemnity Escrow Fund or directly against such Indemnifying
Parties for indemnity with respect to such settlement or resolution, subject
to the limitations in this _Article_ __ _ IX_; (ii) Acquiror and the
Securityholder Representative shall, as promptly as practicable thereafter
(and in any event within two (2) Business Days thereafter), deliver a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent to release to Acquiror from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund that number of Indemnity Escrow Shares having an
aggregate value equal to the amount of Losses set forth in such settlement or
resolution; and (iii) should the Indemnity Escrow Shares then-remaining in the
Indemnity Escrow Fund, if any, be insufficient to satisfy in whole the full
amount set forth in such settlement or resolution, then, subject to any
applicable limitations set forth in this _Article_ __ _ IX_, each
Indemnifying Party shall, within fifteen (15) Business Days following the
date of such consent or deemed consent, pay to Acquiror in cash such
Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion of such shortfall.

 



84

    

CONFIDENTIAL

 



(c) Without limiting any other provision in this Agreement or any right of
recovery under _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_, from and after and by virtue of the
Merger, the Indemnifying Parties agree, severally and not jointly to indemnify
and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from and against all reasonable and
documented costs and expenses, including attorneys, consultants, experts
and other professionals fees and expenses (including in connection with
investigation, defending against, and prosecuting) and court or
arbitration costs paid, incurred, suffered or sustained by the Indemnified
Parties, or any of them directly or indirectly resulting from, arising out of,
or relating to any Third Party Claim. For the avoidance of doubt, this 
_Section_ __ _ 9.5(c)_ does not provide any indemnification for any amounts
owing pursuant to a settlement of any Third Party Claim to which the
Securityholder Representative does not consent (including deemed consent).

 

 _9.6_ _Distribution of the_ _Indemnity Escrow Fund_. On or prior to the date
that is five (5) Business Days after the Expiration Date, Acquiror and the
Securityholder Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint
written instruction to release from the Indemnity Escrow Fund that number of
Indemnity Escrow Shares equal to (a) the Indemnity Escrow Shares then-
remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, _less_ (b) the number of Indemnity
Escrow Shares that would reasonably be required to satisfy Indemnifying
Parties indemnification obligations under  _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_ for
pending claims specified in Claim Notices delivered prior to the end of the
Expiration Date that have not been resolved prior to the Expiration Date (the
number of Indemnity Escrow Shares to be released, the " _Initial Indemnity
Escrow Release_ _Shares_ ", it being understood that, if the foregoing
calculation of "Initial Indemnity Escrow Release Shares" results in a negative
number, then "Initial Indemnity Escrow Release Shares" means zero (0)
Indemnity Escrow Shares), and transfer to the Indemnifying Parties the Initial
Indemnity Escrow Release Shares in accordance with their respective Escrow Pro
Rata Portion. Upon the resolution of any pending claims for which Indemnity
Escrow was withheld and retained in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, and after any
distributions from the Indemnity Escrow Fund to the Indemnified Parties in
accordance with this _Article_ __ _ IX_ with respect to such claims,
Acquiror and the Securityholder Representative shall deliver to the Escrow
Agent a joint written instruction to release from the Indemnity Escrow Fund,
the remaining Indemnity Escrow Shares that were withheld with respect to
such resolved claim (each such shares so released the " _Subsequent Indemnity
Escrow Release Shares_ "), and transfer to the Indemnifying Parties the
Subsequent Indemnity Escrow Release Shares in accordance with their respective
Escrow Pro Rata Portion. Upon the resolution of all pending claims for which
Indemnity Escrow was withheld and retained in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, and
after any distributions from the Indemnity Escrow Fund to the Indemnified
Parties in accordance with this  _Article_ __ _ IX_, Acquiror and the
Securityholder Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint
written instruction to release from the Indemnity Escrow Fund all then-
remaining Indemnity Escrow Shares in the Indemnity Escrow Fund (the " _Final
Indemnity Escrow Release Shares_ "), and transfer to the Indemnifying Parties
the Final Indemnity Escrow Release Shares in accordance with their respective
Escrow Pro Rata Portion. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
aggregate number of Indemnity Escrow Shares to be transferred to any
Indemnifying Party at any particular time in accordance with this _Section_ __
_ 9.6_ shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares and, to
the extent there are any Indemnity Escrow Shares remaining as a result of such
rounding, such remaining shares shall be transferred to Acquiror for no
consideration and the Indemnifying Parties shall have no right or interest in
or to such shares.

ARTICLE X

 

 _SECURITYHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE_

 

10.1 _Appointment and Authority of_ _Securityholder Representative_. By virtue
of the execution and delivery of a Joinder Agreement, the adoption of this
Agreement and approval of the Merger by the Stockholders, or the conversion of
the Company Securities into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and
participating in the Merger and receiving the benefits thereof, each of the
Securityholders shall be deemed to have agreed, and hereby agree, to appoint
Shareholder Representative Services LLC as her, his, or its lawful and
exclusive representative, agent, proxy, and attorney-in-fact (with full power
of substitution) for and on behalf of each of the

 



85

    

CONFIDENTIAL

 



Securityholders for all purposes in connection with this Agreement and the
agreements ancillary hereto, including (a) to give and receive notices and
communications in respect of all Relevant Matters, including any claim for
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement by any Indemnified Party hereunder
against any Indemnifying Party or by any such Indemnifying Party against any
Indemnified Party or any dispute between any Indemnified Party and any such
Indemnifying Party, in each case under or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (b) to authorize or object to any claims
hereunder, including those by any Indemnified Party, (c) to agree to,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration
and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to
any Relevant Matter, including any claim for indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement by any Indemnified Party hereunder against any Indemnifying Party or
by any such Indemnifying Party against any Indemnified Party or any
dispute between any Indemnified Party and any such Indemnifying Party, in
each case under or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, (d) consent or agree to any amendment to this Agreement at any time,
(e) grant any extension or waiver under or in connection with this Agreement,
and (f) and to take all other actions that are either (i) necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Securityholder Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing or in connection with this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement or the Securityholder Representative Engagement Agreement, or
(ii) specifically mandated, permitted, or contemplated by the terms of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Securityholder Representative
shall have no obligation to act on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties, except
as expressly provided herein, in the Escrow Agreement, or in the
Securityholder Representative Engagement Agreement. The powers,
immunities and rights to indemnification granted to the Securityholder
Representative Group hereunder: (i) are coupled with an interest and shall be
irrevocable and survive the death, incompetence, bankruptcy or liquidation of
any Indemnifying Party and shall be binding on any successor thereto, and
(ii) shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any Indemnifying Party of
the whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in the Indemnity Escrow
Fund. The Securityholder Representative may resign at any time. Such agency
may be changed by the Indemnifying Parties from time to time upon not less
than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Acquiror; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Securityholder Representative may not be removed without the
agreement of the Indemnifying Parties having a majority of the aggregate Pro
Rata Portion to such removal and to the identity of the substituted agent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a vacancy in the position of Securityholder
Representative may be filled by Indemnifying Parties having a majority of the
aggregate Pro Rata Portion. No bond shall be required of the Securityholder
Representative. Notices or communications to or from the
Securityholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from the
Indemnifying Parties.

_10.2_ _Exculpation_ _and Indemnification of _ _Securityholder_
_Representative_. Certain Indemnifying Parties have entered, or will enter,
into an engagement agreement (the " _Securityholder Representative Engagement
Agreement_ ") with the Securityholder Representative to provide direction to
the Securityholder Representative in connection with its services under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, and the Securityholder Representative
Engagement Agreement (such Indemnifying Parties, including their individual
representatives, collectively hereinafter referred to as the " _Advisory
Group_ "). The Securityholders agree that neither the Securityholder
Representative nor its members, managers, directors, officers,
contractors, agents and employees nor any member of the Advisory Group
(collectively, the " _Securityholder Representative Group_ ") shall incur any
liability of any kind with respect to any action or omission by the
Securityholder Representative in connection with the Securityholder
Representatives services pursuant to this Agreement and any agreements
ancillary hereto, except in the event of liability directly resulting from the
Securityholder Representatives fraud, gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Indemnifying Parties shall indemnify and defend the
Securityholder Representative and hold the Securityholder Representative
harmless from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims,
penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses (including
the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense
of document location, duplication and shipment and costs incurred in
connection with seeking recovery from insurers) (collectively, "
_Securityholder Representative Expenses_ ") arising out of or in connection
with the Securityholder Representatives execution and performance of this
Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such
Securityholder Representative Expense is suffered or

 



86

    

CONFIDENTIAL

 



incurred; _provided_ that in the event that any such Securityholder
Representative Expense is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by
the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Securityholder
Representative, the Securityholder Representative will reimburse the
Indemnifying Parties the amount of such indemnified Securityholder
Representative Expense to the extent attributable to such fraud, gross
negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Securityholder
Representative Group by the Indemnifying Parties, any such
Securityholder Representative Expenses may be recovered by the Securityholder
Representative from (i) the funds in the Expense Fund and (ii) the Indemnity
Escrow Fund at such time as remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable
to the Indemnifying Parties; provided, that while this section allows the
Securityholder Representative Group to be paid from the aforementioned sources
of funds, this does not relieve the Indemnifying Parties from their obligation
to promptly pay such Securityholder Representative Expenses as they are
suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Securityholder Representative
Group from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no
event will the Securityholder Representative be required to advance its own
funds on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties or otherwise. Furthermore, the
Securityholders agree that the Securityholder Representative shall not be
required to take any action unless the Securityholder Representative has
been provided with funds, security or indemnities which, in its
determination, are sufficient to protect the Securityholder Representative
against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by the
Securityholder Representative in performing such actions. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on
liability or indemnification obligations of, or provisions limiting the
recourse against non-parties otherwise applicable to, the Indemnifying
Parties set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be
applicable to the indemnities provided to the Securityholder Representative
under this section. The foregoing indemnities will survive the Closing, the
resignation or removal of the Securityholder Representative or any member of
the Advisory Group and the Closing or the termination of this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Securityholder Representative, including an amendment, extension or waiver of

need to know such information in connection with the Securityholder

the extent as may be (i) contractually required under the terms of such
Securityholders limited partnership or similar organizational agreement, or
(ii) reasonably necessary in the good faith exercise of the fiduciary duties
of the general partner or similar fiduciary of such Securityholder. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company and Acquiror will consult with each other
before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment
upon, any written press release or written public statement with respect to

party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c)

the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a

constitute or give rise to an extension or waiver of any rights or
obligations hereunder except to the extent specifically provided in such
writing (it being understood that all such other non-waived rights and
obligations are expressly reserved). For purposes of this _Section_ __ _
11.6_, the Securityholders are deemed to have agreed that any extension or
waiver signed by the Company (if prior to Closing) or the Securityholder
Representative (if after the Closing) shall be binding upon and effective
against all Securityholders whether or not they have signed such extension or
waiver.

11.7  _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law
or otherwise.

11.8 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further

provision.

remedies expressly conferred herein upon a party hereto shall be deemed to be
cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy conferred hereby, or
by law or in equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party hereto of any
one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

11.10 _Governing_ _Law_. This Agreement, and all claims, causes of action
(whether in contract, tort or statute) or other matter that may result from,
arise out of, be in connection with or relating to this Agreement, any Related

Each party agrees not to commence any legal proceedings with respect to a
Relevant Matter except in such Court of Chancery (or, only if the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, in any federal court within the State of Delaware). By
execution and delivery of this Agreement, each party hereto and the
Securityholders irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts and to the appellate courts therefrom solely for
the purposes of disputes in connection with any Relevant Matter and not as a
general submission to such jurisdiction or with respect to any other dispute,
matter or claim whatsoever. The parties hereto and the Securityholders
irrevocably consent to the service of process out of any of the aforementioned
courts in any such action or proceeding by the delivery of copies thereof by
overnight courier to the address for such party to which notices are
deliverable hereunder. Any such service of process shall be effective upon
delivery. Nothing herein shall affect the right to serve process in any other
manner permitted by Law. The parties hereto and the Securityholders hereby
waive any right to stay or dismiss any action or proceeding in connection with
any Relevant Matter brought before the foregoing courts on the basis of (i)
any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-
named courts for any reason or that it or any of its property is immune from
the above-described legal process, (ii) that such action or proceeding is
brought in an inconvenient forum, that venue for the action or proceeding is
improper or that this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such courts, or
(iii) any other defense that would hinder or delay the levy, execution or
collection of any amount to which any party hereto is entitled pursuant to
any final judgment of any court having jurisdiction.

11.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT, THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR
ANY OTHER RELEVANT MATTER.

11.13 _Entire_ _Agreement_. This Agreement, Annex A hereto, the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto, the Disclosure Schedule, the Related Agreements (with
respect to the parties thereto), and the documents and instruments and other
agreements among the parties hereto referenced herein constitute the
entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
