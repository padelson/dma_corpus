AGREEMENT

In consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1.DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION

1.1 Purchase and Sale of Acquired Units. At the Closing, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each Seller shall (and,
with respect to HTDS, each of the HTDS Members and HTDS Beneficial Owners
shall cause HTDS to) sell, assign, transfer and convey to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase and acquire from each Seller, all of such
Seller's right, title and interest in and to all of the Acquired Units owned
by such Seller, as set forth on Schedule 1.1 hereto, free and clear from all
Encumbrances, in consideration for payment of the Purchase Price (as defined
in Section 1.2(a)).

1.2 Purchase Price.

(a) Purchase Price. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, the aggregate consideration payable by Purchaser (or an
Affiliate of Purchaser) in respect of the Units (the "Purchase Price") shall
be equal to: (a) $250,000,000 in cash (the "Aggregate Transaction Value"),
minus (b) the aggregate amount of all unpaid Company Transaction Expenses as
of immediately prior to the Closing, minus (c) the Closing Indebtedness
Amount, plus (d) the amount by which the Net Working Capital Amount exceeds
the Targeted Net Working Capital Amount, minus (e) the amount by which the
Targeted Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Net Working Capital Amount (it
being understood that all amounts used in calculating the Purchase Price shall
be based on the amounts set forth and represented in the Closing Certificate).

(b) Escrow. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
1.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement, at the Closing, Purchaser shall withhold
from the Purchase Price payable pursuant to Section 1.2(a) and deposit into an
interest-bearing escrow account with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association
(the "Escrow Agent"):

(i) to secure the indemnification obligations of the Sellers, HTDS Members and
HTDS Beneficial Owners with respect to Severance Payments under Section
11.2(a)(i)(G) of this Agreement, an amount in cash equal to (the "Severance
Escrow Fund"):

(A) as a contribution to the Severance Escrow Fund with respect to each Class
A Unit outstanding immediately prior to the Closing (after taking into account
any exercise or deemed exercise of ABRY Class A Warrants prior to the Closing)
and each Class B Unit outstanding immediately prior to the Closing in
accordance with the terms of the Class B Award Agreements, an amount equal to
the Severance Escrow Contribution Amount applicable to such Unit; and

(B) as a contribution to the Severance Escrow Fund with respect to each Class
A Unit subject to an ABRY Class A Warrant, an amount equal to the Severance
Escrow Contribution Amount applicable to such Unit; and

(ii) to secure the indemnification obligations of the Sellers, HTDS Members
and HTDS Beneficial Owners under Sections 7 and 11 of this Agreement, an
amount in cash equal to (the "Escrow Fund"):

(A) as a contribution to the Escrow Fund with respect to each Class A Unit
outstanding immediately prior to the Closing (after taking into account any
exercise or deemed exercise of ABRY Class A Warrants prior to the Closing) and
each Class B Unit outstanding immediately prior to the Closing in accordance
with the terms of the Class B Award Agreements, an amount equal to the Escrow
Contribution Amount applicable to such Unit; and

(B) as a contribution to the Escrow Fund with respect to each Class A Unit subject to an ABRY Class A Warrant, an amount equal to the Escrow
Contribution Amount applicable to such Unit.

The Severance Escrow Fund and the Escrow Fund shall be held by the Escrow
Agent and disbursed by it solely for the purposes and in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and the provisions of an escrow agreement to be
entered into among Purchaser, the Sellers' Agent and the Escrow Agent on the
Closing Date, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the
"Escrow Agreement"). The Escrow Agreement shall provide that (1) promptly
following the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall
distribute to (x) the former holders of Class A Units and ABRY Class A
Warrants their respective Pro Rata Shares of all amounts then remaining in the
Severance Escrow Fund, and (y) to the Sellers' Agent (for further distribution
to the former holders of Class B Units in accordance with their respective Pro
Rata Shares) the portion of the amounts then remaining in the Severance Escrow
Fund attributable to such Class B Units, in each case less any amounts
designated as subject to a Severance Payment to the extent any such Severance
Payment arises or becomes payable but has not been paid on or prior to the
date of such disbursement; and (2) promptly following the eighteen (18) month
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall distribute to (x) the
former holders of Class A Units and ABRY Class A Warrants their respective Pro
Rata Shares of all amounts then remaining in the Escrow Fund, and (y) to the
Sellers' Agent (for further distribution to the former holders of Class B
Units in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares) the portion of the
amounts then remaining in the Escrow Fund attributable to such Class B Units,
in each case less any amounts designated as subject to a claim notice to the
extent any such claim notice has not been resolved on or prior to the date of
such disbursement.

1.3 Class B Redemption. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take all
necessary action (including providing written notice of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby) to cause all holders of Class B Units to
sell to the Company, pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Class B Award Agreements,
all of the outstanding Class B Units owned by such holders concurrently with
the Closing, in accordance with the terms of the Class B Award Agreements,
such that there shall be no Class B Units outstanding immediately following
the Closing (the "Class B Redemption"). At least two Business Days prior to
the Closing, the Company shall provide to Purchaser evidence, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, that subject to the payment
due to each holder of Class B Units pursuant to Section 1.4(a)(ii), the Class
B Redemption shall have been completed in all respects in accordance with the
terms of the Class B Award Agreements and this Agreement.

1.4 Company Units.

(a) Class A Units, Class B Units and Class C Preferred Units. Subject to
Sections 1.4(c), 1.5, 1.7 and 1.8. at the Closing, Purchaser shall pay (or, in
the case of clause (ii), shall cause the Company to pay):

(i) to each Seller that holds Class A Units, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by such Seller prior to
the Closing, in respect of each Class A Unit issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Closing, (A) an amount in cash equal to (1) the
Residual Per Unit Amount, minus (2) the Escrow Contribution Amount per such
Unit, minus (3) the Severance Escrow Contribution Amount per such Unit, plus
(B) following the Closing, any cash disbursements required to be made from
Purchaser, the Escrow Fund or the Severance Escrow Fund with respect to such
Unit to the former holder thereof in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, as applicable, if, as and when such
disbursements are required to be made; (ii) to the Sellers' Agent (for further distribution to the holders of Class B
Units issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing in accordance
with their respective Pro Rata Shares), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by the Sellers' Agent
prior to the Closing, in respect of each Class B Unit issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Closing, (A) an amount in cash equal to (1) the
Residual Per Unit Amount, minus (2) the Escrow Contribution Amount per such
Unit, minus (3) the Severance Escrow Contribution Amount per such Unit, plus
(B) following the Closing, any cash disbursements required to be made from
Purchaser, the Escrow Fund or the Severance Escrow Fund with respect to such
Unit to the former holder thereof in accordance with the terms of the this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, as applicable, if, as and when such
disbursements are required to be made; and

(iii) to each Seller that holds Class C Units, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by such Seller prior to
the Closing, in respect of each Class C Preferred Unit issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Closing, an amount in cash equal to the Class C Per
Unit Preference Amount.

(b) Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) The "Aggregate Class C Per Unit Preference Amount" shall be an amount
equal to Class C Per Unit Preference Amount, multiplied by the aggregate
number of Class C Preferred Units outstanding immediately prior to the
Closing.

(ii) The "Aggregate Residual Purchase Price Amount" shall be: (A) the Purchase
Price; minus (B) the Aggregate Class C Per Unit Preference Amount.

(iii) The "Class C Per Unit Liquidation Amount" shall be, with respect to each
Class C Preferred Unit outstanding immediately prior to the Closing: (A) the
Unreturned Class C Preferred Capital Amount (as defined in the Company LLC
Agreement) as of the Closing Date, plus (B) the Unpaid Class C Preferred Yield
(as defined in the Company LLC Agreement) as of the Closing Date. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Class C Per Unit Liquidation Amount, assuming the
Closing Date were the date of this Agreement, would equal $1,006.14.

(iv) The "Class C Per Unit Make Whole Amount" shall be, with respect to each
Class C Preferred Unit outstanding immediately prior to the Closing, an amount
equal to the excess of:

(A) if the Closing occurs on or prior to December 22, 2011, (1) the present
value at the Closing Date of one hundred five percent (105%) of the Class C
Per Unit Liquidation Amount of such Class C Preferred Unit as of December 22,
2012 (assuming no payment has been made in respect of such Class C Preferred
Units prior to such date), computed using a discount rate equal to the
Treasury Rate as of the Closing Date, plus fifty (50) basis points over (2)
the Class C Per Unit Liquidation Amount of such Class C Preferred Unit on the
Closing Date; or

(B) if the Closing occurs after December 22, 2011, (1) the present value at
the Closing Date of the Class C Per Unit Liquidation Amount of such Class C
Preferred Unit as of December 22, 2012 (assuming no payment has been made in
respect of such Class C Preferred Unit prior to such date), computed using a discount rate equal to
the Treasury Rate as of the Closing Date, plus fifty (50) basis points over
(2) the Class C Per Unit Liquidation Amount of such Class C Preferred Unit on
the Closing Date.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Class C Per Unit Make Whole Amount, assuming
the Closing Date were the date of this Agreement, would equal $173.23.

(v) The "Class C Per Unit Preference Amount" shall be equal to (A) the Class C
Per Unit Liquidation Amount, plus (B) the Class C Per Unit Make Whole Amount.

(vi) The "Closing Indebtedness Amount" means the aggregate amount of
outstanding Indebtedness (if any) of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing,
excluding up to $1,000,000 in the aggregate of Indebtedness of the Acquired
Companies within the meaning of clauses (b) and (c) of the definition of
"Indebtedness."

(vii) The "Escrow Amount" means an amount in cash equal to 12.5% of the
Aggregate Transaction Value.

(viii) The "Escrow Contribution Amount" means, with respect to each Class A
Unit and Class B Unit outstanding immediately prior to the Closing and each
Class A Unit subject to an ABRY Class A Warrant that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Closing (after taking into account any exercise of
ABRY Class A Warrants prior to the Closing), an amount equal to: (A) the
Escrow Amount; multiplied by (B) the fraction having a numerator equal to the
amount of the Purchase Price payable pursuant to Sections 1.4 or 1.5(a), as
the case may be, in respect of such Class A Unit, Class B Unit or Class A Unit
subject to an outstanding ABRY Class A Warrant (including, in each case, any
amount contributed to the Escrow Fund and the Severance Escrow Fund with
respect thereto), and having a denominator equal to the aggregate amount of
Purchase Price payable pursuant to Sections 1.4 and 1.5(a) in respect of all
Class A Units, Class B Units and Class A Units subject to outstanding ABRY
Class A Warrants (including, in each case, any amount contributed to the
Escrow Fund and the Severance Escrow Fund with respect thereto).

(ix) The "Fully Diluted Company Unit Number" shall be the sum of (without
duplication): (A) the aggregate number of Class A Units and Class B Units
outstanding immediately prior to the Closing (including (1) any such Units
that are subject to a repurchase option or risk of forfeiture under any Class
B Award Agreement, restricted unit purchase agreement or other Contract and
(2) any such Units subject to issuance pursuant to Outstanding Warrants
exercised prior to the Closing); plus (B) the aggregate number of Class A
Units that are purchasable under or otherwise subject to Outstanding Warrants.

(x) The "Net Working Capital Amount" (which can be positive or negative)
means: (A) the sum of all of the current assets of the Acquired Companies as
of the Closing (but excluding prepaid fees and expenses related to the DandO
Tail Policy and deferred Tax assets); minus (B) the sum of all of the current
liabilities of the Acquired Companies (which, for the avoidance of doubt,
shall include all unpaid Tax liabilities as of the Closing) as of the Closing
(but excluding deferred Tax liabilities, the Closing Indebtedness Amount and
the amount of any unpaid Company Transaction Expenses) (it being understood
that all amounts used in calculating "Net Working Capital Amount" (1) shall be
based on the amounts set forth and represented in the Closing Certificate and (2) shall exclude and not give effect to (x) any current assets or current
liabilities in respect of the TPA Business and (y) any intercompany accounts
between any Seller or any Affiliate of any Seller (other than the Acquired
Companies), on the one hand, and any of the Acquired Companies, on the other
hand, or the cancellation thereof).

(xi) The "Residual Per Unit Amount" shall be determined by dividing: (A) the
Aggregate Residual Purchase Price Amount; by (B) the Fully Diluted Company
Unit Number.

(xii) The "Severance Escrow Amount" shall be equal to Two Million Twenty Nine
Thousand Two Hundred Fifty Seven Dollars ($2,029,257).

(xiii) The "Severance Escrow Contribution Amount" means, with respect to each
Class A Unit and Class B Unit outstanding immediately prior to the Closing and
each Class A Unit subject to an ABRY Class A Warrant that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Closing (after taking into account any exercise of
ABRY Class A Warrants prior to the Closing), an amount equal to (A) the
Severance Escrow Amount; multiplied by (B) the fraction having a numerator
equal to the aggregate amount of the Purchase Price payable pursuant to
Sections 1.4 or 1.5(a), as the case may be, in respect of each such Class A
Unit, Class B Unit or Class A Unit subject to an outstanding ABRY Class A
Warrant (including, in each case, any amount contributed to the Escrow Fund
and the Severance Escrow Fund with respect thereto), and having a denominator
equal to the aggregate amount of Purchase Price payable pursuant to Sections
1.4 and 1.5(a) in respect of all Class A Units, Class B Units and Class A
Units subject to outstanding ABRY Class A Warrants (including, in each case,
any amount contributed to the Escrow Fund and the Severance Escrow Fund with
respect thereto).

(xiv) The "Targeted Net Working Capital Amount" shall be equal to negative
Three Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars (-$3,500,000).

(xv) The "Treasury Rate" shall be the yield to maturity as of the Closing Date
of United States Treasury securities with a constant maturity (as compiled and
published in the most recent Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519)
that has become publicly available at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date (or, if such Statistical Release is no longer published, any
publicly available source of similar market data)) most nearly equal to the
period from the Closing Date to December 22, 2012.

(c) Adjustments. In calculating the consideration payable under this Section
1.4, Purchaser shall be entitled to rely on the representations and warranties
contained in Section 2.3 and the Closing Certificate (as defined in Section
8.5(i)). Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, in no event shall the aggregate Purchase Price payable by Purchaser
to the holders of equity interests in the Company (including the holders of
Class A Warrants) in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
exceed such consideration payable assuming such representations, warranties
and Closing Certificate are correct (taking into account any adjustment
pursuant to Section 1.7). In the event that the Company, at any time or from
time to time between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, declares or
pays any dividend on Units payable in Units or in any right to acquire Units,
or effects a subdivision of the outstanding Units into a greater number of
Units, or in the event the outstanding Units shall be combined or
consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of Units,
or a record date with respect to any of the foregoing shall occur during such
period, then the amounts payable in respect of issued and outstanding Units
pursuant to Section 1.4 and the amounts payable in respect of Units subject to
Outstanding Warrants pursuant to Section 1.5(a) shall be appropriately
adjusted.

1.5 Treatment of Class A Warrants. (a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall amend each agreement evidencing a
Class A Warrant that is outstanding as of the date of this Agreement (each
such Class A Warrant, an "Outstanding Warrant", and each such amendment being
referred to herein as a "Warrant Surrender Agreement") to provide that each
such Class A Warrant shall be cancelled, terminated and extinguished as of the
Closing. Upon the cancellation of each such Class A Warrant, at Closing,
Purchaser shall pay (or cause the Company to pay) to each holder of such Class
A Warrant (subject to adjustment pursuant to Sections 1.7 and 1.8):

(i) in respect of each Class A Unit then subject to an ORIX Class A Warrant,
an amount in cash equal to (A) the Residual Per Unit Amount minus (B) the
exercise price per Class A Unit subject to such ORIX Class A Warrant; and

(ii) in respect of each Class A Unit then subject to an ABRY Class A Warrant,
(A) an amount in cash equal to (1) the Residual Per Unit Amount, minus (2) the
exercise price per Class A Unit subject to such ABRY Class A Warrant, minus
(3) the Escrow Contribution Amount applicable to such Class A Unit subject to
such ABRY Class A Warrant, minus, (4) the Severance Escrow Contribution Amount
applicable to such Class A Unit subject to such ABRY Class A Warrant, plus (B)
following the Closing, any cash disbursements required to be made from
Purchaser, the Escrow Fund or the Severance Escrow Fund with respect to such
Class A Unit to the former holder thereof in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, as applicable, if, as and when such
disbursements are required to be made.

(b) Each Warrant Surrender Agreement shall be substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit C, and the Company shall provide Purchaser with a
copy of each Warrant Surrender Agreement immediately upon its execution. The
Company shall take all actions that may be necessary to ensure each holder of
an Outstanding Warrant cancelled as provided in Section 1.5(a) shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
consideration specified in Section 1.5(a), without interest (it being
understood that such holder shall have all rights as a Seller under this
Agreement with respect to its Class A Warrants).

1.6 Closing. The closing of the sale and transfer of the Acquired Units from
Sellers to Purchaser and the consummation of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices
of Sidley Austin LLP, One South Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois 60603 at
10:00 a.m. (Central time) on a date to be designated by Purchaser, which shall
be no later than the third Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of
the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Sections 8
and 9 (other than those conditions that are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) or at such other
time and/or date as Purchaser and the Sellers' Agent may jointly designate;
provided, however, that notwithstanding the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Sections 8 and 9, the parties hereto shall not be
required to effect the Closing prior to January 1, 2012. The date on which the
Closing actually takes place is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing
Date."

1.7 Post-Closing Adjustment to Purchase Price.

(a) Estimated Purchase Price. The Company shall prepare and deliver to
Purchaser at least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date:

(i) an estimated balance sheet of the Company as of immediately prior to the
Closing (the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet"), in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, which shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP (except for the
absence of footnotes and, to the extent that GAAP permits alternate treatments
in calculating the amounts reflected in the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet,
the particular treatment used in the preparation of the Company Financial
Statements shall be used) and on a "closing of the books" basis, and shall set
forth, and contain all of the information necessary to calculate, the unpaid
Closing Indebtedness Amount and the Net Working Capital Amount, together with
documentation, reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, in support of the
calculation of the amounts set forth in the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet;

(ii) an accurate and complete copy of: (A) one or more payoff letters and
other evidence regarding the discharge of Indebtedness and termination and
release of Encumbrances related thereto, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser, each dated no more than five Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, with respect to the Closing Indebtedness Amount, to (1)
satisfy such Indebtedness as of the Closing and (2) terminate and release any
Encumbrances related thereto; and (B) an accurate and complete copy of an
invoice from each advisor or other service provider to any Acquired Company,
dated no more than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, with respect
to all unpaid Company Transaction Expenses estimated to be due and payable to
such advisor or other service provider, as the case may be, as of the Closing
Date; and

(iii) an estimated Closing Certificate (as defined in Section 8.5(i)), in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser and setting forth the
information required by Section 8.5(i) on an accompanying spreadsheet,
together with documentation, reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, in support
of the calculation of the amounts set forth in the estimated Closing
Certificate.

(b) Calculation. As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 60
days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall (i) prepare or cause to be
prepared in accordance with GAAP (except for the absence of footnotes and, to
the extent that GAAP permits alternate treatments in calculating the amounts
reflected in the Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing Date Schedule, the
particular treatment used in the preparation of the Company Financial
Statements shall be used) and on a "closing of the books" basis, an unaudited
balance sheet of the Company as of immediately prior to the Closing (the
"Closing Balance Sheet"), together with a statement (the "Closing Date
Schedule") setting forth in reasonable detail Purchaser's calculation of the
Net Working Capital Amount, the unpaid Closing Indebtedness Amount and unpaid
Company Transaction Expenses and (ii) deliver to the Sellers' Agent the
Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Schedule.

(c) Review/Disputes.

(i) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall provide the Sellers' Agent and
any accountants or advisors retained by the Sellers' Agent with reasonable
access, during normal business hours, to the relevant books and records of the
Company used by Purchaser in the preparation of, or otherwise reasonably
relevant to, the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Schedule. If the
Sellers' Agent disputes the calculation of any of the Net Working Capital
Amount, unpaid Closing Indebtedness Amount or unpaid Company Transaction
Expenses set forth in the Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing Date Schedule,
then the Sellers' Agent shall deliver a written notice (a "Working Capital
Dispute Notice") to Purchaser at any time during the 30-day period commencing
upon receipt by the Sellers' Agent of the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Date Schedule, all as prepared by Purchaser in accordance with the
requirements of Section 1.7(a) (the "Working Capital Review Period"). The
Working Capital Dispute Notice shall set forth the basis for the dispute of
any such calculation in reasonable detail. (ii) If the Sellers' Agent does not deliver a Working Capital Dispute Notice
to Purchaser prior to the expiration of the Working Capital Review Period,
Purchaser's calculation of the Net Working Capital Amount, unpaid Closing
Indebtedness Amount and unpaid Company Transaction Expenses set forth in the
Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Schedule shall be deemed final and
binding on Purchaser, the Sellers, the HTDS Members, the HTDS Beneficial
Owners, the Sellers' Agent and the Class B Unit holders for all purposes of
this Agreement.

(iii) If the Sellers' Agent delivers a Working Capital Dispute Notice to
Purchaser prior to the expiration of the Working Capital Review Period, then
the Sellers' Agent and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts in
good faith to reach agreement on the Net Working Capital Amount, unpaid
Closing Indebtedness Amount and unpaid Company Transaction Expenses within the
30-day period commencing upon receipt by Purchaser of the Working Capital
Dispute Notice. If the Sellers' Agent and Purchaser are unable to reach
agreement on the Net Working Capital Amount, unpaid Closing Indebtedness
Amount and unpaid Company Transaction Expenses within such 30-day period, then
either Purchaser or the Sellers' Agent shall submit the unresolved objections
to a national "big four" accounting firm acceptable to both Purchaser and the
Sellers' Agent (such firm, and any successor thereto, being referred to herein
as the "Accounting Firm"), and such firm shall be directed by Purchaser and
the Sellers' Agent to resolve the unresolved objections in accordance with the
immediately following sentence. In connection with the resolution of any such
dispute by the Accounting Firm: (i) each of Purchaser and the Sellers' Agent
shall have a reasonable opportunity to meet with the Accounting Firm to
provide their views as to any disputed issues with respect to the calculation
of any of the Net Working Capital Amount, unpaid Closing Indebtedness Amount
and unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, (ii) the Accounting Firm shall
determine the Net Working Capital Amount, unpaid Closing Indebtedness Amount
and unpaid Company Transaction Expenses in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event, within 60
days of such referral) and upon reaching such determination shall deliver a
copy of its calculations (the "Expert Calculations") to the Sellers' Agent and
Purchaser and (iii) the determination made by the Accounting Firm of the Net
Working Capital Amount, unpaid Closing Indebtedness Amount and unpaid Company
Transaction Expenses shall be final and binding on all of the parties hereto
for all purposes of this Agreement, absent manifest error. In calculating the
Net Working Capital Amount, unpaid Closing Indebtedness Amount and unpaid
Company Transaction Expenses, the Accounting Firm (x) shall be limited to
addressing any particular disputes referred to in the Working Capital Dispute
Notice and (y) such calculation shall, with respect to any disputed item, be
no greater than the higher amount calculated by the Sellers' Agent or
Purchaser, and no less than the lower amount calculated by the Sellers' Agent
or Purchaser, as the case may be. The Expert Calculations shall reflect in
detail the differences, if any, between the Net Working Capital Amount, unpaid
Closing Indebtedness Amount and unpaid Company Transaction Expenses reflected
therein and the Net Working Capital Amount, unpaid Closing Indebtedness Amount
and unpaid Company Transaction Expenses set forth in the Closing Balance Sheet
and Closing Date Schedule. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall
be borne by the party whose positions generally did not prevail in such
determination, or if the Accounting Firm determines that neither party could
be fairly found to be the prevailing party, then such fees and expenses shall
be borne equally by Purchaser and the Sellers' Agent.

(d) Payment Upon Final Determination of Adjustments.

(i) If (A) the Purchase Price (calculated based on the Net Working Capital
Amount, the unpaid Closing Indebtedness Amount and the unpaid Company
Transaction Expenses, in each case as finally determined in accordance with Section 1.7(c)), is less
than (B) the Purchase Price (calculated based on the estimated Net Working
Capital Amount, the estimated unpaid Closing Indebtedness Amount and estimated
unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, in each case as finally estimated in
accordance with Section 1.7(a)) (the positive amount of such difference, the
"Working Capital Shortfall"), then Purchaser and the Sellers' Agent shall, no
later than two Business Days after such determination, deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release from
the Escrow Fund an amount in cash equal to the Working Capital Shortfall by
delivery of immediately available funds to Purchaser. If the Working Capital
Shortfall exceeds the Escrow Fund, then each Seller shall pay (and, with
respect to HTDS, each of the HTDS Members and HTDS Beneficial Owners shall
cause HTDS to pay), no later than two Business Days after determination of
such excess amount, an amount in cash equal to each Seller's Pro Rata Share of
such excess amount (up to an amount equal to the actual aggregate Purchase
Price consideration received by such Seller) by delivery of immediately
available funds to Purchaser.

(ii) If (A) the Purchase Price (calculated based on the Net Working Capital
Amount, the unpaid Closing Indebtedness Amount and the unpaid Company
Transaction Expenses, in each case as finally determined in accordance with
Section 1.7(c)), is greater than (B) the Purchase Price (calculated based on
the estimated Net Working Capital Amount, the estimated unpaid Closing
Indebtedness Amount and the estimated unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, in
each case as finally estimated in accordance with Section 1.7(a)) (such
amount, the "Purchaser Underpayment"), then Purchaser shall, no later than two
Business Days after such determination, with respect to the former holders of
Class A Units, Class B Units and Outstanding Warrants, pay to each such holder
by delivery of immediately available funds such holder's Purchaser
Underpayment Pro Rata Share of the amount of the Purchaser Underpayment.

(e) Nothing in this Section 1.7 shall limit any rights of any Purchaser
Indemnitee as set forth in Sections 7 or 11.

1.8 Withholding. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement or any Warrant
Surrender Agreement to any securityholder or former securityholder of the
Company such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom or
in connection therewith under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Legal Requirements relating to Taxes or under any other applicable
Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and
subsequently paid to the applicable Governmental Body by Purchaser, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

of the Acquired Companies are accurate, up-to-date and complete in all
material respects, and have been maintained in accordance with prudent
business practices and all applicable Legal Requirements.

(c) Internal Controls. The books, records and accounts of the Acquired
Companies accurately and fairly reflect, in reasonable detail, the
transactions in and dispositions of the assets of the Acquired Companies. The

Company, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, the counterparties thereto, in
accordance with their respective terms. There is not, under any of the Real
Property Leases, any existing default by the applicable Acquired Company or
the counterparties thereto nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, do any facts
or circumstances exist which with notice or lapse of time or both, would
become a default under any of the Real Property Leases by the applicable

copyrights owned or filed by, or on behalf of, or used by any Acquired
Company, including country of filing, owner, filing number, date of issue and

internet domain names and the like owned by any Acquired Company or used in
the business or operations of any Acquired Company and (B) any Person other

delivered to Purchaser complete and accurate copies of all applications,
correspondence with any Governmental Body and other material documents related
to each item of Registered IP identified in Part 2.10(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule.

(b) Inbound Licenses. Part 2.10(b) of the Disclosure Schedule accurately
identifies each Contract pursuant to which any Intellectual Property or
Intellectual Property Right is or has been licensed, sold, assigned or otherwise conveyed or provided to any
Acquired Company (other than: (A) agreements between an Acquired Company and
its employees in such Acquired Company's standard form thereof as delivered to
Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.10(e); and (B) non-exclusive licenses to "off-
the-shelf" third party Computer Software that is generally available on

Schedule, there are no Contracts pursuant to which any Person has been granted
any license under, or otherwise has received or acquired any right (whether or
not currently exercisable and including a right to receive a license) or
interest in, any Acquired Company IP. Except as set forth in Part 2.10(c) of
the Disclosure Schedule, no Acquired Company is bound by, and no Acquired
Company IP is subject to, any Contract containing any covenant or other
provision that in any way limits or restricts the ability of any Acquired
Company to use, exploit, assert or enforce any Acquired Company IP anywhere in
the world.

(d) Royalty Obligations. Part 2.10(d) of the Disclosure Schedule contains a
complete and accurate list and summary of all royalties, fees, commissions and
other amounts payable by any Acquired Company to any other Person upon or for

Purchaser a complete and accurate copy of each standard form of Acquired
Company IP Contract used by any of the Acquired Companies, including each

information and inventions assignment agreement for use with Acquired Company
Employees, consultants or independent contractors containing any assignment or
license of Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Rights (each, an "IP
Assignment Agreement") to the Acquired Companies or any confidentiality
provision; or (iii) confidentiality or nondisclosure agreement. Part 2.10(e)
of the Disclosure Schedule accurately identifies each Acquired Company IP
Contract that deviates in any material respect from the corresponding standard
form agreement delivered to Purchaser, including any agreement with an
employee, consultant or independent contractor in which the employee,
consultant or independent contractor expressly reserved or retained any
Intellectual Property Rights related to any Acquired Company's business,
research or development, or deviates from any Acquired Company's standard data
privacy or security terms. Each Person who is or was an Acquired Company
Employee or consultant of any Acquired Company has signed an IP Assignment
Agreement, substantially similar in all material respects to the form
delivered to Purchaser prior to the date hereof, prior to or substantially
concurrent with the commencement of his, her or its employment relationship
with the Acquired Companies.

(f) Ownership. The Acquired Companies collectively are the sole and exclusive
owner of all right, title and interest to and in the Acquired Company IP
(other than Intellectual Property exclusively licensed to any of the Acquired
Companies, as identified in Part 2.10(b) of the Disclosure Schedule), free and
clear of any Encumbrances (other than nonexclusive licenses granted pursuant
to the Contracts listed in Part 2.10(c) of the Disclosure Schedule and except

after the Closing will continue to have, all Intellectual Property needed to
conduct the business of the Acquired Companies as currently conducted and as
conducted as of the Closing.

(g) Valid and Enforceable. All Acquired Company IP is valid, subsisting and,
to the Knowledge of the Company, enforceable. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, no interference, opposition, reissue, reexamination or other Legal
Proceeding is or has been pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened, in which the scope, validity or enforceability of any Acquired
Company IP is being, has been, or would reasonably be expected to be contested
or challenged, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there is no basis for a
claim that any Acquired Company IP is invalid or unenforceable.

(h) No Third Party Infringement of Acquired Company IP. To the Knowledge of
the Company, no Person has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated,
and no Person is currently infringing, misappropriating or otherwise
violating, any Acquired Company IP.

(i) Effects of This Transaction. Neither the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement or any other agreements referred to in this

Acquired Companies would otherwise be entitled to with respect to any Acquired
Company IP.

(j) No Infringement of Third Party IP Rights. No Acquired Company has ever
infringed (directly, contributorily, by inducement or otherwise),
misappropriated or otherwise violated or made unlawful use of any Intellectual
Property Right of any other Person. No Acquired Company Software and no
product or service developed, marketed, distributed, licensed, sold, offered
or provided by any Acquired Company infringes, violates or makes unlawful use
of any Intellectual Property Right of, or contains any Intellectual Property
misappropriated from, any other Person. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing:

(i) no infringement, misappropriation or similar claim or Legal Proceeding is
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against any Acquired
Company or against any other Person who is or may be entitled to be
indemnified, defended, held harmless or reimbursed by any Acquired Company
with respect to any such claim or Legal Proceeding, and no Acquired Company
has ever received any notice or other communication requesting, claiming, or
demanding any of the foregoing with respect to any such claim or Legal
Proceeding;

(ii) no Acquired Company has ever received any notice or other communication
relating to any actual, alleged or suspected infringement, misappropriation or
violation by any Acquired Company, any Acquired Company Employee or other
Representative of any Acquired Company of any Intellectual Property of another
Person, including any letter or other communication suggesting or offering
that any Acquired Company obtain a license to any Intellectual Property of
another Person; and

(iii) no Acquired Company is bound by any Contract to indemnify, defend, hold
harmless or reimburse any other Person with respect to, or otherwise assumed

Open Source Code disclosed, or required to be disclosed, in Part 2.10(l)(ii)
of the Disclosure Schedule as needed for the Acquired Companies to conduct the
business of the Acquired Companies as currently conducted and currently
planned by the Acquired Companies to be conducted, without violation in any
material respect of any license terms pertaining to such Open Source Code or
infringement of third-party Intellectual Property Rights.

(iii) Except as set expressly stated in Part 2.10(l)(iii) of the Disclosure
Schedule, no Acquired Company Software contains, is derived from, is
distributed with or is being or was developed using Open Source Code that is

pertaining to privacy, User Data, Personal Data, data security, and spyware.
Without limiting the foregoing, each Acquired Company has acquired, collected, and used all User Data pursuant

Policy, Acquired Company Contract, or applicable Legal Requirement. Neither
the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or any of the other
agreements referred to in this Agreement, nor the consummation of any of the

result in any violation in any material respect of any Acquired Company
Privacy Policy, Acquired Company Contract, or any Legal Requirement pertaining
to privacy, User Data, Personal Data, data security, or spyware.

maintained by technically competent personnel, in accordance with standards

Companies. The Acquired Companies have taken commercially reasonable measures
to provide for the back-up and recovery of the data and information necessary

Members, HTDS Beneficial Owners or Acquired Companies shall not, and shall
ensure that their respective Representatives do not: (a) solicit or encourage
the initiation or submission of any expression of interest, inquiry, proposal
or offer from any Person (other than Purchaser) relating to a possible
Acquisition Transaction; (b) participate in any discussions or negotiations or
enter into any agreement, understanding or arrangement with, or provide any
non-public information to, any Person (other than Purchaser or its
Representatives) relating to or in connection with a possible Acquisition
Transaction; or (c) entertain or accept any proposal or offer from any Person
(other than Purchaser) relating to a possible Acquisition Transaction. Each
Seller, HTDS Member, HTDS Beneficial Owner or Acquired Company shall promptly
(and in any event within 24 hours of receipt thereof) notify Purchaser orally
and in writing of any inquiry, indication of interest, proposal, offer or
request for non-public information relating to a possible Acquisition
Transaction that is received by it during the Pre-Closing Period, which notice
shall include: (i) the identity of the Person making or submitting such
inquiry, indication of interest, proposal, offer or request, and the terms and
conditions thereof; and (ii) an accurate and complete copy of all written
materials provided in connection with such inquiry, indication of interest,
proposal, offer or request).

5.5 Termination of Certain Benefit Plans. The Company shall take (or cause to
be taken) all actions necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no
later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date: (a) any Acquired
Company Employee Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code (the "401(k) Plans"); (b)
any group severance, separation, or salary continuation plans, programs or
arrangements of any Acquired Company that are Acquired Company Employee Plans
(the "Severance Plans"); and (c) any other Acquired Company Employee Plan
requested by Purchaser at least three days prior to the Closing Date, unless,
in the case of clauses "(a)" and "(b)," Purchaser, in its sole and absolute
discretion, agrees to sponsor and maintain any such 401(k) Plans or Severance
Plans by providing the Company with written notice of such election (an
"Election Notice") at least three days before the Closing. Unless Purchaser
provides an Election Notice to the Company, the Company shall deliver to
Purchaser, prior to the Closing Date, evidence that the Company's management
committee has validly adopted resolutions to terminate the 401(k) Plans,
Severance Plans and other Acquired Company Employee Plans (the form and
substance of which resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of
Purchaser), effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date. In the event that the distributions of assets from the trust of a 401(k)
Plan which is terminated is reasonably anticipated to trigger liquidation
charges, surrender charges, or other fees to be imposed upon the account of
any participant or beneficiary of such terminated plan or upon any Acquired
Company or plan sponsor, then the Company shall take such actions as are
necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees and
provide such estimate in writing to Purchaser prior to the Closing.

efforts to: (a) cause the agreements identified in Schedule 5.6 to be
terminated effective as of the Closing; and (b) take, or cause to be taken,
all actions necessary to secure the termination and release of any and all
Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances and Encumbrances relating to
up to $1,000,000 in aggregate Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies within
the meaning of clauses (b) and (c) of the definition of "Indebtedness") upon
the assets or properties of the Acquired Companies, in each case, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser.

5.7 FIRPTA Matters. Each Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a certification of
non-foreign status (a "FIRPTA Statement"), in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser and such Seller, in accordance with Treasury
Regulation § 1.1445-2(b), with respect to which Purchaser shall not have
actual knowledge that such certification is false and shall not have received
a notice that such certification is false pursuant to Treasury Regulation §
1.1445-4.



5.8 Repayment of Insider Receivables. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall (and shall cause each Acquired Company to) cause all outstanding Insider
Receivables to be repaid to the applicable Acquired Company in full.

5.9 Communications with Employees. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall not communicate (and the Company shall ensure that no Acquired Company
and no Representative of any Acquired Company communicates) with Acquired
Company Employees regarding post-Closing employment matters with Purchaser or
any Subsidiary or Affiliate of Purchaser, including post-Closing employee
benefit plans and compensation, without the prior written approval of
Purchaser.

5.10 Resignation of Officers and Directors. The Company shall obtain and
deliver to Purchaser, at or prior to the Closing, the resignation of each
officer and Management Committee member of each Acquired Company effective as
of the later of the Closing and the date Purchaser causes such Management
Committee member or officer to be replaced, substantially in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit D (it being understood that such resignations shall not
constitute a termination of employment by such officer or Management Committee
member, if such person is an Acquired Company Employee). 5.11 Tail Insurance; Indemnification. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall purchase an extended reporting period endorsement under the Company's
existing directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage (the "DandO Tail
Policy") for the Acquired Companies' directors and officers in a form mutually
acceptable to the Company and Purchaser, which shall provide such directors
and officers with coverage for six years following the Closing of not less
than the existing coverage under, and have other terms not materially less
favorable to, the insured persons than the directors' and officers' liability
insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company. For a period of six
years following the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the Company to honor the
obligations of the Company pursuant to Section 7.7 of the Company LLC
Agreement, as in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, to
indemnify the ABRY Director (as defined in the Company LLC Agreement) with
respect to any matters occurring prior to the Closing Date.

5.12 Financing Cooperation. Prior to the Closing, HTDS shall provide (and the
HTDS Members and the HTDS Beneficial Owners shall cause HTDS to provide), and
shall cause the Acquired Companies and the respective Affiliates and
Representatives of each of the foregoing to provide, on a timely basis,
reasonable cooperation requested by Purchaser in connection with the
arrangement of any debt or equity financing transaction by Purchaser in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement after the date
hereof.

5.13 Separation of the TPA Business. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall,
and shall cause the Subsidiaries of the Company to, (i) form a new Subsidiary
(the "TPA Subsidiary"); (ii) contribute to the TPA Subsidiary all of its and
their respective right, title and interest in and to the assets exclusively
used in the operation of the TPA Business (including by assigning,
transferring and conveying to the TPA Subsidiary all of the Acquired
Companies' right, title and interest in and to all Contracts exclusively
related to the TPA Business); (iii) cause the TPA Subsidiary to assume and be
obligated to pay, perform or otherwise discharge all TPA Business Liabilities;
(iv) transfer the employment of each TPA Business Employee identified in Part
2.15(a) of the Disclosure Schedule to the TPA Subsidiary; (v) assign to the
TPA Subsidiary that portion of the Shared Contracts that relates exclusively
to the TPA Business or amend or enter into new Contracts with the
counterparties to the Shared Contracts such that all rights thereunder
relating exclusively to the TPA Business shall inure to, and all Liabilities
thereunder relating exclusively to the TPA Business shall be assumed by, the
TPA Subsidiary, and all other rights and Liabilities thereunder shall remain
with the Acquired Companies (provided, however, that if all necessary Consents
are not obtained with respect to such assignment or amendment of any Shared
Contract, then the Company shall terminate that portion of the Shared Contract
that relates exclusively to the TPA Business); and (vi) establish a record
date and distribute limited liability company interests of the TPA Subsidiary
to such holders of Units as of such record date that are entitled to such
distribution (clauses (i) through (vi) being referred to collectively
hereafter as the "Separation"). The Company shall cause the Separation to
occur immediately prior to the Closing and in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements and the Separation Agreements. The Company shall inform Purchaser
in writing in advance of all material actions the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates propose to take in connection with the Separation,
and the Company shall provide Purchaser with copies of all of the Separation
Agreements and related documentation for review not less than ten Business
Days prior to the execution thereof by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates. The Company shall incorporate in the Separation Agreements and
related documentation any comments reasonably proposed by Purchaser or any of
its Representatives, and shall not execute any such Separation Agreements or
related documentation until such time as such Separation Agreements and
related documentation are in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser. The Separation shall be made without any representation or warranty
(express or implied) from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and the TPA
Subsidiary shall expressly disclaim and have no recourse against Purchaser,
Affiliates of Purchaser or the Acquired Companies with respect to the
Separation or the TPA Business. The TPA Subsidiary will provide full and
complete indemnification against all Liabilities relating to the Separation, including
any TPA Business Liabilities. The TPA Subsidiary shall have no right to use
the names "HealthTran" or "HTDS" or any name that, in the reasonable judgment
of Purchaser, is similar to any such names and shall not use such names or
other names acquired by Purchaser hereunder or names confusingly similar
thereto.

this Section 6.5(c) shall not be violated by truthful statements made in a
good faith response to any Legal Proceeding.

6.6 Release. Each Seller, HTDS Member and HTDS Beneficial Owner (collectively
for purposes of this Section 6.6, the "Releasing Parties") hereby consents to
the transactions contemplated under this Agreement and each other agreement,
document or instrument referred to in or contemplated by this Agreement.
Effective as of the Closing, each of the Releasing Parties hereby irrevocably,

7. TAX MATTERS

7.1 Liability for Taxes.

(a) Indemnification. From and after the Closing, each Seller shall hold
harmless and indemnify each of the Purchaser Indemnitees from and against, and
shall compensate and reimburse each of the Purchaser Indemnitees for, its or
his applicable Pro Rata Share of any Damages which are directly or indirectly
suffered or incurred at any time by any of the Purchaser Indemnitees or to
which any of the Purchaser Indemnitees may otherwise directly or indirectly
become subject at any time (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate
to any third party claim) and which arise directly or indirectly from or as a
result of, or are directly or indirectly connected with Taxes imposed on any
Acquired Company, or for which any Acquired Company may otherwise be liable,
for any taxable year or period that ends on or before the Closing Date and,
with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period
ending on and including the Closing Date. For purposes of the foregoing, the
determination of the Taxes of an Acquired Company for the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date shall be determined
on a closing-of-the-books basis by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted
of two taxable years or periods, one which ended at the close of the Closing
Date and the other which began at the beginning of the day following the
Closing (with depreciation and other exemptions, allowances, or deductions
calculated on an annual basis apportioned on a daily basis).

(b) Transfer Taxes. Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers (each in
accordance with its or his applicable Pro Rata Share), on the other hand, shall each bear one-
half of any real property transfer or gains Tax, sales Tax, use Tax, stamp
Tax, unit transfer Tax, or other similar transfer Taxes imposed on the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

7.2 Tax Returns.

(a) With respect to Tax Returns required to be filed by, on behalf of or with
respect to the Acquired Companies, the Company (or, in the case of Pre-Closing
Income Tax Returns filed after the Closing Date, the Sellers' Agent on behalf
of the Company) shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when due (taking
into account all extensions properly obtained): (i) all such Tax Returns that
are required to be filed on or prior to the Closing Date; and (ii) all such
Tax Returns that are Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns. Purchaser shall file or
cause to be filed when due (taking into account all extensions properly
obtained) all other Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with
respect to the Acquired Companies.

(b) In the case of Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns filed by the Sellers' Agent
after the Closing Date: (i) such Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed at
the cost of the Sellers' Agent and Sellers; (ii) such Tax Returns shall be
prepared and filed in a manner consistent with prior practice, this Agreement
and Legal Requirements and, on such Tax Return, the Sellers' Agent shall not
make or change any Tax election or adopt or change a material accounting
method in respect of Taxes; (iii) such Tax Returns shall be provided to
Purchaser for review and approval (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
no less than thirty (30) days prior to due date for timely filing such Tax
Return; and (iv) Taxes required to be paid by the Company, if any, with
respect to such Tax Returns shall be paid by (and the responsibility of) the
Sellers' Agent and the Sellers.

7.3 Assistance and Cooperation. After the Closing Date, each of Sellers' Agent
and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to):

(a) timely sign and deliver such certificates or forms as may be necessary or
appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce), or file Tax
Returns or other reports with respect to, Taxes described in Section 7.1(b)
(relating to sales, transfer and similar Taxes);

(b) assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other party
is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with Section 7.2;

(c) cooperate fully in preparing for and defending any audits of, or disputes
with taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of any Acquired Company;

(d) make available to the other and to any taxing authority as reasonably
requested all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes of the
Acquired Companies; and

(e) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received from any
taxing authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request with
respect to any such taxable period.

7.4 Tax Treatment. Purchaser and Sellers acknowledge and agree that the sale
of the Acquired Units from Sellers to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement
shall be treated for federal income Tax purposes and, as may be applicable,
for state and local income Tax purposes, in accordance with Revenue Ruling
99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432 (Situation 2). Purchaser and Sellers will file all Tax
Returns in a manner consistent with such treatment, and will take no position inconsistent with such
characterization for federal, state or local income Tax purposes, including in
any audit, judicial or administrative proceeding.

7.5 Survival, Etc. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement
(including Section 10), the obligations of the parties set forth in this
Section 7 shall survive the Closing until the date that is 60 days after the
expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations (including any extensions
thereof); provided, however, that if, at any time on or prior to the
expiration date referred to in this sentence, any Purchaser Indemnitee
delivers to the Sellers' Agent a written notice asserting a claim for recovery
under this Section 7 based on such alleged breach, then the claim asserted in
such notice shall survive until such time as such claim is fully and finally
resolved. No claim made pursuant to this Section 7 shall be subject to the
limitations in Section 11.3.

11.3 Limitations.

(a) Basket. Subject to Section 11.3(b), the Sellers shall not be required to
make any indemnification payment pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(i)(A) for any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty in this Agreement
until such time as the total amount of all Damages (including the Damages
arising from such inaccuracy or breach and all other Damages arising from any
other inaccuracies or breaches of any representations or warranties) that have
been directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by any one or more of the
Purchaser Indemnitees, or to which any one or more of the Purchaser
Indemnitees has or have otherwise directly or indirectly become subject,
exceeds $1,000,000 in the aggregate, in which event the Purchaser Indemnitees
shall, subject to the other limitations herein, be indemnified for all such
Damages in excess of $500,000.

(b) Applicability of Basket. The limitation set forth in Section 11.3(a) shall
not apply: (i) in the event of intentional misrepresentation, willful
misconduct or fraud; (ii) to inaccuracies in or breaches of any of the
Specified Representations, Tax Representations, Employee Representations or
Regulatory Representations; or (iii) to the matters referred to in Section 7
or Sections 11.2(a)(i)(B) through 11.2(a)(i)(H).

(c) Recourse to Escrow Fund. With respect to any claim for indemnification
under Section 11.2(a)(i), the Purchaser Indemnitees shall seek recovery of any
and all Damages for which the Purchaser Indemnitees are determined to be
entitled to indemnification, first from the Escrow Fund until it has been
depleted or all amounts have been released therefrom. Subject to Section
11.3(d), recourse by the Purchaser Indemnitees to the Escrow Fund shall be the
Purchaser Indemnitees' sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement for
monetary Damages resulting from the matters referred to in Section
11.2(a)(i)(A). With respect to any claim for indemnification under Section
11.2(a)(ii), the Purchaser Indemnitees may, at their option, seek recovery of
any and all Damages for which the Purchaser Indemnitees are determined to be
entitled to indemnification (i) severally and directly from the Sellers, HTDS
Members or HTDS Beneficial Owners, as applicable, or (ii) from the Escrow Fund
(for the full amount of such Damages). If the Purchaser Indemnitees are
entitled to indemnification under Section 11.2(a) in excess of the amount of
the Escrow Fund, or if the funds in the Escrow Fund are inadequate to
reimburse the Purchaser Indemnitees with respect to any and all Damages for
which the Purchaser Indemnitees are determined to be entitled to
indemnification, the Purchaser Indemnitees shall have the right to seek
recovery of such Damages in excess of the Escrow Fund: (A) with respect to
Damages for which the Purchaser Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification
under Section 11.2(a)(i), severally and directly from each Seller (in
accordance with its respective Pro Rata Share), and (B) with respect to
Damages for which the Purchaser Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification
under Section 11.2(a)(ii), severally and directly from the responsible Seller, HTDS
Member or HTDS Beneficial Owner, as the case may be.

(d) Applicability of Liability Cap. The limitation set forth in the second
sentence of Section 11.3(c) shall not apply: (i) in the event of intentional
misrepresentation, willful misconduct or fraud; (ii) to inaccuracies in or
breaches of any of the Specified Representations, Tax Representations,
Employee Representations or Regulatory Representations; or (iii) to the
matters referred to in Section 7 or Sections 11.2(a)(i)(B) through
11.2(a)(i)(H).

(e) Insurance Proceeds; Tax Benefits. The amount of any Damages for which
indemnification is provided under this Section 11 shall be net of any proceeds
actually recovered by the Indemnified Party in respect of such matter (A)
under any insurance policies, or under any insurance policies held by the
Acquired Companies at or prior to the Closing, in each case less any costs and
expenses and any premiums or Taxes incurred by such Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates in connection with the pursuit or recovery of such amounts,
including any increase in insurance premiums, retroactive premiums, costs
associated with any loss of insurance and replacement thereof or self-insured
component of such insurance coverage, or (B) from any third party, and in each
case, no right of subrogation shall accrue to any insurer or third party
hereunder. If any proceeds to be netted hereunder with respect to such Damages
are actually received by the Indemnified Party after payment by the
Indemnifying Party of any amounts otherwise required to be paid to an
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 11 with respect to such Damages,
then the Indemnified Party shall pay to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after
such receipt, any amount that the Indemnifying Party would not have been
required to pay pursuant to this Section 11 with respect to such Damages had
such proceeds been received at the time of such payment. Notwithstanding the
fact that the Indemnified Party has recourse against any third party covering
the action, omission or other fact giving rise to Damages for which
indemnification may be sought under this Section 11, such Indemnified Party
shall not be obligated to pursue such recourse from any third party. The
amount of any Damages (including Taxes) for which indemnification is provided
under this Section 11 shall be (i) increased to take account of any net Tax
cost incurred by the Indemnified Party arising from the receipt or accrual of
indemnity payments hereunder (as a result of the indemnity payment being
included in income, resulting in a reduction of Tax basis, or otherwise), (ii)
increased, to the extent not previously taken into account, to take account of
any net Tax cost incurred by the Indemnified Party as a result of the event
giving rise to the Damages for which indemnification is provided, and (iii)
reduced, to the extent not previously taken into account, to take account of
any net Tax benefit realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the
incurrence or payment of any such Damages or Taxes for all affected taxable
years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date and, with respect to any
Straddle Period, the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including
the Closing Date. In computing the amount of any such Tax cost or Tax benefit,
all calculations shall be made at the time of the relevant indemnification
payment using reasonable assumptions (as agreed to by the Indemnifying Party
and Indemnified Party) and present value concepts (using a discount rate equal
to the applicable federal rate in effect at the time of the Indemnified Event
(based on the Federal mid-term rate) using semi-annual compounding).

(f) Liabilities Included in Closing Working Capital. In no event shall any
Seller, HTDS Member or HTDS Beneficial Owner have any obligation to indemnify
the Purchaser Indemnitees for any Damages pursuant to this Section 11 to the
extent that such Damages were included as Liabilities in the calculation of
the Net Working Capital Amount, the unpaid Closing Indebtedness Amount or the
amount of unpaid Company Transaction Expenses (other than in respect of any
obligation arising under Section 1.7).

(g) Mitigation of Damages. Each Seller Indemnitee and Purchaser Indemnitee
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its Damages to the extent
required by applicable Legal Requirement upon and after becoming aware of any
event that would reasonably be expected to give rise to Damages that may be
indemnifiable under this Section 11 (it being understood and agreed that any
reasonable out-of-pocket fees, costs or expenses incurred in connection with
such mitigation shall themselves constitute Damages, to the extent the Damages
mitigated would have been indemnifiable pursuant to Section 11).

11.4 No Contribution. Each Seller, HTDS Member and HTDS Beneficial Owner
waives, and acknowledges and agrees that such party shall not have and shall
not exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), any right of
contribution, right of indemnity or advancement of expenses or other right or
remedy against any Acquired Company in connection with any indemnification
obligation or any other liability to which such party may become subject under
or in connection with this Agreement or any other agreement or document
delivered to Purchaser in connection with this Agreement. Effective as of the
Closing, the Sellers' Agent, on behalf of itself and each Seller, HTDS Member
and HTDS Beneficial Owner, and each Seller, HTDS Member and HTDS Beneficial
Owner, expressly waives and releases any and all rights of subrogation,
contribution, advancement, indemnification or other claim against any Acquired

11.5 Defense of Third Party Claims. The party making a claim for
indemnification under this Section 11 is referred to as the "Indemnified
Party," and the party against whom such claim for indemnification is asserted
under this Section 11 is referred to as the "Indemnifying Party."

(a) Third Party Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any claim or Legal Proceeding (whether against
any Acquired Company, Purchaser or any other Person) made or brought by any
Person who is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this
Agreement or a Representative of the foregoing (a "Third Party Claim") against
such Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is
obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified
Party shall give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice
thereof. The failure to promptly give such written notice shall not, however,
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and
only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially
prejudiced thereby. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the
Third Party Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material
written evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if
reasonably practicable, of the Damages that have been or may be sustained by
the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
participate in or, upon providing written notice to the Indemnified Party
within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such notice of such Third Party Claim
in which the Indemnifying Party acknowledges without qualification its
indemnification obligation hereunder (subject only to the applicable
limitations set forth in this Section 11), to assume the defense of any Third
Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's expense and by the Indemnifying
Party's own counsel. In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of any Third Party Claim, subject to Section 11.5(b), it shall have
the right to take such reasonable action as it deems necessary to avoid,
dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third
Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it, subject to the Indemnifying
Party's right to control the defense thereof. The fees and disbursements of
such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party, provided, that
if in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, there are
legal defenses available to an Indemnified Party that are different from or
additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying
Party elects not to compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, fails to give
timely and sufficient notification to the Indemnified Party in writing of its
election to defend as provided in this Agreement, or loses its right to defend
such Third Party Claim by failing to diligently defend such Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party may, subject to Section 11.5(b), without prejudice to
its right to indemnification hereunder, pay, compromise and defend such Third Party Claim and seek indemnification for any
and all Damages based upon, arising from or relating to such Third Party
Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
11.5, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume control of a
Third Party Claim if (i) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in
connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, investigation or
allegation, (ii) the Third Party Claim seeks injunctive or other equitable
relief or relief other than for monetary Damages against the Indemnified
Party, (iii) the Indemnified Party reasonably believes that the Third Party
Claim, if adversely determined, would impair in any material respect the
financial condition, business, operations, reputation or prospects of the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (iv) an actual or readily apparent
conflict of interest (as determined by the Indemnified Party after obtaining
advice of counsel) exists between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party with respect to the Third Party Claim that precludes effective joint
representation or (v) the amounts reasonably expected to be incurred in
connection with such Third Party Claim, together with all other outstanding
claims on the Escrow Fund, exceed the amount remaining in the Escrow Fund. If,
pursuant to this Section 11.5(a), the Indemnified Party so contests, defends,
litigates or settles a Third Party Claim for which it is entitled to
indemnification hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall be reimbursed by the
Indemnifying Party for the reasonable attorneys' fees and other expenses of
defending the Third Party Claim which are incurred from time to time, promptly
following the presentation to the Indemnifying Party of itemized bills for
such attorneys' fees and other expenses, subject, however, to any applicable
limitations set forth in this Section 11. Subject to any applicable
limitations set forth in this Section 11, all expenses (including attorneys'
fees) incurred by the Indemnifying Party in connection with the foregoing
shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party.

(b) Settlement of Third Party Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
unless: (i) a firm offer is made to settle a Third Party Claim that (A) does
not impose injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party
or any of its Affiliates (including any equitable remedies or other
obligations or restrictions upon the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates), (B) would not lead to any Liability or the creation of a
financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party or any of
its Affiliates, (C) provides, in customary form, for the full, unconditional
written release of each Indemnified Party and its Affiliates from all
liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third Party Claim, and (D)
does not adversely affect the conduct of the business of the Indemnified Party
or any of its Affiliates, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party provides written
notice to the Indemnified Party that it desires to accept and agree to such
offer and the terms thereof. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense
pursuant to Section 11.5(a), it shall not agree to any settlement without the
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(c) Cooperation. The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall each
use commercially reasonable efforts in good faith to cooperate with each other
in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any Third Party
Claim, including, upon the reasonable request of the defending party,
providing copies of records within the non-defending party's possession or
control relating to such Third Party Claim and making available, without
expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses),
Representatives of the non-defending party as may be reasonably necessary for
the preparation of the defense of such Third Party Claim.

11.6 Indemnification Obligations of HTDS. Each HTDS Beneficial Owner shall be
jointly and severally liable with its respective HTDS Member, up to the
percentage ownership interest of such HTDS Member in HTDS, with respect to the
indemnification and other obligations of HTDS under Sections 7 and 11 of this
Agreement, in each case on the same terms and conditions as HTDS in its
capacity as Seller and as if he or it were Seller for purposes of such
Sections. Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, each HTDS Beneficial Owner and each HTDS Member hereby agrees to be bound on
his or its own behalf to perform each and every covenant of HTDS under
Sections 7 and 11 of this Agreement in its capacity as Seller contained in
this Agreement.

11.7 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification payments
made under this Agreement will be treated by the parties as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable
Legal Requirement.

11.8 Exclusive Remedy. Except (a) in the event of fraud, willful misconduct or
intentional misrepresentation and (b) for equitable remedies, from and after
the Closing, the rights to indemnification, compensation and reimbursement set
forth in Section 7 or this Section 11 shall be the sole and exclusive monetary
remedy of the Purchaser Indemnitees and the Seller Indemnitees (whether at law
or in equity) with respect to any breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant set forth in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant
to this Agreement.

12. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

12.1 Sellers' Agent.

(a) Appointment. By virtue of the adoption and approval of this Agreement,
each of the Sellers, HTDS Members and HTDS Beneficial Owners, and by virtue of
execution of the Class B Letter Agreements, each of the holders of Class B
Units, irrevocably nominates, constitutes and appoints HTDS as his, her or its
agent and true and lawful attorney in fact (the "Sellers' Agent"), with full
power of substitution, to act in the name, place and stead of such party for
purposes of executing any documents and taking any actions that the Sellers'
Agent may, in the Sellers' Agent's sole discretion, determine to be necessary,
desirable or appropriate in connection with any claim for indemnification,
compensation or reimbursement under Sections 7 or 11\. HTDS hereby accepts its
appointment as Sellers' Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that any claim for indemnification under Section
11.2(a)(ii) of this Agreement made by the Purchaser Indemnitees severally and
directly from and against ABRY as the breaching Seller and involving no other
party hereto shall be asserted by Purchaser against ABRY directly, and the
Sellers' Agent shall not be authorized to act or have any power, discretion or
obligation in connection with such claim.

(b) Authority. Except as set forth in the last sentence of Section 12.1(a),
the Sellers, HTDS Members, HTDS Beneficial Owners and Class B Unit holders
grant to the Sellers' Agent full authority to execute, deliver, acknowledge,
certify and file on behalf of such parties (in the name of any or all of the
parties or otherwise) any and all documents that the Sellers' Agent may, in
its sole discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable or appropriate, in
such forms and containing such provisions as the Sellers' Agent may, in its
sole discretion, determine to be appropriate, in performing its duties as
contemplated by Section 12.1(a). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or in any other agreement executed in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, and except as set forth in the last
sentence of Section 12.1(a): (i) each Purchaser Indemnitee shall be entitled
to deal exclusively with the Sellers' Agent or either of its authorized
representatives (McClurg or Hutchison), on all matters relating to any claim
for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under Sections 7 or 11; and
(ii) each Purchaser Indemnitee shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without
further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or purported
to be executed on behalf of any Seller, HTDS Member, HTDS Beneficial Owner or
Class B Unit holder by McClurg or Hutchison (on behalf of the Sellers' Agent),
and on any other action taken or purported to be taken on behalf of any
Seller, HTDS Member, HTDS Beneficial Owner or Class B Unit holder by McClurg or Hutchison (on behalf of the
Sellers' Agent), as fully binding upon such Seller, HTDS Member, HTDS
Beneficial Owner or Class B Unit holder.

(c) Power of Attorney. The Sellers, HTDS Members., HTDS Beneficial Owners and
Class B Unit holders recognize and intend that the power of attorney granted
in Section 12.1(a): (i) is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable; (ii)
may be delegated by the Sellers' Agent or either of its authorized
representatives (McClurg or Hutchison); and (iii) shall survive the death,
incapacity, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of each Seller, HTDS
Member, HTDS Beneficial Owner or Class B Unit holder.

(d) Replacement. If the Sellers' Agent shall resign or become unable to
fulfill its responsibilities hereunder, the Sellers, HTDS Members, HTDS
Beneficial Owners and Class B Unit holders shall (by consent of those Persons
entitled to at least a majority of the Purchase Price), within 10 days after
such resignation or inability, appoint a successor to the Sellers' Agent (who
shall be reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser) and immediately thereafter
notify Purchaser of the identity of such successor. Any such successor shall
succeed the Sellers' Agent as Sellers' Agent hereunder. If for any reason
there is no Sellers' Agent at any time, all references herein to the Sellers'
Agent shall be deemed to refer to the Sellers, HTDS Members, HTDS Beneficial
Owners and Class B Unit holders.

(e) No Liability; Indemnification. The Sellers' Agent shall not be liable to
any of the Sellers, HTDS Members, HTDS Beneficial Owners or Class B Unit
holders for any action taken by the Sellers' Agent pursuant to this Agreement
unless the Sellers' Agent has acted in bad faith or with gross negligence. The
Sellers' Agent is serving in the capacity as exclusive agent of the Sellers,
HTDS Members, HTDS Beneficial Owners and Class B Unit holders hereunder solely
for purposes of administrative convenience. The Sellers, HTDS Members, HTDS
Beneficial Owners and Class B Unit holders shall severally (based on his or
its Pro Rata Share) indemnify the Sellers' Agent to the fullest extent
permitted by law (i) for all costs and expenses of the Sellers' Agent incurred
in the performance of such Sellers' Agent's duties as a shareholder
representative, and (ii) if the Sellers' Agent was or is or becomes a party to
or witness or other participant in, or is threatened to be made a party to or
a witness or other participant in, any threatened, pending or completed
proceeding (a "Representative Claim") by reason of (or arising in part out of)
any event or occurrence related to the fact that the Sellers' Agent is or was
a shareholder representative, or by reason of any action or inaction on the
part of the Sellers' Agent while serving in such capacity, against any and all
expenses (including attorneys' fees and all other costs, expenses and
obligations incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a
witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to defend,
be a witness in or participate in, any proceeding), judgments, fines and
penalties of such Representative Claim ((i) and (ii), collectively, the
"Representative Expenses"), including all interest, assessments and other
charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such
Representative Expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the
Sellers' Agent be indemnified for any Representative Expenses that arise out
of the Sellers' Agent's gross negligence or bad faith or with respect to any
proceeding instituted by the Sellers' Agent to enforce or interpret this
Agreement, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that each of the
material assertions made by the Sellers' Agent in such proceeding was not made
in good faith or was frivolous.

(f) Decisions Final. Subject to the last sentence of Section 12.1(a), any
decision or action by the Sellers' Agent or either of its authorized
representatives (McClurg or Hutchison), including any agreement between the
Sellers' Agent (or McClurg or Hutchison on behalf of the Sellers' Agent) and
Purchaser relating to the defense, payment or settlement of any claims
(including claims for which the Escrow Fund may be available to indemnify any
of the Purchaser Indemnitees) under this Agreement, shall constitute a
decision or action of the Sellers, HTDS Members, HTDS Beneficial Owners and
Class B Unit holders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such Seller, HTDS Member,
HTDS Beneficial Owner and Class B Unit holder. Subject to the last sentence of
Section 12.1(a), none of the Sellers, HTDS Members, HTDS Beneficial Owners or
Class B Unit holders shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or
otherwise contest the same.

(g) Other. Except as set forth in the last sentence of Section 12.1(a), the
Sellers, HTDS Members and HTDS Beneficial Owners, the Class B Unit holders
(through the Class B Letter Agreements), further authorize and approve, and
Purchaser agrees that that Purchaser may rely conclusively, absolutely and
exclusively, without inquiry, upon any communication given or action taken by
HTDS or either McClurg or Hutchison on behalf of HTDS as the action of each
Seller, HTDS Member, HTDS Beneficial Owner and Class B Unit holder in actions
required or permitted to be taken by the Sellers' Agent hereunder and will not
be liable to any Seller, HTDS Member, HTDS Beneficial Owner or Class B Unit
holder or any other Person for any action taken or not taken in reliance upon
the direction of the Sellers' Agent. Purchaser will not be obligated to
inquire as to the authority of McClurg, Hutchison or the Sellers' Agent with
respect to the taking of any action that the Sellers' Agent takes on behalf of
any Seller, HTDS Member, HTDS Beneficial Owner or Class B Unit holder.

12.2 Further Assurances. Each party hereto shall execute and cause to be
delivered to each other party hereto such instruments and other documents, and
shall take such other actions, as such other party may reasonably request
(prior to, at or after the Closing) for the purpose of carrying out or
evidencing any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

12.3 No Waiver Relating to Claims for Fraud, Willful Misconduct or Intentional
Misrepresentation. The liability of any Person under Sections 7 or 11 will be
in addition to, and not exclusive of, any other liability that such Person may
have at law or in equity based on such Person's fraudulent acts or omissions,
willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentations. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, none of the provisions set forth
in this Agreement, including the provisions set forth in Sections 7 or 11,
shall be deemed a waiver by any party to this Agreement of any right or remedy
which such party may have at law or in equity based on any other Person's
fraudulent acts or omissions, willful misconduct or intentional
misrepresentation, nor will any such provisions limit, or be deemed to limit:
(a) the amounts of recovery sought or awarded in any such claim for fraud,
willful misconduct or intentional misrepresentation; (b) the time period
during which a claim for fraud, willful misconduct or intentional
misrepresentation may be brought; or (c) the recourse which any such party may
seek against another Person with respect to a claim for fraud, willful
misconduct or intentional misrepresentation.

12.4 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly required by this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, each party to this Agreement shall bear
and pay all fees, costs and expenses that have been incurred or that are
incurred in the future by such party in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including all fees, costs and expenses
incurred by such party in connection with or by virtue of: (a) the
negotiation, preparation and review of this Agreement (including the
Disclosure Schedule) and all agreements, certificates, opinions and other
instruments and documents delivered or to be delivered in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (b) the preparation and
submission of any filing or notice required to be made or given in connection
with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the obtaining
of any Consent required to be obtained in connection with any of such
transactions; and (c) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

12.5 Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be
delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
deemed properly delivered, given and received: (a) if delivered by hand, when delivered; (b) if sent on a Business Day by
facsimile transmission before 5:00 p.m. (recipient's time) on the day sent by
facsimile and receipt is confirmed, when transmitted; (c) if sent by facsimile

to be a part of this Agreement and shall not be referred to in connection with
the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

12.7 Counterparts and Exchanges by Electronic Transmission or Facsimile. This
Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall
constitute an original and all of which, when taken together, shall constitute
one agreement. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or

12.8 Governing Law; Dispute Resolution.

(a) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with, and
governed in all respects by, the internal laws of the State of Illinois
(without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws).

(b) Venue. Except as otherwise provided in the Escrow Agreement or in Section
12.8(c), any action, suit or other legal proceeding relating to this Agreement
or the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement (including an action,
suit or other legal proceeding based upon intentional misrepresentation,
willful misconduct or fraud) shall be brought or otherwise commenced
exclusively in any state or federal court located in Chicago, Illinois. Each
party to this Agreement: (i) expressly and irrevocably consents and submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of each state and federal court located in Chicago, Illinois (and each appellate court located in Chicago, Illinois) in
connection with any such action, suit or legal proceeding; (ii) agrees that
each state and federal court located in Chicago, Illinois shall be deemed to
be a convenient forum; and (iii) agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a
defense or otherwise), in any such action, suit or legal proceeding commenced
in any state or federal court located in Chicago, Illinois, any claim that
such party is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of such court, that
such action, suit or legal proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient
forum, that the venue of such action, suit or legal proceeding is improper or
that this Agreement or the subject matter of this Agreement may not be
enforced in or by such court.

(c) Indemnification Claims. Any direct claim for indemnification, compensation
or reimbursement pursuant to Sections 7 or 11 not constituting a Third Party
Claim (and, at the option of any Purchaser Indemnitee, any other claim for a
monetary remedy, such as in the case of a claim based upon intentional
misrepresentation, willful misconduct or fraud, relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated herein after the Closing) shall be brought and
resolved exclusively in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and Exhibit G (it
being understood that, for the avoidance of doubt and without limiting any
portion of Section 12.8(b): (i) at the option of any Purchaser Indemnitee, any
claim based upon intentional misrepresentation, willful misconduct or fraud
may be brought and resolved in accordance with Section 12.8(b) rather than in
accordance with Exhibit G; and (ii) nothing in this Section 12.8(c) shall
prevent any Indemnified Party from seeking preliminary injunctive relief or
any other equitable remedy from a court of competent jurisdiction).

12.9 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation
of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser may freely assign any or all
of its rights under this Agreement (including its indemnification rights under
Sections 7 and 11), in whole or in part, (A) prior to the Closing, to an
Affiliate of Purchaser without obtaining the consent or approval of any other
party hereto or of any other Person; provided, however, that no assignment
shall limit or affect Purchaser's obligations hereunder, which shall remain
primary, and (B) after the Closing, to any other Person without obtaining the
consent or approval of any other party hereto or of any other Person. This
Agreement shall be binding upon: (a) the Company and its successors and
assigns (if any); (b) Purchaser and its successors and assigns (if any); (c)
the Sellers' Agent and its successors and assigns (if any); and (d) Sellers,
the HTDS Members and the HTDS Beneficial Owners. This Agreement shall inure to
the benefit of: (i) the Company; (ii) Purchaser; (iii) the other Purchaser
Indemnitees; (iv) the Sellers' Agent; (v) Sellers, the HTDS Members and the
HTDS Beneficial Owners; and (vi) the respective successors and assigns (if

12.10 Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance. Except as expressly set forth
in this Agreement, the rights and remedies of the parties hereto shall be
cumulative (and not alternative). The parties to this Agreement agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof, and that in the event of any
breach or threatened breach by any party hereto of any covenant, obligation or
other provision set forth in this Agreement, each of the other parties will be
entitled to, without any proof of actual damages, to, in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity: (a) a decree or order
of specific performance or mandamus to enforce the observance and performance
of such covenant, obligation or other provision; (b) an injunction restraining
such breach or threatened breach.

12.11 Waiver. No failure on the part of any Person to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of
any Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right,
privilege or remedy. No Person shall be deemed to have waived any claim
arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under
this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or
remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and
delivered on behalf of such Person; and any such waiver shall not be
applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is
given.

12.12 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT OR OTHER LEGAL
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

12.13 Amendments. This Agreement may not be amended, modified, altered or
supplemented other than by means of a written instrument duly executed and
delivered: (a) prior to the Closing Date, on behalf of the Company, Purchaser
and the Sellers' Agent; and (b) after the Closing Date, on behalf of Purchaser
and the Sellers' Agent (acting exclusively for and on behalf of all of the
Sellers, HTDS Members and HTDS Beneficial Owners).

12.14 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application of any such provision to any Person or set of circumstances, shall
be determined to be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable to any extent,
the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such provision to
Persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is determined to be
invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable, shall not be impaired or otherwise
affected and shall continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by law.

12.15 Parties in Interest. Except for the provisions of Sections 7 and 11,
this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or
implied, is intended to or will confer upon any other Person any legal or
equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason
of this Agreement.

12.16 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other agreements referred to
herein set forth the entire understanding of the parties hereto relating to
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings among or between any of the parties relating to the subject
matter hereof and thereof; provided, however, that the Confidentiality
Agreement shall not be superseded by this Agreement and shall remain in effect
in accordance with its terms until the earlier of: (a) the Closing; or (b) the
date on which such Confidentiality Agreement is terminated or expires in
accordance with its terms.

12.17 Disclosure Schedule. The Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in
separate parts corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and
subsections contained in this Agreement, and the information disclosed in any
numbered or lettered part shall be deemed to relate to and to qualify only the
particular representation or warranty of the Company set forth in the
corresponding numbered or lettered section or subsection of this Agreement,
except to the extent that (a) such information is explicitly cross-referenced
in another part of the Disclosure Schedule, or (b) it is readily apparent on
the face of the disclosure (without reference to any document referred to
therein) that such information qualifies another representation and warranty
of the Company in this Agreement. Nothing in the Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty of
the Company made in this Agreement, unless the applicable part of the
Disclosure Schedule identifies the exception with reasonable particularity and
describes the relevant facts in reasonable detail. The mere listing of a
document or other item in, or attachment of a copy thereof to, the Disclosure Schedule will not be deemed
adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made in this
Agreement (unless the representation or warranty pertains directly to the
existence of the document or other item itself). The inclusion of documents in
the Company's "Project Bronco" electronic documentation site hosted by Merrill
Communications LLC at least one Business Day prior to the date of this
Agreement shall be deemed to constitute delivery or the making available of
such documents hereunder.

12.18 Construction.

(a) Gender; Etc. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context
requires: the singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the
masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine
gender shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender
shall include the masculine and feminine genders.

(b) Ambiguities. The parties hereto agree that any rule of construction to the
effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall
not be applied in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

(c) Interpretation. As used in this Agreement, (i) the words "include" and
"including," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of
limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without

pursuant to Sections 7 or 11 of this Agreement (and, at the option of any

procedures set forth in the Escrow Agreement and this Exhibit G shall not

this Agreement (and, at the option of any Indemnified Party, any other claim
for a monetary remedy, such as in the case of a claim based upon intentional
misrepresentation or fraud, relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement after the Closing) shall be brought and
resolved exclusively as follows:

(a) If any Indemnified Party has or claims in good faith to have incurred or

Indemnified Party believes in good faith that its is entitled to
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under Section 7 or 11 of this

(the "Agreed Amount"), then:
