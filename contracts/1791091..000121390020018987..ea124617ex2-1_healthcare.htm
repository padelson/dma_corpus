aggregate consideration to be paid to the holders of Company
Interests pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)-(d)_ shall be the Merger Consideration.

  



  

(b) The Merger Consideration shall be paid in the form of: (i) an amount in
cash equal to the Closing Cash Payment Amount and (ii) the Closing Number of

(as reflected in the Company Closing Statement).

Interests or the holders of any of the securities of Parent, the following
shall occur:

  



  

(a) Each share of Company Stock (other than Excluded Shares) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and
automatically deemed for all purposes to represent the right to receive a
portion of the Merger Consideration, with each Company Stockholder being
entitled to receive a portion of the Closing Cash Payment Amount and the
Closing Number of Securities in accordance with the terms of the Applicable
Charter Documents (as reflected in the Company Closing Statement), in each
case, without interest, upon surrender of stock certificates representing all
of such Company Stockholder's Company Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") and
delivery of the other documents required pursuant to _Section 2.9_. As of the
Effective Time, each Company Stockholder shall cease to have any other rights
in and to the Company (and after the Reorganization, Newco), the Surviving
Corporation or the Surviving Entity, and each Certificate relating to the
ownership of shares of Company Stock (other than Excluded Shares)
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the applicable portion
of the Merger Consideration.

  



  

(b) Each Company Warrant that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be treated in accordance with its terms and cancelled as
of the Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive a portion of the
Merger Consideration, with each holder of Company Warrants being entitled to
receive a portion of the Closing Cash Payment Amount and the Closing Number of
Securities in accordance with the terms of such Company Warrant and the
Applicable Charter Documents (as reflected in the Company Closing Statement),
net of the exercise price of such Company Warrant, in each case, without
interest, upon delivery of the documents required pursuant to _Section 2.9_.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the exercise price payable in respect of a
share of Company Common Stock under a Company Warrant exceeds the applicable
portion of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such share of
Company Common Stock, such Company Warrant shall be automatically terminated
for no consideration immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall be of
no further force or effect, and the holder of such Company Warrant shall have
no further rights to any portion of the Merger Consideration otherwise. As of
the Effective Time, each holder of Company Warrants shall cease to have any
other rights in and to the Company (and after the Reorganization, Newco), the
Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Entity, and each Company Warrant shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the applicable portion of the
Merger Consideration.

(c) Each vested Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be treated in accordance with its terms and cancelled as
of the Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive a portion of the
Merger Consideration, with each holder of vested Company Options being
entitled to receive a portion of the Closing Cash Payment Amount and the
Closing Number of Securities in accordance with the terms of such vested
Company Option and the Applicable Charter Documents (as reflected in the
Company Closing Statement), net of the exercise price of such vested Company
Option, in each case, without interest, upon delivery of the
documents required pursuant to _Section 2.9_. For the avoidance of doubt, if
the exercise price payable in respect of a share of Company Common Stock
under a vested Company Option exceeds the applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such share of Company Common Stock, such
vested Company Option shall be cancelled for no consideration immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and the holder of vested Company Options shall
have no further rights to any portion of the Merger Consideration otherwise.
As of the Effective Time, each holder of vested Company Options shall cease to
have any other rights in and to the Company (and after the Reorganization,
Newco), the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Entity. Payments of the
Closing Cash Payment Amount in respect of this _Section 2.7(c)_ shall be
remitted through the payroll system of the Surviving Entity upon delivery of
an Option Termination Agreement in accordance with _Section 2.9_ and subject
to applicable deduction or withholding pursuant to _Section 2.10_.

  



  

(d) Each unvested Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be converted into an option to purchase a number of
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock (each such option, an " _Exchanged
Option_ ") equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, as equitably
adjusted pursuant to a conversion ratio applied in, and subject the terms and
conditions of, the Company Closing Statement or as otherwise agreed upon by
the Parties (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") and rounded down to the nearest whole
number, with an exercise price per share equal to the exercise price per
share of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, as
equitably adjusted pursuant to the Exchange Ratio and rounded up to the
nearest whole cent; _provided_ , _however_ , that the number of shares and
exercise price of Parent Class A Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the
Exchanged Options shall be determined in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the
case of any Exchanged Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the
exercise price and the number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock
purchasable pursuant to such option shall be determined in accordance with the
foregoing, subject to such adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy
the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. Except as specifically
provided above, following the Effective Time, each Exchanged Option shall
continue to be governed by substantially the same terms and conditions
(including vesting and exercisability terms) as were applicable to the
corresponding former Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.
As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and, in any event, in
accordance with applicable Law, Parent shall file an appropriate registration
statement or registration statements with respect to the shares of Parent
Class A Common Stock underlying such Exchanged Options and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as
such awards remain outstanding.

(e) No fraction of a share of Parent Class A Common Stock will be issued by
virtue of the First Merger, and each holder of Company Interests who would
otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Class A Common Stock
(after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock that
otherwise would be received by such holder of Company Interests) shall receive
from Parent, in lieu of such fractional share: (i) one share of Parent Class
A Common Stock if the aggregate amount of fractional shares of Parent Class A
Common Stock such holder of Company Interests would otherwise be entitled to
is equal to or exceeds 0.50; or (ii) no shares of Parent Class A Common Stock
if the aggregate amount of fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock
such holder of Company Interests would otherwise be entitled to is less than
0.50.

  



  

(f) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock of First Merger Sub
shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation, which shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time,
all certificates representing the common stock of First Merger Sub shall be
deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with
the immediately preceding sentence.

  



  

(g) Each share of Company Stock held in the Company's (or after the
Reorganization, Newco's) treasury or owned by Parent, First Merger Sub,
Second Merger Sub or the Company (or after the Reorganization, Newco)
immediately prior to the Effective Time (together with the Dissenting Shares,
the " _Excluded Shares_ "), shall be cancelled and no consideration shall be
paid or payable with respect thereto.

  



  

(h) The number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock that the holders of
Company Interests are entitled to receive as a result of the First Merger and
as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement shall be adjusted to reflect
appropriately the effect of any stock split, split-up, reverse stock split,
stock dividend or distribution (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Parent Class A Common Stock), extraordinary cash
dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Parent
Class A Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the
Closing.

  



  

Section 2.8 _Effect of the Second Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Second Effective Time, by virtue of the
Second Merger and without any action on the part of any Party or any holder
of Company Interests or the holders of any shares of capital stock of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or Second Merger Sub: (a) each share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Second Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist without
any conversion thereof or payment therefor; and (b) the membership interest
of Second Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective
Time shall be converted into and become the membership interest of the
Surviving Entity, which shall constitute one hundred percent (100%) of the
outstanding equity of the Surviving Entity. From and after the Second
Effective Time, the membership interests of the Second Merger Sub shall be
deemed for all purposes to represent the number of membership interests into
which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence.

Section 2.9 _Surrender of Company Certificates and Disbursement of Merger
Consideration_.

  



  

(a) Subject to this _Section 2.9_, promptly following the Effective Time,
Parent shall deliver, or cause to be delivered to each holder of Company
Interests a portion of the Closing Cash Payment Amount and the Closing Number
of Securities in accordance with the terms of _Section 2.7_ and the
Applicable Charter Documents (as reflected in the Company Closing Statement).

  



  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or
trust company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purposes of exchanging (i)
Certificates and Company Warrants for the portion of the Merger Consideration
payable to each Company Stockholder and holder of Company Warrants,
respectively and (ii) Company Options for the Closing Number of Securities
payable to each holder of Company Options.

  



  

(c) At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent to be
held in trust the aggregate amount of the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration (other than payments of the Closing Cash Payment Amount in
respect of _Section 2.7(c)_ , which shall be paid in accordance with the
terms thereof) and make available the aggregate amount of the equity portion
of the Merger Consideration, in each case, required pursuant to the Company
Closing Statement to fund the payments set forth in _Section 2.7(a)_ , 
_Section 2.7(b)_ and _Section 2.7(c)_. Such cash and equity deposited with the
Exchange Agent shall be referred to in this Agreement as the " _Exchange
Fund_ ". At the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver irrevocable
instructions to the Exchange Agent to deliver the Merger Consideration out of
the Exchange Fund in the manner it is contemplated to be issued or paid
pursuant to this _ARTICLE II_.

  



  

(d) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3)
Business Days thereafter), the Exchange Agent shall deliver to each Company
Stockholder (other than holders of Excluded Shares): (i) a letter of
transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") in customary form mutually
agreed between Parent and the Company (or after the Reorganization, Newco)
prior to the Closing specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided
in _Section 2.9(h)_) to the Exchange Agent, such letter of transmittal to be
in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company (or
after the Reorganization, Newco) may reasonably agree; and (ii) instructions
for surrendering the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in _Section 2.9(h)_) to the Exchange Agent (the "
_Surrender Documentation_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Exchange
Agent shall not be required to deliver the Surrender Documentation to any
Company Stockholder that has delivered its Surrender Documentation with
respect to such Company Stockholder's Certificates to the Exchange Agent at
least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Upon surrender of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in
_Section 2.9(h)_) to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the terms of the
Surrender Documentation, the Exchange Agent will deliver to the holder of
such Certificate in exchange therefor such holder's portion of the
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.9(a)_ hereof, with: (A)
any cash portion of the Merger Consideration being delivered via wire
transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with instructions
provided by such Company Stockholder in the Letter of Transmittal; and (B)
the equity portion of the Merger Consideration being delivered via book-entry
issuance, in each case, less any required Tax withholdings as provided in
_Section 2.10_; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the holder of such
Certificate delivers to the Exchange Agent the Surrender Documentation with
respect to such Company Stockholder's Certificates at least two Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the holder of
such Certificate in exchange therefor such holder's portion of the Merger
Consideration covered by such Surrender Documentation in accordance with
clauses (A) and (B) of this sentence on the Closing Date or as promptly as
practicable thereafter. The Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. Until so surrendered, each Certificate shall represent after the
Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the applicable
portion of the Merger Consideration attributable to such Certificate. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of
the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of
Company Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company
(or after the Reorganization, Newco), the applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration to be delivered upon due surrender of the Certificate may be
issued to such transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such
shares of Company Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

(e) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3)
Business Days thereafter), the Exchange Agent shall deliver to (i) to each
holder of vested Company Options an option termination agreement in a
customary form mutually agreed between Parent and the Company (or after the
Reorganization, Newco) prior to the Closing (the " _Option Termination
Agreement_ ") and to each holder of Company Warrants a warrant surrender
agreement (the " _Warrant Surrender Agreement_ ") in a customary form
mutually agreed between Parent and the Company (or after the Reorganization,
Newco) prior to the Closing; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Exchange
Agent shall not be required to deliver the Option Termination Agreement or
Warrant Surrender Agreement to any holder of vested Company Options or
Company Warrants that has delivered its Option Termination Agreement or
Warrant Surrender Agreement with respect to such holder of vested Company
Options or Company Warrants to the Exchange Agent at least two Business Days
prior to the Closing Date. Upon delivery of an Option Termination Agreement or
Warrant Termination Agreement to the Exchange Agent, the Exchange Agent will
deliver to the holder of such vested Company Options or Company Warrants in
exchange therefor such holder's portion of the Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.9(a)_ hereof, with: (A) any cash portion of the
Merger Consideration being delivered via wire transfer of immediately
available funds in accordance with instructions provided by such holder; and
(B) the equity portion of the Merger Consideration being delivered via book-
entry issuance, in each case, less any required Tax withholdings as provided
in _Section 2.10_; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such holder of vested
Company Options or Company Warrants delivers to the Exchange Agent the Option
Termination Agreement or Warrant Surrender Agreement with respect to such
holder's vested Company Options or Company Warrants at least two
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to
the holder of such certificate in exchange therefor such holder's portion of
the Merger Consideration covered by such Option Termination Agreement or
Warrant Surrender Agreement in accordance with clauses (A) and (B) of this
sentence on the Closing Date or as promptly as practicable thereafter. Each
vested Company Option and Company Warrant shall represent after the Effective
Time for all purposes only the right to receive the applicable portion of the
Merger Consideration attributable to such vested Company Option and Company
Warrants and no interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon
delivery of an Option Termination Agreement or Warrant Surrender Agreement.

  



  

(f) From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
transfer books of the Company (or after the Reorganization, Newco) of any
shares of Company Stock or any Company Warrants that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity,
Parent or the Exchange Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and deemed
exchanged for (without interest and after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.10_) the portion of the Merger
Consideration represented by such Certificate, as applicable.

  



  

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains unclaimed by the
Company Stockholders or holders of Company Warrants or vested Company Options
for one hundred and eighty (180) days after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Entity. Any Company Stockholder or holder of
Company Warrants or vested Company Options who has not theretofore complied
with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity for
payment of their respective portion of the Merger Consideration (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.10_) upon
due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such
certificates as provided in _Section 2.9(h) _or other applicable
documentation), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity, Parent, the Exchange
Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Company
Interests for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

  



  

   

11

 



    



  

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed:
(i) upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed; and (ii) if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms
as may be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it, the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Entity with respect to
such certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue the portion of the Merger
Consideration attributable to such certificate (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.10_).

  



  

Section 2.10 _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Parent, First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub, the Company (or
after the Reorganization, Newco), the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving
Entity, the Exchange Agent and their Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any portion of the consideration otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement, any amount required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under applicable Law. Prior to the
deduction or withholding from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement in accordance with this _Section 2.10_, the Parties will
reasonably cooperate in good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to
minimize any such deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made.

  



  

Section 2.11 _Appraisal Rights_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and to
the extent available under the DGCL, shares of Company Stock (excluding, for
the avoidance of doubt, shares of Company Series I Preferred Stock and Company
Series J Preferred Stock) that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that are held by Company Stockholders who shall have
neither voted in favor of the First Merger nor consented thereto in writing
in respect of such Company Stock and who shall have demanded properly in
writing appraisal for such Company Stock in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL and otherwise complied with all of the provisions of the DGCL
relevant to the exercise and perfection of appraisal rights (collectively, the
" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into, and such Company
Stockholders shall have no right to receive, the portion of the Merger
Consideration that would otherwise be attributable to such Company Stock in
accordance with the terms of the Applicable Charter Documents (as reflected
in the Company Closing Statement) unless and until such Company Stockholder
fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its right to
appraisal and payment under the DGCL. Any Company Stockholder who fails to
perfect or who effectively withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its
rights to appraisal of such shares of Company Stock under Section 262 of the
DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have
become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the
portion of the Merger Consideration attributable to such Company Stock in
accordance with the terms of the Applicable Charter Documents (as reflected
in the Company Closing Statement), without any interest thereon, upon
surrender, in the manner provided in _Section 2.9_ , of the Certificate or
Certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Stock.

  



  

   

12

 



    



  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company (and after the Reorganization, Newco)
shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by
the Company (or after the Reorganization, Newco) and any withdrawals of such
demands, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company
(and after the Reorganization, Newco) shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

  



  

Section 2.12 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Actions_. If, at any time
after the Effective Time or the Second Effective Time, any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to
vest the Surviving Corporation following the First Merger and the Surviving
Entity following the Second Merger with full right, title and possession to
all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company
(and after the Reorganization, Newco), First Merger Sub and Second Merger
Sub, the officers and directors or members, as applicable, (or their
designees) of the Company (and after the Reorganization, Newco), First Merger
Sub and Second Merger Sub are fully authorized in the name of their
respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful
and necessary action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with this
Agreement.

  



  

Section 2.13 _Tax Treatment of the Mergers_. The Parties intend that, for
United States federal income tax purposes, the Mergers, will constitute an
integrated plan described in Rev. Rul. 2001-46, 2001-2 C.B. 321 that
qualifies as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations to which each of Parent and the Company (or
after the Reorganization, Newco) are to be parties under Section 368(b) of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations and this Agreement is intended to be,
and is adopted as, a plan of reorganization for purposes of Sections 354, 361
and the 368 of the Code and within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-2(g). Following the Mergers, Parent intends to cause the Surviving
Entity to continue the Company's historic business or use a
significant portion of the Company's historic business assets in a business,
in each case, to the extent required pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-1(d). The Mergers, taken together, shall be reported by the Parties for
all income Tax purposes in accordance with the foregoing, including the
filing of the statement required by Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-3,
unless otherwise required by (a) a change in Law after the date of this
Agreement, or (b) a Governmental Entity as a result of a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code. Each
Company Stockholder and holder of Company Warrants may make an
express designation in its Letter of Transmittal provided by such Company
Stockholder or in its Warrant Surrender Agreement provided by such holder of
Company Warrants, in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section
1.358-2(a)(2)(ii), that specifies the Closing Cash Payment Amount that the
Company Stockholder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_ or the
holder of Company Warrants is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section
2.7(b)_ is received in exchange for a particular share of Common Stock or
received in exchange for a particular Company Warrant.

  



  

ARTICLE III. 
  _Sponsor Earnout Shares_

  



  

Section 3.1 _Potential Forfeiture_. In accordance with the Sponsor
Agreement, Sponsor has agreed that, effective upon the Closing, the Sponsor
will subject 1,875,000 shares of Parent Class A Common Stock owned by
Sponsor (the " _Sponsor Earnout Shares_ ") to potential forfeiture if the
Triggering Events do not occur during the Earnout Period, with such Sponsor
Earnout Shares vesting (and therefore no longer subject to forfeiture)

Except: (a) as set forth in the letter dated as of the date of this Agreement
and delivered by Parent, First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub to the
Company on or prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure
Letter_ "); and (b) as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed with the SEC
prior to the date of this Agreement (to the extent the qualifying nature of

"Risk Factors", "Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and any other
disclosures therein to the extent they are of a predictive or cautionary
nature or related to forward-looking statements, Parent, First Merger Sub and
Second Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company as of the date hereof
and as of the Closing Date as follows:

Second Merger Sub, taken as a whole.

  



  

(c) None of Parent, First Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub are in violation of
any of the provisions of their respective Charter Documents.

or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation or limited liability
company and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of
the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its

37

 



    



  

Section 5.2 _Parent Subsidiaries_. Parent has no direct or indirect

(a) execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements to which it is a party, and each ancillary document
that it has executed or delivered or is to execute or deliver pursuant to
this Agreement; and (b) carry out its obligations hereunder and thereunder
and, to consummate the Transactions (including the Mergers). The execution
and delivery by Parent, First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements to which each of them is a
party, and the consummation by Parent, First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub
of the Transactions (including the Mergers), have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate or limited liability company action on
the part of each of Parent, First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub, and no
other proceedings on the part of Parent, First Merger Sub or Second Merger
Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the other Transaction
Agreements to which each of them is a party or to consummate the transactions
contemplated thereby, other than obtaining the Requisite Parent Stockholder
Approval. This Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements to which each
of them is a party have been duly and validly executed and delivered by
Parent, First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the other Parties,
constitute the legal and binding obligations of Parent, First Merger Sub and
Second Merger Sub (as applicable), enforceable against Parent, First Merger
Sub and Second Merger Sub (as applicable) in accordance with their terms,
except insofar as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors'
rights generally or by principles governing the availability of equitable
remedies.

  



  

   

39

 



    



  

Section 5.5 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

  



  

(a) Neither the execution, delivery nor performance by Parent, First Merger
Sub and Second Merger Sub of this Agreement or the other
Transaction Agreements to which each of them is a party, nor (assuming the
Requisite Parent Stockholder Approval is obtained) the consummation of the
Transactions shall: (i) conflict with or violate their respective Charter
Documents; (ii) assuming that the consents, approvals, orders,
authorizations, registrations, filings or permits referred to in _Section
5.5(b)_ are duly and timely obtained or made, conflict with or violate any
applicable Law; or (iii) result in any breach of or constitute a default (or
an event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default)
under, or materially impair their respective rights or alter the rights or
obligations of any third party under, or give to others any rights of consent,
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a Lien (other than any Permitted Lien) on any of the properties or
assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any Parent Material
Contracts, except, with respect to clause (iii), as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(b) The execution and delivery by each of Parent, First Merger Sub and Second
Merger Sub of this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements to which it
is a party, does not, and the performance of its obligations hereunder and
thereunder will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit
of, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Entity, except: (i)
for the filing of the Certificates of Merger in accordance with the DGCL and
DLLCA, as applicable; (ii) for applicable requirements, if any, of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, blue sky laws, and the rules and regulations
thereunder, and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other
jurisdictions in which Parent is qualified to do business; (iii) for the
filing of any notifications required under the HSR Act and the expiration of
the required waiting period thereunder; and (iv) where the failure to
obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such
filings or notifications, would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, or prevent
the consummation of the Mergers.

  



  

Section 5.6 _Compliance; Permits_. Since its incorporation or organization,
as applicable, each of Parent, First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub has
complied in all material respects with and has not been in violation of any
applicable Law with respect to the conduct of its business, or the ownership
or operation of its business. Since the date of its incorporation or
organization, as applicable, to the Knowledge of Parent, no investigation or
review by any Governmental Entity with respect to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries has been pending or threatened. No written or oral notice of non-
compliance with any applicable Law has been received by any of Parent, First
Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub. Each of Parent, First Merger Sub and Second
Merger Sub is in possession of all Permits necessary to own, lease and operate
the properties it purports to own, operate or lease and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to have such
Permits would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to be material to Parent, First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub, taken as a
whole.

  



  

Section 5.7 _Parent SEC Reports; Financial Statements; No Undisclosed
Liabilities_.

  



  

(a) Parent has timely filed all forms, reports, schedules, statements and
other documents, including any exhibits thereto, required to be filed or
furnished by Parent with the SEC under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act
since Parent's incorporation (collectively, as they have been amended since
the time of their filing and including all exhibits thereto, the " _Parent SEC
Reports_ "). The Parent SEC Reports were prepared in accordance with the
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations thereunder. The
Parent SEC Reports did not at the time they were filed with the SEC contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Parent maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by
Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Each director and
executive officer of Parent has filed with the SEC on a timely basis all
statements required with respect to Parent by Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. As used in this _Section 5.7_,
the term "file" shall be broadly construed to include any manner in which a
document or information is furnished, supplied or otherwise made available to
the SEC or Nasdaq.

  



  

   

40

 



    



  

(b) The financial statements and notes contained or incorporated by reference
in the Parent SEC Reports fairly present in all material respects the
financial condition and the results of operations, changes in stockholders'
equity and cash flows of Parent as at the respective dates of, and for the
periods referred to, in such financial statements, all in accordance with: (i)
GAAP; and (ii) Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K, as applicable, subject, in
the case of interim financial statements, to normal recurring year-end
adjustments (the effect of which will not, individually or in the aggregate,
be material) and the omission of notes to the extent permitted by Regulation
S-X or Regulation S-K, as applicable. Parent has no off-balance sheet
arrangements that are not disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports. No financial
statements other than those of Parent are required by GAAP to be included in
the consolidated financial statements of Parent.

  



  

(c) There is no liability, debt or obligation (absolute, accrued, contingent
or otherwise) of any of the Parent or its Subsidiaries, except for
liabilities, debts and obligations: (i) provided for in, or otherwise
reflected or reserved for the financial statements and notes contained or
incorporated by reference in the Parent SEC Reports; (ii) that have arisen
since the date of the most recent balance sheet included in the financial
statements and notes contained or incorporated by reference in the Parent SEC
Reports in the ordinary course of the operation of business of Parent; (iii)
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
(iv) that will be discharged or paid off prior to or at the Closing; or (v)
that are not material to the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole.

  



  

Section 5.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as set forth in
Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, and except as
contemplated by this Agreement, since December 31, 2019, there has not been:
(a) any Parent Material Adverse Effect or (b) any action taken or agreed upon
by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that would be prohibited by _Section
6.2 _if such action were taken on or after the date hereof without the consent
of the Company (or after the Reorganization, Newco).

  



  

Section 5.9 _Litigation_. There are no Legal Proceedings pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing against or otherwise relating to
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, before any Governmental Entity: (a)
challenging or seeking to enjoining, alter or materially delay the
Transactions; or (b) that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to be material to Parent.

  



  

Section 5.10 _Business Activities_. Since their respective dates of
formation, none of Parent, First Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub has
conducted any business activities other than activities: (a) in connection
with its organization; or (b) directed toward the accomplishment of a
business combination. Except as set forth in Parent's Charter Documents,
there is no Contract or Order binding upon Parent, First Merger Sub or Second
Merger Sub or to which any of them is a party which has or could reasonably
be expected to have the effect of prohibiting or materially impairing any
business practice of it, any acquisition of property by it or the conduct of
business by it as currently conducted or as currently contemplated to be
conducted (including, in each case, following the Closing). Parent does not
own or have a right to acquire, directly or indirectly, any interest or
investment (whether equity or debt) in any corporation, partnership, joint
venture, business, trust or other entity. Except for this Agreement and the
Transactions, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
interests, rights, obligations or liabilities with respect to, or is party
to, bound by or has its assets or property subject to, in each case whether
directly or indirectly, any Contract or transaction which is a Business
Combination. Except for this Agreement and the agreements expressly
contemplated hereby, Parent and its Subsidiaries are not, and at no time have
been, party to any Contract with any other Person that would require payments
by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in excess of $10,000 monthly or
$100,000 in the aggregate.

  



  

   

41

 



    



  

Section 5.11 _Parent Material Contracts_. _Schedule 5.11_ of the Parent
Disclosure Letter sets forth a true, correct and complete list of each
"material contract" (as such term is defined in Regulation S-K of the SEC) to
which Parent, First Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub is party, including
Contracts by and among Parent, First Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub, on the
one hand, and any director, officer, stockholder or Affiliate of such Parties
(the " _Parent Material Contracts_ "), other than any such Parent Material
Contract that is listed as an exhibit to Parent's annual report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2019.

  



  

Section 5.12 _Parent Listing_. The issued and outstanding Parent Units
(other than the Private Placement Units) are registered pursuant to Section
12(b) of the Exchange Act and listed for trading on the Nasdaq Stock Markets
(" _Nasdaq_ ") under the symbol "HCCOU". The issued and outstanding shares of
Parent Class A Common Stock (other than those underlying the Private
Placement Units) are registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act
and are listed for trading on Nasdaq under the symbol "HCCO". The issued and
outstanding Parent Warrants (other than those underlying the Private
Placement Units) are registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act
and are listed for trading on Nasdaq under the symbol "HCCOW". Parent has not
been notified by Nasdaq that it does not comply with any Nasdaq listing rule,
which noncompliance is not subject to any compliance extension or ability to
remedy, in each case as permitted by the Nasdaq continued listing rules.
There is no action or proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened in writing against Parent by Nasdaq or the SEC with
respect to any intention by such entity to deregister the Parent Units, the
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock or Parent Warrants or terminate the
listing of Parent on Nasdaq, other than Legal Proceedings where a compliance
extension or ability to remedy is available under applicable Law. None of
Parent or any of its Affiliates has taken any action in an attempt to
intentionally terminate the registration of the Parent Units, the Parent
Class A Common Stock or Parent Warrants under the Exchange Act.

  



  

Section 5.13 _PIPE Investment Amount_. Parent has delivered to the Company
true, accurate and complete copies of each of the subscription agreements
(the " _Subscription Agreements_ ") entered into by Parent with the PIPE
Investors, pursuant to which the PIPE Investors have committed to provide
equity financing to Parent in the aggregate amount of $165,000,000 (the "
_PIPE Investment Amount_ "). The PIPE Investment Amount, together with the
amount in the Trust Account at the Closing, are in the aggregate sufficient to
enable Parent to: (a) pay all cash amounts required to be paid by Parent or
its Subsidiaries under or in connection with this Agreement; and (b) pay any
and all fees and expenses of or payable by Parent with respect to the
Transactions. To Parent's Knowledge, with respect to each PIPE Investor, the
Subscription Agreements are in full force and effect and have not been
withdrawn or terminated, or otherwise amended or modified, in any respect,
and no withdrawal, termination, amendment or modification is contemplated by
Parent. Each Subscription Agreement is a legal, valid and binding obligation
of Parent and, to Parent's Knowledge, each PIPE Investor. Neither the
execution nor delivery by Parent or, to Parent's Knowledge, any other party
thereto nor the performance of Parent's or, to Parent's Knowledge, any other
party's obligations under such Subscription Agreement violates any applicable
Laws. There are no other agreements, side letters, or arrangements between
Parent and any PIPE Investor relating to any Subscription Agreement, that
could affect the obligation of the PIPE Investors to contribute to Parent the
applicable portion of the PIPE Investment Amount set forth in the
Subscription Agreements, and, as of the date hereof, Parent does not know of
any facts or circumstances that may reasonably be expected to result in any
of the conditions set forth in any Subscription Agreement not being satisfied,
or the PIPE Investment Amount not being available to Parent, on the Closing
Date. No event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent under any
material term or condition of any Subscription Agreement and, as of the date
hereof, Parent has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy in
all material respects on a timely basis any term or condition of closing to
be satisfied by it contained in any Subscription Agreement. The Subscription
Agreements contain all of the conditions precedent (other than the conditions
contained in the other Transaction Agreements) to the obligations of the PIPE
Investors to contribute to Parent the applicable portion of the PIPE
Investment Amount set forth in the Subscription Agreements on the terms
therein. No fees, consideration or other discounts are payable or have been
agreed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, from and after the
Closing, the Company (or after the Reorganization, Newco) and its
Subsidiaries) to any PIPE Investor in respect of its PIPE Investment, except
as set forth in the Subscription Agreements.

  



  

   

42

 



    



  

Section 5.14 _Trust Account_.

  



  

(a) As of July 27, 2020, Parent has at least $251,990,000 in a trust account
(the " _Trust Account_ "), maintained and invested pursuant to that certain
Investment Management Trust Agreement (the " _Trust Agreement_ ") effective
as of December 12, 2019, by and between Parent and Continental Stock Transfer
and Trust Company, a New York corporation (the " _Trustee_ ") for the benefit
of its public stockholders, with such funds invested in United States
Government securities or money market funds meeting certain conditions under
Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act.

  



  

(b) The Trust Agreement has not been amended or modified and, to the
Knowledge of Parent with respect to the Trustee, is valid and in full force
and effect and is enforceable in accordance with its terms, except insofar as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights
generally or by principles governing the availability of equitable remedies.
Parent has performed all material obligations required to be performed by
it as of the date hereof under, and complied in all material respects with
the terms of the Trust Agreement and is not in breach thereof or default
thereunder and there does not exist under the Trust Agreement any event which,
with the giving of notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such a
breach or default by Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, the Trustee. There
are no separate Contracts, side letters or other understandings (whether
written or unwritten, express or implied) that would cause the description of
the Trust Agreement in the Parent SEC Reports to be inaccurate in any material
respect or that would entitle any Person (other than stockholders of Parent
holding Parent Class A Common Stock sold in Parent's initial public
offering who shall have elected to redeem their shares of Parent Class A
Common Stock pursuant to Parent's Charter Documents) to any portion of the
proceeds in the Trust Account. Prior to the Closing, none of the funds held in
the Trust Account may be released except: (i) to pay income and franchise
taxes from any interest income earned in the Trust Account; and (ii) to redeem
Parent Class A Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of Parent's
Charter Documents. There are no Legal Proceedings pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing with respect to the Trust Account.
As of the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Company (and after the Reorganization, Newco) contained
herein and the compliance by the Company (and after the Reorganization,
Newco) with its obligations hereunder, Parent does not have any reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the use of funds in the Trust Account
will not be satisfied or funds available in the Trust Account will not be
available to Parent on the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, funds
pursuant to the foregoing will be deemed to be available hereunder
notwithstanding any obligation to make payments in connection with (A) the
Parent Stockholder Redemptions, (B) the remittance to any Governmental
Authority of income Tax or other Tax obligations of Parent prior to the
Closing that are accrued and unpaid and (C) any deferred underwriting
discount payable from the Trust Account.

  



  

   

43

 



    



  

Section 5.15 _Taxes_.

Subsidiaries have been filed, and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and
complete in all material respects.

  



  

(b) Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has paid all material Taxes which are
due and payable by it.

  



  

(c) No deficiency for Taxes has been asserted or assessed (or threatened in
writing) by any Governmental Entity against Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, which deficiency has not been paid in full or finally resolved
with no payment due. No audit or other proceeding by any Governmental Entity
is currently pending or threatened in writing against Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to Taxes.

  



  

(d) There are no liens for material amounts of Taxes (other than Permitted
Liens) upon any of the assets of Parent or its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(e) None of Parent and its Subsidiaries has any reason to believe that any
conditions or facts exist that would reasonably be expected to prevent or
impede the Mergers, taken together, from qualifying as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  



  

Section 5.16 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Merger Materials will, at the date mailed to stockholders of Parent or at the
time of the Parent Special Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent makes no representation, warranty or covenant with respect
to: (a) statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by any Group Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Merger Materials; or (b) any projections or forecasts
included in the Merger Materials.

  



  

Section 5.17 _Board Approval; Stockholder Vote_. The board of directors of
Parent and First Merger Sub (including any required committee or subgroup of
the board of directors of Parent or First Merger Sub, as applicable) and the
sole member of Second Merger Sub have, as of the date of this Agreement,
unanimously: (a) approved and declared the advisability of this Agreement, the
other Transaction Agreements and the consummation of the Transactions; and
(b) determined that the consummation of the Transactions is in the best
interest of, as applicable, the stockholders of Parent or First Merger Sub (as
applicable) and the sole member of Second Merger Sub. Other than obtaining
the Requisite Parent Stockholder Approval, no other corporate proceedings on
the part of Parent are necessary to approve the consummation of the
Transactions.

  



  

Section 5.18 _Brokers_. Other than fees or commissions for which Parent will
be solely responsible, none of Parent, First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub,
nor any of their respective Affiliates, including Sponsor, has any liability
or obligation to pay, or is entitled to receive, any fees or commissions to
any broker, finder or agent with respect to the Transactions.

  



  

   

44

 



    



  

Section 5.19 _Indebtedness_. _Schedule 5.19_ of the Parent Disclosure
Letter sets forth the principal amount of all of the outstanding
Indebtedness, as of the date hereof, of Parent and its Subsidiaries.

  



  

Section 5.20 _Sponsor Agreement_. Parent has delivered to the Company a
true, correct and complete copy of the Sponsor Agreement. To the Knowledge of
Parent, the Sponsor Agreement is in full force and effect and has not been
withdrawn or terminated, or otherwise amended or modified, in any respect and
no withdrawal, termination, amendment or modification is contemplated by
Parent. The Sponsor Agreement is a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, Sponsor, and, to the Knowledge
of Parent, neither the execution nor delivery by Sponsor, nor the performance
of any Sponsor's obligations under, the Sponsor Agreement violates any
provision of, or results in the breach of or default under, or require any
filing, registration or qualification under, any applicable Law (other than
as required under applicable securities Laws and as otherwise
contemplated herein or in the Transaction Agreements). No event has occurred
that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default or breach on the part of Parent under any material term or condition
of the Sponsor Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.21 _Investment Company Act; JOBS Act_. Parent is not an
"investment company" or a Person directly or indirectly "controlled" by or
acting on behalf of an "investment company", in each case within the meaning
of the Investment Company Act. Parent constitutes an "emerging growth
company" within the meaning of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of
2012.

  



  

Section 5.22 _Disclaimer of Other Warranties_. PARENT, FIRST MERGER SUB AND
SECOND MERGER SUB HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN

OTHERWISE, INCLUDING ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY: (A) NONE OF THE COMPANY (AND AFTER
THE REORGANIZATION, NEWCO), ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR ANY OF
THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES OR REPRESENTATIVES SHALL BE DEEMED TO MAKE TO
PARENT, FIRST MERGER SUB, SECOND MERGER SUB, OR THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES
OR REPRESENTATIVES ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY MADE
BY THE COMPANY (OR AFTER THE REORGANIZATION, NEWCO) TO PARENT, FIRST MERGER

officers, should be discovered by the Company (or after the Reorganization,

supplement to the Merger Materials so that such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party and an

execute and deliver a stockholder written consent in substantially the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ (the " _Stockholder Written Consent_ ") in
respect of the Company Stock beneficially owned by the Written Consent Party
(which represent (i) at least a majority of the outstanding voting power of
the Company Stock issued and outstanding (voting as a single class and on an
as-converted basis and excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, shares of
Company Series I Preferred Stock and Company Series J Preferred Stock) and
(ii) at least a majority of the shares of the Company Series H Preferred
Stock issued and outstanding) in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL
within three (3) Business Days of the Registration Statement becoming
effective. As promptly as practicable following the execution and delivery of
the Stockholder Written Consent by the Written Consent Party to the Company
(or after the Reorganization, Newco), the Company (or after the
Reorganization, Newco) shall deliver to Parent a copy of such Stockholder
Written Consent in accordance with _Section 11.1_. Promptly following the

Written Consent the notice required by Section 228(e) of the DGCL and include
a description of the appraisal rights of the Company Stockholders available

have been commenced by any third party other than Parent and its Affiliates,
a statement disclosing that the board of directors of the Company (or after
the Reorganization, Newco) recommends rejection of such tender or exchange
offer (for the avoidance of doubt, the taking of no position or a
neutral position by the board of directors of the Company (or after the
Reorganization, Newco) in respect of the acceptance of any such tender offer
or exchange offer as of the end of such period shall constitute a failure to
publicly announce that the board of directors of the Company (or after the
Reorganization, Newco) recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer);
or (iv) if requested by Parent, fail to issue, within ten (10) Business Days
after a Company Acquisition Proposal (other than any tender offer or exchange

recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer (for the avoidance of
doubt, the taking of no position or a neutral position by the board of
directors of Parent in respect of the acceptance of any such tender offer or
exchange offer as of the end of such period shall constitute a failure to
publicly announce that the board of directors of Parent recommends

anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any right, title, interest or
claim of any kind it has or may have in the future in or to any monies in the
Trust Account or permitted distributions therefrom in accordance with the
Trust Agreement, regardless of whether such claim arises as a result of, in
connection with or relating in any way to, this Agreement or any proposed or
actual business relationship between Parent or its Representatives, on the
one hand, and the Company (and after the Reorganization, Newco) or its
Representatives, on the other hand, or any other matter, and regardless of

to pursue a claim against Parent for (i) legal relief against monies or other
assets held by Parent outside the Trust Account or (ii) specific performance
or other equitable relief in connection with the consummation of the

the foregoing proviso, the " _Released Claims_ "). The Company (and after the
Reorganization, Newco), on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby

event, development or condition of which they have Knowledge that: (a) is
reasonably likely to cause any of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_
not to be satisfied; or (b) would require any amendment or supplement to the
Merger Materials; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification or the
failure to provide such notification shall, in and of itself, affect any of
the representations, warranties, covenants, rights or remedies, or the
conditions to the obligations of, the Parties or result, in and of itself, in
the failure of a condition set forth in _Article VIII_.

Agreement, at the Closing, Parent: (i) shall cause the documents, opinions
and notices required to be delivered to the Trustee pursuant to the Trust

and hold harmless each current or former director or officer, as the case may
be, of the Company (and after the Reorganization, Newco) and the Company
Subsidiaries (each, together with such person's heirs, executors or
administrators, a " _D andO Indemnified Party_") (in each case, solely to the
extent acting in their capacity as such and to the extent such activities are
related to the business of the Group Companies being acquired under this
Agreement) against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that
the Company (and after the Reorganization, Newco), Parent or their respective
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, would have been permitted under applicable
Law and its respective Charter Documents in effect on the date of this
Agreement to indemnify such DandO Indemnified Parties (including the
advancing of expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law). Without limiting the foregoing, Parent agrees that all
rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses now
existing in favor of each DandO Indemnified Party, as provided in their
respective Charter Documents or in any indemnification agreement with the
Company (or after the Reorganization, Newco) or any of the Company
Subsidiaries set forth on _Schedule 7.15(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
shall survive the Closing and shall continue in full force and effect. For a
period of six (6) years from the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Company
(and after the Reorganization, Newco) and the Company Subsidiaries to maintain
in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses
provisions of their respective Charter Documents as in effect immediately
prior to the Closing Date or in any of their respective indemnification
agreements with any DandO Indemnified Party as in effect immediately prior
to the Closing Date, and Parent shall not, and shall cause the Company (and
after the Reorganization, Newco) and the Company Subsidiaries not to, amend,
repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any DandO Indemnified Party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification or advancement of
expenses in respect of any Legal Proceedings pending or asserted or any claim
made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Legal
Proceeding or resolution of such claim.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company (or after the Reorganization, Newco)
shall purchase a "tail" or "runoff" directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy (the " _D andO Tail_") in respect of acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such Person that is a
director or officer of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries currently
covered by a directors' and officers' liability insurance policy of Company or
the Company Subsidiaries on terms with respect to coverage, deductibles and
amounts no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date
of this Agreement for the six-year period following the Closing at a price
not to exceed three-hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid by
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for such purpose. Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Entity to, maintain the DandO Tail in full force and
effect for its full term and cause all obligations thereunder to be
honored by the Company (or after the Reorganization, Newco) or the Company
Subsidiaries, as applicable, and no other party shall have any further
obligation to purchase or pay for such insurance pursuant to this _Section
7.15(b)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the premium of the
DandO Tail exceed three-hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid
by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for such purpose; and _provided_
, _further_ , that if the cost of such insurance coverage exceeds such
amount, the Surviving Entity shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(c) The rights of each DandO Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition
to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such person may have under the
Charter Documents of the Company (or after the Reorganization, Newco) of the
Company Subsidiaries, any other indemnification arrangement, any Law or
otherwise. The obligations of Parent, the Company (and after the
Reorganization, Newco) or the Company Subsidiaries under this _Section 7.15_
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
any DandO Indemnified Party without the consent of such DandO Indemnified Party.
The provisions of this _Section 7.15 _shall survive the Closing and
expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the DandO
Indemnified Parties, each of whom is an intended third-party beneficiary of
this _Section 7.15_.

  



  

(d) If Parent or, after the Closing, the Company (or after the
Reorganization, Newco) or the Company Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective successors or assigns: (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the
Company (or after the Reorganization, Newco) or the Company Subsidiaries, as
applicable, assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.15_.

  



  

Section 7.16 _280G Approval_. To the extent that any "disqualified
individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code and the
regulations thereunder) has the right to receive any payments or benefits that
could be deemed to constitute "parachute payments" (within the meaning of
Section 280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code and the regulations thereunder), then, the
Company (and after the Reorganization, Newco) will: (a) no later than three
(3) days prior to the Closing Date, solicit and use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain from each such "disqualified individual" a waiver of such
disqualified individual's rights to some or all of such payments or benefits
(the " _Waived 280G Benefits_ ") so that any remaining payments and/or
benefits shall not be deemed to be "excess parachute payments" (within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder); and (b)
no later than two (2) days prior to the Closing Date, with respect to each
individual who agrees to the waiver described in clause (a), submit to a vote
of holders of the equity interests of the Company (or after the
Reorganization, Newco) entitled to vote on such matters, in the manner
required under Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, along with adequate disclosure intended to satisfy such
requirements (including QandA 7 of Section 1.280G-1 of such regulations), the
right of any such "disqualified individual" to receive the Waived 280G
Benefits. Prior to, and in no event later than four days prior to soliciting
such waivers and approval, the Company (or after the Reorganization, Newco)
shall provide drafts of such waivers and approval materials to Parent for its
reasonable review and comment, and the Company (or after the Reorganization,
Newco) shall consider in good faith any changes reasonably requested by
Parent. No later than seven days prior to soliciting the waivers, the Company
shall provide Parent with the calculations and related documentation to
determine whether and to what extent the vote described in this _Section 7.16_
is necessary in order to avoid the imposition of Taxes under Section 4999 of
the Code. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company (or after the
Reorganization, Newco) shall deliver to Parent evidence that a vote of the
Company Stockholders was solicited in accordance with the foregoing and
whether the requisite number of votes of the Company Stockholders was obtained
with respect to the Waived 280G Benefits or that the vote did not pass and
the Waived 280G Benefits will not be paid or retained.

shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each

Party shall be deemed to meet the requirements of the previous sentence.

agreements among the Parties as contemplated by or referred to herein,

Section 11.6 _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise
provided herein, prior to the Closing, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any
other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and the
exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that each Party shall be entitled to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the United States
or any state having jurisdiction and immediate injunctive relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy
of money damages as a remedy and without bond or other security being
required, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties hereby acknowledges and
agrees that it may be difficult to prove damages with reasonable certainty,
that it may be difficult to procure suitable substitute performance, and that
injunctive relief and/or specific performance will not cause an undue
hardship to the Parties. Each of the Parties hereby further acknowledges that
the existence of any other remedy contemplated by this Agreement does not
diminish the availability of specific performance of the obligations
hereunder or any other injunctive relief. Each Party hereby further agrees
that in the event of any action by any other party for specific performance
or injunctive relief, it will not assert that a remedy at law or other remedy
would be adequate or that specific performance or injunctive relief in
respect of such breach or violation should not be available on the grounds
that money damages are adequate or any other grounds. Parent acknowledges and
agrees that the Company (and after the Reorganization, Newco) shall be
entitled to bring an action for specific enforcement to cause Parent to seek
enforcement of the provisions of the Subscription Agreements to the fullest
extent permissible pursuant to such Subscription Agreements as if it were a
party thereto.

internal law of the State of Delaware regardless of the law that might
otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof.

and venue of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware;  _provided_ ,

Proceeding is vested exclusively in the U.S. federal courts, such Legal
Proceeding shall be heard in, and each of the Parties irrevocably consents to
the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of, the U.S. District Court for the
District of Delaware; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the U.S. District

be heard in, and each of the Parties irrevocably consents to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of, the Delaware state courts located in Wilmington,
Delaware (together with the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware
and the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, the " _Chosen Courts_ ")
in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement,
the other Transaction Agreements and the consummation of the
Transactions. Each Party and any Person asserting rights as a third-party

assert as a defense in any legal dispute, that: (i) such Person is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts for any reason;
(ii) such Legal Proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in the
Chosen Courts; (iii) such Person's property is exempt or immune from

asserting rights as a third-party beneficiary hereby agrees not to commence
or prosecute any such action, claim, cause of action or suit other than before
the Chosen Courts, nor to make any motion or take any other action seeking or
intending to cause the transfer or removal of any such action, claim, cause of
action or suit to any court other than the Chosen Courts, whether on the
grounds of inconvenient forum or otherwise. Each Party hereby consents to
service of process in any such proceeding in any manner permitted by laws of
the State of Delaware, and further consents to service of process by
nationally recognized overnight courier service guaranteeing overnight
delivery, or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at
its address specified pursuant to _Section 11.1_, and waives and
covenants not to assert or plead any objection which they might otherwise
have to such manner of service of process. Notwithstanding the foregoing in
this _Section 11.8_, any Party may commence any action, claim, cause of
action or suit in a court other than the Chosen Courts solely for the purpose
of enforcing an order or judgment issued by the Chosen Courts.

  



  

(b) TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW WHICH CANNOT BE WAIVED,
EACH OF THE PARTIES AND ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD-
PARTY BENEFICIARY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY ON ANY CLAIMS OR
COUNTERCLAIMS ASSERTED IN ANY LEGAL DISPUTE RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, EACH
OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS AND THE CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSACTIONS, IN EACH
CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING. IF THE SUBJECT MATTER OF ANY
SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE IS ONE IN WHICH THE WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL IS PROHIBITED, NO
PARTY NOR ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY SHALL
ASSERT IN SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE A NONCOMPULSORY COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS AND THE
CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSACTIONS. FURTHERMORE, NO PARTY NOR ANY PERSON
ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY SHALL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY
SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE WITH A SEPARATE ACTION OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDING IN WHICH
A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE WAIVED.

  



  

Section 11.9 _Rules of Construction_. Each of the Parties agrees that it has
been represented by independent counsel of its choice during the negotiation
and execution of this Agreement and each Party hereto and its counsel
cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement and the
documents referred to herein and, therefore, waive the application of any law,
regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document will be construed against the Party drafting such
agreement or document.

  



  

   

74

 



    



  

Section 11.10 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the Transactions are consummated, each Party will
pay its own costs and expenses incurred in anticipation of, relating to and in
connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the
Transaction Agreements and the consummation of the Transactions.

  



  

Section 11.11 _Assignment_. No Party may assign, directly or indirectly,
including by operation of law, either this Agreement or any of its rights,
interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the
other Parties. Subject to the first sentence of this _Section 11.11_, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties
and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

  



  

Section 11.12 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at
any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
the Parties.

inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to the other Party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) waive

Party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such Party. Delay in exercising any right under
this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right. In the event any
provision of any of the other Transaction Agreement in any way conflicts with
the provisions of this Agreement (except where a provision therein expressly
provides that it is intended to take precedence over this Agreement), this
Agreement shall control.

  



  

Section 11.14 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed
or implied in this Agreement, this Agreement may only be enforced against,
and any Legal Proceeding for breach of this Agreement may only be made
against, the entities that are expressly identified herein as Parties to this
Agreement, and no Released Related Party of a Party shall have any liability
for any liabilities or obligations of the Parties for any Legal Proceeding
(whether in tort, contract or otherwise) for breach of this Agreement or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith. No Party shall have any right of recovery in respect hereof against
any Released Related Party of a Party and no personal liability shall attach
to any Released Related Party of a Party through such Party, whether by or
through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by the enforcement of any
judgment, fine or penalty or by virtue of any Law or otherwise. The provisions
of this _Section 11.14 _are intended to be for the benefit of, and
enforceable by the Released Related Parties of the Parties and each such
Person shall be a third-party beneficiary of this _Section 11.14_. This
_Section 11.14_ shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parties.

  



  

   

75

 



    



  

Section 11.15 _Legal Representation_. Parent hereby agrees on behalf of its
directors, members, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates (including
after the Closing, the Company and after the Reorganization, Newco), and each
of their respective successors and assigns (all such parties, the " _Waiving
Parties_ "), that Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe LLP (or any successor) may
represent the holders of Company Interests or any of their respective
directors, members, partners, officers, employees or Affiliates (other than
the Company or after the Reorganization, Newco) (collectively, the " _Waiving
Party Group_ "), in each case, in connection with any Legal Proceeding or
obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any
Transaction Agreement or the Transactions, notwithstanding its representation
(or any continued representation) of the Group Companies or other Waiving
Parties, and each of Parent and the Company (and after the Reorganization,
Newco) on behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties hereby consents thereto
and irrevocably waives (and will not assert) any conflict of interest, breach
of duty or any other objection arising therefrom or relating thereto. Parent
and the Company (and after the Reorganization, Newco) acknowledge that the
foregoing provision applies whether or not Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe LLP
provides legal services to any Group Companies after the Closing Date. Each
of Parent and the Company (and after the Reorganization, Newco), for itself
and the Waiving Parties, hereby further irrevocably acknowledges and agrees
that all communications, written or oral, between any Group Company or
any member of the Waiving Party Group and its counsel, including Orrick,
Herrington and Sutcliffe LLP, made in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery and performance under, or any dispute or
Legal Proceeding arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, any
Transaction Agreements or the Transactions, or any matter relating to any of
the foregoing, are privileged communications that do not pass to the Company
(or after the Reorganization, Newco) notwithstanding the Mergers, and instead
survive, remain with and are controlled by the Waiving Party Group (the "
_Privileged Communications_ "), without any waiver thereof. Parent and the
Company (or after the Reorganization, Newco), together with any of their
respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries, successors or assigns, agree that no
Person may use or rely on any of the Privileged Communications, whether
located in the records or email server of the Company (or after the
Reorganization, Newco) or otherwise (including in the knowledge of the
officers and employees of the Company (or after the Reorganization, Newco)),
in any Legal Proceeding against or involving any of the Parties after the
Closing or in any way adverse to the Company (or after the Reorganization,
Newco), and Parent and the Company (and after the Reorganization, Newco)
agree not to assert that any privilege has been waived as to the Privileged
Communications, whether located in the records or email server of the Company
(or after the Reorganization, Newco) or otherwise (including in the
knowledge of the officers and employees of the Company (or after the
Reorganization, Newco)).

  



  

Section 11.16 _Disclosure Letters and Exhibits_. The Company Disclosure
Letter and Parent Disclosure Letter shall each be arranged in separate parts
corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and subsections in this
Agreement, and the information disclosed in any numbered or lettered part
shall be deemed to relate to and to qualify only the particular provision set
forth in the corresponding numbered or lettered Section or subsection of this
Agreement, except to the extent that: (a) such information is cross-
referenced in another part of the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent
Disclosure Letter, as applicable; or (b) it is reasonably apparent on the
face of the disclosure (without any independent knowledge on the part of the
reader regarding the matter disclosed) that such information qualifies
another provision in this Agreement. The specification of any dollar amount in
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the
inclusion of any specific item in the Company Disclosure Letter and Parent
Disclosure Letter is not intended to imply that such amounts (or higher or
lower amounts) are or are not material, and no Party shall use the fact of
the setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in
the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter in any dispute or
controversy between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item, or matter
not described herein or included in Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent
Disclosure Letter is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. The
inclusion of any item in the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure
Letter shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment by the Company (or
after the Reorganization, Newco) or Parent, as applicable, that the matter is
required to be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement, nor shall such
disclosure in and of itself be deemed (a) an admission of any breach or
violation of any Contract or Law, (b) an admission of any liability or
obligation to any third party, or (c) to establish a standard of
materiality. The disclosure of any items or information that is not required
by this Agreement to be so included is solely for informational purposes and
the convenience of Parent, First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub or the
Company (or after the Reorganization, Newco), as applicable. In addition,
under no circumstances shall the disclosure of any matter in this Company
Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, where a representation or
warranty of the Company (or after the Reorganization, Newco) or Parent, as
applicable, is limited or qualified by the materiality of the matters to
which the representation or warranty is given or by Company Material Adverse
Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, imply that any other undisclosed
matter having a greater value or other significance is material or would have
a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as
applicable.

 BOARD OF DIRECTORS

  



  

Section 5.1 _Board Powers_. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall
be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the
powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this
Second Amended and Restated Certificate, as it may be further amended from
time to time, or the Amended and Restated By-Laws of the Corporation, as they
may be further amended from time to time (" _By-Laws_ "), the Board is hereby
empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may
be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the
provisions of the DGCL and this Second Amended and Restated Certificate.

  



  

Section 5.2 _Number, Election and Term_.

  



  

(a) The total number of directors of the Corporation, other than those who
may be elected by the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock
voting separately by class or series, shall be fixed from time to time by
resolution adopted by at least a majority of the Whole Board. For purposes of
this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the term "Whole Board" shall
mean the total number of directors then in office, whether or not there exist
any vacancies in previously authorized directorships.

  



  

(b) The Board shall be divided, with respect to the time for which its
members severally hold office, into three classes, as nearly equal in number
as possible and designated as Class I, Class II and Class III. The Board is
authorized to assign members of the Board already in office to Class I, Class
II or Class III at the time the classification becomes effective. The term of
the initial Class I Directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of the
stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second

shall expire at the second annual meeting of the stockholders of the
Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate and the term of the initial Class III Directors shall expire at

succeeding annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, beginning

the successors elected to replace the class of directors whose term expires
at that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term or until the
election and qualification of their respective successors in office, subject
to their earlier death, resignation or removal. If the number of directors
that constitute the Board is changed, any increase or decrease shall be
apportioned by the Board among the classes so as to maintain the number of
directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case shall a
decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board shorten the term
of any incumbent director. Subject to the rights of the holders of one or more
series of Preferred Stock, voting separately by class or series, to elect
directors pursuant to the terms of one or more series of Preferred Stock, the
election of directors shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by
the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and
entitled to vote thereon. The Board is hereby expressly authorized, by
resolution or resolutions thereof, to assign members of the Board already in
office to the aforesaid classes at the time this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate (and therefore such classification) becomes effective in
accordance with the DGCL.

(c) A director shall hold office until the annual meeting for the year in
which his or her term expires and until his or her successor has been elected
and qualified, subject, however, to such director's earlier death,
resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal.

election of directors need not be by written ballot. The holders of shares of
Common Stock shall not have cumulative voting rights with regard to election
of directors.

  



  

Section 5.3 _Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies_. Subject to the
rights, if any, of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding,
newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of
directors and any vacancies occurring on the Board for any reason shall,
unless (a) the Board determines by resolution that any such vacancies or newly
created directorships shall be filled by the stockholders or (b) as otherwise
provided by law, be filled solely by the affirmative vote of a majority vote
of the remaining directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a
sole remaining director (and not by stockholders), and any director so chosen
shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors
to which the new directorship was added or in which the vacancy occurred and
until his or her successor has been elected and qualified, subject, however,
to such director's earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification
or removal.

  



  

Section 5.4 _Removal_. Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of
shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding, any or all of the directors of
the Corporation may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause so
long as the Board is classified and only by the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding capital stock of the Corporation then
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, considered for
purposes of this Article V as one class. For purposes of this Article V,
"cause" shall mean, with respect to any director, (x) the willful failure by
such director to perform, or the gross negligence of such director in
performing, the duties of a director, (y) the engaging by such director in
willful or serious misconduct that is injurious to the Corporation or (z) the

The affirmative vote of a majority of the Whole Board shall be required to
adopt, amend, alter or repeal the By-Laws. The By-Laws also may be adopted,
amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; _provided_ , _however_
, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or any
provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser or no vote, but in
addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock
of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the affirmative vote
of the holders of at least a two-thirds (2/3) of the voting power of all then-
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class,
shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the
By-Laws; _provided_ , _further_ , however, that if two-thirds (2/3) of the
Whole Board has approved such adoption, amendment or repeal of any provisions
of the By-Laws, then only the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a
majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the
capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the
stockholders to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of the By-Laws; and
provided further, however, that no By-Laws hereafter adopted by the
stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been
valid if such By-Laws had not been adopted.

Section 8.2 _Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_.

  



  

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by the applicable laws of the State of
Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, the Corporation
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is or was made a
party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit, investigation, arbitration or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
including an action by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a
judgment in its favor (each, a " _proceeding_ ") by reason of the fact that he
or she is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries or, while a director or officer of the Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or nonprofit entity,
including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (an " _indemnitee_
"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official
capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or in any other capacity
while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, against all liability
and loss suffered and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys'
fees and disbursements, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes, damages,
claims and penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred by
such indemnitee in connection with such proceeding. The Corporation shall to
the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law pay as incurred the
expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by an indemnitee in defending
or otherwise participating in any proceeding in advance of its final
disposition (including by making payment directly to applicable third parties
if requested by the indemnitee); _provided_ , _however_ , that, to the
extent required by applicable law, such payment of expenses in advance of the
final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an
undertaking, by or on behalf of the indemnitee, to repay all amounts so
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that the indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified under this _Section 8.2_ or otherwise. The rights
to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred by this _Section
8.2_ shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an
indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and
shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 8.2(a)_ , except for
proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses,
the Corporation shall indemnify and advance expenses to an indemnitee in
connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee
only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board.

  



  

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on
any indemnitee by this _Section 8.2_ shall not be exclusive of any other
rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this
Second Amended and Restated Certificate as it may be further amended from
time to time, the By-Laws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors, or otherwise.

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this _Section 8.2_ by the stockholders of the
Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of
this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this _Section
8.2_ , shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except
to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation
to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than
permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely
affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or
amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any
proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced
or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring
prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

  



  

(d) This _Section 8.2_ shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the
extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law, to indemnify and to
advance expenses to persons other than indemnitees.

  



  

(e) To the extent an indemnitee has rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and/or insurance provided by persons or entities other than the
Corporation (collectively, the " _Other Indemnitors_ "), (i) the Corporation
shall be the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., that its obligations to an
indemnitee are primary and any obligation of the Other Indemnitors to advance
expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities
incurred by an indemnitee are secondary), (ii) the Corporation shall be
required to advance the full amount of expenses incurred by an indemnitee and
shall be liable for the full amount of all claims, liabilities, damages,
losses, costs and expenses (including amounts paid in satisfaction of
judgments, in compromises and settlements, as fines and penalties and legal
or other costs and reasonable expenses of investigating or defending against
any claim or alleged claim) to the extent legally permitted and as required by
the terms of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the By-Laws and
the agreements to which the Corporation is a party, without regard to any
rights an indemnitee may have against the Other Indemnitors, and (iii) the
Corporation irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases the Other
Indemnitors from any and all claims against them for contribution,
subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect thereof. No
advancement or payment by the Other Indemnitors on behalf of an indemnitee
with respect to any claim for which an indemnitee has sought
indemnification from the Corporation shall affect the foregoing, and the
Other Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution and be subrogated to the
extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of an
indemnitee against the Corporation.

Amended and Restated Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended

ARTICLE XI 
 EXCLUSIVE FORUM FOR CERTAIN LAWSUITS

  



  

Section 11.1 _Forum_. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the
selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and
exclusive forum for any (a) derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf
of the Corporation, (b) action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty
owed by or other wrongdoing by any current or former director, officer,
employee, agent or stockholder of the Corporation to the Corporation or the
Corporation's stockholders, (c) action asserting a claim arising under any
provision of the DGCL or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation or the By-Laws, or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (d) action asserting a
claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to each
of (a) through (d) above, any action as to which the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware determines that there is an indispensable party not subject
to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
(and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware within ten (10) days
following such determination), in which case the United States District Court
for the District of Delaware or other state courts of the State of Delaware,
as applicable, shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and
exclusive forum for any such claims. This Article XI shall not apply to suits
brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any
other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive or concurrent
jurisdiction. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of
an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the federal
district courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and
exclusive forum for the resolution of any action asserting a claim arising
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. If any provision or provisions of this
Article XI shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied
to any person or entity or circumstance for any reason whatsoever, then, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, the validity, legality and
enforceability of such provisions in any other circumstance and of the
remaining provisions of this Article XI (including, without limitation, each
portion of any sentence of this Article XI containing any such provision held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable) and the application of such provision to
other persons or entities and circumstances shall not in any way be affected
or impaired thereby. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring
or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be
deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article XI.
Failure to enforce the foregoing provisions would cause the Corporation
irreparable harm and the Corporation shall be entitled to equitable relief,
including injunction and specific performance, to enforce the foregoing
provisions.

Section 11.2 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. If any action the subject matter of
which is within the scope of _Section 11.1_ immediately above is filed in a
court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (a " _Foreign
Action_ ") in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed
to have consented to (a) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal
courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any action
brought in any such court to enforce _Section 11.1_ immediately above (an "
_FSC Enforcement Action_ ") and (b) having service of process made upon such
stockholder in any such FSC Enforcement Action by service upon such
stockholder's counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such stockholder.

competitive advantage in which the Corporation or any of its
controlled Affiliates, directly or indirectly, could have an interest or
expectancy (a " _Competitive Opportunity_ ") or may otherwise compete with

have any duty to refrain from directly or indirectly (a) engaging in any
Competitive Opportunity or (b) otherwise competing with the Corporation or

duty solely by reason of the fact that such Identified Person engages in any
such activities. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the
Corporation hereby renounces any interest or expectancy in, or right to be
offered an opportunity to participate in, any Competitive Opportunity or
other corporate or business opportunity that may be a Competitive Opportunity

her or his Affiliates, and for the Corporation or any of its controlled
Affiliates, such Identified Person shall, to the fullest extent permitted by

Corporation or any of its controlled Affiliates and, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, shall not be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders
or to any controlled Affiliate of the Corporation for breach of any fiduciary
duty as a stockholder, director or officer of the Corporation solely by
reason of the fact that such Identified Person pursues or acquires such
Competitive Opportunity for itself, herself or himself, or offers or directs
such Competitive Opportunity to another Person.

  



  

Section 12.3 _Allocation of Corporate Opportunities_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in _Section 12.2_ , the Corporation does not
renounce its interest in any Competitive Opportunity offered to any director
of the Corporation if such opportunity is expressly offered to such person
solely in his or her capacity as a director of the Corporation, and the
provisions of _Section 12.2_ of this Article XII shall not apply to any such
Competitive Opportunity.

  



  

Section 12.4 _Certain Matters Deemed Not Corporate Opportunities_. In
addition to and notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article XII,
a business or other opportunity shall not be deemed to be a potential
Competitive Opportunity for the Corporation if it is an opportunity that (a)
the Corporation (together with its controlled Affiliates) is neither
financially or legally able, nor contractually permitted to undertake, (b)
from its nature, is not in the line of the Corporation's business or is of no
practical advantage to the Corporation or (c) is one in which the Corporation
has no interest or reasonable expectancy.

Article II 
  
 REGISTRATIONS

  



  

2.1  _Shelf Registration_.

  



  

2.1.1  _Initial Registration_. The Company shall, as soon as practicable, but
in any event within thirty (30) days after the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, file a Registration
Statement under the Securities Act to permit the public resale of all the
Registrable Securities held by the Holders from time to time as permitted by
Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or any successor or similar provision
adopted by the Commission then in effect) (" _Rule 415_ ") on the terms and
conditions specified in this _subsection 2.1.1_ and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to be declared effective as
soon as practicable after the filing thereof, but in no event later than the
earlier of (i) sixty (60) days following the filing deadline (or ninety (90)
days after the filing deadline if the Registration Statement is reviewed by,
and receives comments from, the Commission) and (ii) ten (10) business days
after the date the Company is notified (orally or in writing, whichever is
earlier) by the Commission that the Registration Statement will not be
"reviewed" or will not be subject to further review (such earlier date, the "
_Effectiveness Deadline_ "). The Registration Statement filed with the
Commission pursuant to this _subsection 2.1.1_ shall be a shelf registration
statement on Form S-3 (a " _Form S-3 Shelf_ ") or, if Form S-3 is not then
available to the Company, on Form S-1 (a " _Form S-1 Shelf_ ") or such other
form of registration statement as is then available to effect a registration
for resale of such Registrable Securities, covering such Registrable
Securities, and shall contain a Prospectus in such form as to permit any
Holder to sell such Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 415 at any time
beginning on the effective date for such Registration Statement. A
Registration Statement filed pursuant to this _subsection 2.1.1_ shall provide
for the resale pursuant to any method or combination of methods legally
available to, and requested by, the Holders. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause a Registration Statement filed pursuant to
this _subsection 2.1.1_ to remain effective, and to be supplemented and
amended to the extent necessary to ensure that such Registration Statement is
available or, if not available, that another Registration Statement is
available, for the resale of all the Registrable Securities held by the
Holders until all such Registrable Securities have ceased to be Registrable
Securities. As soon as practicable following the effective date of a
Registration Statement filed pursuant to this _subsection 2.1.1_ , but in any
event within five (5) business days of such date, the Company shall notify
the Holders of the effectiveness of such Registration Statement. When
effective, a Registration Statement filed pursuant to this _subsection 2.1.1_
(including the documents incorporated therein by reference) will comply as to
form in all material respects with all applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading (in the case of any Prospectus
contained in such Registration Statement, in the light of the circumstances
under which such statement is made).

  



  

2.1.2  _Form S-3 Shelf_. If the Company files a Form S-1 Shelf and thereafter
the Company becomes eligible to use Form S-3 for secondary sales, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to file a Form S-3 Shelf as promptly as
practicable to replace the shelf registration statement that is a Form S-1
Shelf and have the Form S-3 Shelf declared effective as promptly as
practicable and to cause such Form S-3 Shelf to remain effective, and to be
supplemented and amended to the extent necessary to ensure that
such Registration Statement is available or, if not available, that another
Registration Statement is available, for the resale of all the Registrable
Securities held by the Holders until all such Registrable Securities have
ceased to be Registrable Securities.

2.1.3  _Shelf Takedown_. At any time and from time to time following the
effectiveness of the shelf registration statement required by _subsection
2.1.1_ or _2.1.2_ , any Holder may request to sell all or a portion of their
Registrable Securities in an underwritten offering that is registered
pursuant to such shelf registration statement, including a Block Trade if the
Company files a Form S-3 Shelf and is eligible to use Form S-3 for secondary
sales (a " _Shelf Underwritten Offering_ "), provided, that such Holder(s)
(a) reasonably expect aggregate gross proceeds in excess of $15,000,000 from
such Shelf Underwritten Offering or (b) reasonably expects to sell all of the
Registrable Securities held by such Holder in such Shelf Underwritten
Offering. All requests for a Shelf Underwritten Offering shall be made by
giving written notice to the Company (the " _Shelf Takedown Notice_ "). Each
Shelf Takedown Notice shall specify the approximate number of Registrable
Securities proposed to be sold in the Shelf Underwritten Offering and the
expected price range (net of underwriting discounts and commissions) of
such Shelf Underwritten Offering. Except with respect to a Block Trade
requested pursuant to Section 2.5 or any Registrable Securities distributed
by the Sponsor to its members following the expiration of the Founder Lock-Up
Period or the Private Placement Lock-Up Period, as applicable, within five
(5) business days after receipt of any Shelf Takedown Notice, the Company
shall give written notice of such requested Shelf Underwritten Offering to
all other Holders of Registrable Securities (the " _Company Shelf Takedown
Notice_ ") and, subject to the provisions of _Section 2.2.4_ , shall include
in such Shelf Underwritten Offering all Registrable Securities with respect
to which the Company has received written requests for inclusion therein,
within five (5) days after sending the Company Shelf Takedown Notice. The
Company shall enter into an underwriting agreement in a form as is customary
in Underwritten Offerings of securities by the Company with the managing
Underwriter or Underwriters selected by the Holders after consultation with
the Company and shall take all such other reasonable actions as are requested
by the managing Underwriter or Underwriters in order to expedite or
facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities. In connection
with any Shelf Underwritten Offering contemplated by this _subsection 2.1.3_
, subject to _Section 3.3_ and _Article IV_ , the underwriting agreement into
which each Holder and the Company shall enter shall contain such
representations, covenants, indemnities and other rights and obligations of
the Company and the selling stockholders as are customary in underwritten
offerings of securities by the Company.

  



  

2.1.4  _Holder Information Required for Participation in Shelf Registration_.
At least ten (10) business days prior to the first anticipated filing date of
a Registration Statement pursuant to this _Article II_ , the Company shall use
reasonable efforts to notify each Holder in writing (which may be by email)
of the information reasonably necessary about the Holder to include
such Holder's Registrable Securities in such Registration Statement.
Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, the Company shall not be
obligated to include such Holder's Registrable Securities to the extent the
Company has not received such information, and received any other reasonably
requested agreements or certificates, on or prior to the fifth (5th) business
day prior to the first anticipated filing date of a Registration Statement
pursuant to this _Article II_.

2.2  _Demand Registration_.

  



  

2.2.1  _Request for Registration_. Subject to the provisions of _subsection
2.2.4_ hereof and provided that the Company does not have an effective
Registration Statement pursuant to _subsection 2.1.1_ outstanding covering
Registrable Securities, following the expiration of the applicable Lock-Up
Period, (a) the Existing Holders of at least a majority in interest of
the then-outstanding number of Registrable Securities held by the Existing
Holders or (b) the New Holders of at least a majority-in-interest of the
then-outstanding number of Registrable Securities held by the New Holders (the
" _Demanding Holders_ "), in each case, may make a written demand for
Registration of all or part of their Registrable Securities, which written
demand shall describe the amount and type of securities to be included in
such Registration and the intended method(s) of distribution thereof (such
written demand a " _Demand Registration_ "). The Company shall, within ten
(10) days of the Company's receipt of the Demand Registration, notify, in
writing, all other Holders of Registrable Securities of such demand, and each
Holder of Registrable Securities who thereafter wishes to include all or a
portion of such Holder's Registrable Securities in a Registration pursuant to
a Demand Registration (each such Holder that includes all or a portion of such
Holder's Registrable Securities in such Registration, a " _Requesting Holder_
") shall so notify the Company, in writing, within five (5) days after the
receipt by the Holder of the notice from the Company. Upon receipt by the
Company of any such written notification from a Requesting Holder(s) to the
Company, such Requesting Holder(s) shall be entitled to have
their Registrable Securities included in a Registration pursuant to a Demand
Registration and the Company shall effect, as soon thereafter as practicable,
but not more than sixty (60) days immediately after the Company's receipt of
the Demand Registration, the Registration of all Registrable Securities
requested by the Demanding Holders and Requesting Holders pursuant to such
Demand Registration. Under no circumstances shall the Company be obligated to
effect more than (x) an aggregate of three (3) Registrations pursuant to a
Demand Registration by the Existing Holders under this _subsection 2.2.1_ with
respect to any or all Registrable Securities held by such Existing Holders
and (y) an aggregate of three (3) Registrations pursuant to a Demand
Registration by the New Holders under this _subsection 2.2.1_ with respect to
any or all Registrable Securities held by such New Holders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Company shall not be required to give
effect to a Demand Registration from a Demanding Holder if the Company has
registered Registrable Securities pursuant to a Demand Registration from such
Demanding Holder in the preceding one hundred and eighty (180) days, or (ii)
the Company's obligations with respect to any Demand Registration shall be
deemed satisfied so long as the Registration Statement filed pursuant to
_subsection 2.1.1_ includes all of such Demanding Holder's Registrable
Securities and is effective.

  



  

2.2.2  _Effective Registration_. Notwithstanding the provisions of
_subsection 2.2.1_ above or any other part of this Agreement, a Registration
pursuant to a Demand Registration shall not count as a Registration unless and
until (i) the Registration Statement filed with the Commission with respect
to a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration has been declared
effective by the Commission and (ii) the Company has complied with all of its
obligations under this Agreement with respect thereto; _provided_ , 
_further_ , that if, after such Registration Statement has been declared
effective, an offering of Registrable Securities in a Registration pursuant
to a Demand Registration is subsequently interfered with by any stop order or
injunction of the Commission, federal or state court or any other
governmental agency, the Registration Statement with respect to such
Registration shall be deemed not to have been declared effective, unless and
until, (i) such stop order or injunction is removed, rescinded or
otherwise terminated, and (ii) a majority-in-interest of the Demanding
Holders initiating such Demand Registration thereafter affirmatively elect to
continue with such Registration and accordingly notify the Company in writing,
but in no event later than five (5) days, of such election; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Company shall not be obligated or required to file
another Registration Statement until the Registration Statement that has been
previously filed with respect to a Registration pursuant to a
Demand Registration becomes effective or is subsequently terminated.

2.2.3  _Underwritten Offering_. Subject to the provisions of _subsection
2.2.4_ , if a majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders so advise the
Company as part of their Demand Registration that the offering of the
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Demand Registration shall be in the
form of an Underwritten Offering, then the right of such Demanding Holder or
Requesting Holder (if any) to include its Registrable Securities in such
Registration shall be conditioned upon such Holder's participation in such
Underwritten Offering and the inclusion of such Holder's Registrable
Securities in such Underwritten Offering to the extent provided herein. All
such Holders proposing to distribute their Registrable Securities through an
Underwritten Offering under this _subsection 2.2.3_ shall enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter(s) selected for
such Underwritten Offering by the majority-in-interest of the Demanding
Holders initiating the Demand Registration, which Underwriter(s) shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

  



  

2.2.4  _Reduction of Underwritten Offering_. If the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters in an Underwritten Registration pursuant to a Demand
Registration, in good faith, advises the Company, the Demanding Holders and
the Requesting Holders (if any) in writing that the dollar amount or number
of Registrable Securities that the Demanding Holders and the Requesting
Holders (if any) desire to sell, taken together with all other Class A Common
Stock or other equity securities that the Company desires to sell and
the Class A Common Stock, if any, as to which a Registration has been
requested pursuant to separate written contractual piggy-back registration
rights held by any other stockholders who desire to sell, exceeds the maximum
dollar amount or maximum number of equity securities that can be sold in the
Underwritten Offering without adversely affecting the proposed offering price,
the timing, the distribution method, or the probability of success of such
offering (such maximum dollar amount or maximum number of such securities, as
applicable, the " _Maximum Number of Securities_ "), then the Company shall
include in such Underwritten Offering, as follows: (i) first, the Registrable
Securities of the Demanding Holders and the Requesting Holders (if any) (in
each case pro rata based on the respective number of Registrable Securities
that such Demanding Holder and Requesting Holder (if any) has requested be
included in such Underwritten Registration and the aggregate number of
Registrable Securities that such Demanding Holders and Requesting Holders
have requested be included in such Underwritten Registration (such
proportion is referred to herein as " _Pro Rata_ ")) that can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (ii) second, to the extent that
the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing
clause (i), the Registrable Securities of Holders (Pro Rata, based on the
respective number of Registrable Securities that each Holder has so requested)
exercising their rights to register their Registrable Securities pursuant to
_subsection 2.2.1_ hereof, without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities; and (iii) third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the
Class A Common Stock or other equity securities that the Company desires to
sell, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities;
and (iv) fourth, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has
not been reached under the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), the Class A
Common Stock or other equity securities of other persons or entities that the
Company is obligated to register in a Registration pursuant to separate
written contractual arrangements with such persons and that can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities.

reason whatsoever upon written notification to the Company and the
Underwriter or Underwriters (if any) of their intention to withdraw from such
Registration prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement filed
with the Commission with respect to the Registration of their Registrable
Securities pursuant to such Demand Registration (or in the case of an
Underwritten Registration pursuant to Rule 415, at least five (5) business

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall
be responsible for the Registration Expenses incurred in connection with a
Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration or a Shelf Underwritten
Offering prior to its withdrawal under this _subsection 2.2.5_.

  



  

2.3  _Piggyback Registration_.

  



  

2.3.1  _Piggyback Rights_. If the Company proposes to file a Registration
Statement under the Securities Act with respect to an offering of equity
securities, or securities or other obligations exercisable or exchangeable
for, or convertible into, equity securities, for its own account or for the
account of stockholders of the Company (or by the Company and by the
stockholders of the Company including, without limitation, pursuant to
_subsection 2.1.1_ or _2.1.2_ hereof), other than a Registration Statement
(or any registered offering with respect thereto) (i) filed in connection with
any employee stock option or other benefit plan, (ii) for an exchange offer
or offering of securities solely to the Company's existing stockholders, (iii)
for an offering of debt that is convertible into equity securities of the
Company, (iv) for a dividend reinvestment plan or (v) a Block Trade, then the

such offering, and (B) offer to all of the Holders of Registrable Securities
the opportunity to register the sale of such number of Registrable Securities
as such Holders may request in writing within five (5) days after receipt of
such written notice (such Registration a " _Piggyback Registration_ "). The
Company shall, in good faith, cause such Registrable Securities to be included
in such Piggyback Registration and shall use its best efforts to cause the
managing Underwriter or Underwriters of a proposed Underwritten Offering to
permit the Registrable Securities requested by the Holders pursuant to this
_subsection 2.3.1_ to be included in a Piggyback Registration on the same
terms and conditions as any similar securities of the Company included in such
Registration and to permit the sale or other disposition of such Registrable
Securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of distribution thereof.
All such Holders proposing to distribute their Registrable Securities through
an Underwritten Offering under this _subsection 2.3.1_ shall enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter(s) selected for
such Underwritten Offering by the Company.

Underwriters in an Underwritten Registration that is to be a Piggyback

desires to sell, taken together with (i) the Class A Common Stock, if any, as
to which Registration has been demanded pursuant to separate written
contractual arrangements with persons or entities other than the Holders of
Registrable Securities hereunder (ii) the Registrable Securities as to which
registration has been requested pursuant to _Section 2.3_ hereof, and (iii)
the Class A Common Stock, if any, as to which Registration has been requested
pursuant to separate written contractual piggyback registration rights of
other stockholders of the Company, exceeds the Maximum Number of Securities,

without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (B) second, to the extent
that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the
foregoing clause (A), the Registrable Securities of Holders exercising their
rights to register their Registrable Securities pursuant to  _subsection
2.3.1_ hereof, Pro Rata, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Securities; and (C) third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), the
Class A Common Stock, if any, as to which Registration has been requested
pursuant to written contractual piggyback registration rights of other
stockholders of the Company, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Securities;

  



  

(b) If the Registration is pursuant to a request by persons or entities other
than the Holders of Registrable Securities, then the Company shall include in
any such Registration (A) first, the Class A Common Stock or other equity
securities, if any, of such requesting persons or entities, other than the
Holders of Registrable Securities, which can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Securities; (B) second, to the extent that the Maximum
Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clause (A), the
Registrable Securities of Holders exercising their rights to register their
Registrable Securities pursuant to  _subsection 2.3.1_ , Pro Rata based on
the respective number of Registrable Securities that each Holder has requested
be included in such Underwritten Registration and the aggregate number of
Registrable Securities that the Holders have requested to be included in such
Underwritten Registration, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Securities; (C) third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), the
Class A Common Stock or other equity securities that the Company desires to
sell, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities; and (D) fourth, to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A), (B) and (C),
the Class A Common Stock or other equity securities for the account of other
persons or entities that the Company is obligated to register pursuant to
separate written contractual arrangements with such persons or entities, which
can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities.

2.3.3  _Piggyback Registration Withdrawal_. Any Holder of Registrable
Securities shall have the right to withdraw from a Piggyback Registration for
any or no reason whatsoever upon written notification to the Company and the
Underwriter or Underwriters (if any) of his, her or its intention to withdraw
from such Piggyback Registration prior to the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement filed with the Commission with respect to such
Piggyback Registration (or in the case of an Underwritten
Registration pursuant to Rule 415, at least five (5) business days prior to
the time of pricing of the applicable offering). The Company (whether on its
own good faith determination or as the result of a request for withdrawal by
persons pursuant to separate written contractual obligations) may withdraw a
Registration Statement filed with the Commission in connection with a
Piggyback Registration at any time prior to the effectiveness of such
Registration Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses
incurred in connection with the Piggyback Registration prior to
its withdrawal under this _subsection 2.3.3_.

  



  

2.3.4  _Unlimited Piggyback Registration Rights_. For purposes of clarity,
any Registration effected pursuant to _Section 2.3 _ hereof shall not be
counted as a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration effected under
_Section 2.2_ hereof or a Shelf Underwritten Offering effected under
_subsection 2.1.3_.

  



  

2.4  _Restrictions on Registration Rights_. If (A) during the period starting
with the date sixty (60) days prior to the Company's good faith estimate of
the date of the filing of, and ending on a date one hundred and twenty (120)
days after the effective date of, a Company initiated Registration and
provided that the Company has delivered written notice to the Holders prior to
receipt of a Demand Registration pursuant to _subsection 2.2.1_ and it
continues to actively employ, in good faith, all reasonable efforts to cause
the applicable Registration Statement to become effective; (B) the Holders
have requested an Underwritten Registration and the Company and the Holders
are unable to obtain the commitment of an Underwriter or Underwriters to
firmly underwrite the offer; or (C) in the good faith judgment of the Board
such Registration would be seriously detrimental to the Company and the Board
concludes as a result that it is essential to defer the filing of such
Registration Statement at such time, then in each case the Company shall
furnish to such Holders a certificate signed by the Chairman of the Board
stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board it would be seriously
detrimental to the Company for such Registration Statement to be filed in the
near future and that it is therefore essential to defer the filing of such
Registration Statement. In such event, the Company shall have the right to
defer such filing for a period of not more than sixty (60) days; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not defer its obligation in this manner
more than once in any twelve (12)-month period.

  



  

2.5  _Block Trades_.

  



  

2.5.1 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article II, but subject to
Sections 2.4 and 3.4, at any time and from time to time when an effective
Form S-3 Shelf is on file with the Commission, if one or more Demanding
Holders desire to effect a Block Trade with a total offering price reasonably
expected to exceed, in the aggregate, either (x) $15,000,000 or (y) all
remaining Registrable Securities held by such Demanding Holder(s), but in no
event less than $10,000,000, then such Demanding Holder(s) shall
provide written notice to the Company at least five (5) business days prior
to the date such Block Trade will commence. As expeditiously as possible, the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate such Block
Trade. The Demanding Holders shall use reasonable best efforts to work with
the Company and the Underwriter(s) (including by disclosing the maximum number
of Registrable Securities proposed to be the subject of such Block Trade)

Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended plan of distribution
thereof, and pursuant thereto the Company shall, as expeditiously as possible:

  



  

3.1.1 prepare and file with the Commission as soon as practicable a

3.1.2 prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and post-effective
amendments to the Registration Statement, and such supplements to the

rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used
by the Company or by the Securities Act or rules and regulations
thereunder to keep the Registration Statement effective until all Registrable
Securities covered by such Registration Statement are sold in accordance with
the intended plan of distribution set forth in such Registration Statement or
supplement to the Prospectus;

  



  

   

14

 



    



  

3.1.3 prior to filing a Registration Statement or prospectus, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, furnish without charge to
the Underwriter(s), if any, and each Holder of Registrable Securities
included in such Registration, and each such Holder's legal counsel, copies
of such Registration Statement as proposed to be filed, each amendment and
supplement to such Registration Statement (in each case including all
exhibits thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein), the
Prospectus included in such Registration Statement (including each
preliminary Prospectus), and such other documents as the Underwriter(s) and
each Holder of Registrable Securities included in such Registration or the
legal counsel for any such Holders may request in order to facilitate the
disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such Holders;

  



  

3.1.4 prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities, use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) register or qualify the Registrable Securities
covered by the Registration Statement under such securities or "blue sky" laws
of such jurisdictions in the United States as any Holder of Registrable
Securities included in such Registration Statement (in light of their
intended plan of distribution) may request and (ii) take such action
necessary to cause such Registrable Securities covered by the
Registration Statement to be registered with or approved by such other
governmental authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and
operations of the Company and do any and all other acts and things that may be
necessary or advisable to enable the Holders of Registrable Securities
included in such Registration Statement to consummate the disposition of such
Registrable Securities in such jurisdictions; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company shall not be required to qualify generally to do business in any
jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify or take any
action to which it would be subject to general service of process or taxation
in any such jurisdiction where it is not then otherwise so subject;

  



  

3.1.5 cause all such Registrable Securities to be listed on each securities
exchange or automated quotation system on which similar securities issued by

and promptly use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any
stop order or to obtain its withdrawal if such stop order should be issued;

  



  

3.1.8 at least three (3) days prior to the filing of any Registration
Statement or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to such Registration
Statement or Prospectus or any document that is to be incorporated by
reference into such Registration Statement or Prospectus, furnish a copy

including, without limitation, providing copies promptly upon receipt of any
comment letters received with respect to any such Registration Statement or
Prospectus;

  



  

3.1.9 notify the Holders at any time when a Prospectus relating to such
Registration Statement is required to be delivered under the Securities Act,
of the happening of any event as a result of which the Prospectus included in
such Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes a Misstatement, and
then to correct such Misstatement as set forth in _Section 3.4_ hereof;

  



  

   

15

 



    



  

3.1.10 permit a representative of the Holders (such representative to be
selected by a majority-in-interest of the participating Holders), the
Underwriter(s), if any, and any attorney or accountant retained by such
Holders or Underwriter(s) to participate, at each such person's own expense,
in the preparation of the Registration Statement, and cause the Company's
officers, directors and employees to supply all information reasonably
requested by any such representative, Underwriter, attorney or accountant
in connection with the Registration; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
representative or Underwriter enters into a confidentiality agreement, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, prior to the
release or disclosure of any such information; and _provided further_ , the
Company may not include the name of any Holder or Underwriter or any
information regarding any Holder or Underwriter in any Registration Statement
or Prospectus, any amendment or supplement to such Registration Statement or
Prospectus, any document that is to be incorporated by reference into such
Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any response to any comment letter,
without the prior written consent of such Holder or Underwriter and providing
each such Holder or Underwriter a reasonable amount of time to review and
comment on such applicable document, which comments the Company shall include
unless contrary to applicable law;

  



  

3.1.11 obtain a "comfort" letter from the Company's independent registered
public accountants in the event of an Underwritten Registration in customary
form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by "comfort"
letters as the managing Underwriter(s) may reasonably request, and reasonably
satisfactory to a majority-in-interest of the participating Holders;

  



  

3.1.12 on the date the Registrable Securities are delivered for sale pursuant
to such Registration, obtain and deliver to the Holders a copy of an opinion,
dated such date, of counsel representing the Company for the purposes of such
Registration, addressed to the placement agent or sales agent, if any, and
the Underwriter(s), if any, covering such legal matters with respect to the
Registration in respect of which such opinion is being given as the
Underwriter(s) may reasonably request and as are customarily included in such
opinions and negative assurance letters, and reasonably satisfactory to a
majority in interest of the participating Holders;

  



  

3.1.13 in the event of any Underwritten Offering, enter into and perform its
obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form,
with the managing Underwriter of such offering;

  



  

3.1.14 make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably
practicable, an earnings statement covering the period of at least twelve
(12) months beginning with the first (1st) day of the Company's first full
calendar quarter after the effective date of the Registration Statement which
satisfies the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158
thereunder (or any successor rule promulgated thereafter by the Commission);

  



  

3.1.15 if the Registration involves the Registration of Registrable
Securities involving gross proceeds in excess of $50,000,000, use its
reasonable efforts to make available senior executives of the Company to
participate in customary "road show" presentations that may be reasonably
requested by the Underwriter(s) in any Underwritten Offering; and

  



  

3.1.16 otherwise, in good faith, cooperate reasonably with, and take such
customary actions as may reasonably be requested by the Holders, in
connection with such Registration.

  



  

   

16

 



    



  

3.2  _Registration Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
Registration Expenses of all Registrations shall be borne by the Company. It
is acknowledged by the Holders that the Holders shall bear all incremental
selling expenses relating to the sale of Registrable Securities, such as
Underwriters' commissions and discounts, brokerage fees, Underwriter marketing
costs and, other than as set forth in the definition of "Registration
Expenses," all reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel representing
the Holders.

  



  

3.3  _Requirements for Participation in Underwritten Offerings_. No person
may participate in any Underwritten Offering for equity securities of the
Company pursuant to a Registration initiated by the Company hereunder unless
such person (i) agrees to sell such person's securities on the basis provided
in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Company and (ii)
completes and executes all customary questionnaires, powers of attorney,
indemnities, lock-up agreements (subject to subsection 3.6.3
hereof), underwriting agreements and other customary documents as may be
reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

  



  

3.4  _Suspension of Sales; Adverse Disclosure_. Upon receipt of written
notice from the Company that a Registration Statement or Prospectus contains
a Misstatement, each of the Holders shall forthwith discontinue disposition of
Registrable Securities until it has received copies of a supplemented or
amended Prospectus correcting the Misstatement (it being understood that the
Company hereby covenants to prepare and file such supplement or amendment as
soon as practicable after the time of such notice), or until it is advised in
writing by the Company that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed. If the
filing, initial effectiveness or continued use of a Registration Statement in
respect of any Registration at any time would require the Company to make an
Adverse Disclosure or would require the inclusion in such Registration
Statement of financial statements that are unavailable to the Company for
reasons beyond the Company's control, the Company may, upon giving prompt
written notice of such action to the Holders, delay the filing or initial
effectiveness of, or suspend use of, such Registration Statement for the
shortest period of time, but in no event more than sixty (60) consecutive
days or one hundred-twenty (120) total days in any twelve (12)-month
period, determined in good faith by the Company to be necessary for such
purpose; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not defer its
obligations in this manner more than three times in any twelve (12)-month
period. In the event the Company exercises its rights under the preceding
sentence, the Holders agree to suspend, immediately upon their receipt of the
notice referred to above, their use of the Prospectus relating to any
Registration in connection with any sale or offer to sell Registrable
Securities. The Company shall immediately notify the Holders of the
expiration of any period during which it exercised its rights under this 
_Section 3.4_.

  



  

3.5  _Reporting Obligations_. As long as any Holder shall own Registrable
Securities, the Company, at all times while it shall be a reporting company
under the Exchange Act, covenants to file timely (or obtain extensions in
respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports
required to be filed by the Company after the date hereof pursuant to Sections
13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The Company further covenants that it
shall take such further action as any Holder may reasonably request, all to
the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell shares of
the Class A Common Stock held by such Holder without registration under the
Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144,
including providing any legal opinions.

  



  

   

17

 



    



  

3.6  _Transfer Restrictions_.

  



  

3.6.1 Except with respect to a Transfer to a Permitted Transferee, during the
applicable Lock-Up Periods, no Existing Holder shall, directly or indirectly,
offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, make any
short sale or otherwise dispose of or distribute (" _Transfer_ ") any (i)
shares of Class A Common Stock or any other shares of the Company's capital
stock, (ii) options or warrants to purchase any shares of Class A Common Stock
or any other shares of the Company's capital stock or (iii) securities
convertible into, exercisable for, exchangeable for or that represent the
right to receive shares of Class A Common Stock or any other shares of the
Company's capital stock, in each case, whether now owned or hereinafter
acquired, that are owned directly by such Existing Holder (including
securities held as a custodian) or with respect to which such Existing Holder
has beneficial ownership within the rules and regulations of the SEC
(collectively, the " _Restricted Shares_ "), or publicly disclose the
intention to make any offer, sale, pledge, grant, disposition or transfer of
the Restricted Shares. The foregoing restriction is expressly agreed to
preclude each Existing Holder from engaging in any hedging or other
transaction which is designed to or which reasonably could be expected to lead
to or result in a sale or disposition of the Restricted Shares even if such
Restricted Shares would be disposed of by someone other than such Existing
Holder. Such prohibited hedging or other transactions include any short sale
or any purchase, sale or grant of any right (including any put or call
option) with respect to any of the Restricted Shares of the applicable
Existing Holder or with respect to any security that includes, relates to, or
derives any significant part of its value from such Restricted Shares.

  



  

3.6.2 Each Existing Holder hereby represents and warrants that it now has
and, except as contemplated by this _subsection 3.6.2_  for the duration of
the applicable Lock-Up Period, will have good and marketable title to its
Restricted Shares, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, and claims that
could impact the ability of such Existing Holder to comply with the foregoing
restrictions. Each Existing Holder agrees and consents to the entry of stop
transfer instructions with the Company's transfer agent against the transfer
of any Restricted Shares during the applicable Lock-Up Period, except in
compliance with the foregoing restrictions.

  



  

3.6.3 In connection with any Underwritten Offering (other than a Block
Trade), the Company and each Holder proposing to distribute their Registrable
Securities through such Underwritten Offering will agree (with respect to the
Registrable Securities held by such Holder) to be bound by the underwriting
agreement's lock-up restrictions (which must apply in like manner to all such
Holders) that are agreed to by (a) the Company, if a majority of the shares
being sold in such Underwritten Offering are being sold for its account, and
(b) Holders holding a majority of the shares being sold by all Holders, if a
majority of the shares being sold in such Underwritten Offering are being
sold by the Holders, provided that, in no event shall any lock-up restriction
in accordance with this _subsection 3.6.3_ exceed a period of forty-five (45)
days from the date of the final Prospectus for any such
Underwritten Offering, except with respect to the first Underwritten Offering
following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, if the managing Underwriter or Underwriters, in good faith, advise
the Company in writing that a lock-up restriction of a period of forty-five
(45) or fewer days would have a material adverse impact on such Underwritten
Offering, then such lock-up restrictions shall be for the number of days such
managing Underwriter or Underwriters so advise, not to exceed a period of
ninety (90) days from the date of the final Prospectus for any such
Underwritten Offering.

Article IV 
  
 INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION

  



  

4.1  _Indemnification_.

  



  

4.1.1 The Company agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each
Holder of Registrable Securities, its officers and directors and each person
who controls such Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against
all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including without
limitation reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from any untrue or alleged
untrue statement of material fact contained in any Registration Statement,
Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, except insofar as the same are caused by or contained in any
information furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder expressly for
use therein. The Company shall indemnify the Underwriters, their officers and
directors and each person who controls such Underwriters (within the meaning
of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided in the foregoing with
respect to the indemnification of the Holder.

  



  

4.1.2 In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder of
Registrable Securities is participating, such Holder shall furnish to the
Company in writing such information and affidavits as the Company reasonably
requests for use in connection with any such Registration Statement or
Prospectus and, to the extent permitted by law, shall indemnify the Company,
its directors and officers and agents and each person who controls the
Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against any
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including without
limitation reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from any untrue statement of
material fact contained in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or
preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any
omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that such
untrue statement or omission is contained in any information or affidavit
so furnished in writing by such Holder expressly for use therein; _provided_
, _however_ , that the obligation to indemnify shall be several, not joint
and several, among such Holders of Registrable Securities, and the liability
of each such Holder of Registrable Securities shall be in proportion to and
limited to the net proceeds received by such Holder from the sale of
Registrable Securities in such offering giving rise to such liability. The
Holders of Registrable Securities shall indemnify the Underwriters, their
officers, directors and each person who controls such Underwriters (within the
meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided in the
foregoing with respect to indemnification of the Company.

  



  

   

19

 



    



  

4.1.3 Any person entitled to indemnification herein shall (i) give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which
it seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt notice
shall not impair any person's right to indemnification hereunder to the
extent such failure has not materially prejudiced the indemnifying party) and
(ii) unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of
interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with
respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of
such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If
such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any
liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its
consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).
An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the
defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of
more than one counsel (plus local counsel) for all parties indemnified by such
indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable
judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between
such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect
to such claim. No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the
indemnified party, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement which cannot be settled in all respects by the payment of money
(and such money is so paid by the indemnifying party pursuant to the terms of
such settlement) or which settlement does not include as an unconditional
term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified
party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation.

  



  

4.1.4 The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of
the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling person of such
indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities. The Company
and each Holder of Registrable Securities participating in an offering also
agrees to make such provisions as are reasonably requested by any indemnified
party for contribution to such party in the event the Company's or such
Holder's indemnification is unavailable for any reason.

  



  

4.1.5 If the indemnification provided under _Section 4.1_ hereof from the
indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying the indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of
the indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission
to state a material fact, was made by, or relates to information supplied by,
such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the indemnifying party's
and indemnified party's relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action and the benefits received by
the such indemnifying party or indemnified party; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that the liability of any Holder under this _subsection 4.1.5_ shall be
limited to the amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder from the
sale of Registrable Securities in such offering giving rise to such liability.
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses or other
liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the
limitations set forth in _subsections 4.1.1_ , _4.1.2_ and _4.1.3_ above, any
legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in
connection with any investigation or proceeding. The parties hereto agree
that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this
_subsection 4.1.5_ were determined by Pro Rata allocation or by any other
method of allocation, which does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to in this _subsection 4.1.5_. No person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution pursuant to this
_subsection 4.1.5_ from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

21

5.2.4 This Agreement shall not confer any rights or benefits on any persons
that are not parties hereto, other than as expressly set forth in this
Agreement and _Section 5.2_ hereof.

obligations hereunder shall be binding upon or obligate the Company unless
and until the Company shall have received (i) written notice of such
assignment as provided in _Section 5.1 _ hereof and (ii) the written
agreement of the assignee, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company,
to be bound by the terms and provisions of this Agreement (which may be

ENTERED INTO AND TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO
THE CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS OF SUCH JURISDICTION AND (II) THE VENUE FOR
ANY ACTION TAKEN WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE ANY STATE OR FEDERAL

5.5  _Amendments and Modifications_. Upon the written consent of the Company
and the Holders of at least a majority-in-interest of the Registrable
Securities at the time in question, compliance with any of the provisions,
covenants and conditions set forth in this Agreement may be waived, or any of
such provisions, covenants or conditions may be amended or modified;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment
hereto or waiver hereof that adversely affects either the Existing Holders as
a group or the New Holders as a group, respectively, in a manner that is
materially adversely different from the Existing Holders or New Holders, as
applicable, shall require the consent of at least a majority-in-interest of
the Registrable Securities held by such Existing Holders or New Holders, as
applicable, at the time in question; _provided_ , _further_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment hereto or waiver hereof that
adversely affects one Holder, solely in its capacity as a holder of the
shares of capital stock of the Company, in a manner that is materially
different from the other Holders (in such capacity) shall require the consent
of the Holder so affected; _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, no amendment hereto or waiver hereof that has the effect of
extending the Lock-Up Period applicable to any particular Holder shall be
enforceable against, or effective with respect to, such Holder without such
Holder's written consent. No course of dealing between any Holder or the
Company and any other party hereto or any failure or delay on the part of a
Holder or the Company in exercising any rights or remedies under this
Agreement shall operate as a waiver of any rights or remedies of any Holder or
the Company. No single or partial exercise of any rights or remedies under
this Agreement by a party shall operate as a waiver or preclude the exercise
of any other rights or remedies hereunder or thereunder by such party.

5.6  _Other Registration Rights_. The Company represents and warrants that,
other than pursuant to (a) that certain Warrant Agreement, dated as of
December 12, 2019, by and between Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company
and the Company and (b) those certain Subscription Agreements, dated as of
July 29, 2020, by and between the Company and certain persons that have become
stockholders of the Company as of the date hereof in connection with the
issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock on the terms set forth therein, no
person, other than a Holder of Registrable Securities, has any right to
require the Company to register any securities of the Company for sale or to
include such securities of the Company in any Registration filed by the
Company for the sale of securities for its own account or for the account of
any other person. Further, the Company represents and warrants that
this Agreement supersedes any other registration rights agreement or
agreement with similar terms and conditions and in the event of a conflict
between any such agreement or agreements and this Agreement, the terms of this
Agreement shall prevail. The Company agrees that it will not, after the date
of this Agreement, enter into any agreement which materially and adversely
interferes with the rights granted to the Holders of Registrable Securities
in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof,
including allowing any other holder of Class A Common Stock to have
registration rights in the nature or substantially in the nature of those set
forth in this Agreement that would have priority over or _pari passu_ with the

INVESTOR RIGHTS AGREEMENT

  



  

THIS INVESTOR RIGHTS AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of [●], 2020 (the " _Effective Time_ "), by and among SOC Telemed,
Inc. (f/k/a Healthcare Merger Corp.), a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_
"), and SOC Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "
_Stockholder_ "). Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this
Agreement have the respective meanings given to them in the Merger Agreement
(as defined below).

  



  

WHEREAS, the Company and certain of its affiliates have consummated the
business combination and the other transactions (collectively, the "
_Transactions_ ") contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as
of July 28, 2020, by and among the Company, Sabre Merger Sub I, Inc., a
Delaware corporation, Sabre Merger Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company, and Specialists On Call, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Sabre_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, in its capacity as the holder of a majority of the outstanding
equity interests of Sabre prior to the consummation of the Transactions, the
Stockholder desires that, after giving effect to the Transactions, it will
have representation on the board of directors of the Company (the " _Board_
") so as to continue to create value for its direct and indirect equityholders
and for the other direct and indirect equityholders of the Company; and

  



  

WHEREAS, in furtherance of the foregoing, the Stockholder desires to have
certain director nomination rights with respect to the Company, and the
Company desires to provide the Stockholder with such rights, in each case, on
the terms and conditions set forth herein.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficient of which
are hereby acknowledged, each of the parties to this Agreement agrees as
follows:

  



  

Article I 
  
 NOMINATION RIGHT

  



  

Section 1.1 _Board Nomination Right_.

  



  

(a) From the Effective Time until the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 2.1_ , at every meeting of the Board, or a committee
thereof, or action by written consent, at or by which directors of the Company
are appointed by the Board or are nominated to stand for election and elected
by stockholders of the Company:

  



  

(i) For so long as the Stockholder holds at least fifty percent (50%) of the
issued and outstanding shares of Parent Class A Common Stock, the Stockholder
shall have the right to designate for election to the Board up to five (5)
individuals to serve as directors of the Company (any individual designated
by the Stockholder for election to the Board pursuant to this _Section 1.1(a)_
, a " _Designee_ " and, collectively, the " _Designees_ ") that, if elected,
will result in five (5) Designees serving on the Board; provided that in such
event, the size of the Board in accordance with _Section 1(d)_ shall be nine
(9) directors.

  



  

(ii) For so long as the Stockholder holds at least thirty five percent (35%)
but less than fifty percent (50%) of the issued and outstanding shares of
Parent Class A Common Stock, the Stockholder shall have the right to designate
for election to the Board up to three (3) Designees that, if elected, will
result in three (3) Designees serving on the Board; provided that in such
event, the size of the Board in accordance with _Section 1(d)_ shall be nine
(9) directors.

  



  

(iii) For so long as the Stockholder holds at least fifteen percent (15%) but
less than thirty five percent (35%) of the issued and outstanding shares of
Parent Class A Common Stock, the Stockholder shall have the right to designate
for election to the Board up to two (2) Designees that, if elected, will
result in two (2) Designees serving on the Board provided that in such event,
the size of the Board in accordance with _Section 1(d)_ shall be seven (7)
directors.

  



  

   

1

 



    



  

(iv) For so long as the Stockholder holds at least five percent (5%) but less
than fifteen percent (15%) of the issued and outstanding shares of Parent
Class A Common Stock, the Stockholder shall have the right to designate for
election to the Board up to one (1) Designee that, if elected, will result in
one (1) Designee serving on the Board; provided that in such event, the size
of the Board in accordance with _Section 1(d)_ shall be seven (7) directors.

  



  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Company shall, as promptly as
practicable, take all actions necessary (including, without limitation,
calling special meetings of the Board and the stockholders of the Company and
recommending, supporting and soliciting proxies) to ensure that: (i) the
applicable Designees are included in the Board's slate of nominees to the
stockholders of the Company and recommended by the Board at any meeting of
stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors, in each case, to
the extent necessary such that the number of Designees that the Stockholder is
eligible to designate shall be designated; and (ii) each applicable Designee
up for election in accordance with the foregoing is included in the proxy
statement prepared by management of the Company in connection with the
Company's solicitation of proxies or consents in favor of the foregoing for
every meeting of the stockholders of the Company called with respect to the
election of directors, and at every adjournment or postponement thereof, and
on every action or approval by written resolution of the stockholders of the
Company or the Board with respect to the election of directors. The Company
shall use no less efforts to cause the election of each Designee that
is proposed to serve on the Board by the Stockholder than the Company shall
use with respect to each other nominee up for election.

  



  

(c) If any Designee ceases to serve for any reason (including because of the
death, disability, disqualification, resignation, or removal of such
Designee), the Stockholder shall, subject to the Stockholder then being
entitled to designate such individual for election or appointment as a
director pursuant to _Section 1.1(a)_ , be entitled to designate such person's
successor in accordance with this Agreement and the Board shall promptly fill
the vacancy with such successor Designee.

  



  

(d) The Company shall take all necessary and desirable actions within its
control such that, as of the Effective Time and thereafter from time to time,
the size of the Board is set at either seven (7) directors or nine (9)
directors, as applicable in accordance with _Section 1(a)_ , and sufficient
existing directors from time to time resign or are removed from the Board such
that the Board positions designated for the Designees are vacant immediately
prior to the nomination and appointment of the Designees provided for herein;
provided that the Board may after the Effective Time take action (in
accordance with the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and bylaws in effect at such time) to increase the size of the
Board so long as the Stockholder approves such action. For the avoidance of
doubt, in the event that the Stockholder shall forfeit the right pursuant to
_Section 1(a)_ to designate one (1) or more Designees (but continues
thereafter to retain the right pursuant to _Section 1(a)_  to designate one
(1) or more other Designees), the Stockholder shall have the right to elect
which of its Designees is required to resign or otherwise be removed from the
Board.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding any of this _Section 1.1_ to the contrary, the election
or appointment of any Designee to the Board shall be subject to the prior
execution by such Designee of an irrevocable resignation letter in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit A_.

  



  

(f) The Company shall indemnify the Designees on the same basis as all other
members of the Board and pursuant to indemnity agreements with terms that are
no less favorable to the Designees than the indemnity agreements entered into
between the Company and its other non-employee directors.

(g) Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 1.1_ , the Stockholder
shall not be entitled to designate a Person as a nominee to the Board upon a
written determination by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of
the Company (which determination shall set forth in writing reasonable grounds
for the determination) that the Person would not be qualified under any
applicable law, rule or regulation to serve as a director of the Company, in
each case solely to the extent such determination is based upon any of the
following: (i) such Person was convicted in a criminal proceeding or is a
named subject of a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations
and other minor offenses); (ii) such Person was the subject of any Order not
subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated of any court of competent
jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining such proposed director
from, or otherwise limiting, the following activities: (A) engaging in any
type of business practice, or (B) engaging in any activity in connection with
the purchase or sale of any security or in connection with any violation of
federal or state securities Laws; (iii) such Person was the subject of any
Order not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any federal or state
authority barring, suspending or otherwise limiting for more than sixty (60)
days the right of such person to engage in any activity described in clause
(ii)(B), or to be associated with Persons engaged in such activity; (4) such
Person was found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by
the SEC to have violated any federal or state securities Law, and the judgment
in such civil action or finding by the SEC has not been subsequently
reversed, suspended or vacated; or (v) such Designee was the subject of, or a
party to any federal or state judicial or administrative Order not
subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, relating to a violation of any
federal or state securities Law.

  



  

(h) In such an event set forth in _Section 1.1(g)_ , the Stockholder shall be
entitled to select a Person as a replacement Designee and the Company shall
use such efforts as set forth in _Section 1.1(b)_ to cause that Person to be
nominated as a Designee at the same meeting as the initial Person was to be
nominated.

  



  

(i) For the avoidance of doubt, [●], who is currently serving as a Class [●]
Director (as defined in the Company's Second Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation (the " _Company Charter_ ")), and [●], who is currently
serving as a Class [●] Director (as defined in the Company Charter), shall
constitute Designees of the Stockholder for so long as each shall serve as
directors of the Company in accordance with, and subject to, the rights of
the Stockholder under this Agreement.

  



  

(j) For so long as any Designee serves as a director on the Board, the
Company (i) shall provide such Designee with the same expense reimbursement,
benefits, indemnity, exculpation and other arrangements provided to the
other directors on the Board and (ii) shall not amend, alter or repeal any
right to indemnification or exculpation covering or benefiting any Designee
as and to the extent consistent with applicable Law, including but not limited
to any rights contained in the governing documents of the Company (except to
the extent such amendment or alteration permits the Company to provide broader
indemnification or exculpation rights on a retroactive basis than permitted
prior thereto).

  



  

(k) The Company shall (i) purchase directors' and officers' liability
insurance in an amount determined by the Board to be reasonable and customary
and (ii) for so long as any Designee serves as a director on the Board,
maintain such directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage with
respect to such Designee; provided, that upon removal or resignation of such
Designee for any reason, the Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to extend such directors' and officers' liability insurance
coverage with respect to such Designee for a period of not less than six (6)
years from any such event in respect of any act or omission of such Designee
occurring at or prior to such event.

  



  

Article II 
  
 MISCELLANEOUS

  



  

Section 2.1 _Termination._ This Agreement shall terminate automatically and

of the Support Agreement.

  



  

Section 2.3 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

Section 2.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of
action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
principles or rules of conflict of Laws to the extent such principles or rules
would require or permit the application of Laws of another jurisdiction.

  



  

Section 2.8 _Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. Any Legal Proceeding
based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby may be brought in federal and state courts located in the
