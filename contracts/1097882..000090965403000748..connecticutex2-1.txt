or before March 31, 2004, the Per Share Merger  Consideration shall be increased
by the amount  determined by dividing (x) the Purchase  Price  Adjustment by (y)
the sum of (i) the  number of  shares of  Connecticut  Bancshares  Common  Stock
issued and  outstanding  immediately  prior to the  Effective  Date and (ii) the
number of shares of  Connecticut  Bancshares  Common Stock which may be acquired
immediately  prior to the  Effective  Date  upon the  exercise  of the  Options,
subject to Connecticut Bancshares providing to NHSB the following:

                  (a) as soon as  reasonably  practicable  following  the end of
                  each calendar  month ending after March 31, 2004 preceding the
                  Closing,  Connecticut  Bancshares  shall  deliver  to  NHSB  a
                  consolidated  statement of operations  for such calendar month
                  in form  consistent  with  the  determination  of  Connecticut

                  (b) not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing

                  to review and issue its report on the  consolidated  statement
                  of  operations  of  Connecticut   Bancshares  for  the  period
                  beginning  on April 1, 2004 and ending at the date of the last

                  report  shall be binding  on the  parties  for the  purpose of
                  calculating  the  Purchase  Price  Adjustment.  No  partner or
                  manager of PwC who is involved in the audit engagement at NHSB
                  shall  participate  in  the  preparation  or  issuance  of the

Plans which has not been granted or allocated,  shall,  at the  Effective  Time,
cease to exist,  and the  certificates  for such shares  shall be  cancelled  as
promptly as practicable thereafter, and no payment or distribution shall be made
in consideration therefor.

                  3.1.3 Each Option issued and outstanding  immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall,  by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the  holder  thereof  and  without  regard to any  future  vesting  date
thereof,  be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment in
an amount determined by multiplying (i) the positive difference, if any, between
the Per Share Merger Consideration, adjusted, if applicable, pursuant to Section
3.1.1  above,  and the  exercise  price  of  such  Option,  for  each  share  of
Connecticut  Bancshares Common Stock covered by such Option (the "Option Price")
by (ii) the number of shares of Connecticut  Bancshares  Common Stock subject to
such  Option   (the   "Option   Consideration").   The  payment  of  the  Option
Consideration  referred to in the immediately  preceding sentence to each holder
of an Option  shall be subject to such  holder  executing  such  instruments  of
cancellation   as  NEWCO  and   Connecticut   Bancshares  may  reasonably   deem
appropriate. Connecticut Bancshares or SBM shall make necessary tax withholdings
from the Option Consideration as they deem appropriate.

                  3.1.4. At the Effective Time, each unvested  restricted  share
of Connecticut  Bancshares Common Stock granted under the Connecticut Bancshares
Option Plans (each a "Company  Restricted  Share"),  as set forth in Connecticut

prior to the Effective  Time shall vest and become free of  restrictions  to the
extent provided by the terms thereof.  Each holder of a Company Restricted Share
shall have the same rights to receive the Merger  Consideration  as are provided
to other holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.1.

         3.2      DISSENTERS' RIGHTS.
                  ------------------

                  3.2.1 Each outstanding share of Connecticut  Bancshares Common
Stock the holder of which has  perfected his right to dissent under the DGCL and
has not  effectively  withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective Time (the
"Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive
the Merger  Consolidation  hereunder,  and the holder  thereof shall be entitled
only to such rights as are  granted by the DGCL.  Connecticut  Bancshares  shall
give NHSB notice upon receipt by Connecticut  Bancshares of any such demands for
payment of the fair value of such shares of Connecticut  Bancshares Common Stock
and of withdrawals of such notice and any other instruments provided pursuant to
applicable law (any shareholder duly making such demand being hereinafter called
a "Dissenting Shareholder"), and NHSB shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations  and  proceedings  with  respect to any such  demands.  Connecticut
Bancshares shall not, except with the prior written consent of NHSB, voluntarily
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,  any such demand
for  payment,  or waive any  failure  to timely  deliver  a written  demand  for
appraisal or the taking of any other action by such  Dissenting  Shareholder  as
may be necessary to perfect  appraisal  rights under the DGCL. Any payments made
in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by NEWCO.

                  3.2.2 If any Dissenting Shareholder shall effectively withdraw
or lose (through  failure to perfect or otherwise)  his right to such fair value
payment at or prior to the Effective  Time,  such holder's shares of Connecticut
Bancshares  Common Stock shall be  converted  into a right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement. If
such holder shall  effectively  withdraw or lose (through  failure to perfect or
otherwise) his right to such fair value payment after the Effective  Time,  each
share of Connecticut  Bancshares  Common Stock of such holder shall be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

                  3.2.3  After  the  Effective   Time,   shares  of  Connecticut
Bancshares  Common  Stock  other  than  Dissenting  Shares  shall  be no  longer
outstanding and shall  automatically  be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
shall thereafter by operation of this section be the right to receive the Merger

Options,  for  exchange in  accordance  with this Section 3.3, an amount of cash
sufficient  to pay the  aggregate  amount of cash  payable  in  accordance  with
Article III hereof (such cash for shares of Connecticut  Bancshares Common Stock

outstanding  Connecticut  Bancshares Common Stock and Options in accordance with
this Agreement.

cash that such  holder  has the right to  receive  in  respect  of  Certificates

deliver  within five (5) Business  Days a check  representing  the amount of the
Option  Price to the  holders  of the  Options,  all of which  shall  have  been
cancelled in connection with the Merger Agreement.

                  3.3.4  Rights  of  Certificate  or  Option  Holders  after the
                         -------------------------------------------------------

exchange for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement.

                  3.3.5 Surrender by Persons Other than Record  Holders.  If the
                        -----------------------------------------------
Person  surrendering  a  Certificate  and  signing  the  accompanying  letter of

endorsed to such Person or is accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either
case  signed  exactly  as  the  name  of  the  record  holder  appears  on  such
Certificate,  and is otherwise in proper form for transfer, or is accompanied by
appropriate   evidence  of  the  authority  of  the  Person   surrendering  such
Certificate  and  signing  the letter of  transmittal  to do so on behalf of the
record  holder;  and (ii) the person  requesting  such exchange shall pay to the
Exchange  Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment  to a  person  other  than  the  registered  holder  of the  Certificate
surrendered,  or  required  for any  other  reason,  or shall  establish  to the
satisfaction  of the  Exchange  Agent  that  such  tax has  been  paid or is not
payable.

                  3.3.6 Closing of Transfer Books.  From and after the Effective
                        -------------------------
Time,  there shall be no transfers on the stock  transfer  books of  Connecticut

been made  available  to the  Exchange  Agent and not  disbursed  to  holders of
Certificates and Options (including,  without limitation, all interest and other
income  received by the Exchange Agent in respect of all funds made available to
it), and thereafter  such holders shall be entitled to look to NEWCO (subject to
abandoned  property,  escheat and other similar laws) with respect to any Merger
Consideration  that may be payable  upon due  surrender of the  Certificates  or
Options held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither NHSB, NEWCO nor the
Exchange  Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Option for any
Merger  Consideration  delivered in respect of such  Certificate  or Option to a
public  official  pursuant to any abandoned  property,  escheat or other similar
law.

                  3.3.8 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any

by such  person  of a bond in such  amount  as NEWCO  may  reasonably  direct as
indemnity  against  any claim that may be made  against it with  respect to such
Certificate,  the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof.

                  3.3.9  Withholding.  NEWCO  or  the  Exchange  Agent  will  be
                         -----------
entitled  to  deduct  and  withhold  from the  consideration  otherwise  payable
pursuant to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to any holder
of Connecticut  Bancshares Common Stock or Options such amounts as NEWCO (or any
Affiliate  thereof) or the  Exchange  Agent are  required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such  payment  under the Code,  or any  applicable
provision of U.S. federal,  state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that
such amounts are properly withheld by NEWCO or the Exchange Agent, such withheld
amounts will be treated for all  purposes of this  Agreement as having been paid
to the holder of the Connecticut  Bancshares  Common Stock or Options in respect
of whom such deduction and withholding were made by NEWCO or the Exchange Agent.

         5.5 MATERIAL  ADVERSE  CHANGE.  Since March 31, 2003 to the date hereof
             -------------------------
(i) NHSB has conducted its business in the ordinary and usual course  (excluding
the incurrence of expenses in connection with this Agreement,  and excluding the
incurrence of expenses in connection with the transactions  contemplated  hereby
and the  transactions  contemplated by or referred to in the Plan),  and (ii) no
event  has  occurred  or  circumstance  arisen  that,  individually  or  in  the
aggregate,  has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
NHSB.

         5.6      TAX MATTERS.
                  -----------

                  5.6.1 NHSB (taking  into account any  extension of time within
which to file which has not expired)  has timely filed all Tax Returns  required
by applicable law to be filed by it in respect of all applicable  Taxes required
to be paid  through  the date  hereof and will  timely file any such Tax Returns
required to be filed prior to the Effective  Time with respect to Taxes required
to be paid through the  Effective  Time.  NHSB has paid, or where payment is not
required to have been made,  has set up an  adequate  reserve or accrual for the
payment of, all Taxes  required to be paid in respect of the periods  covered by
such Tax Returns and, as of the Effective Time, will have paid, or where payment
is not  required  to have been  made,  will have set up an  adequate  reserve or
accrual for the payment of, all Taxes for any  subsequent  periods  ending on or
prior to the  Effective  Time.  To the  knowledge  of NHSB,  NHSB  will  have no
liability  for any such Taxes in excess of the  amounts so paid or  reserves  or
accruals  so  established.  As of the date  hereof,  no  audit,  examination  or
deficiency or refund litigation with respect to any Tax Returns filed by NHSB is
pending  or, to the best of NHSB's  knowledge,  threatened  and,  to the best of
NHSB's  knowledge,  there  is no  basis  for any Tax  authority  to  assess  any
additional Taxes for any period for which Tax Returns have been filed.

                  5.6.2 NHSB has withheld and paid all Taxes required to be paid
in  connection  with  amounts  paid  to any  employee,  independent  contractor,
creditor, stockholder or other third party.

                  5.6.3 All Tax Returns filed by NHSB are complete and accurate,
in all  material  respects.  NHSB is not  delinquent  in the payment of any Tax,
assessment or governmental charge, or has requested any extension of time within
which to file any Tax Returns in respect of any fiscal  year or portion  thereof
which have not since  been  filed.  Except as set forth in Section  5.6.3 of the
NHSB  Disclosure  Schedule,  the Tax  Returns of NHSB have been  examined by the
applicable tax  authorities  (or are closed to examination due to the expiration
of the  applicable  statute of  limitations)  and no  deficiencies  for any Tax,
assessment  or  governmental  charge  have been  proposed,  asserted or assessed
(tentatively  or  otherwise)  against NHSB as a result of such  examinations  or
otherwise  which  have not  been  settled  and  paid.  There  are  currently  no
agreements  in effect with  respect to NHSB to extend the period of  limitations
for the  assessment  or  collection of any Tax and no power of attorney has been
granted by NHSB with respect to any Tax matter currently in force.

                  5.6.4  Except  as set  forth  in  Section  5.6.4  of the  NHSB
Disclosure  Schedule,  NHSB  has  made  no  payments,  is  obligated  to make no
payments,  and is party  to no  agreement  that  could  obligate  it to make any
payments that will not be deductible under Section 280G of the



                                       37

Disclosure Schedule,  NHSB (i) is not a party to any agreement providing for the
allocation  or sharing of taxes,  (ii) is not  required to include in income any
adjustment  pursuant  to  Section  481(a) of the Code by  reason of a  voluntary
change in accounting  method initiated by NHSB (NHSB does not have any knowledge
that the Internal  Revenue Service has proposed any such adjustment or change of
accounting  method) or (iii) has not filed a consent  pursuant to Section 341(f)
of the Code or agreed to have Section 341(f)(2) of the Code apply.

                  5.6.6 As used in this  Agreement,  "Tax"  means  any  federal,
state, local or foreign income, gross receipts,  license,  payroll,  employment,
excise, severance, stamp, occupation,  premium, windfall profits, environmental,
customs duties, capital stock, franchise, profits, withholding,  social security
(or similar), unemployment, disability, real property, personal property, sales,

kind whatsoever,  including any interest, penalties or addition thereto, whether
disputed or not, imposed by any government or  quasi-government  authority;  and
"Tax  Return"  means any  return,  declaration,  report,  claim for  refund,  or
information  return or statement  relating to Taxes,  including  any schedule or
attachment thereto, and including any amendment thereof.

bodies that are  required in order to permit it to carry on its  business in all
material  respects  as  it is  currently  being  conducted;  all  such  permits,
licenses,  certificates of authority, orders and approvals are in full force and

knowledge of NHSB,  investigation  into the business or operations of NHSB. NHSB
has not received any objection from any regulatory  agency to NHSB's response to
any  violation,  criticism or exception  with respect to any report or statement
relating to any examination of NHSB.

that would  provide  access to or to disclose  information  where such access or
disclosure  would  violate or  prejudice  the rights or  business  interests  or

Connecticut  Bancshares  shall provide and shall request its auditors to provide
NHSB with such historical financial information regarding Connecticut Bancshares
and any  Connecticut  Bancshares  Subsidiary  (and  related  audit  reports  and
consents) as NHSB may  reasonably  request for securities  disclosure  purposes.
NHSB shall use reasonable  efforts to minimize any interference with Connecticut

operations during any such access to Connecticut  Bancshares' or any Connecticut
Bancshares  Subsidiary's  personnel,  property,  books or  records.  Connecticut
Bancshares and its Subsidiaries  shall permit NHSB, at NHSB's expense,  to cause

Bancshares  Subsidiary has the contractual  right to do so, at any Loan Property

             -----------------------
provided,  Connecticut  Bancshares shall use its reasonable best efforts in good

                                       46


<PAGE> 52


by this Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement.

         6.9  FAILURE  TO  FULFILL  CONDITIONS.  In the event  that  Connecticut
              --------------------------------
Bancshares  determines that a condition to its obligation to complete the Merger
or the  Bank  Merger  cannot  be  fulfilled  and  that it will  not  waive  that
condition, it will immediately so notify NHSB.

         6.10  ACQUISITION  PROPOSALS.  (a)  From  and  after  the  date of this
               ----------------------
Agreement and until the  termination of this Agreement,  Connecticut  Bancshares
agrees that neither it nor any of Connecticut  Bancshares'  Subsidiaries  shall,
and that it shall  direct and use its  reasonable  best efforts in good faith to
cause its and each such Subsidiary's directors,  officers, employees, agents and
representatives  not to, directly or indirectly,  initiate,  solicit,  knowingly
encourage or otherwise facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or
offer with respect to an Acquisition  Proposal.  Connecticut  Bancshares further
agrees  that  neither it nor any of its  Subsidiaries  shall,  and that it shall
direct and use its  reasonable  best efforts in good faith to cause its and each
such Subsidiary's directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives not
to, directly or indirectly,  engage in any negotiations  concerning,  or provide
any  confidential  information  or data to, or have any  discussions  with,  any
Person relating to an Acquisition  Proposal,  or otherwise knowingly  facilitate
any effort or attempt to make or implement an  Acquisition  Proposal;  provided,
however,  that nothing  contained in this  Agreement  shall prevent  Connecticut
Bancshares  or its Board of Directors  from (A)  complying  with its  disclosure
obligations under federal or state law; (B) providing information in response to
a request  therefore by a Person who has made an  unsolicited  bona fide written
Acquisition  Proposal if the Connecticut  Bancshares Board of Directors receives
from the Person so  requesting  such  information  an  executed  confidentiality
agreement  substantially similar to that entered into with NHSB; (C) engaging in
any negotiations or discussions with any Person who has made an unsolicited bona
fide  written  Acquisition  Proposal  or (D)  recommending  such an  Acquisition
Proposal  to the  shareholders  of  Connecticut  Bancshares,  if and only to the
extent that, in each such case referred to in clause (B), (C) or (D) above,  (i)
the Connecticut  Bancshares  Board of Directors  determines in good faith (after
consultation  with outside legal  counsel) that such action would be required in
order for its directors to comply with their  respective  fiduciary duties under
applicable  law,  and  (ii)  the  Connecticut   Bancshares  Board  of  Directors
determines in good faith (after  consultation  with its financial  advisor) that
such Acquisition  Proposal,  if accepted, is at least as reasonably likely to be
consummated,  taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of
the  proposal  and the Person  making the proposal  and, if  consummated,  would
result  in  a  transaction   more  favorable  to  the  Connecticut   Bancshares'
shareholders  from a  financial  point of view than the Merger.  An  Acquisition
Proposal  which  is  received  and  considered  by  Connecticut   Bancshares  in
compliance with this Section 6.10 and which meets the  requirements set forth in
clause  (D) of the  preceding  sentence  is herein  referred  to as a  "Superior
Proposal."  Connecticut  Bancshares  agrees that it will  immediately  cease and
cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with
any parties  conducted  heretofore  with respect to any  Acquisition  Proposals.
Connecticut  Bancshares  agrees that it will notify NHSB immediately if any such
inquiries,  proposals  or  offers  are  received  by,  any such  information  is
requested  from,  or any such  discussions  or  negotiations  are  sought  to be
initiated or continued with Connecticut Bancshares or any of its representatives
after the date  hereof,  and the  identity of the person  making  such  inquiry,
proposal or offer and the  substance  thereof and will keep NHSB informed of any
material  developments  with respect  thereto  immediately  upon


                                       47


<PAGE> 53



the occurrence thereof.

(b) In  the  event  that  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Connecticut  Bancshares
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and upon
advice from outside counsel,  that it desires to accept a Superior Proposal,  it
shall notify NHSB in writing of its intent to terminate  this Agreement in order
to enter into an acquisition  agreement with respect to, or recommend acceptance
of, the Superior  Proposal.  Such notice shall specify all of the material terms
and  conditions  of such  Superior  Proposal and identify the Person making such
Superior Proposal. NHSB shall have five Business Days to evaluate and respond to
Connecticut  Bancshares'  notice.  If NHSB  notifies  Connecticut  Bancshares in
writing prior to the  expiration of the five Business Day period  provided above
that it shall increase the Merger  Consideration  to an amount at least equal to
that  of  such  Superior  Proposal  (the  "NHSB  Proposal"),   then  Connecticut
Bancshares  shall not be permitted to enter into an  acquisition  agreement with
respect to, or permit its Board to recommend  acceptance to its shareholders of,
such  Superior  Proposal.  Such  notice by NHSB  shall  specify  the new  Merger
Consideration.  Connecticut Bancshares shall have five Business Days to evaluate
the NHSB Proposal.

(c) In the event the Superior  Proposal  involves  consideration  to Connecticut
Bancshares'  shareholders consisting of securities,  in whole or in part, a NHSB
Proposal shall be deemed to be at least equal to the Superior  Proposal,  if the
NHSB  Proposal   offers  Merger   Consideration   that  equals  or  exceeds  the
consideration  being  offered to  Connecticut  Bancshares'  shareholders  in the
Superior Proposal valuing any securities forming a part of the Superior Proposal
at its  cash  equivalent  based  upon  (a) the  average  trading  price  of such
securities  for the 10 trading days  immediately  preceding the date of the NHSB
Proposal,  or (b) the  written  valuation  of such  securities  by a  nationally
recognized investment banking firm selected if such securities are not traded on
a nationally recognized exchange or will be newly issued securities that are not
of a class  then  trading  on a  nationally  recognized  exchange.  Any  written
valuation shall be attached as an exhibit to the NHSB Proposal.

(d) In the event that the Board of Directors  Connecticut  Bancshares determines
in good faith,  upon the advice of its  financial  advisor and outside  counsel,
that  the  NHSB  Proposal  is not at  least  equal  to  the  Superior  Proposal,
Connecticut  Bancshares  can  terminate  this  Agreement  in order to execute an
acquisition  agreement  with  respect  to,  or to  allow  its  Board  to adopt a
resolution recommending  acceptance to Connecticut Bancshares'  shareholders of,
the Superior Proposal as provided in Section 11.1.10.

         6.11 BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS.  Connecticut Bancshares
              -----------------------------------------
shall provide to NHSB (a) notice of any and all regular meetings of the Board of
Directors of Connecticut Bancshares or SBM, which notice shall be no less timely
than the notice  required  to be provided to  Connecticut  Bancshares'  or SBM's
directors,  and  (b)  at  such  time  as  customarily  provided  to  Connecticut
Bancshares'  and  SBM's   directors,   copies  of  all  written   materials  (i)
accompanying any such notices, (ii) presented to the participants of any and all
such  meetings,  and  (iii)  copies  of drafts of  meeting  minutes  and  credit
memoranda  produced  with  respect  to  such  meeting  excluding,  however,  any
materials  pertaining to NHSB, the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement,
and any third party  proposal to acquire a controlling  interest in  Connecticut
Bancshares or SBM.

         6.12  RESERVES AND  MERGER-RELATED  COSTS.  On or before the  Effective
               -----------------------------------
Time, Connecticut Bancshares shall use its reasonable best efforts in good faith
to  establish  such  additional  accruals  and  reserves as may be  necessary to
conform the  accounting  reserve  practices and methods  (including  credit loss
practices and methods) of  Connecticut  Bancshares  and SBM to those of NHSB (as
such practices and methods are to be applied to  Connecticut  Bancshares and SBM
from and after the Closing Date) and NHSB's plans with respect to the conduct of
the  business  of  Connecticut  Bancshares  and SBM  following  the  Merger  and
otherwise to reflect  Merger-related  expenses and costs incurred by Connecticut
Bancshares, provided, however, that Connecticut Bancshares shall not be required
to take such action unless NHSB agrees in writing that all conditions to Closing
set forth in Article IX have been satisfied or waived  (including the expiration
of any applicable waiting periods but excluding the delivery of certificates and
other  documents to be delivered at the Closing);  prior to the delivery by NHSB
of the  writing  referred to in the  preceding  clause,  Connecticut  Bancshares
shall,  upon  NHSB's  request,   provide  NHSB  a  written  statement  that  the
representation  made in Section  4.22.1,  hereof  with  respect  to  Connecticut
Bancshares'  allowance  for  possible  loan  losses  is true as of such date or,
alternatively,  setting  forth in detail the  circumstances  that  prevent  such
representation  from being true as of such date;  and no accrual or reserve made
by Connecticut  Bancshares or any Connecticut  Bancshares Subsidiary pursuant to
this subsection,  or any litigation or regulatory  proceeding arising out of any
such accrual or reserve,  shall constitute a breach of this Agreement within the
meaning of Section  11.1.2  hereof.  No action  shall be required to be taken by
Connecticut  Bancshares  pursuant  to this  Section  6.12 if, in the  opinion of
Connecticut Bancshares' independent auditors, such action would contravene GAAP.

         6.13     TRANSACTION EXPENSES OF CONNECTICUT BANCSHARES.
                  ----------------------------------------------

                  6.13.1 For planning  purposes,  Connecticut  Bancshares shall,
within  thirty (30) days from the date  hereof,  provide  NHSB with  Connecticut
Bancshares'   estimated  budget  of   transaction-related   expenses  reasonably
anticipated  to be payable by  Connecticut  Bancshares in  connection  with this
transaction, including the fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment
bankers and other  professionals.  Connecticut  Bancshares shall promptly notify
NHSB if or when it determines that it expects to exceed its budget.

                  6.13.2   Promptly  after  the  execution  of  this  Agreement,
Connecticut Bancshares shall ask all of its attorneys and other professionals to
render  current and correct  invoices for all unbilled  time and  disbursements.
Connecticut  Bancshares  shall  accrue  and/or pay all of such  amounts that are
actually due and owing as soon as possible.

                  6.13.3 Connecticut Bancshares shall advise NHSB monthly of all
out-of-pocket  expenses that  Connecticut  Bancshares has incurred in connection
with  the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement  (including  the  Bank
Merger).

         7.1  DISCLOSURE  SUPPLEMENTS.  From time to time prior to the Effective
              -----------------------
Time,  NHSB  will  promptly  supplement  or amend the NHSB  Disclosure  Schedule
delivered in connection  herewith with respect to any material matter  hereafter
arising which,  if existing,  occurring or known at the date of this  Agreement,
would have been  required to be set forth or described  in such NHSB  Disclosure
Schedule  or  which  is  necessary  to  correct  any  information  in such  NHSB
Disclosure Schedule which has been rendered inaccurate thereby. No supplement or
amendment to such NHSB Disclosure Schedule shall have any effect for the purpose
of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX.

         7.2  CONSENTS  AND  APPROVALS  OF THIRD  PARTIES.  NHSB  shall  use all
              -------------------------------------------
reasonable  best  efforts  in good  faith to obtain as soon as  practicable  all
consents  and  approvals  of  any  other  Persons,  including  the  Corporators,
necessary or desirable for the consummation of the transactions  contemplated by
this Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement, including the Conversion.

         7.3 REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS. Subject to the terms and conditions herein
             -----------------------
provided,  NHSB agrees to use its reasonable best efforts in good faith to take,

necessary,  proper  or  advisable  under  applicable  laws  and  regulations  to
consummate and make effective the  transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement
and the Bank Merger Agreement,  including the Conversion. It is NHSB's intention
that the Closing shall occur as soon as practicable  following the  consummation
of the Conversion.

         7.4 FAILURE TO FULFILL  CONDITIONS.  In the event that NHSB  determines
             ------------------------------
that a condition  to its  obligation  to complete  the Merger or the Bank Merger
Agreement cannot be fulfilled and that it will not waive that condition, it will
immediately so notify Connecticut Bancshares.

         7.5  NEWCO  ORGANIZATIONAL  DOCUMENTS.  Prior  to  the  filing  of  the
              --------------------------------

and in good standing or legal existence,  as appropriate,  under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized with full corporate power and authority to
own or lease all of its  properties  and assets and to carry on its  business as
then  conducted and shall be duly licensed or qualified to do business and be in
good standing or legal existence, as appropriate,  in each jurisdiction in which
its  ownership  or leasing of property or the conduct of its  business  requires
such licensing or qualification.  Promptly  following the organization of NEWCO,
the Board of Directors thereof shall approve this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated  hereby,  and NHSB  shall  cause  NEWCO to execute  and  deliver an
appropriate  instrument of accession to this  Agreement,  whereupon  NEWCO shall
become a party to, and be bound by, this Agreement. On the Effective Date, NEWCO
will be a bank holding company under the BHCA.

         7.6      EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.
                  -------------------------------

                  7.6.1  NHSB  anticipates  employing  substantially  all branch
office customer service employees of SBM and such other employees of SBM as NHSB
shall  reasonably  require  for the  conduct of NHSB's  business  following  the
Effective Time. NHSB may, after  consultation with SBM, pay a retention bonus to
certain  key  employees  in an  amount  to be  determined  by NHSB  in its  sole
discretion,  in the event such  employee  remains  in the employ of  Connecticut
Bancshares or SBM through the Effective Time and is an employee of NHSB or NEWCO
for a period of time to be  negotiated  between NHSB and each such key employee.
Each SBM employee whose  employment is terminated at the Effective Time shall be
eligible to receive COBRA health care continuation benefits as required by law.

                  7.6.2 Each  employee of SBM who  remains  employed by NEWCO or
NHSB  following the Effective  Time (each,  a  "Continuing  Employee")  shall be
entitled to  participate  in (i) such of the employee  benefit  plans,  deferred
compensation  arrangements,  bonus or incentive plans and other compensation and
benefit  plans that NEWCO or NHSB may  continue  for the  benefit of  Continuing
Employees  following the Effective Time and (ii) whatever employee benefit plans
and other  compensation  and benefit plans that NEWCO or a NEWCO  Subsidiary may
maintain  for the benefit of its  similarly  situated  employees on an equitably
equivalent   basis,   if  such   Continuing   Employee  is  not  otherwise  then
participating in a similar plan. The parties hereto  acknowledge that Continuing
Employees  shall be eligible to participate in any stock option plan or employee
stock  ownership  plan  implemented by NEWCO after the Effective Time based upon
the same  criteria as other  employees  of NHSB or NEWCO.  Continuing  Employees
shall be eligible to receive credit for service with Connecticut  Bancshares and
the Connecticut  Bancshares  Subsidiaries under any existing NHSB employee plan,
NHSB  benefit plan or NHSB  personnel  policy in which such  employees  would be
eligible to enroll or  participate  for purposes of  determining  eligibility to
participate  and vesting  therein but not for purposes of  calculating  benefits
thereunder;  provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized to the
extent that such  recognition  would result in a duplication  of benefits.  Each
Continuing  Employee  shall be  credited  with  service as an SBM  employee  for
purposes of  determining  their  status under  NHSB's  policies  with respect to
vacation, sick and other leave. With respect to the NHSB defined benefit pension
plan, each Continuing Employee shall be credited with service as an SBM employee
for  purposes of  determining  eligibility  under the early  retirement,  normal
retirement and disability provisions of such plan. With respect to any NHSB plan
which is a health,  life or disability  insurance plan, each Continuing Employee
shall not be subject to any  pre-existing  condition  limitation  for conditions
covered  under  such plans and each such plan which  provides  health  insurance
benefits shall honor any deductible and  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred under
any comparable SBM plan for the year in which the Effective Time occurs. Nothing
herein shall limit the ability of NHSB or NEWCO to amend or terminate any of the
Connecticut  Bancshares  Employee  Plans in  accordance  with their terms at any
time. NHSB shall consult with Connecticut Bancshares prior to the Effective Time
as to the  advisability of outplacement  assistance for any Continuing  Employee
whose  employment is terminated  within six months of the  Effective  Date.  The
structure of such  assistance  will be in the sole discretion of NHSB, at a cost
not to exceed $30,000.

                  7.6.3 Section 7.6.3 of the Connecticut  Bancshares  Disclosure
Schedule  contains all employment  and change of control,  severance and similar
agreements,  arrangements, policies or programs with any employee or director of
Connecticut  Bancshares  or  any  Connecticut  Bancshares  Subsidiary  ("Benefit
Agreements").  At and following the Effective  Time, NHSB and NEWCO shall honor,
and the  Surviving  Corporation  shall  continue to be obligated to perform,  in
accordance with their terms, all benefit  obligations of Connecticut  Bancshares
existing as of the Effective Time under the Benefit  Agreements other than those
employment  agreements,  change in control agreements and supplemental executive
retirement plans covered by the Termination and Release Agreements referenced in
Section 7.6.5 hereof.  NHSB acknowledges (i) that the consummation of the Merger
will constitute a "change-in-control"  of Connecticut Bancshares for purposes of
any of the Benefit Agreements of Connecticut  Bancshares (except where otherwise
set forth in Section 7.6.3 of the Connecticut  Bancshares  Disclosure Schedule).
Any employee of Connecticut Bancshares or any of its Subsidiaries who is a party
to  an  agreement  (excluding  the  employment  agreements,  change  in  control
agreements and supplemental retirement agreements covered by the Termination and
Release Agreements  referenced in Section 7.6.5 hereof) which has been set forth
in  Section  7.6.3  of  the  Connecticut  Bancshares  Disclosure  Schedule  (the
"Executive  Agreements")  who becomes  entitled to benefits  thereunder shall be
entitled to receive the cash and other  benefits  payable or provided under such
agreement; provided, however, that the employee executes and delivers to NHSB an
instrument in form and substance  satisfactory  to NHSB  releasing  NHSB and its
affiliates  from  any  further   liability  for  monetary  payments  under  such
agreement.  Connecticut  Bancshares represents and warrants that the amounts set
forth in Section 7.6.3 of the  Connecticut  Bancshares  Disclosure  Schedule (A)
have  been  calculated  in a manner  consistent  with,  and  according  to,  the
provisions of the Executive  Agreements  (copies of which have been furnished by
Connecticut  Bancshares to NHSB) and (B) represent  good faith  estimates of the
amounts payable as of the future date specified  therein based upon  assumptions
regarding  interest rates,  compensation or the assumed Closing Date, which have
been  set  forth  in  Section  7.6.3 of the  Connecticut  Bancshares  Disclosure
Schedule,  and (ii) the amounts payable under such Executive Agreements will not
exceed, individually or in the aggregate, the amounts set forth in Section 7.6.3
of the Connecticut Bancshares Disclosure Schedule (except to the extent that any
good faith  estimates  set forth in Section  7.6.3 of  Connecticut  Bancshares's
Disclosure  Schedule  change  due to changes in  interest  rates or the  assumed
Closing Date).  To the extent that an employee of Connecticut  Bancshares or any
of its  Subsidiaries is entitled to the continued  receipt of health  insurance,
life  insurance,  disability  insurance,  automobile  allowance or other similar
fringe benefits pursuant to an Executive Agreement,  and such employee becomes a
director,  officer,  employee or consultant of NEWCO or any of its  Subsidiaries
following the  Effective  Time and as a result  becomes  entitled to receive the
same fringe benefits in his or her capacity as a director,  officer, employee or
consultant  of  NEWCO  or any of its  Subsidiaries,  then  the  fringe  benefits
provided to such person shall be deemed to be provided in  connection  with such
person's service as a director,  officer, employee or consultant of NEWCO or any
of its Subsidiaries for so long as such person serves in such capacity and shall
be in lieu  of,  and not in  addition  to (and  for the  sole  purpose  to avoid
duplication  of benefits),  the same fringe  benefits that would have  otherwise
been provided pursuant to the Executive Agreement.

                  7.6.4 The ESOP shall be terminated  as of the  Effective  Time
(all  shares held by the ESOP shall be  converted  into the right to receive the
Merger  Consideration),  all outstanding ESOP indebtedness shall be repaid as of
the Effective Time, and the balance remaining with respect to unallocated shares
held by the ESOP prior to the Effective Time shall be allocated and  distributed
to the ESOP participants  (subject to the receipt of a determination letter from
the  IRS),  as  provided  for in the  ESOP  and  unless  otherwise  required  by
applicable  law.  As soon as  practicable  after  the date  hereof,  Connecticut
Bancshares  shall  file a  request  for a  determination  letter  from  the  IRS
regarding the continued qualified status of the ESOP upon its termination. Prior
to the Effective Time, Connecticut Bancshares and, following the Effective Time,
NHSB shall use their respective  reasonable best efforts in good faith to obtain
such favorable determination letter (including,  but not limited to, making such
changes  to the ESOP and the  proposed  allocations  described  herein as may be
requested by the IRS as a condition to its issuance of a favorable determination
letter). NHSB and NEWCO will adopt such additional amendments to the ESOP as may
be  reasonably  required  by the  IRS  subsequent  to the  Effective  Time  as a
condition to granting  such  favorable  determination  and  termination  letters
provided that such  amendments do not  substantially  change the terms  outlined
herein or would  result in an  additional  material  liability to NHSB or NEWCO.
Neither  Connecticut  Bancshares nor NHSB shall make any  distribution  from the
ESOP except as may be required by applicable law until receipt of such favorable
determination letter.

                  7.6.5 Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement by the
parties  hereto,  (i) each of Richard P.  Meduski,  Charles L. Pike,  Douglas K.
Anderson,  Roger A. Sommerville and SBM,  Connecticut  Bancshares and NHSB shall
enter into a  Termination  and Release  Agreement  substantially  in the form of
Exhibit D-1 hereto, (ii) each of Nancy A. Elliott,  Harry S. Gaucher,  III, John
H.  Hamby,  Michael  J.  Hartl,  Dale B.  Lynch,  Christopher  Martin,  Patricia
McLaughlin,  Brian A.  Orenstein,  John F. Smith,  William T.  Thomas,  Joyce R.
Trainer,  Carol L. Yungk and SBM,  Connecticut  Bancshares  and NHSB shall enter
into a Termination and Release  Agreement  substantially  in the form of Exhibit
D-2, and (iii) each of Richard P. Meduski, Charles L. Pike, Douglas K. Anderson,
Roger A. Sommerville shall enter into a Noncompetition  Agreement  substantially
in the form of Exhibit E hereto.

         7.7      DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE.
                  ----------------------------------------------------

                  7.7.1  NHSB  shall  maintain,  and/or  shall  cause  NEWCO  to
maintain,  in effect for six (6) years following the Effective Time, the current
directors' and officers'  liability insurance policies maintained by Connecticut
Bancshares and the Connecticut Bancshares Subsidiaries (provided,  that NHSB may
substitute  therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and
conditions  which are not  materially  less  favorable)  with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall
NHSB be required to expend in the aggregate  pursuant to this Section 7.7.1 more
than 150% of the annual cost currently  expended by Connecticut  Bancshares with
respect  to such  insurance.  In  connection  with  the  foregoing,  Connecticut
Bancshares  agrees to provide  such  insurer  or  substitute  insurer  with such
representations as such insurer may request with respect to the reporting of any
prior claims.

<PAGE> 59


                  7.7.2 From and after the Effective  Time,  NHSB shall,  and/or
shall cause NEWCO or the appropriate NEWCO Subsidiary to, indemnify,  defend and
hold  harmless  each  person who is now,  or who has been at any time before the
date hereof or who becomes  before the Effective  Time, an officer,  director or
employee of Connecticut  Bancshares or SBM (the  "Indemnified  Parties") against
all losses,  claims,  damages,  costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney's
fees),  liabilities  or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement  (which
settlement shall require the prior written consent of NEWCO, which consent shall
not be unreasonably  withheld) of or in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding  or  investigation,   whether  civil,   criminal,   investigative  or
administrative  (each a  "Claim"),  in  which an  Indemnified  Party  is,  or is
threatened  to be made,  a party or witness in whole or in part on or arising in
whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director,  officer
or employee of Connecticut  Bancshares or a Connecticut Bancshares Subsidiary if
such Claim  pertains to any matter of fact arising,  existing or occurring at or
before the Effective Time  (including,  without  limitation,  the Merger and the
other  transactions  contemplated  hereby),  regardless of whether such Claim is
asserted or claimed  before,  or after,  the  Effective  Time (the  "Indemnified
Liabilities"), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable state or federal
law and under Connecticut  Bancshares'  Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.
NEWCO shall pay expenses in advance of the final  disposition of any such action
or  proceeding  to each  Indemnified  Party  to the  full  extent  permitted  by
applicable  state or federal law upon  receipt of an  undertaking  to repay such
advance  payments  if he or she shall be  adjudicated  or  determined  not to be
entitled to indemnification in the manner set forth below. Any Indemnified Party
wishing to claim  indemnification  under this Section 7.7.2 upon learning of any
Claim,  shall notify NEWCO (but the failure so to notify NEWCO shall not relieve
it from any liability which it may have under this Section 7.7.2,  except to the
extent such failure prejudices NEWCO) and shall deliver to NEWCO the undertaking
referred to in the previous  sentence.  In the event of any such Claim  (whether
arising  before or after the  Effective  Time) (1) NEWCO shall have the right to
assume  the  defense  thereof  (in which  event  the  Indemnified  Parties  will
cooperate  in the  defense of any such  matter) and upon such  assumption  NEWCO
shall not be liable to any  Indemnified  Party for any legal  expenses  of other
counsel or any other expenses  subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense  thereof,  except that if NEWCO elects not to assume
such defense,  or counsel for the  Indemnified  Parties  reasonably  advises the
Indemnified  Parties  that  there  are or may be  (whether  or not any  have yet
actually  arisen) issues which raise conflicts of interest between NEWCO and the
Indemnified  Parties,  the  Indemnified  Parties may retain  counsel  reasonably
satisfactory  to them, and NEWCO shall pay the  reasonable  fees and expenses of
such counsel for the Indemnified  Parties, (2) NEWCO shall be obligated pursuant
to this  paragraph  to pay for only one (1) firm of counsel for all  Indemnified
Parties whose  reasonable fees and expenses shall be paid promptly as statements
are received unless there is a conflict of interest that  necessitates more than
one (1) law firm,  (3) NEWCO  shall not be liable  for any  settlement  effected
without its prior  written  consent  (which  consent  shall not be  unreasonably
withheld),  and (4) no  Indemnified  Party shall be entitled to  indemnification
hereunder  with  respect  to a  matter  as to  which  (x)  he  shall  have  been
adjudicated in any proceeding not to have acted in good faith and in a manner he
reasonably  believed  to be  in,  or not  opposed  to,  the  best  interests  of
Connecticut Bancshares or any Connecticut  Bancshares Subsidiary,  or (y) in the
event that a proceeding is  compromised or settled so as to impose any liability
or obligation upon an Indemnified  Party, if there is a determination  that with
respect to said matter said Indemnified Party did not act in good faith and in a
manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to,


                                       54


<PAGE> 60


the best  interests of  Connecticut  Bancshares  or any  Connecticut  Bancshares
Subsidiary.  The  determination  shall  be made by a  majority  vote of a quorum
consisting of the Directors of NEWCO who are not involved in such proceeding.

                  7.7.3 If NHSB,  NEWCO or any of their  successors  or  assigns
shall  consolidate  with or merge  into any  other  entity  and shall not be the
continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer
all or substantially  all of its assets to any other entity,  then in each case,
proper  provision  shall be made so that the  successors and assigns of NHSB and
NEWCO shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.7.

                  7.7.4 NHSB  shall  honor  and/or  shall  cause  NEWCO to honor
Connecticut  Bancshares'  "Directors'  Consultation Plan" as it exists as of the
date hereof.

         7.8 CONNECTICUT  BANCSHARES MAIN OFFICE.  NHSB shall occupy, or cause a
             -----------------------------------
third party to occupy,  the Connecticut  Bancshares main office building located
at 923 Main Street,  Manchester,  Connecticut  06045 for a period of twenty-four
(24) months after the Effective Date.

         7.9  CHARITABLE  FOUNDATION.  NHSB  acknowledges  and  agrees  that SBM
              ----------------------
Charitable   Foundation,   Inc.,  the  charitable   foundation  affiliated  with
Connecticut Bancshares, is in existence and will continue to be operated for the
benefit of Connecticut Bancshares' community,  notwithstanding that it is NHSB's
intention  that The New Haven  Savings Bank  Foundation,  Inc.,  the  charitable
foundation  affiliated  with  NHSB  and/or  a new  charitable  foundation  to be
established in connection  with the  Conversion,  may at some time subsequent to
the  Effective  Date,  service  each  of  Connecticut   Bancshares'  and  NHSB's
respective communities.

         7.10 DIRECTORSHIPS. On or prior to the Effective Time, each of NHSB and

by  Connecticut  Bancshares in order to  concurrently  enter into an acquisition
agreement or similar  agreement (each, an "Acquisition  Agreement") with respect
to a Superior  Proposal  which has been received and  considered by  Connecticut
Bancshares and the Connecticut  Bancshares Board of Directors in compliance with
Section 6.10 hereof, provided, however, that this Agreement may be terminated by
Connecticut  Bancshares  pursuant to this  Section  11.1.11 only after the fifth

during such  five-Business  Day period,  NHSB does not, in its sole  discretion,
make an offer to Connecticut  Bancshares that the Connecticut  Bancshares' Board
of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial and
legal advisors, is at least as favorable as the Superior Proposal.

         For purposes of this Section  11.1,  termination  of this  Agreement by
NHSB shall be deemed to constitute a termination on behalf of NEWCO.

         11.2     EFFECT OF TERMINATION.

have no further force,  except that (i) the  provisions of Sections 11.1,  11.3,
12.1,  12.2, 12.6,  12.9,  12.10,  this Section 11.2, and (ii) any other Section

                                 pursuant to Section 11.1.5(a),  and in the case
                                 of any  termination  pursuant  to clause (A) or

                                 Connecticut   Bancshares  or  the   Connecticut
                                 Bancshares  Board of  Directors  (or any Person
                                 shall have publicly announced,  communicated or
                                 made  known  an   intention,   whether  or  not
                                 conditional,  to make an Acquisition  Proposal)
                                 at any time  after  the date of this  Agreement
                                 and  prior  to the  taking  of the  vote of the
                                 shareholders    of    Connecticut    Bancshares
                                 contemplated   by   this   Agreement   at   the
                                 Connecticut  Bancshares Shareholder Meeting, in

                  In the event the Connecticut  Bancshares Termination Fee shall

shall pay to NHSB an amount  equal to Ten Million  Dollars  ($10,000,000)  on or
before the third Business Day following  termination of this Agreement,  and (y)
if  within  18  months  after  such  termination  Connecticut  Bancshares  or  a
Connecticut  Bancshares Subsidiary enters into any agreement with respect to, or
consummates,  any Acquisition  Transaction,  Connecticut Bancshares shall pay to
NHSB  the  Connecticut  Bancshares  Termination  Fee  (net of any  payment  made
pursuant  to clause (x) above) on the date of  execution  of such  agreement  or
consummation  of the  Acquisition  Transaction.  In the  event  the  Connecticut
Bancshares Termination Fee shall become payable pursuant to Section 11.2.2(iii),

this Agreement.  Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to this Section 11.2.2
shall be paid by wire  transfer  of  immediately  available  funds to an account
designated by NHSB.

                  11.2.3  In  the  event  of a  termination  of  this  Agreement
pursuant to Section 11.1.2 or 11.1.3 hereof  resulting from the willful  conduct
or gross  negligence of a party,  such party shall be obligated to reimburse the
other party for up to Two Million Dollars  ($2,000,000) of  out-of-pocket  costs
and expenses,  including,  without limitation,  reasonable legal, accounting and
investment banking fees and expenses, incurred by such other party in connection
with the  entering  into of this  Agreement  and the carrying out of any and all
acts contemplated  hereunder  (collectively referred to as "Costs"). The payment
of Costs is not an exclusive  remedy,  but is in addition to any other rights or
remedies  available  to  the  parties  hereto  at  law  or  in  equity  or as is
contemplated  herein.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary herein,  if (i)
Connecticut  Bancshares makes the payment contemplated in Section 11.2.2 of this
Agreement or (ii) if NHSB makes the payment contemplated in Section 11.3 of this
Agreement,  such party shall not have any further  liability  to the other party
(or its Subsidiaries), whether for Costs, breach or otherwise.

                  11.2.4 Except as provided in Sections 11.2.2, 11.2.3 and 11.3,
whether or not the Merger is consummated,  all Costs incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the  transactions  contemplated  hereby shall be borne by the
party incurring such Costs.

                  11.2.5 In no event  shall any  officer,  agent or  director of
Connecticut Bancshares, any Connecticut Bancshares Subsidiary,  NHSB or any NHSB
Subsidiary,  be personally liable thereunder for any default by any party in any
of its obligations hereunder unless any such default was intentionally caused by
such officer, agent or director.

         11.3     NHSB SPECIAL PAYMENT.
                  --------------------

                  11.3.1 NHSB Special  Payment.  As a condition  of  Connecticut
                         ---------------------
Bancshares'  willingness to, and in order to induce  Connecticut  Bancshares to,
enter into this Agreement, and to reimburse Connecticut Bancshares for incurring
the damages,  costs and expenses  related to entering  into this  Agreement  and
consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, NHSB hereby agrees
to pay to Connecticut Bancshares, as liquidated damages and


                                       66


<PAGE> 72


in lieu of any other rights or remedies under this Agreement,  a cash payment in
the amount of Thirty Million Dollars  ($30,000,000) (the "Special Payment") only
if (i) the Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11.1.5(b) or 11.1.5(c) of
this Agreement,  or (ii) the Agreement is terminated  pursuant to Section 11.1.6
or 11.1.7,  or (iii) NHSB  otherwise  does not consummate the Merger by no later
than the  Termination  Date or such later date agreed as contemplated in Section
11.1.4(b),  or (iv)  Connecticut  Bancshares  has  terminated  this Agreement in
accordance with Section 11.1.2 or Section 11.1.3 because NHSB has  intentionally
and  willfully  breached  any of its  representations  or  warranties  herein or
intentionally  and  willfully  failed  to  perform  or  comply  with  any of its
covenants or  agreements  herein,  to such extent as to permit such  termination
(each of such  reasons  for  termination  being  hereinafter  referred to as the
"Special  Payment  Event").  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  NHSB shall have no
obligation to make the Special Payment to Connecticut  Bancshares if the Special
Payment  Event is primarily due to a breach of a  representation  or warranty of
Connecticut  Bancshares  (subject to the standard set forth in Section  9.2.1 of
this  Agreement) or a breach by Connecticut  Bancshares of one or more covenants
in this  Agreement  (subject to the standard set forth in Section  9.2.2 of this
Agreement),  which  breach  of  representation,  warranty  or  covenant  is  the
principal cause of the occurrence of the Special Payment Event.

                  11.3.2  Payments  Required.  Any  payment  required to be made
                          ------------------
under this Section 11.3 shall be paid by NHSB to Connecticut  Bancshares by wire
transfer of immediately  available funds to an account designated by Connecticut
Bancshares   within  three  (3)  Business  Days  after  demand  by   Connecticut
Bancshares.

                  11.3.3 Exclusivity of Remedy.  Notwithstanding anything to the
                         ---------------------
contrary  set  forth in this  Agreement,  if NHSB  pays or  causes to be paid to
Connecticut  Bancshares  the  Special  Payment,  NHSB will not have any  further
obligations or liabilities to Connecticut Bancshares or SBM with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                  11.3.4 Return of Portion of NHSB Special Payment. In the event
                         -----------------------------------------
NHSB pays the Special Payment to Connecticut Bancshares and prior to the earlier
of (a)  October  15,  2006  or (b) two  years  after  demand  for  payment  from
Connecticut Bancshares pursuant to Section 11.3.2 of this Agreement, Connecticut
Bancshares or a Connecticut Bancshares Subsidiary consummates any acquisition or
merger transaction pursuant to which the shareholders of Connecticut  Bancshares
are entitled to receive per share merger  consideration in excess of $51.60 (the
"Benchmark  Price"),  Connecticut  Bancshares  shall pay to NHSB Fifteen Million
Dollars ($15,000,000).  The Benchmark Price shall be adjusted for any subsequent
stock dividends or splits by Connecticut  Bancshares.  The Benchmark Price shall
be determined on the date of closing of such acquisition or merger  transaction.
If the  consideration  in such  transaction  includes  or  consists of shares of
capital  stock of  another  entity,  the value of such  shares  shall  equal the
average of the last sales prices for such shares on the five trading days ending
on the day  prior to the  consummation  of such  transaction.  Any  amount  that
becomes  payable  pursuant to this Section 11.3.4 shall be paid by wire transfer
of immediately  available  funds to an account  designed by NHSB within ten (10)
Business Days of the closing of such acquisition or merger transaction.

their respective Boards of Directors,  may (a) amend this Agreement,  (b) extend

consideration to be delivered to Connecticut Bancshares'  shareholders or Option
holders pursuant to this Agreement.  This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument  in writing  signed on behalf of each of the parties  hereto.  Any
agreement  on the part of a party  hereto to any  extension  or waiver  shall be
valid only if set forth in an  instrument  in  writing  signed on behalf of such
party,  but such  waiver or  failure  to insist on strict  compliance  with such
obligation,  covenant,  agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

___________, 2003

New Haven Savings Bank
195 Church Street
New Haven, Connecticut 06510

Ladies and Gentlemen:

The  undersigned is a director of  Connecticut  Bancshares,  Inc.  ("CONNECTICUT
BANCSHARES")  and  is the  beneficial  holder  of  shares  of  common  stock  of
Connecticut Bancshares ("CONNECTICUT BANCSHARES COMMON STOCK").

Connecticut  Bancshares and New Haven Savings Bank ("NHSB") are  considering the
execution of an Agreement  and Plan of Merger  ("AGREEMENT")  contemplating  the
merger of Connecticut Bancshares with and into a holding company to be formed by
NHSB  (referred to as "NEWCO"),  with NEWCO as the surviving  corporation of the
merger (the "MERGER"), and the merger of The Savings Bank of Manchester with and
into NHSB,  with NHSB as the surviving  corporation  (the "BANK  MERGER"),  such
execution  being  subject in the case of NHSB to the  execution  and delivery of
this letter agreement ("LETTER AGREEMENT").  In consideration of the substantial
expenses that NHSB will incur in connection with the  transactions  contemplated
by the  Agreement  and in order to induce NHSB to execute the  Agreement  and to
proceed to incur such expenses, the undersigned agrees and undertakes, in his or
her capacity as a shareholder  of  Connecticut  Bancshares and not in his or her
capacity as a director of Connecticut Bancshares as follows:

1. The  undersigned,  while this Letter  Agreement  is in effect,  shall vote or
cause to be voted IN FAVOR OF the  Agreement and the Merger all of the shares of
Connecticut Bancshares Common Stock that the undersigned shall be entitled to so
vote,  whether such shares are beneficially owned by the undersigned on the date
of this Letter Agreement or are subsequently  acquired,  whether pursuant to the
exercise of stock options or otherwise  (the "SUBJECT  SHARES"),  at the special
meeting of Connecticut Bancshares'  shareholders to be called and held following
the date hereof, to consider the Agreement,  the Merger and the Bank Merger (the
"SPECIAL  MEETING").  The  undersigned  shall  not  sell,  pledge,  transfer  or
otherwise  dispose  of  any  Subject  Shares,  except  as  contemplated  in  any
Termination and Release Agreement executed in connection with


                                       C-1

<PAGE> 87


the  Agreement.  The Subject  Shares owned by the  undersigned as of the date of
this Letter Agreement are identified on Annex I.

2.  At the  Special  Meeting  or at any  adjournment  thereof,  or in any  other
circumstances in which the undersigned is entitled to vote,  consent or give any
other approval, except as otherwise agreed to in writing in advance by NHSB, the
undersigned  shall  vote or cause to be voted the  Subject  Shares  AGAINST  the
following actions:

                  (i) any action or  agreement  that would result in a breach in
any material  respect of any covenant,  representation  or warranty or any other
obligation or agreement of Connecticut  Bancshares or SBM under the Agreement or
of the undersigned hereunder; or

                  (ii) any action or agreement that could reasonably be expected
to impede,  interfere with, delay,  postpone or attempt to discourage the Merger
or the  Bank  Merger,  including,  but  not  limited  to:  (A) the  adoption  by
Connecticut  Bancshares  of any  proposal  or offer  with  respect to any of the
following (other than the transactions  contemplated by the Agreement) involving
Connecticut  Bancshares  or any  Connecticut  Bancshares  Subsidiaries:  (i) any
merger,  consolidation,  share exchange,  business  combination or other similar
transaction; (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other
disposition of 25% or more of its consolidated assets in a single transaction or
series of  transactions;  or (iii) any tender offer or exchange offer for 25% or
more  of the  outstanding  shares  of its  capital  stock  or  the  filing  of a
registration statement under the Securities Act in connection therewith;  or (B)
after the  Agreement  and  Merger  have been  approved  by the  shareholders  of
Connecticut  Bancshares,  any action to abandon the  Agreement  and Merger.  The
undersigned   further  agrees  not  to  commit  or  agree  to  take  any  action
inconsistent with the foregoing agreements.

3. The undersigned  acknowledges and agrees that any remedy at law for breach of
the foregoing  provisions shall be inadequate and that, in addition to any other
relief which may be available, NHSB shall be entitled to temporary and permanent
injunctive relief without the necessity of proving actual damages.

4. The  foregoing  restrictions  shall not apply to shares with respect to which
the  undersigned  may have voting power as a fiduciary for others.  In addition,
this Letter  Agreement  shall only apply to actions taken by the  undersigned in
his or her capacity as a shareholder of Connecticut  Bancshares and shall not in
any way limit or affect actions the  undersigned may take in his or her capacity
as a director of Connecticut Bancshares.

5. This Letter Agreement shall  automatically  terminate if the Agreement is not
entered  into by the parties  thereto or upon the  earlier of (i) the  Effective
Time or (ii) the termination of the Agreement in accordance with its terms.

6. This Letter  Agreement may be executed in one or more  counterparts,  each of
which  shall  be  deemed  to be an  original  but all of  which  together  shall
constitute one and the same document.

as of the date first above written.


                                    Very truly yours,

                                    --------

         WHEREAS, New Haven,  Connecticut Bancshares and Manchester have entered

         WHEREAS, Section 7.6.5 of the Merger Agreement provides that New Haven,

         1. CERTAIN ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN OR NOT TAKEN IN 2003.
            ------------------------------------------------

         (a) The Executive  hereby agrees to take the following  actions between
the date hereof and  December 31,  2003,  it being the  intention of the parties
hereto that all of such actions  shall be fully  effective  and  consummated  no
later than December 31, 2003:

         (i)  exercise all vested  non-qualified  stock  options  granted to the
Executive under  Connecticut  Bancshares' 2000  Stock-Based  Incentive Plan (the
"Incentive Plan"), including non-qualified stock options scheduled to vest prior
to December 31, 2003;

        (ii) both (A)  exercise  all  vested  incentive  stock  options  granted
to the Executive  under the Incentive Plan  (including  incentive  stock options
scheduled  to vest  prior to  December  31,  2003) and (B)  effect a sale of the
shares of Connecticut  Bancshares' common stock acquired upon such exercise in a
manner that will  constitute a  "disqualifying  disposition"  of such shares for
purposes of Section 421(b) of the Code; and

         (iii)  refrain  from  exercising  any  stock  options  granted  to  the
Executive  under  Connecticut  Bancshares'  2002 Equity  Compensation  Plan (the
"Compensation Plan").

         (b) Connecticut Bancshares and Manchester agree to take such actions as
may be necessary  or advisable by them in order to permit the  Executive to take
the actions set forth in Section 1(a) above and have them be fully effective and
consummated  no later than  December  31,  2003,  including  without  limitation
promptly  processing  all exercises of stock options by the Executive  under the
Incentive  Plan.  Neither  Connecticut   Bancshares  nor  Manchester  shall  (i)
accelerated the vesting of any unvested  restricted  stock awards granted to the
Executive under the Incentive Plan or the Compensation  Plan, or (ii) accelerate
payment  of any cash bonus to which the  Executive  may be  entitled  to receive
pursuant to Manchester's Bonus Plan for services rendered in 2003.

         2. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF PAYMENT, RELEASE AND WAIVER.
            ----------------------------------------------

         (a) On the  Effective  Date of the Merger,  provided  the  Executive is
still employed by Manchester immediately prior to such date and has taken all of
the actions set forth in Section  1(a)  hereof,  Connecticut  Bancshares  and/or
Manchester   shall   pay   to   the   Executive   an   amount   equal   to   (i)
__________________dollars  ($______),  subject  to  adjustment  as set  forth in
Section 2(b) below (the "Maximum Amount"),  minus (ii) the Initial Present Value
Amount (as defined in Section 3(c) below) of the welfare benefits to be provided
to the Executive  pursuant to Section 3(a) below,  with  applicable  withholding
taxes  to  be  subtracted   from  the  amount  payable  to  the  Executive.   In
consideration  of such payment and the other  provisions of this Agreement,  the
Executive,  Connecticut Bancshares,  Manchester and New Haven hereby agree that,
except as  provided  in  Section 4 below,  the Bank  Employment  Agreement,  the
Company Employment




                                      D1-2



<PAGE> 91



Agreement,  the SERP and the Supplemental  Agreement shall be terminated without
any further action of any parties  hereto,  effective  immediately  prior to the
Effective Date of the Merger.

         (b) If the payment  pursuant to Section  2(a)  hereof,  either alone or
together with other  payments and benefits  which the Executive has the right to
receive from  Connecticut  Bancshares,  Manchester  or New Haven (but  excluding
amounts  payable  pursuant to the  Noncompetition  Agreement  of even date being
entered into between New Haven and the Executive), would constitute a "parachute
payment"  under  Section 280G of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986,  as amended
(the "Code"),  including but not limited to the  parachute  payments  associated
with the accelerated  vesting of stock options and restricted stock awards, then
the amount  payable by  Connecticut  Bancshares  and/or  Manchester  pursuant to
Section  2(a)  hereof  shall be  reduced  by the  amount  which  is the  minimum
necessary  to  result  in no  portion  of the  payment  payable  by  Connecticut
Bancshares  and/or  Manchester  under  Section  2(a)  being   non-deductible  to
Connecticut Bancshares and/or Manchester (or any successors thereto) pursuant to
Section  280G of the Code and  subject to the excise tax imposed  under  Section
4999 of the  Code.  The  parties  hereto  agree  that the  present  value of the
payments and benefits  payable  pursuant to this Agreement to the Executive upon
termination  of the  Executive's  employment  pursuant to Section 2(a) shall not
exceed  three times the  Executive's  "base  amount," as that term is defined in
Section  280G(b)(3)  of the Code,  less one  dollar.  The  determination  of any
reduction in the payment to be made pursuant to Section 2(a) shall be based upon
an analysis prepared by Elias, Matz, Tiernan & Herrick L.L.P.  ("EMTH") and paid
for by New Haven.  EMTH shall  provide its  analysis no later than five (5) days
prior to the Effective Date of the Merger,  and may use such actuaries as it may
deem necessary or advisable for the purpose.

         (c) On the Effective Date of the Merger,  Connecticut Bancshares and/or
Manchester shall pay to the Executive a lump sum cash amount equal to his vested
benefit under the SERP and his vested benefit under the Supplemental  Agreement,
provided  that none of such  amount is deemed to be a  parachute  payment  under
Section 280G of the Code.

                  3.       PAYMENT OF WELFARE BENEFITS.
                           ---------------------------

         (a) For a period of thirty-six (36) full calendar months  following the
Effective  Date of the Merger,  New Haven agrees to cause to be continued  life,
health,  dental and disability  coverage pursuant to the policies offered to its
employees  for the Executive and any of his  dependents  covered by  Connecticut
Bancshares or Manchester  immediately prior to the Effective Date of the Merger,
except as set forth in Section  3(b)  below.  During such  thirty-six  (36) full
calendar month period, the Executive shall continue to be responsible for paying
the employee share of any premiums,  copayments or deductibles. In the event the
Executive's participation in any such plan or program is barred, New Haven shall
arrange to provide the Executive and his dependents with benefits  substantially
similar to those which the Executive and his  dependents  would  otherwise  have
received under such plans and programs from which their continued  participation
is barred or provide their economic equivalent.


                                      D1-3



<PAGE> 92


         (b) In lieu of  receiving  one or more of the  coverages  specified  in
Section 3(a) above,  the  Executive may elect to receive a cash payment equal to
the present value of the cost to New Haven of providing such coverage,  in which
event (i) Section 3(a) shall no longer  require such  coverage to be provided by
New Haven,  (ii) the cash payment in lieu of such coverage  shall be included in
the amount set forth in Section 2(a)(i)  hereof,  and (iii) the present value of
such  coverage  shall not be  included  in the  deduction  specified  in Section
2(a)(ii) hereof.  If the Executive  desires to receive a cash payment in lieu of
receiving  one or more of the  coverages  specified in Section  3(a) above,  the
Executive  shall give written  notice of such election to New Haven on or before
December 31, 2003.

         (c) The value of the  benefits to be provided by New Haven  pursuant to
Section  3(a) above shall be  discounted  to present  value in  accordance  with
Section 280G of the Code, and an amount equal to 33% of such present value shall
be added to the present value amount to cover anticipated premium increases over
the 36  month  period  specified  in  Section  2(a)  above.  The  present  value
calculations  shall be based on the  discount  rates  published  by the Internal
Revenue  Service for the month in which the Effective Date of the Merger occurs.
The  aggregate  present value of the  coverages  actually  provided by New Haven
pursuant to Section 3(a) hereof  (excluding those  coverages,  if any, which the
Executive  has elected to receive a cash payment in lieu of such  coverage),  as
determined  as of the  Effective  Date of the Merger and as increased by the 33%
factor set forth in the first  sentence  of this  Section  3(c),  is referred to
herein as the "Initial Present Value Amount."

         (d) In the event the costs to New Haven of  providing  the benefits set
forth in Section 3(a) (excluding  those  coverages,  if any, which the Executive
has elected to receive a cash payment in lieu of such coverage)  increase due to
increases  in  premiums  or  otherwise  and the  effect of such  increase  is to
increase  the  present  value of the  benefits  provided  by New Haven above the
Initial  Present Value Amount (the "Adjusted  Present Value  Amount"),  then the
Executive shall elect to either reduce one or more of his insurance coverages or
pay a higher share of the total premium cost so that the Adjusted  Present Value
Amount does not exceed the Initial Present Value Amount.

         4. AMENDMENTS TO THE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS. Each of Section 5(c) of the
            ---------------------------------------
Bank Employment  Agreement and Section 5(c) of the Company Employment  Agreement
is hereby amended,  effective as of the date of this Agreement,  by revising the

                  bonus for services  rendered in 2003,  or (5) any other income

                  under "Severance Calculation" on Exhibit 1 attached hereto."

         5. AMENDMENTS TO THE SERP.  Section 4.01 of the SERP is hereby amended,
            ----------------------
effective as of the date of this Agreement, by adding Section 4.01(c) at the end
of such Section to read in its entirety as follows:

                  "(c)  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  the  Supplemental  ESOP
                  Benefit shall exclude  compensation in 2003 related to (1) the
                  granting or vesting of  restricted  stock awards after October
                  31,  2003,  (2) the  granting,  vesting or  exercise  of stock
                  options,  (3) the  income  resulting  from  the  disqualifying
                  disposition of shares  received upon the exercise of incentive
                  stock  options,  (4) any payment to the Executive in 2003 of a

         Section 4.03 of the SERP is hereby amended, effective as of the date of
this  Agreement,  by  adding  the  following  new  paragraph  at the end of such
Section:

         "Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the Supplemental Pension Benefit shall

         inapplicable in 2003."

                  bonus for services  rendered in 2003,  or (5) any other income
                  (whether  taxable or not) not  included in the  amounts  shown
                  under "Severance Calculation" on Exhibit 1 attached hereto."

         6.       AMENDMENT  TO THE  SUPPLEMENTAL  AGREEMENT.  Section  2 of the

         under   "Severance   Calculation"   on  Exhibit  1   attached   hereto.
         Consequently,   the  Change  in  Control  provisions  under  the  First
         Amendment to the Supplemental Agreement,  dated October 21, 2002, shall
         be inapplicable in 2003."

         7.       RELEASES.
                  --------

                   [FORM OF TERMINATION AND RELEASE AGREEMENT]


                        TERMINATION AND RELEASE AGREEMENT

         This  Termination and Release  Agreement (this  "Agreement") is entered
into as of July 15, 2003 by and among  ____________________  (the  "Executive"),
Connecticut Bancshares, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Connecticut Bancshares"),
The Savings Bank of  Manchester,  a Connecticut  savings bank and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Connecticut Bancshares  ("Manchester"),  and The New Haven Savings
Bank, a Connecticut mutual savings bank ("New Haven").

                                    RECITALS
                                    --------

         WHEREAS, New Haven,  Connecticut Bancshares and Manchester have entered
into an  Agreement  and Plan of Merger,  dated as of July 15, 2003 (the  "Merger
Agreement"); and

         WHEREAS, Section 7.6.5 of the Merger Agreement provides that New Haven,
Connecticut  Bancshares,  Manchester  and the  Executive  shall  enter into this
Agreement  which shall  terminate  the Change in Control  Agreement  between the
Executive,  Connecticut  Bancshares and Manchester dated ___________,  ____ (the
"Control  Agreement") as of the Effective Date of the Merger, and in lieu of any
rights and  payments  under  said  Control  Agreement,  the  Executive  shall be
entitled to the rights and payments set forth herein.

         NOW  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the foregoing and other good and
valuable   consideration   the  receipt  and  sufficiency  of  which  is  hereby
acknowledged,  the Executive,  Connecticut Bancshares,  Manchester and New Haven
agree as follows:

         1. CERTAIN ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN IN 2003.
            -----------------------------------

         (a) The Executive  hereby agrees to take the following  actions between
the date hereof and  December 31,  2003,  it being the  intention of the parties
hereto that all of such actions  shall be fully  effective  and  consummated  no
later than December 31, 2003:

         (i)  exercise all vested  non-qualified  stock  options  granted to the
Executive under  Connecticut  Bancshares' 2000  Stock-Based  Incentive Plan (the
"Incentive Plan") and 2002 Equity  Compensation Plan (the "Compensation  Plan"),
including  non-qualified  stock options  scheduled to vest prior to December 31,
2003 (i.e., all vested non-qualified options under either plan to be exercised);



                                      D2-1


<PAGE> 99


         (ii) both (A) exercise all vested  incentive  stock options  granted to
the Executive under the Incentive Plan and/or the  Compensation  Plan (including
incentive  stock  options  scheduled to vest prior to December 31, 2003) and (B)
effect a sale of all of the  shares  of  Connecticut  Bancshares'  common  stock
acquired  upon such  exercise  (including  shares  acquired upon the exercise of
incentive  stock  options  in 2003 prior to the date of this  Agreement  if such
shares  have not been  sold  prior to the date  hereof)  in a manner  that  will
constitute a "disqualifying  disposition" of such shares for purposes of Section
421(b) of the Code (i.e., all vested  incentive  options under either plan to be
exercised, with the underlying shares sold);

         (iii) agree to the  accelerated  vesting as of December 31, 2003 of all
then  unvested  restricted  stock  awards  granted  to the  Executive  under the
Incentive Plan and/or the Compensation Plan (i.e., all unvested restricted stock
awards under either plan to be accelerated); and

         (iv) accept payment on December 31, 2003 of any cash bonus to which the
Executive  may be entitled to receive  pursuant to  Manchester's  Bonus Plan for
services  rendered in 2003 and which  otherwise would be payable in the ordinary
course by Manchester to the Executive in 2004.

         (b) Connecticut Bancshares and Manchester agree to take such actions as
may be necessary  or advisable by them in order to permit the  Executive to take
the actions set forth in Section 1(a) above and have them be fully effective and
consummated no later than December 31, 2003,  including  without  limitation (i)
promptly  processing  all exercises of stock options by the Executive  under the
Incentive Plan and/or the Compensation  Plan, (ii)  accelerating to December 31,
2003 the vesting of all then  unvested  restricted  stock awards  granted to the
Executive  under the  Incentive  Plan and/or the  Compensation  Plan,  and (iii)
accelerating  the  payment  of any  cash  bonus to which  the  Executive  may be
entitled to receive pursuant to Manchester's Bonus Plan for services rendered in
2003 to December 31, 2003.

         2. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF PAYMENT, RELEASE AND WAIVER.
            ----------------------------------------------

         (a) On the  Effective  Date of the Merger,  provided  the  Executive is
still employed by Manchester immediately prior to such date and has taken all of
the actions set forth in Section  1(a)  hereof,  Connecticut  Bancshares  and/or
Manchester   shall   pay   to   the   Executive   an   amount   equal   to   (i)
__________________dollars  ($______),  subject  to  adjustment  as set  forth in
Section 2(b) below (the "Maximum Amount"),  minus (ii) the Initial Present Value
Amount (as defined in Section 3(c) below) of the welfare benefits to be provided
to the Executive  pursuant to Section 3(a) below,  with  applicable  withholding
taxes  to  be  subtracted   from  the  amount  payable  to  the  Executive.   In
consideration of such payment, the Executive, Connecticut Bancshares, Manchester
and New Haven  hereby  agree that,  except as  provided in Section 4 below,  the
Control Agreement shall be terminated  without any further action of any parties
hereto, effective immediately prior to the Effective Date of the Merger.


                                      D2-2



<PAGE> 100


         (b) If the payment  pursuant to Section  2(a)  hereof,  either alone or
together with other  payments and benefits  which the Executive has the right to
receive from Connecticut Bancshares, Manchester or New Haven, would constitute a
"parachute  payment" under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended  (the  "Code"),  including  but not  limited to the  parachute  payments
associated  with the accelerated  vesting of stock options and restricted  stock
awards,  then the amount payable by  Connecticut  Bancshares  and/or  Manchester
pursuant  to Section  2(a)  hereof  shall be reduced by the amount  which is the
minimum  necessary to result in no portion of the payment payable by Connecticut
Bancshares  and/or  Manchester  under  Section  2(a)  being   non-deductible  to
Connecticut Bancshares and/or Manchester (or any successors thereto) pursuant to
Section  280G of the Code and  subject to the excise tax imposed  under  Section
4999 of the  Code.  The  parties  hereto  agree  that the  present  value of the
payments and benefits  payable  pursuant to this Agreement to the Executive upon
termination  of the  Executive's  employment  pursuant to Section 2(a) shall not
exceed  three times the  Executive's  "base  amount," as that term is defined in
Section  280G(b)(3)  of the Code,  less one  dollar.  The  determination  of any
reduction in the payment to be made pursuant to Section 2(a) shall be based upon
an analysis prepared by Elias, Matz, Tiernan & Herrick L.L.P.  ("EMTH") and paid
for by New Haven.  EMTH shall  provide its  analysis no later than five (5) days
prior to the Effective Date of the Merger,  and may use such actuaries as it may
deem necessary or advisable for the purpose.

                  3.       PAYMENT OF WELFARE BENEFITS.
                           ---------------------------

         (a) For a period of thirty-six (36) full calendar months  following the
Effective  Date of the Merger,  New Haven agrees to cause to be continued  life,
medical  and  disability  coverage  pursuant  to  the  policies  offered  to its
employees  for the Executive and any of the  Executive's  dependents  covered by
Connecticut  Bancshares or Manchester immediately prior to the Effective Date of
the Merger,  except as set forth in Section 3(b) below.  During such  thirty-six
(36) full calendar month period,  the Executive shall continue to be responsible
for paying the employee share of any premiums, copayments or deductibles. In the
event the Executive's  participation in any such plan or program is barred,  New
Haven  shall  arrange to  provide  the  Executive  and the  Executive's  covered
dependents  with  benefits   similar  to  those  which  the  Executive  and  the
Executive's  covered  dependents  would otherwise have received under such plans
and programs from which their continued participation is barred or provide their
economic equivalent.

         (b) In lieu of  receiving  one or more of the  coverages  specified  in
Section 3(a) above,  the  Executive may elect to receive a cash payment equal to
the present value of the cost to New Haven of providing such coverage,  in which
event (i) Section 3(a) shall no longer  require such  coverage to be provided by
New Haven,  (ii) the cash payment in lieu of such coverage  shall be included in
the amount set forth in Section 2(a)(i)  hereof,  and (iii) the present value of
such  coverage  shall not be  included  in the  deduction  specified  in Section
2(a)(ii) hereof.  If the Executive  desires to receive a cash payment in lieu of
receiving  one or more of the  coverages  specified in Section  3(a) above,  the
Executive  shall give written  notice of such election to New Haven on or before
December 31, 2003.




                                      D2-3
<PAGE> 101



         (c) The value of the  benefits to be provided by New Haven  pursuant to
Section  3(a) above shall be  discounted  to present  value in  accordance  with
Section 280G of the Code, and an amount equal to 33% of such present value shall
be added to the present value amount to cover anticipated premium increases over
the 36  month  period  specified  in  Section  3(a)  above.  The  present  value
calculations  shall be based on the  discount  rates  published  by the Internal
Revenue  Service for the month in which the Effective Date of the Merger occurs.
The  aggregate  present value of the  coverages  actually  provided by New Haven
pursuant to Section 3(a) hereof  (excluding those  coverages,  if any, which the
Executive  has elected to receive a cash payment in lieu of such  coverage),  as
determined  as of the  Effective  Date of the Merger and as increased by the 33%
factor set forth in the first  sentence  of this  Section  3(c),  is referred to
herein as the "Initial Present Value Amount."

         (d) In the event the costs to New Haven of  providing  the benefits set
forth in Section 3(a) (excluding  those  coverages,  if any, which the Executive
has elected to receive a cash payment in lieu of such coverage)  increase due to
increases  in  premiums  or  otherwise  and the  effect of such  increase  is to
increase  the  present  value of the  benefits  provided  by New Haven above the
Initial  Present Value Amount (the "Adjusted  Present Value  Amount"),  then the
Executive shall elect to either reduce one or more of his insurance coverages or
pay a higher share of the total premium cost so that the Adjusted  Present Value
Amount does not exceed the Initial Present Value Amount.

         4.  AMENDMENT  TO THE CONTROL  AGREEMENT.  Section  3(a) of the Control
             ------------------------------------
Agreement  is hereby  amended,  effective as of the date of this  Agreement,  by
revising the second sentence of such section to read in its entirety as follows:

                           "Such average annual  compensation shall include base
                  salary and any other taxable income, including but not limited
                  to amounts  related to the  granting,  vesting or  exercise of
                  restricted stock or stock option awards, commissions, bonuses,
                  pension  and profit  sharing  plan  contributions  or benefits
                  (whether  or  not  taxable),  severance  payments,  retirement
                  benefits,  and fringe benefits paid or to be paid to Executive
                  or paid for Executive's  benefit during any such year,  except
                  that compensation in 2003 shall not include amounts related to
                  (1) the granting or vesting of  restricted  stock awards after
                  October 31,  2003,  (2) the  granting,  vesting or exercise of
                  stock options, (3) the income resulting from the disqualifying
                  disposition of shares  received upon the exercise of incentive
                  stock  options,  (4) any payment to the Executive in 2003 of a
                  bonus for services  rendered in 2003,  or (5) any other income
                  (whether  taxable or not) not  included in the  amounts  shown
                  under "Severance Calculation" on Exhibit 1 attached hereto."

         5.  RELEASES.  Upon  payment of the  amount  set forth in Section  2(a)
             --------
hereof,  as such amount may be adjusted  pursuant to Section  2(b)  hereof,  the
Executive,  for himself and for his heirs,  successors and assigns,  does hereby
release completely and forever discharge Connecticut

                            NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT

                                    RECITALS:

         WHEREAS,  pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July

Interim (the "Merger"),  with Connecticut  Bancshares being the surviving entity
(the  "Interim  Surviving  Corporation");  and (iii)  immediately  following the
Merger,  Manchester will merge with and into New Haven, with New Haven being the
surviving  entity  (the  "Bank  Merger")  (the  Merger  and the Bank  Merger are
collectively referred to herein as the "Mergers");

         WHEREAS, the Executive is the _________ and  _______________________ of
Connecticut  Bancshares  and  Manchester  and as a result of the Mergers will no

         WHEREAS,  the parties hereto  recognize and acknowledge the interest of

Executive enter into this Agreement.

         NOW THEREFORE,  in consideration  of the foregoing,  and for other good
and  valuable  consideration,  the  receipt and  sufficiency  of which is hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

         1. Any  capitalized  terms not defined in this Agreement  shall have as

employee, shareholder, principal, agent, consultant or independent contractor of
any insured depository  institution,  trust company or parent holding company of
any such  institution  or  company  which  has an  office  in any of  Fairfield,
Hartford,  Litchfield,  Middlesex,  New Haven,  New  London,  Tolland or Windham
Counties in the State of Connecticut or Kent,  Providence or Washington Counties
in the State of Rhode Island  (collectively,  the "Counties" and  individually a
"County") or in the New York,  New York Primary  Metropolitan  Statistical  Area
("PMSA"),  or any other entity whose business in the aforesaid  Counties or PMSA
materially competes with the depository, lending or other business activities of
New  Haven or its  subsidiaries  or  affiliates  (in  each  case,  a  "Competing
Business"),  provided,  however,  that this  provision  shall not  prohibit  the
Executive from owning bonds,  non-voting  preferred  stock or up to five percent
(5%) of the outstanding  common stock of any such entity if such common stock is
publicly traded,  (ii) solicit or induce,  or cause others to solicit or induce,
any employee of New Haven or any of its  subsidiaries to leave the employment of

transact business with any other entity, whether or not a Competing Business, or
to reduce or refrain from doing any business with New Haven or its subsidiaries,
or  interfere  with or damage (or  attempt  to  interfere  with or  damage)  any
relationship between New Haven or its subsidiaries and any such customers.

         3. In consideration of the obligations and commitments of the Executive
under this  Agreement,  New Haven shall pay to the  Executive an amount equal to
____________________  dollars  ($_______) on the  Effective  Date of the Merger,
with applicable withholding taxes to be subtracted from such amount.

         4.  Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the Executive agrees to
treat as confidential all information (excluding, however, information contained
in publicly  available  reports filed by New Haven or any parent holding company
with any  governmental  entity and  information  published  or  disclosed to the
public by a third party) concerning the records,  properties,  books, contracts,
commitments  and affairs of New Haven and/or its  subsidiaries  and  affiliates,
including  but not limited to,  information  regarding  accounts,  shareholders,
finances,  strategies,  marketing,  customers  and  potential  customers  (their
identities,  preferences, likes and dislikes) and other information of a similar
nature not available to the public.

         5.  The  term  of  this Agreement shall expire _______ months after the
Effective Date of the Merger.

         6. No rights  under  this  Agreement  shall be  assignable  nor  duties
delegable  by either  party,  except that New Haven may assign any of its rights
hereunder  to any  acquiror  of all or  substantially  all of the  assets of New
Haven.  This  Agreement  will inure to the  benefit  of and be binding  upon any
successor to New Haven by merger or consolidation or any other change in form or
any other  person or firm or  entity  to which all or  substantially  all of the
assets and business of New Haven may be sold or otherwise  transferred.  Nothing
contained  in this  Agreement  is  intended to confer upon any person or entity,
other than the  parties  hereto,  their  successors  in interest  and  permitted

         7. This  Agreement  shall be  construed,  enforced and  interpreted  in
accordance  with and governed by the laws of the State of  Connecticut,  without
reference  to its  principles  of  conflict  of laws,  except to the extent that
federal law shall be deemed to preempt such state laws.

         8. It is the  intention of the parties  hereto that the  provisions  of
this  Agreement  shall be enforced to the fullest extent  permissible  under all
applicable  laws and  public  policies,  but that  the  unenforceability  or the
modification  to  conform  with such laws or public  policies  of any  provision
hereof shall not render  unenforceable or impair the remainder of the Agreement.
The  covenants in Section 2 of this  Agreement  with respect to the Counties and
the PMSA shall be deemed to be separate  covenants  with  respect to each County
and PMSA, and should any court of competent  jurisdiction  conclude or find that
this  Agreement  or any portion is not  enforceable  with  respect to any of the
Counties or PMSA,  such  conclusion or finding shall in no way render invalid or
unenforceable  the  covenants  herein with  respect to any other County or PMSA.
Accordingly, if any provision shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable
either in whole or in part,  this Agreement shall be deemed amended to delete or
modify as necessary the invalid or unenforceable provisions to alter the balance
of this Agreement in order to render the same valid and enforceable.

         9. The  Executive  acknowledges  that New Haven would not have  entered
into the  Merger  Agreement  or intend to  consummate  the  Mergers  unless  the
Executive had, among other things,  entered into this  Agreement.  Any breach of
this  Agreement  will  result in  irreparable  damage to New Haven for which New
Haven will not have an adequate remedy at law. In addition to any other remedies
and damages available to New Haven, the Executive further  acknowledges that New
Haven shall be entitled to injunctive  relief  hereunder to enjoin any breach of
this Agreement,  and the parties hereby consent to an injunction in favor of New
Haven by any court of  competent  jurisdiction,  without  prejudice to any other
right or remedy to which New Haven may be entitled. The Executive represents and
acknowledges  that, in light of his experience and  capabilities,  the Executive
can obtain  employment  with other than a  Competing  Business  or in a business
engaged in other lines and/or of a different nature than those engaged in by New
Haven or its subsidiaries or affiliates, and that the enforcement of a remedy by
way of injunction  will not prevent the Executive from earning a livelihood.  In
the  event  of a  breach  of this  Agreement  by the  Executive,  the  Executive
acknowledges  that in  addition  to or in lieu of New Haven  seeking  injunctive
relief,  New Haven may also seek to recoup any or all amounts  paid by New Haven
to the Executive pursuant to Section 3 hereof. Each of the remedies available to
New Haven in the event of a breach by the Executive  shall be cumulative and not
mutually exclusive.

         10. If an action is instituted to enforce any of the provisions of this
Agreement, the prevailing party in such action shall be entitled to recover from
the losing party its, her or his reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.

         11.  Notwithstanding   anything  to  the  contrary  contained  in  this
Agreement,  the effectiveness of this Agreement shall be subject to consummation
of the Mergers in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, as the same
may be amended by the parties thereto in accordance with its terms. In the event
the Merger  Agreement is  terminated  for any reason,  this  Agreement  shall be
deemed null and void.
