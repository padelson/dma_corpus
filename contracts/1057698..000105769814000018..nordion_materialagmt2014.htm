in the case of the Corporation, using its commercially reasonable efforts to

order to maintain the Material Contracts in full force and effect following
completion of the Arrangement on terms that are reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(c)

  |  

using its commercially reasonable efforts to oppose, lift or rescind any
injunction, restraining or other order, decree or ruling seeking to restrain,
enjoin or otherwise prohibit or adversely affect the consummation of the

is a party or brought against it or its directors or officers challenging the
Arrangement or this Agreement;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(d)

  |  

carrying out the terms of the Interim Order and the Final Order applicable to
it and complying with all material requirements imposed by Law on it or its

---|---

  |  

in the event that the condition set forth in Section 6.1(f) cannot be
satisfied or will reasonably likely not be satisfied, Corporation and
Purchaser will diligently and in good faith discuss the feasibility and
implementation of alternative strategies and structures to complete the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(2)

  |  

Corporation shall promptly notify Purchaser of:

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

any material written notice from any Person reasonably alleging that the

Section 4.3 Regulatory Approvals

  

  

    

(1)

  |  

The Parties shall, as promptly as practicable, prepare and file all necessary
documents, registrations, statements, petitions, filings and applications for
the Regulatory Approvals (including the Key Regulatory Approvals) and use
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain all Regulatory
Approvals (including the Key Regulatory Approvals). For purposes of this
covenant, "commercially reasonable efforts" means agreeing to any steps,
conditions or undertakings required by a Governmental Entity in connection
with granting or issuing Regulatory Approvals that are of a nature typically
required in connection with such approvals and provided that any such steps,
conditions or undertakings would not reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the business, operations, results of operations, assets,
capitalization, financial condition or liabilities of Corporation and its
Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) or of Purchaser, Guarantors and
Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries and parent entities (on a
combined and consolidated basis). For greater certainty, a divestiture of a
material portion of the business or assets of Corporation and its Subsidiaries
(on a consolidated basis) or of Purchaser, Guarantors and Corporation and
their respective Subsidiaries and parent entities (on a combined and
consolidated basis) is not of a nature typically required and shall be deemed
to have such a material adverse effect on the business, operations, results of
operations, assets, capitalization, financial condition or liabilities of
Corporation and its Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) or of Purchaser,
Guarantors and Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries and parent
entities (on a combined and consolidated basis) as applicable.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(2)

  |  

Subject to applicable Laws, the Parties shall cooperate with one another in
connection with obtaining the Regulatory Approvals including by providing or
submitting on a timely basis all notices, requests or filings with any
Governmental Entity that are required or advisable, in connection with
obtaining the Regulatory Approvals, provided that competitively sensitive
information may be provided only to the external legal counsel to the other
Party pursuant to a joint defense agreement whereby such information can only
be used for the purpose of the completion of the Arrangement and will not be
shared with its clients, and information as to valuation need not be
disclosed. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Party shall
promptly respond to any requests for information from a Governmental Entity in
connection with obtaining the Regulatory Approvals, and in all cases, unless
mutually agreed to in writing otherwise, each Party shall respond to any
request for information from a Governmental Entity within 90 days after
receipt thereof.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(3)

  |  

Subject to Law, the Parties shall cooperate with and keep one another fully
informed as to the status of and the processes and proceedings relating to
obtaining the Regulatory Approvals, and shall promptly notify each other and
provide a copy of any communication from any Governmental Entity in respect of
the Arrangement or this Agreement, and shall not make any submissions or
filings, participate in any meetings or any conversations with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigations or other
inquiries related to the Arrangement or this Agreement unless it consults with
the other Party in advance and gives the other Party the opportunity to review
drafts of any submissions or filings, or attend and participate in any
communications or meetings. If reasonably requested by Purchaser, Corporation
shall make itself available upon reasonable notice to attend at meetings with
any Governmental Entity or Person in connection with obtaining the Regulatory
Approvals. Notwithstanding anything in this subsection, submissions, filings
or other written communications with any Governmental Entity may be redacted
as necessary before sharing with the other Party to address reasonable
attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns, provided that
a Party must provide external legal counsel to the other Party non-redacted
versions of drafts or final submissions, filings or other written
communications with any Governmental Entity on the basis that the redacted
information will not be shared with its clients. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, information as to the valuation of Corporation need not be
disclosed.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(4)

  |  

Each Party shall promptly notify the other Parties if it becomes aware that
(i) any application, filing, document or other submission for a Regulatory
Approval contains a Misrepresentation, or (ii) any Regulatory Approval or
other order, clearance, consent, ruling, exemption, no-action letter or other
approval applied for as contemplated by this Agreement contains, reflects or
was obtained following the submission of any application, filing, document or
other submission containing a Misrepresentation, such that an amendment or
supplement may be necessary or advisable. In such case, the Party making the
amendment or supplement shall, in consultation with and subject to the prior
approval of the other Party, cooperate in the preparation, filing and
dissemination, as applicable, of any such amendment or supplement.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(5)

  |  

The Parties shall request that the Regulatory Approvals be processed by the
applicable Governmental Entities on an expedited basis and, to the extent that
a hearing is held, the Parties shall request the earliest possible hearing
date for the consideration of the Regulatory Approvals.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(6)

  |  

If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement under any Law, or if any proceeding is instituted or
threatened by any Governmental Entity challenging or potentially leading to a
challenge of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as not in
compliance with Law, the Parties shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts consistent with the terms of this Agreement and this Section 4.3 to
resolve such proceeding so as to allow the Effective Time to occur on or prior
to the Outside Date.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(7)

  |  

Purchaser shall be responsible for and pay all filing fees or other regulatory
levies, charges or payments incurred in connection with obtaining the
Regulatory Approvals.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

Section 4.4

  |  

Internal Investigation

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

Corporation has provided to Purchaser copies of any material correspondence,
in writing, to or from any Governmental Entity conveying an offer to settle
the Internal Investigation with such Government Entity. For the purposes of
this Section 4.4, "Internal Investigation" means the matters described in
Section 13 of the Corporation Disclosure Letter and any action, investigation
or other proceeding related thereto by any the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
or any Governmental Entity (collectively, the "Investigation Authorities").
Corporation shall promptly provide Purchaser with copies of any material
correspondence from Investigation Authorities received following the date
hereof with respect to the Internal Investigation, and shall keep Purchaser
and its counsel informed, on a timely basis, of the status and progress of
discussions with any Investigation Authorities with respect to the Internal
Investigation. Corporation shall consult with Purchaser regarding any proposed
material correspondence, communication or meeting in each case from or with
Investigation Authorities with respect to the Internal Investigation or other
action to be taken in connection with the Internal Investigation and
Corporation shall consider in good faith any recommendation made by Purchaser
with respect thereto. Any settlement of a claim or proceeding relating to the
Internal Investigation involving non-monetary relief shall require the prior
consent of Purchaser solely with respect to the non-monetary relief of such
settlement and the scope of any admissions or statement of facts shall require
the consent of Purchaser (in each case not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). For greater certainty, the Corporation\'s obligations in this
Section 4.4 shall in each case be subject to Section 4.5(2) and Section
4.5(3).

  

  

    

Section 4.5

Access to Information; Confidentiality

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(1)

  |  

Subject to Law, Corporation shall (a) give Purchaser and its Representatives,
upon reasonable notice, reasonable access during normal business hours to its
and its Subsidiaries\' (i) premises, (ii) property and assets (including all
books and records, whether retained internally or otherwise), (iii) Contracts
and Leases, and (iv) senior personnel, (b) furnish to Purchaser and its
Representatives such financial and operating data and other information with
respect to the assets or business of Corporation and any of its Subsidiaries
as it may reasonably request, provided that Corporation may require that the
disclosure of competitively or highly sensitive information be limited to a
team of Purchaser Representatives, which may include internal Representatives
of Purchaser and its affiliates who are not involved in the day-to-day
operations of, and do not have pricing responsibilities for or direct
supervision of contract negotiations with customers or suppliers for,
businesses of Purchaser, Guarantors or their respective Subsidiaries or parent
entities (the "Clean Representatives"), on terms reasonably satisfactory to
Corporation, and that such competitively or highly sensitive information not
be disclosed by the Clean Representatives, directly or indirectly, to any
Person other than another Clean Representative, and (c) instruct its
Representatives to cooperate with Purchaser and its Representatives in respect
of (a) and (b), but subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and so long as
the access does not unduly interfere with the Ordinary Course conduct of the
business of Corporation.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(2)

  |  

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, Corporation shall not be
obligated to provide access to, or to disclose, any information to Purchaser
if Corporation reasonably determines that such access or disclosure would
jeopardize any attorney client or other privilege claim by Corporation or its
Subsidiaries provided that, to the extent any information is withheld due to a
potential waiver of such privilege, Corporation shall notify Purchaser of the
nature of the information which is being withheld and the basis for privilege
and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to find a way to allow
disclosure of such information, including entering into common interest
privilege agreements or other arrangements, as appropriate.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(3)

  |  

Purchaser acknowledges that the Confidentiality Agreement and any common
interest privilege agreement or other arrangement referred to in Section
4.5(2) continue to apply and that all information provided under this Section
4.5 shall be subject to the terms thereof on the same basis as if such
information had been disclosed under such agreement or arrangement. For
greater certainty, if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its
terms, the obligations of the Parties and their respective affiliates under
the Confidentiality Agreement and any common interest privilege agreement or
other arrangement referred to in Section 4.5(2) shall survive the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof.

Section 4.6

  |  

Cooperation regarding Reorganization

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(1)

  |  

Corporation shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, cooperate with
Purchaser in structuring and preparing any reorganization, transfer of
securities, assets or business as Purchaser may reasonably require, including
amalgamations or liquidations, and including the structuring transactions
described in a letter of Purchaser to Corporation dated the date hereof (each
a "Contemplated Reorganization Transaction"), and to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to implement any such Contemplated Reorganization
Transaction, provided, however, that (i) such requested cooperation does not
unreasonably nor materially interfere with the ongoing operations of
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, (ii) such Contemplated Reorganization
Transaction is not, in the opinion of Corporation or Corporation\'s counsel,
acting reasonably, prejudicial to the Shareholders, holders of Options,
holders of DSUs, holders of RSUs, Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries,
(iii) such Contemplated Reorganization Transaction shall not impede, delay or
prevent the receipt of any Regulatory Approvals or the satisfaction of any
conditions set forth in Article 6, (iv) such Contemplated Reorganization
Transaction shall not impede, delay or prevent the consummation of the
Arrangement, (v) such Contemplated Reorganization Transaction shall not
require Corporation to obtain the approval of the Shareholders and shall not
require Purchaser to obtain the approval of its shareholders, (vi) such
Contemplated Reorganization Transaction complies with all Laws, including the
Nordion Act and the Nordion Articles, (vii) Purchaser shall pay all of the
cooperation and implementation costs and all direct or indirect costs and
liabilities, fees, damages, penalties and Taxes that may be incurred as a
consequence of the implementation of or to unwind any such reorganization if
the Arrangement is not completed, including actual out-of-pocket costs and
expenses for filing fees and external counsel and auditors which may be
incurred, (viii) such cooperation does not require the directors, officers,
employees or agents of Corporation or its Subsidiaries to take any action in
any capacity other than as a director, officer or employee, and (ix) no such
Contemplated Reorganization Transaction shall be considered to constitute a
breach of the representations, warranties or covenants of Corporation
hereunder. Subject to and in accordance with this Section 4.6, the documents
(collectively, the "Reorganization Documents") to give effect, as at the
Effective Time, to any Contemplated Reorganization Transaction in accordance
with the Plan of Arrangement will be executed by the parties thereto prior to
the Effective Time to take effect pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement,
provided that Corporation shall have the right to not execute any
Reorganization Document in accordance with this Section 4.6 and this refusal
shall not prevent or delay the filing of the Articles of Arrangement and the
effectiveness of the Plan of Arrangement which shall then become effective in
accordance with its terms but without any step relating to any such
Reorganization Document not executed becoming effective.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(2)

  |  

Purchaser shall provide written notice to Corporation of any proposed
Contemplated Reorganization Transaction at least 20 Business Days prior to the
anticipated Effective Time. The Parties shall seek to have any Contemplated
Reorganization Transaction that is to be effective before the Effective Time
made effective as of the last moment of the day ending immediately prior to
the Effective Time (but after Purchaser shall have irrevocably waived or
confirmed that all conditions under Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 have been
satisfied), provided that no Contemplated Reorganization Transaction will be
made effective unless (A) it is reasonably certain, after consulting with
Corporation, that the Arrangement will become effective, (B) such Contemplated
Reorganization Transaction can be reversed or unwound without adversely
affecting the Shareholders, holders of Options, holders of DSUs, holders of
RSUs, Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries in the event the Arrangement does
not become effective and this Agreement is terminated, or (C) Corporation
otherwise reasonably agrees.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(3)

  |  

The obligation of Purchaser to reimburse Corporation for fees and expenses and
be responsible for costs as set out in this Section 4.6 will be in addition to
any other payment Purchaser may be obligated to make hereunder and will
survive termination of this Agreement. The completion of a Contemplated
Reorganization Transaction shall not be a condition to the consummation of the
Arrangement. If the Arrangement is not completed for any reason, and without
prejudice to any other remedy of Corporation, Purchaser shall indemnify
Corporation for all losses and reasonable costs and expenses, including
reasonable legal fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any
Contemplated Reorganization Transactions and in connection with reversing or
unwinding any Contemplated Reorganization Transactions.

Section 4.7

  |  

Cooperation for Financing

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(1)

  |  

Purchaser and Guarantors shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
reasonably necessary to arrange and obtain the Financing described in the
Equity Letter and the Financing Letters on the terms and conditions described
therein (including any "flex" provisions) or, if available, on other terms
that are acceptable to Purchaser and would not adversely affect the ability of
Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated herein, and Purchaser
and Guarantors shall not, without the consent of Corporation (not to be
unreasonably withheld), permit any amendment, supplement or modification to be
made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under any of the Equity
Letter and the Financing Letters, that renders existing conditions more
onerous for any of Purchaser or Guarantors, or imposes new or additional
conditions, to satisfy or that could reasonably be expected to (A) reduce the
aggregate amount of cash proceeds available from the Debt Financing (including
by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the
Debt Financing (other than in connection with the imposition of the "flex"
terms) unless the Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding amount or
from alternative financing to the extent required or permitted pursuant to
this Section 4.7) to fund the amounts required to be paid by the Purchaser
under this Agreement, (B) prevent or materially delay, or otherwise have a
material adverse impact on, the availability of the Financing, or (C) make the
funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
Financing) materially less likely to occur (it being understood and agreed
that Purchaser and Guarantors may amend the Financing Letters to impose the
"flex" provisions with respect thereto and to add lenders, arrangers,
bookrunners, agents, managers or similar entities that have not executed the
Financing Letters as of the date of this Agreement) or adversely impact the
ability of the Purchaser or the Guarantors to enforce their rights against the
other party to the Financing Letters. Without limiting the foregoing,
Purchaser and Guarantors shall use their reasonable best efforts (i) to
maintain in effect the Financing Letters and the Equity Letter until the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) to negotiate and
enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing Letters on the
terms and conditions contained in the Financing Letters (including any "flex"
provisions) (or on terms no less favorable to Purchaser than the terms and
conditions in the Financing Letters or, if available, on other terms that are
acceptable to Purchaser and would not adversely affect the ability of
Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated herein, (iii) to satisfy
(or obtain waivers to) on a timely basis all conditions (other than any
condition where the failure to be so satisfied is a direct result of the
Corporation's failure to furnish information described in Section 4.6) to
funding applicable to Purchaser, Guarantors, their Subsidiaries or any Person
in the Financing Letters, (iv) comply with their obligations pursuant to the
Financing Letters, and (v) subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in the Financing Letters and the Equity Letter (other
than the conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the
Effective Time), at the time when the Arrangement would have been consummated
but for the failure of the Financing to be funded, to seek to enforce their
rights under the Financing Letters and the Equity Letter, including using its
reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and the other Persons committed
to fund the Financing to fund the Financing (or such lesser amount as may be
required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby) at the Effective
Time. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser shall give
Corporation prompt notice (x) of any breach or default by any party to any of
the Financing Letters and the Equity Letter and any definitive agreements with
respect thereto of which Purchaser becomes aware, (y) of the receipt of (A)
any written notice or (B) other material written communication, in each case
from any Financing Sources in the case of the Financing Letters or from any of
GTCR Fund IX/A LP, GTCR Partners IX, L.P. or from GTCR Golder Rauner II,
L.L.C. in the case of the Equity Letter, with respect to (1) any actual or
potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any of
the Financing Letters and the Equity Letter and any definitive agreements with
respect thereto or any material provisions of the Financing Letters and the
Equity Letter and any definitive agreements with respect thereto, or (2) any
material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any of the
Financing Letters and the Equity Letter with respect to the obligation to fund
the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded at the Effective
Time, in each case which would make the funding of the Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing) materially less
likely to occur. Upon the occurrence of any circumstance referred to in clause
(x) or (y) of the immediately preceding sentence which would reasonably make
any portion of the Debt Financing or Equity Financing unavailable or upon the
occurrence of any circumstance which would reasonably make any portion of the
Debt Amount unavailable, and such portion is reasonably required to fund the
aggregate Purchaser Consideration and all fees, expenses and other amounts
contemplated to be paid by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, Purchaser and
Guarantors shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in
replacement thereof alternative financing from alternative sources in an
amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on terms and conditions (including conditionality) not less
favorable, and with financing sources reasonably acceptable, to Purchaser than
the terms set forth in the Financing Letters as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the occurrence of such event. For the avoidance of
doubt, Purchaser and Guarantors arranging and obtaining, in replacement of the
Financing, alternative financing in accordance with this Section 4.7(1) shall
not modify or affect in any way Corporation\'s rights or obligations pursuant
to this Agreement, including its right to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with Section 7.2(1)(c)(i) and Section 7.2(1)(c)(iii) and
obligations under Section 4.7(2) below. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, in no event shall any of Purchaser and Guarantors
be required pursuant to this Agreement to agree to pay to the lenders
providing the Debt Financing any additional fees, original issue discount or
to increase any interest rates applicable to the Debt Financing, except as
expressly required pursuant to the Financing Letters (including the "flex"
provision) in existence as of the date hereof or in any fee letter or other
document referenced therein or related thereto.

Corporation shall, and shall cause each of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries to
provide to Purchaser cooperation reasonably requested by Purchaser and that is
customary in connection with any financing entered into in connection with the
Arrangement including with respect to those items set forth in Financing
Letters, including: (a) subject to Section 4.5, furnishing Purchaser as
promptly as reasonably practicable with available financial and other
reasonably required or customary information regarding Corporation, any of its
wholly-owned Subsidiaries or any combination of such Persons (information
required to be delivered pursuant to this clause (a) being referred to as, the
"Required Information"), provided that competitively or highly sensitive
information may be provided only to the external counsel of the other Party or
Clean Representatives and will not be shared with its clients, and (b) using
its commercially reasonably efforts to facilitate the pledging of collateral
in connection with the Financing (subject to the occurrence of the Effective
Time); provided, however, that (i) such requested cooperation or Financing
does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of Corporation and
its Subsidiaries, (ii) such requested cooperation or Financing is not, in the
opinion of Corporation or Corporation\'s counsel, acting reasonably,
prejudicial to the Shareholders, holders of Options, holders of DSU, holders
of RSU, Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) such requested
cooperation or Financing shall not impede, delay or prevent the receipt of any
Regulatory Approvals or the satisfaction of any other conditions set forth in
Article 6, (iv) such requested cooperation or Financing shall not impede,
delay or prevent the consummation of the Arrangement, (v) such requested
cooperation or Financing shall not require Corporation to obtain the approval
of the Shareholders and shall not require Purchaser to obtain the approval of
its shareholders, (vi) such requested cooperation or Financing complies with
all Laws, including the Nordion Act and the Nordion Articles, (vii) Purchaser
shall pay all of the cooperation costs and all direct or indirect costs and
liabilities, fees, damages, penalties and Taxes that may be incurred as a
consequence of such requested cooperation or Financing, including actual out-
of-pocket costs and expenses for external counsel and auditors which may be
incurred, (viii) such requested cooperation or Financing does not require the
directors, officers, employees or agents of Corporation or its Subsidiaries to
take any action in any capacity other than as a director, officer or employee,
and (ix) no such requested cooperation or Financing shall be considered to
constitute a breach of the representations, warranties or covenants of
Corporation hereunder, so long as Corporation is not otherwise in breach of
its covenants hereunder.

Purchaser shall provide written notice to Corporation of any proposed
Financing at least 20 Business Days prior to the anticipated Effective Time.
The obligation of Purchaser to reimburse Corporation for fees and expenses and
be responsible for costs as set out in this Section 4.7 will be in addition to
any other payment Purchaser may be obligated to make hereunder and will
survive termination of this Agreement. The completion of a Financing shall not
be a condition to the consummation of the Arrangement. If the Arrangement is
not completed for any reason, other than as a result of a termination of this
Agreement by Purchaser in accordance with Section 7.2(1)(d)(i) or Section
7.2(1)(d)(ii) and without prejudice to any other remedy of Corporation,
Purchaser shall indemnify Corporation for all losses and reasonable costs and
expenses, including reasonable legal fees and disbursements, incurred in
connection with any requested cooperation or Financing.

not make any filing with any Governmental Entity (other than as contemplated
by Section 4.3 and Securities Laws) with respect to this Agreement or the
Arrangement without the consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided that any Party that is required to
make disclosure by Law shall use its reasonable efforts to give the other
Party prior oral or written notice and a reasonable opportunity to review or
comment on the disclosure or filing (other than with respect to confidential
information contained in such disclosure or filing). The Party making such
disclosure shall give reasonable consideration to any comments made by the
other Party or its counsel, and if such prior notice is not possible, shall
give such notice immediately following the making of such disclosure or
filing.

From and after the Effective Time, Corporation shall, and Purchaser shall
cause Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law (and to also advance expenses as incurred to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law), each present and former
director, officer and employee of Corporation and its Subsidiaries (each, an
"Indemnified Person") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, inquiry, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or related to such Indemnified Person\'s service as a director,
officer, trustee or employee of Corporation and/or any of its Subsidiaries or
services performed by such Persons at the request of Corporation and/or any of
its Subsidiaries at or prior to or following the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including the
approval or completion of this Agreement, the Arrangement or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or arising out of or related to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Neither Purchaser nor
Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
in any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation or threatened claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving or naming an Indemnified
Person or arising out of or related to an Indemnified Person\'s service as a
director, officer or employee of Corporation and/or any of its Subsidiaries or
services performed by such Persons at the request of Corporation and/or any of
its Subsidiaries at or prior to or following the Effective Time without the
prior written consent of that Indemnified Person. Purchaser shall cause
Corporation to provide direct confirmation of these undertakings to the
current directors and officers as part of the closing of the Arrangement.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(2)

  |  

Prior to the Effective Time, Corporation shall and, if Corporation is unable
to, Purchaser shall cause Corporation as of the Effective Time to obtain and
fully prepay the premium for the irrevocable extension of the directors\',
officers\' and employees\' liability coverage of Corporation\'s and its
Subsidiaries\' existing directors\', officers\' and employees\' insurance
policies for a claims reporting or run-off and extended reporting period and
claims reporting period of at least six years from and after the Effective
Time with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to
the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as Corporation\'s current insurance carriers with respect to
directors\', officers\' and employees\' liability insurance ("DandO Insurance"),
and with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no
less advantageous to the Indemnified Persons than the coverage provided under
Corporation\'s and its Subsidiaries\' existing policies with respect to any
actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission,
neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director, officer or
employee of Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her
serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective
Time (including in connection with the approval or completion of this
Agreement, the Arrangement or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or arising out of or related to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby), provided that the total cost of such run-off DandO
Insurance shall not exceed 300% of the current annual aggregate premium for
DandO Insurance currently maintained by Corporation and its Subsidiaries. If
Corporation for any reason fails to obtain such "run off" insurance policies
as of the Effective Time, Corporation or Purchaser shall continue to maintain
in effect for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time
the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less advantageous in the
aggregate than the coverage provided under Corporation\'s and its
Subsidiaries\' existing policies as of the date hereof, or Corporation or
Purchaser shall purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period
with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least
as favourable to the Indemnified Persons as provided in Corporation\'s
existing policies as of the date hereof; provided that the total cost of such
run-off DandO Insurance shall not exceed 300% of the current annual aggregate
premium for DandO Insurance currently maintained by Corporation and its
Subsidiaries.

up into any other Person and, if applicable, shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person or Persons (including as part of the
Arrangement), then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so
that the successors, assigns and transferees of Corporation, its Subsidiaries
or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set
forth in this Section 4.11.

to such indemnification, then Corporation or Purchaser shall pay such
Indemnified Person\'s costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and
expenses, incurred in connection with pursuing such claim against Corporation.

Person with Corporation, its Subsidiaries and their respective successors and
assigns. All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to

any contract between such Indemnified Person and Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries shall survive the Effective Time, be transferred and assumed in

period of 24 months following the Effective Time shall provide Corporation
Employees with benefits and total compensation that are substantially

If Corporation receives an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior
Proposal prior to the approval of the Arrangement Resolution by Shareholders,

  |  

Corporation has been, and continues to be, in compliance with its obligations
under this Article 5;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

Corporation has delivered to Purchaser a written notice of the determination
of the Board that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal
and that, in its good faith judgment (after consultation with Corporation's
outside counsel), failure to recommend such Acquisition Proposal to
Shareholders would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Laws, and of the intention of the Board to approve, recommend or enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (the "Superior
Proposal Notice");

   
---|---

---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(e)

  |  

Purchaser has offered to amend this Agreement and the Arrangement under
Section 5.4(2) and the Board has determined in good faith, after consultation
with Corporation\'s outside legal counsel and financial advisers, that such
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal compared to
the terms of the Arrangement as proposed to be amended by Purchaser under
Section 5.4(2); and

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(f)

  |  

prior to or concurrently with making a Change in Recommendation and entering

During the Matching Period, or such longer period as Corporation may approve
(in its sole discretion) in writing for such purpose: (a) Purchaser shall have
the opportunity (but not the obligation) to offer to amend the Arrangement and
this Agreement in order for such Acquisition Proposal to cease to be a
Superior Proposal; (b) the Board shall review any such offer made by Purchaser
to amend the terms of this Agreement and the Arrangement in good faith in
order to determine whether such proposal would, upon acceptance, result in the
Acquisition Proposal previously constituting a Superior Proposal ceasing to be
a Superior Proposal; and (c) Corporation shall negotiate in good faith with
Purchaser to make such amendments to the terms of this Agreement and the
Arrangement as would enable Purchaser to proceed with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on such amended terms. If the Board determines
that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to be a Superior Proposal,
Corporation shall promptly so advise Purchaser and Corporation and Purchaser
shall amend this Agreement to reflect such offer made by Purchaser, and shall
take and cause to be taken all such actions as are necessary to give effect to
the foregoing.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(3)

  |  

Each successive material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal that results in
an increase in, or modification of, the consideration (or value of such
consideration) to be received by the Shareholders or other material terms or
conditions thereof shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for the
purposes of this Section 5.4, and Purchaser shall be afforded a new three
Business Day Matching Period from the date on which Purchaser received the
Superior Proposal Notice for the new Superior Proposal from Corporation.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(4)

  |  

If Corporation provides a Superior Proposal Notice to Purchaser after a date
that is less than ten Business Days before the Meeting, Corporation shall be
entitled to and shall upon request from Purchaser acting reasonably postpone

agent, consultant or representative of such Party) to any other Party to this
Agreement, except that in the event of termination under Section 7.2, this
Section 7.3, Section 8.2 through to and including Section 8.18, Section
2.4(5), Section 4.3(7), Section 4.5(3), Section 4.6(3) and Section 4.7(3) and
the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement (pursuant to the terms set out
therein) shall survive, and provided further that, subject to Section 8.5(3),
no Party shall be relieved of any liability for any wilful and material breach
by it of this Agreement. Upon the Arrangement becoming effective, Section 4.11
shall survive for a period of six years following such termination and Section
4.12 shall survive for a period of 24 months following such termination.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(2)

  |  

As used in this Section 7.3 and Section 7.2(1)(d)(ii)(c), "wilful and material
breach" means a material breach that is a consequence of an act undertaken by
the breaching party with the actual knowledge that the taking of such act
would, or would be reasonably expected to, cause a breach of this Agreement.

GENERAL PROVISIONS

  

  

    

Section 8.1

  |  

Amendments

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

This Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement may, at any time and from time to
time before or after the holding of the Meeting but not later than the
Effective Time, be amended by mutual written agreement of the Parties, and any
such amendment may, without limitation:

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

change the time for performance of any of the obligations or acts of the
Parties;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

modify any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or in any
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(c)

  |  

modify any of the covenants contained in this Agreement and waive or modify
performance of any of the obligations of the Parties; and

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(d)

  |  

modify any mutual conditions contained in this Agreement.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

provided that such amendment or variation does not (i) invalidate any required
Shareholders approval of the Arrangement, or (ii) after the holding of the
Meeting, results in an adverse change in the form or value of Consideration
payable to Shareholders pursuant to the Arrangement or delay the date of
payment of such Consideration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, the Financing Source Sections (in each case, together
with any related definitions and other provisions of this Agreement to the
extent an amendment, modification, supplement or waiver would serve to modify
the substance of such Sections) may not be amended, modified, supplemented or
waived in a manner that is adverse to any Financing Source without the prior
written consent of such Financing Source.

  

  

    

Section 8.2

  |  

Termination Fees

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(1)

  |  

Despite any other provision in this Agreement relating to the payment of fees
and expenses, including the payment of brokerage fees, if a Termination Fee
Event or Reverse Termination Fee Event occurs, Corporation shall pay Purchaser
the Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.2(3) or Purchaser shall pay
Corporation the Reverse Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.3, as
applicable. For greater certainty, a Party shall not be required to pay the
Termination Fee or Reverse Termination Fee, as applicable, more than once.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(2)

  |  

For the purposes of this Agreement, "Termination Fee" means $12 million and
"Termination Fee Event" means the termination of this Agreement:

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

by Purchaser, pursuant to Section 7.2(1)(d)(ii)(a) or Section 7.2(1)(d)(ii)(b)
[Change in Recommendation or Superior Proposal];

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

by Corporation, pursuant to Section 7.2(1)(c)(ii) [Superior Proposal]; or

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(c)

  |  

(A) by Corporation pursuant to Section 7.2(1)(b)(iii) [Occurrence of Outside
Date], in circumstances other than as a result of the condition set forth in
Section 6.1(c) [Key Regulatory Approvals] or Section 6.1(e) [Illegality], as
applicable, not being satisfied as a result of the Key Regulatory Approvals
having not been obtained, and provided that Purchaser is not then in breach of
this Agreement so as to directly or indirectly cause any condition in Section
6.3(a) [Purchaser Representations and Warranties Condition] or Section 6.3(b)
[Purchaser Covenants Condition], as applicable, not to be satisfied, (B) by
Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.2(1)(d)(i) [Breach of Representations and
Warranties or Covenants by Corporation], (C) by either Corporation or
Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.2(1)(b)(i) [No Required Approval by
Shareholders], or (D) by Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.2(1)(d)(ii)(c)
[Changing Recommendation or Superior Proposal--Breach] if:

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(i)

  |  

prior to such termination but after the date hereof, an Acquisition Proposal
is made or publicly announced by any Person other than Purchaser or any of its
affiliates or any such Person shall have publicly announced an intention to do
so; and

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

within 180 days following the date of such termination, (i) such Acquisition
Proposal is consummated, or (ii) Corporation or one or more of its
Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, in one or more transactions, enters into
a contract in respect of such Acquisition Proposal and such Acquisition
Proposal is later consummated (whether or not within 180 days after such
termination).

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

For purposes of the foregoing, the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in Section 1.1, except that references to "20%
or more" shall be deemed to be references to "50% or more" and, for greater
certainty, any distribution of cash, stock or assets to Shareholders by
Corporation (by way of dividend, reduction of capital or otherwise), stock
buy-back or any similar transactions by Corporation shall be deemed not to
constitute an Acquisition Proposal.

  

  

    

(3)

  |  

The Termination Fee shall be paid by Corporation to Purchaser as follows, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, if a Termination Fee Event
occurs due to:

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

a termination of this Agreement described in Section 8.2(2)(a), within two
Business Days of the occurrence of such Termination Fee Event;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

a termination of this Agreement described in Section 8.2(2)(b), prior to or
concurrently with the occurrence of such Termination Fee Event; and

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(c)

  |  

a termination of this Agreement described in Section 8.2(2), on or prior to
the consummation of the Acquisition Proposal.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(4)

  |  

Where Purchaser Expenses have been paid by Corporation to Purchaser in
accordance with Section 8.4, any Termination Fee payable by Corporation in
accordance with this Section 8.2 shall be reduced by the amount of the
Purchaser Expenses actually paid to Purchaser.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

Section 8.3 Reverse Termination Fees

  

  

In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Corporation pursuant to
either Section 7.2(1)(c)(i) [Breach of Representations and Warranties by
Purchaser] or Section 7.2(1)(c)(iii) [Financing Failure] (a "Reverse
Termination Fee Event") then, Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to
Corporation by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account
designated by Corporation an amount equal to $24 million within two Business
Days of such termination (the "Reverse Termination Fee").

  

  

Section 8.4 Purchaser Expenses

  

  

    

(1)

  |  

In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser pursuant to
Section 7.2(1)(d)(i) [Breach of Representations and Warranties or Covenants by
Corporation], Corporation shall reimburse Purchaser for the Purchaser Expenses
actually incurred in connection with this Agreement. The Purchaser Expenses
shall be paid by Corporation to Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds within two Business Days of such termination.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(2)

  |  

Notwithstanding Section 8.4(1), in the event that any Termination Fee becomes
payable by Corporation to Purchaser in accordance with Section 8.2, the amount
of any Purchaser Expenses paid in accordance with Section 8.4(1) shall be
deducted from the amount of the Termination Fee payable.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

Section 8.5 Injunctive Relief, Specific Performance and Remedies

  

  

    

(1)

  |  

The Parties agree that irreparable harm would occur for which money damages
would not be an adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be
entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce compliance with the terms of this Agreement, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which the Parties may be entitled at
law or in equity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (including
the immediately preceding two sentences), it is explicitly agreed that:

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

Corporation shall be entitled to seek specific performance of Purchaser\'s
obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to fund its
obligations pursuant to Section 2.9 only in the event that:

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(i)

  |  

all conditions in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 have been satisfied or waived by
the applicable Party or Parties (excluding conditions that, by their terms,
cannot be satisfied until the Effective Time but are reasonably capable of
being satisfied at the Effective Time) and Purchaser fails to consummate the
Arrangement on the date on which the Effective Date should have occurred
pursuant to Section 2.8(2);

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

the financing provided for by the Term Loan Facility in the Financing Letters
(or, if alternative financing is being used in accordance with Section 4.7
pursuant to the commitments with respect thereto) in an amount equal to at
least (but no less than) the Debt Amount has been funded or will be funded on
the Effective Date if the Equity Financing is funded at the Effective Date;
and

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(iii)

  |  

Corporation has irrevocably confirmed that, if specific performance is granted
and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, it is ready, willing
and able to consummate the Arrangement including payment of the Redemption
Consideration and advance of the Corporation Loan, if applicable; and

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

Corporation shall be entitled to seek specific performance of Purchaser and
Guarantors\' obligation to enforce the terms of the Financing Letters, or if
alternative financing is being used in accordance with Section 4.7, pursuant
to the commitments with respect thereto (in each case, subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Financing Letters or in the
commitments in respect of such alternative financing, as applicable), but only
in the event that (i) all conditions in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 have been
satisfied or waived by the applicable Party or Parties (excluding conditions
that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Effective Time but are
reasonably capable of being satisfied by the Effective Time) and Purchaser
fails to consummate the Arrangement on the date on which the Effective Date
should have occurred pursuant to Section 2.8(2), and (ii) Corporation has
irrevocably confirmed that, if specific performance is granted and the Equity
Financing and Debt Financing are funded, it is ready, willing and able to
consummate the Arrangement including payment of the Redemption Consideration
and advance of the Corporation Loan, if applicable.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(2)

  |  

Subject to the foregoing and the provisions in Section 8.5(3) below, each
Party hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the
equitable remedies provided for herein and the Parties further agree that (i)
by seeking the remedies provided for in Section 8.5(1), a Party shall not in
any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be
available to a Party under this Agreement (including monetary damages), and
(ii) nothing set forth in Section 8.5(1) shall require any Party hereto to
institute any proceeding for (or limit any Party\'s right to institute any
proceeding for) specific performance under Section 8.5(1) prior or as a
condition to exercising any termination right under this Agreement (and/or
receipt of any amounts due in connection with such termination), nor shall the
commencement of any legal action or legal proceeding pursuant to Section
8.5(1) or anything set forth in Section 8.5(1) restrict or limit any Party\'s
right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof, or
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(3)

  |  

Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 8.2 and
Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that without these agreements the other Party would not enter
into this Agreement, and that the amounts set out in Section 8.2 and Section
8.3 represent liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-estimate of the
damages, including opportunity costs, which either Party will suffer or incur
as a result of the event giving rise to such damages and resultant termination
of this Agreement, and is not a penalty. Each Party irrevocably waives any
right it may have to raise as a defence that any such liquidated damages are
excessive or punitive. In the event the amounts set out in Section 8.2 or
Section 8.3 are paid to a Party (or as it directs), no other amounts will be
due and payable as damages or otherwise by the other Party, and such Party
hereby accepts that such payments are the maximum aggregate amount that such
Party shall be required to pay in lieu of any damages or any other payments or
remedy which the other Party may be entitled to in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided,
however, that this limitation shall not apply to any payments required to be
made pursuant to Section 2.4(5), Section 4.3(7), Section 4.6(3) and Section
4.7(3). In the event of the termination of this Agreement by Corporation in
accordance with Section 7.2(1)(c)(i) [Breach of Representations and Warranties
by Purchaser] or Section 7.2(1)(c)(iii) [Financing Failure], the payment of
the Reverse Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy (including
damages, specific performance and injunctive relief) of Corporation and its
affiliates against Purchaser, its affiliates and any of their respective
former, current or future directors, officers, employees, affiliates, general
or limited partners, shareholders, managers, Financing Sources, members or
agents for all breaches of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement by Purchaser and the failure of the transactions
contemplated herein to be consummated (including with respect to any loss
suffered as a result of the failure of the Arrangement to be consummated or
for a breach or failure to perform hereunder, in any case whether willfully,
intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise). In the event of termination of
this Agreement by Purchaser or Corporation in accordance with a Termination
Fee Event, the payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.2(2)(a),
Section 8.2(2)(b) or Section 8.2(2)(c), as applicable, shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy (including damages, specific performance and injunctive
relief) of Purchaser and its affiliates against Corporation, its affiliates
and any of their respective former, current or future directors, officers,
employees, affiliates, general or limited partners, shareholders, managers,
members or agents for all breaches of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained in this Agreement by Corporation and the failure of the
transactions contemplated herein to be consummated (including with respect to
any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Arrangement to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder, in any case
whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise). For the
avoidance of doubt, while either Party may pursue both a grant of specific
performance and the payment of the Termination Fee or Reverse Termination Fee,
as applicable, under no circumstances shall either Party be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and any money
damages, including all or any portion of the Termination Fee or Reverse
Termination Fee, as applicable.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

Section 8.6 Expenses

  

  

Except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, all out-of-pocket third
party transaction expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Plan of Arrangement, including all costs, expenses and fees of Corporation
incurred prior to or after the Effective Date in connection with, or
incidental to, the Plan of Arrangement, shall be paid by the Party incurring
such expenses, whether or not the Arrangement is consummated.

Any notice or other communication is deemed to be given and received (i) if
sent by personal delivery or same day courier, on the date of delivery if it
is a Business Day and the delivery was made prior to 4:30 p.m. (local time in
place of receipt) and otherwise on the next Business Day, (ii) if sent by
overnight courier, on the next Business Day, or (iii) if sent by facsimile, on
the Business Day following the date of confirmation of transmission by the
originating facsimile. A Party may change its address for service from time to
time by providing a notice in accordance with the foregoing. Any subsequent
notice or other communication must be sent to the Party at its changed
address. Any element of a Party\'s address that is not specifically changed in
a notice will be assumed not to be changed. Sending a copy of a notice or
other communication to a Party\'s legal counsel as contemplated above is for
information purposes only and does not constitute delivery of the notice or
other communication to that Party. The failure to send a copy of a notice or
other communication to legal counsel does not invalidate delivery of that
notice or other communication to a Party.

  

  

Section 8.8 Time of the Essence

  

  

Time is of the essence in this Agreement.

  

  

Section 8.9 Further Assurances

  

  

Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Parties will, from time to
time, do all acts and things and execute and deliver all such further
documents and instruments, as the other Party may, either before or after the
Effective Date, reasonably require to effectively carry out or better evidence
or perfect the full intent and meaning of this Agreement and, in the event the
Arrangement becomes effective, to document or evidence any of the transactions
or events set out in the Plan of Arrangement.

  

  

Section 8.10 Third Party Beneficiaries

  

  

    

(1)

  |  

Except as provided below or in Section 4.11 and Section 2.4(5) and which,
without limiting their terms, are intended as stipulations for the benefit of
the third Persons mentioned in such provisions (such third Persons referred to
in this Section 8.10, including the Financing Sources, as the "Third Party
Beneficiaries") and except for the rights of the Shareholders to receive the
Consideration following the Effective Time pursuant to the Arrangement (for
which purpose Corporation hereby confirms that it is acting as agent on behalf
of the Shareholders), Corporation, Purchaser and Guarantors intend that this
Agreement will not benefit or create any right or cause of action in favour of
any Person, other than the Parties and that no Person, other than the Parties,
shall be entitled to rely on the provisions of this Agreement in any action,
suit, proceeding, hearing or other forum.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(2)

  |  

Despite the foregoing, Purchaser and Guarantors acknowledge to each of the
Third Party Beneficiaries their direct rights against it under Section 4.6,
Section 4.11 and Section 2.4(5) respectively of this Agreement, which are
intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Third Party
Beneficiary, his or her heirs and his or her legal representatives, and for
such purpose, Corporation confirms that it is acting as trustee on their
behalf, and agrees to enforce such provisions on their behalf. The Parties
reserve their right to vary or rescind the rights at any time and in any way
whatsoever, if any, granted by or under this Agreement to any Person who is
not a Party other than a Third Party Beneficiary, without notice to or consent
of that Person.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(3)

  |  

Each of Corporation, Purchaser and each of the Guarantors acknowledges to each
Financing Source, as a Third Party Beneficiary, their direct rights against it
under the Financing Source Sections, which are intended for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each Financing Source, its heirs and its legal
representatives.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

Section 8.11 No Liability

  

  

No director or officer of Corporation or any of its affiliates or Subsidiaries
shall have any personal liability whatsoever to Purchaser under this Agreement
or any other document delivered in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby on behalf of Corporation or any of its affiliates or
Subsidiaries. No director or officer of Purchaser shall have any personal
liability whatsoever to Corporation under this Agreement or any other document
delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby on behalf of
Purchaser.

  

  

Section 8.12 Waiver

  

  

No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement will constitute a waiver
of any other provision (whether or not similar). No waiver will be binding
unless executed in writing by the Party to be bound by the waiver. A Party\'s
failure or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement will not operate
as a waiver of that right. A single or partial exercise of any right will not
preclude a Party from any other or further exercise of that right or the
exercise of any other right.

  

  

Section 8.13 Entire Agreement

  

  

This Agreement, together with the Confidentiality Agreement and the
Corporation Disclosure Letter, constitutes the entire agreement between the
Parties with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions,
whether oral or written, of the Parties. There are no representations,
warranties, covenants, conditions or other agreements, express or implied,
collateral, statutory or otherwise, between the Parties in connection with the
subject matter of this Agreement, except as specifically set forth in this
Agreement. The Parties have not relied and are not relying on any other
information, discussion or understanding in entering into and completing the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

Section 8.14 Successors and Assigns

  

  

    

(1)

  |  

This Agreement becomes effective only when executed by Corporation and
Purchaser. After that time, it will be binding upon and enure to the benefit
of Corporation, Purchaser, Guarantors and their respective successors and

Delivery of Consideration

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(1) Upon the surrender to the Depositary of a certificate which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Common Shares together
with a duly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal (it being understood
that AmalCo Preferred Shares and AmalCo Common Shares will be evidenced by the
certificates evidencing Common Shares as no certificates will be issued in
accordance with Section 3.1(d)(ii)), and such additional documents and
instruments as the Depositary may reasonably require, the Shareholder
surrendering such certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange for
each Common Share represented thereby, and the Depositary shall, in exchange,
deliver to the applicable Shareholder as soon as practicable and in accordance
with Section 3.1(f) , a cheque (or other form of immediately available funds)
representing the cash amount that such Shareholder is entitled to receive
under the Arrangement, less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 5.3.

  

  

(2) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Depositary shall
deliver on behalf of Corporation to each holder of Options, RSUs and DSUs, in
accordance with Section 3.1(c), a cheque (or other form of immediately
available funds) representing the cash amount that such holder of Options,
RSUs or DSUs is entitled to receive under the Arrangement, as applicable, less
any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 5.3.

  

  

(3) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 5.1, each certificate
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Common
Shares shall be deemed, immediately after the completion of the transactions
contemplated in Section 3.1, to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender cash in lieu of such certificate as contemplated in Section 3.1. Any
such certificate formerly representing outstanding Common Shares not duly
surrendered on or before the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Date
shall cease to represent a claim by or interest of any former Shareholder of
any kind or nature against or in Corporation, AmalCo, Purchaser or any other
Person.

  

  

(4) Any payment made by way of cheque by the Depositary on behalf of
Corporation, AmalCo or Purchaser, pursuant to the Arrangement that has not
been deposited or has been returned to the Depositary or that otherwise
remains unclaimed, in each case, on or before the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the Effective Date, and any right or claim to payment hereunder that remains
outstanding on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Date shall cease
to represent a right or claim of any kind or nature and the right of any
Shareholder or holder of Options, RSUs or DSUs to receive the consideration
for any Common Shares, Options, RSUs or DSUs pursuant to the Arrangement shall
terminate and be deemed to be surrendered and forfeited to Purchaser or
Corporation, as the case may be, for no consideration and shall cease to
represent a right or claim of any kind or nature.

  

  

(5) No Shareholder or holder of Options, RSUs or DSUs shall be entitled to
receive any consideration with respect to Common Shares, Options, RSUs or DSUs
other than the consideration to which such Shareholder or holder of Options,
RSUs or DSUs is entitled to receive in accordance with Section 3.1, and no
such Shareholder or holder of Options, RSUs or DSUs shall be entitled to
receive any interest, dividends, premium or other payment in connection
therewith, other than, subject to complying with Section 5.1 or 5.2, any
declared but unpaid dividends with a record date prior to the Effective Date.
No dividend or other distribution declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to Common Shares, Options, RSUs or DSUs with a record date on or
after the Effective Date shall be delivered to the holder of any unsurrendered
certificate which, immediately prior to the Effective Date, represented
outstanding Common Shares, Options, RSUs or DSUs.

  

  

    

Section 5.2

  |  

Lost Certificates

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented one or more outstanding Common Shares that were transferred
pursuant to Section 3.1(e), shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary will pay and
deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the cash
amount which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(f),
net of amounts required to be withheld pursuant to Section 5.3. When
authorizing such payment and delivery in exchange for any lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, the Person to whom the payment is made shall, as a
condition precedent to the delivery thereof, give a bond satisfactory to
Corporation, Purchaser and the Depositary in such sum as Purchaser may direct
or otherwise indemnify Purchaser in a manner satisfactory to Purchaser against
any claim that may be made against Purchaser with respect to the certificate
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

that makes a payment hereunder shall be entitled to (i) deduct and withhold
from any consideration otherwise payable to any Shareholder or holder of
Options, RSUs or DSUs under this Plan of Arrangement, such amounts as
Purchaser, AmalCo, Corporation or the Depositary is directed to deduct and
withhold or required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under
the Tax Act or any provision of provincial, state, local or foreign tax law,
subject to the provisions of any applicable income tax treaty between Canada
and the country where the Shareholder or holder of Options, RSUs or DSUs is
resident, and (ii) remit such deduction or withholding amount to or for
remittance to the appropriate Governmental Entity. To the extent that amounts
are so deducted and withheld, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes as having been paid to the Shareholder or holder of
Options, RSUs or DSUs, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

---|--- 
 

  

  

Purchaser has delivered to Corporation a complete and accurate copy of (i) an
executed commitment letter (the "Equity Letter") from GTCR Fund IX/A LP
pursuant to which the party thereto agrees to provide, subject to the terms
and conditions therein, equity financing to Purchaser or Guarantors in the
amount set forth therein (the "Equity Financing"), and (ii) an executed
commitment letter from (1) Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Credit
Suisse AG, (2) Goldman Sachs Bank USA and (3) RBC Capital Markets LLC and
Royal Bank of Canada (collectively with all exhibits thereto, and the redacted
fee letter referred to therein, the "Financing Letters"), pursuant to which
the lenders party thereto have committed to provide, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, debt financing in the amounts set forth therein
for, among other things, the purpose of financing the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (being collectively referred to as the "Debt
Financing", and together with the Equity Financing referred to as the
"Financing"). The Equity Letter is a valid and binding obligation of Purchaser
or Guarantors (as applicable) and GTCR Fund IX/A LP, GTCR Partners IX, L.P.

warranties of Corporation set forth in this Agreement and performance by
Corporation of its obligations hereunder, the net proceeds contemplated by the

Consideration, to make payments in respect of any fees and expenses required

constitute a default or breach on the part of any of Purchaser, Guarantors or
GTCR Fund IX/A LP under the Equity Letter or Purchaser or Guarantors under the
Financing Letters or, to the knowledge of Purchaser, any other parties thereto
or under the Equity Letter, or a failure of any condition to the Financing or
otherwise result in any portion of the Financing contemplated thereby to be
unavailable and (ii) subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in Article 6, Purchaser has no reason to expect that any of the conditions of
any of Purchaser or Guarantors to the Financing will fail to be timely
satisfied or that the full amount of the Term Loan Facility in the Financing
(with respect to the Debt Financing in an amount equal to at least (but no
less than) the Debt Amount), will not be available at the Effective Time.
There are no conditions precedent related to the funding or investing, as
applicable, of the full amount of the Financing, other than as set forth in or
contemplated by the Financing Letters and the Equity Letter. Purchaser,
Guarantors and GTCR Fund IX/A LP have paid in full any and all commitment fees
or other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Equity Letter
and the Financing Letters on or before the date of this Agreement, and will
pay in full any such amounts due on or prior to the Effective Time. There are
no side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements to which any of
Purchaser or Guarantors is a party which are related to the funding of the
full amount of the Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Equity
Letter and the Financing Letters. Guarantors will have at the Effective Time
at least $38 million in cash on hand available for purposes of financing the
transactions contemplated by the Arrangement and have and will have at the
Effective Time sufficient funds and assets to otherwise cover any and all
obligations of Purchaser hereunder including the obligation to pay the Reverse

Dear Sirs/Mesdames:

  

  

Re: Support and Voting Agreement

  

  

I understand that Purchaser (the "Purchaser") and Corporation (the

date hereof (the "Arrangement Agreement") contemplating an arrangement of the
Corporation pursuant to Section 192 of the Canada Business CorporationsAct
(the "Arrangement"), the result of which shall be the Purchaser\'s acquisition
of all the outstanding common shares of the Corporation (the "Common Shares").
I am the registered and beneficial owner of Common Shares (collectively, the
"Holder Securities").

  

  

I, , hereby agree, in my capacity as securityholder and not in my capacity as
an officer or director of the Corporation, from the date hereof until the
earlier of (i) the date the Arrangement Agreement is terminated in accordance
with its terms and (ii) the Outside Date (as defined in the Arrangement
Agreement):

to vote or to cause to be voted the Holder Securities, and any other
securities directly or indirectly acquired by or issued to the undersigned
after the date hereof (including, without limitation, any Common Shares issued
upon further exercise of options to purchase Common Shares), in favour of the
Arrangement and any other matter necessary for the consummation of the
Arrangement at the meeting of shareholders of the Corporation held to consider
the Arrangement (or any adjournment thereof);

   
---|---

affect the success of the Arrangement;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(d)

  |  

except in my capacity as director or officer to the extent permitted by the
Arrangement Agreement, not to, directly or indirectly, make or participate in
or take any action that would reasonably be expected to result in an
Acquisition Proposal (as such term is defined in the Arrangement Agreement),
or engage in any discussion, negotiation or inquiries relating thereto or
accept any Acquisition Proposal; and

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(e)

  |  

not to, directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, pledge or assign or agree to
sell, transfer, pledge or assign any of the Holder Securities or any interest
therein, without the Purchaser\'s prior written consent.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

I hereby represent and warrant that (a) I am the sole beneficial owner of the
Holder Securities with good and marketable title thereto, free of any and all
encumbrances and demands of any nature or kind whatsoever, and I have the sole
right to vote and sell (in the case of transferable Holder Securities) all of
the Holder Securities, (b) except for the Arrangement Agreement, no person has
any agreement or option, or any right or privilege (whether by law, preemptive
or contractual) capable of becoming an agreement or option for the purchase,
acquisition or transfer from the undersigned of any of the Holder Securities
or any interest therein or right thereto, and (c) the only securities of the
Corporation (other than Options, RSUs and DSUs (as such terms are defined in
the Arrangement Agreement), as applicable) beneficially owned, directly or
indirectly, by the undersigned on the date hereof are the Holder Securities.

  

  

Notwithstanding any provision of this letter agreement to the contrary, but
subject to the terms and conditions of the Arrangement Agreement, I, in my
capacity as director or officer of the Corporation, shall not be limited or
restricted in any way whatsoever in the exercise of my fiduciary duties as
director or officer of the Corporation.

If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding and is agreed to by
the Purchaser, please signify your acceptance by executing the enclosed copies
of this letter where indicated below and returning the same to the
undersigned, upon which this letter as so accepted shall constitute an
agreement among us.
