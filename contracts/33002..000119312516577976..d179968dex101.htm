---|---|--- 



     | (i) | At least three (3) Business Days before the Closing Date,

Capital Statement"), certified by the chief financial officer of Seller,
setting forth an estimate of Closing Working Capital as of the last day of the
most recently ended month for which financial statements are available (the
"Estimated Working Capital"). The Estimated Working Capital Statement and the
determinations and calculations contained therein shall be calculated in
accordance with the Accounting Principles and in the same manner as set forth
in the Sample Working Capital Statement. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | In the event that the Estimated Working Capital is greater

---|--- 



     | (ii) | After receipt of the Closing Working Capital Statement,

Working Capital Statement. During the Review Period, Buyer and Buyers
Accountants shall have full access to the books and records of the Company,
the personnel of, and work papers prepared by, Seller or Sellers Accountants
to the extent that they relate to the Closing Working Capital Statement
and to such historical financial information (to the extent in Sellers
possession or under Sellers control) relating to the Closing Working Capital
Statement as Buyer may reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing the
Closing Working Capital Statement and to prepare a Statement of Objections
(defined below), _provided_ , _that_ such access shall be in a manner that

---|---|---

may object to the Closing Working Capital Statement by delivering to Seller a
written statement setting forth Buyers objections in reasonable
detail, indicating each disputed item or amount and the basis for Buyers
disagreement therewith (the "Statement of Objections"). If Buyer fails to
deliver the Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Review
Period, the Closing Working Capital Statement and the Closing Working Capital
reflected in the Closing Working Capital Statement shall be deemed to have
been accepted by Buyer. If Buyer delivers the Statement of Objections before
the expiration of the Review Period, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve such objections within 30 days after the delivery of the
Statement of Objections (the "Resolution Period"), and, if the same are so
resolved within the Resolution Period, the Closing Working Capital and the
Closing Working Capital Statement with such changes as may have been
previously agreed in writing by Buyer and Seller, shall be final and binding. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iv) |

If Seller and Buyer fail to reach an agreement with respect to all of the
matters set forth in the Statement of Objections before expiration of the
Resolution Period, then any amounts remaining in dispute ("Disputed Amounts",
and any amounts not so disputed, the "Undisputed Amounts") shall be submitted
for resolution to an impartial nationally recognized firm of independent
certified public accountants other than Sellers Accountants or Buyers
Accountants to be appointed by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller (the
"Independent Accountants") who, acting as experts 

---|---|--- 
 



14 and make any adjustments to the Closing Working Capital and the Closing
Working Capital Statement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Independent
Accountants shall only consider and have authority to resolve the Disputed
Amounts and shall have no other rights or obligations with respect to any
Undisputed Amounts, including but not limited, audit rights. The parties
hereto agree that all adjustments shall be made in accordance with the
Accounting Principles and without regard to materiality. The Independent
Accountants shall only decide the specific items under dispute by the parties
and their decision for each Disputed Amount must be within the range of
values assigned to each such item in the Closing Working Capital Statement and
the Statement of Objections, respectively, the difference between which, in
the aggregate, shall be referred to as the "Disputed Amount Range". 
---|--- 



     | (v) | Buyer and Seller shall each bear fifty percent (50%) of all
fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants; _provided_ , _that_ , if the
Independent Accountants determine the Disputed Amounts to be within ten
percent (10% measured by the Disputed Amount Range) of Buyers calculations as
set forth in the Statement of Objections, then Seller shall be responsible for
all of the fees and expenses of Independent Accountants, and if the
Independent Accountants determine the Disputed Amounts to be within ten
percent (10% measured by the Disputed Amount Range) of the calculations set
forth in the Closing Working Capital Statement, then Buyer shall bear all fees
and expenses of the Independent Accountants. For purposes of clarification,
if the Disputed Amount Range is $500,000 and the Independent Accountants
determination of the Disputed Amounts is within $50,000 of the amounts
reflected in the Statement of Objections, then Seller shall be responsible
for all of the fees of the Independent Accountants. If the Independent
Accountants determination of the Disputed Amounts is within $50,000 of the
amounts reflected in the Closing Working Capital Statement, then Buyer
shall be responsible for all of the fees of the Independent Accountants. 
---|---|--- 



     | (vi) | The Independent Accountants shall make a determination as
soon as practicable within 30 days (or such other time as the parties hereto
shall agree in writing) after their engagement, and their resolution of the
Disputed Amounts and their adjustments to the Closing Working Capital
Statement or the Closing Working Capital shall be conclusive and binding upon
the parties hereto. 
---|---|--- 



     | (vii) |

No later than five (5) Business Days after the expiration of the Review Period
if Buyer does not dispute any items in the Closing Working Capital Statement
or, if Buyer disputes items in the

its Subsidiaries participates in a multiemployer plan as defined in ERISA
3(37), this sale contemplated by this Agreement will not trigger
multiemployer plan withdrawal liability and that to the extent that Ennis
participates in any multiemployer plans, they will indemnify Buyer from such
withdrawal liability.

 

(e) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan (i) no such plan is a "multiple
employer plan" within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code or a

ERISA); (ii) no such plan is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the

of ERISA, has occurred with respect to any such plan.

 

(f) Except as required by applicable Law, no provision of any Company Benefit
Plan or collective bargaining agreement could reasonably be expected to
result in any limitation on Buyer from amending or terminating any Company
Benefit Plan. The Company has no commitment or obligation and has not made any
representations to any employee, officer, director, consultant or
independent contractor, whether or not legally binding, to adopt, amend or
modify in any material respect any Company Benefit Plan or any collective
bargaining agreement, in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise.

(g) Other than as required under Section 601 et. seq. of ERISA or other
applicable Law, no Company Benefit Plan provides post-termination or retiree
welfare benefits to any individual for any reason, and neither the Company nor
any of its ERISA Affiliates has any Liability to provide post-termination or
retiree welfare benefits to any individual or has ever contracted or, to
Sellers Knowledge, has ever represented or promised to any individual that

Plan or collective bargaining agreement that would materially increase the
annual expense of maintaining such plan above the level of the expense

director, officer, employee, consultant or independent contractor, as
applicable. Seller does not have any commitment or obligation and has not made
any representations to any director, officer, employee, consultant or
independent contractor, whether or not legally binding, to adopt, amend or
modify any Company Benefit Plan or any collective bargaining agreement.

 

(j) Each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the Code has
been operated in compliance, in all material respects, with such section and
all applicable regulatory guidance (including notices, rulings and proposed

compensation plan that is subject to Section 409A of the Code.

Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing and shall disclose only that
portion of such information which Seller is advised by its counsel in writing
is legally required to be disclosed, _provided that_ Seller shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order or other
reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such
information.

 

Section 5.07 Non-competition; Non-solicitation.

 

(a) For a period of five years commencing on the Closing Date (the "Restricted
Period"), Seller shall not, and shall not permit any of its controlled
Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, (i) engage in or assist others in
engaging in the Restricted Business anywhere in the world; (ii) have a
material interest in any Person that engages directly or indirectly in the
Restricted Business anywhere in the world in any capacity, including as a

consultant; or (iii) intentionally interfere in any material respect with the
business relationships (whether formed prior to or after the date of this
Agreement) between the Company and customers or suppliers of the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller may (A) own, directly or indirectly,
solely as an investment, securities of any Person traded on any national
securities exchange if Seller is not a controlling Person of, or a member of a
group which controls, such Person and does not, directly or indirectly, own 5%
or more of any class of securities of such Person, (B) continue to operate
its retained businesses as such retained businesses have been conducted prior
to and on the date of this Agreement, and (C) perform any services for Buyer
or its Affiliates, including such services as are contemplated under

not, and shall not permit any of its controlled Affiliates to, directly or

employment, except pursuant to a general solicitation which is not directed
specifically to any such employees; _provided_ , that nothing in this Section
5.07(b) shall prevent Seller or any of its controlled Affiliates from hiring

employee whose employment has been terminated by the employee.

 

(c) During the Restricted Period, Seller shall not, and shall not permit any
of its controlled Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, solicit or entice,
or attempt to solicit or entice, any clients or customers of the Company or
potential clients or customers of the Company for purposes of diverting their
business or services from the Company.

 

(d) Seller acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach of this Section
5.07 would give rise to irreparable harm to Buyer, for which monetary damages
would not be an adequate remedy, and hereby agrees that in the event of a
breach or a threatened breach by Seller of any such obligations, Buyer shall,
in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may be available to
it in respect of such breach, be entitled to equitable relief, including a
temporary restraining order, an injunction, specific performance and any other
relief that may be available from a court of competent jurisdiction (without
any requirement to post bond).

(e) Seller acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Section 5.07
are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Buyer and
constitute a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that
any covenant contained in this Section 5.07 should ever be adjudicated to
exceed the time, geographic, product or service, or other limitations
permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any court is expressly
empowered to reform such covenant, and such covenant shall be deemed
reformed, in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic, product or
service, or other limitations permitted by applicable Law. The covenants
contained in this Section 5.07 and each provision hereof are severable and
distinct covenants and provisions. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
such covenant or provision as written shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable the remaining covenants or provisions hereof, and any such
invalidity or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other jurisdiction.

 



46 (f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Section
5.07 shall restrict Seller or any of its Affiliates from taking commercially
reasonable steps to carry out its rights and obligations under any of the
Transaction Documents.

 

Section 5.08 Governmental Approvals and Consents.

 

(a) Each party hereto shall, as promptly as possible, (i) make, or cause or be
made, all filings and submissions (including those under the HSR Act and the

Affiliates; and (ii) use reasonable best efforts (excluding any payment of
money or divestiture of assets) to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all
consents, authorizations, orders and approvals from all Governmental
Authorities that may be or become necessary, in each case, for its execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the performance of its obligations pursuant
to this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. Each party shall
cooperate fully with the other party and its Affiliates in promptly seeking to

delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any required consents,
authorizations, orders and approvals.

(b) Seller and Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to give all notices
to, and obtain all consents from, all third parties that are described in
Section 3.05 of the Disclosure Schedules.

subsections (a) and (b) above, each of the parties hereto shall use all

action that would restrain, alter or enjoin the transactions contemplated by

the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Transaction Document has been issued, to have such
Governmental Order vacated or lifted. 
---|---|--- 

(d) If any consent, approval or authorization necessary to preserve the rights
or benefits under any Contract listed on Section 5.08(d) of the Disclosure
Schedules is not obtained prior to the Closing, Seller shall, subsequent to
the Closing, cooperate with Buyer and the Company in attempting to obtain such
consent, approval or authorization as promptly thereafter as practicable.
Until such consent, approval or authorization is obtained (or if such consent,
approval or authorization cannot be obtained), Seller shall use its reasonable
best efforts to provide the Company with the rights and benefits of such
Contract for the term thereof, and, if Seller provides such rights and
benefits, the Company shall assume all obligations and burdens thereunder.

 



47 (e) All analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals made by or on behalf of
either party before any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of
any Governmental Authority, in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereunder (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including any Tax Returns,
any interactions between Seller or the Company with Governmental Authorities
in the ordinary course of business, any disclosure which is not permitted by
Law or any disclosure containing confidential information) shall be disclosed
to the other party hereunder in advance of any filing, submission or
attendance, it being the intent that the parties will consult and cooperate
with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in
connection with any such analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals. Each
party shall give notice to the other party with respect to any meeting,
discussion, appearance or contact with any Governmental Authority or the
staff or regulators of any Governmental Authority, with such notice being
sufficient to provide the other party with the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meeting, discussion, appearance or contact.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.08 shall require,
or be construed to require, Buyer or any of its Affiliates to agree to (i)
sell, hold, divest, discontinue or limit, before or after the Closing Date,
any assets, businesses or interests of Buyer, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates; (ii) any conditions relating to, or changes or
restrictions in, the operations of any such assets, businesses or interests
which, in either case, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect or materially and adversely impact the economic or business
benefits to Buyer of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or
(iii) any material modification or waiver of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

(a) Seller shall pay, when due, to Irshad Ahmad all benefits to which he is
entitled under the deferred compensation plan in which he participates, in
accordance with Section 409A of the Code and will indemnify and hold Buyer

(b) Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from all Liabilities in
respect of the Ahmad Employment Agreement and Irshad Ahmads employment with

obligations as set forth in the Ahmad Employment Agreement or (iii) any

taken or omitted to be taken by the Company or any of its Affiliates after

in the event that such actions or the omission of such actions had not
occurred. 

Section 5.11 Employment-Related Liabilities. Effective as of the Closing Date,
Buyer shall assume all Liabilities resulting from any workers compensation
claim by any former or current employee of the Company that results from an
accident, incident or event occurring, or from an occupational disease which

49  the extent such Liabilities would have been borne by Seller. If Buyer is
unable to assume any such Liability (or any portion thereof) or the
administration of any such claim because of the operation of applicable Law
or for any other reason, Seller shall retain such Liability and Buyer shall
reimburse and otherwise fully indemnify Seller for such Liability, including
the costs of administering the plans, programs or arrangements under which
any such Liabilities have accrued or otherwise arisen.

Section 5.12 Joinder Agreement. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the
Joinder Agreement shall continue in full force and effect from and after the

of triggering any obligation of Seller under the Joinder Agreement. In the
event that Buyer or any of its Affiliates takes any action or omits to take

pursuant to the terms of the Joinder Agreement, then Buyer shall reimburse
and otherwise fully indemnify Seller for such Liability.

provide to Buyer evidence of such distribution in form reasonably satisfactory
to Buyer.

50  reasonably required to carry out the provisions hereof and give effect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Further, Seller shall
cooperate in good faith with requests from Buyer, between the date hereof and
the Closing Date, to restructure the transactions contemplated hereunder
(whether for purposes of maximizing the integration of the Company and its
operations with Buyers operations, for purposes of preserving
tax efficiency, or for other purposes), including, for the avoidance of
doubt, transferring any of the assets or Subsidiaries of the Company or any of
the Acquired Assets to an entity designated by Buyer; _provided, however,_
that any such restructuring shall (i) not cause Seller to be in a worse
position than if this Agreement had been implemented without such
restructuring, including, but not limited to, by causing Seller or any of its
Affiliates to incur any additional Taxes or adversely affecting the Tax
characterization of any gain or loss arising pursuant to this Agreement than
would be the case if such restructuring had not taken place, (ii) in the case
of any conversion of the corporate form of the Mexican Subsidiaries, be
carried out as a so-called "F Reorg" and (iii) not include any check-the-box
election that is effective as of or retroactive to any date prior to the
Closing Date; and _provided further_ , that in no event shall any actions
taken by Buyer pursuant to this Section 5.18 delay the Closing in the event
that all other conditions to the Closing have been satisfied. For the
avoidance of doubt, if any restructuring requested by Buyer pursuant to
this Section 5.18 resulted in a higher amount of the Taxes described in
Section 6.01(d) than would be the case without such restructuring, Buyer shall
be responsible for such excess.

 

ARTICLE VI

TAX MATTERS 

Section 6.01 Tax Covenants.

 

(a) All transfer (including real property transfer or gains), documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration, excise, recordation, value added and other
similar Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) that may be
imposed on or assessed as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, together with any interest, additions or penalties with respect
thereto ("Transfer Taxes") shall be borne 100% by Buyer. The parties shall
cooperate in the preparation and filing of any Tax Returns for Transfer Taxes.
Buyer shall file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all such Transfer Taxes and, if required by applicable Law, the
parties to this Agreement shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, join in
the execution of any such Tax Returns or other documentation. Expenses
incurred in connection with filing all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes shall be borne 100% by
Buyer.

(b) Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Tax Returns required
to be filed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date
with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Any such Tax Return shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required
by Law) and without a change of any election or any accounting method and
shall be submitted by Seller to Buyer (together with schedules, statements
and, to the extent requested by Seller, supporting documentation) at least 45
days prior to the due date (including extensions) of such Tax Return. If Buyer
objects to any item on any such Tax Return, it shall, within ten days after
delivery of such Tax Return, notify Seller in writing that it so objects,
specifying with particularity any such item and stating the specific factual
or legal basis for any such objection. If a notice of objection shall be duly
delivered,

 



51  Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith and use their reasonable best
efforts to resolve such items. If Buyer and Seller are unable to reach such
agreement within ten days after receipt by Seller of such notice, the
disputed items shall be resolved by a nationally recognized accounting firm
selected by Buyer and reasonably acceptable to Seller (the "Accounting
Referee") and any determination by the Accounting Referee shall be final. The
Accounting Referee shall resolve any disputed items within twenty days of
having the item referred to it pursuant to such procedures as it may require.
If the Accounting Referee is unable to resolve any disputed items before
the due date for such Tax Return, the Tax Return shall be filed as prepared
by Seller and then amended to reflect the Accounting Referees resolution. The
costs, fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be borne equally by
Buyer and Seller. The preparation and filing of any Tax Return of the Company
that does not relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be exclusively within
the control of Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that, pursuant to the terms set
forth in the Transition Services Agreement, Seller shall prepare on Buyers
behalf any Sales and Use Tax Return of the Company that relates to the period
of time from the Closing Date through the date on which the Transition
Services Agreement terminates pursuant to its terms. For the avoidance of
doubt, Buyer shall have no responsibility for preparing or filing any Tax
Return of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (other than the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries) or any Tax Return of an Affiliated Group of which Seller or
any Affiliate of Seller (other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) is
a member.

(c) Following the Closing, Buyer will not, unless required under applicable
Tax Law, (i) file (or cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to file) an amended Tax Return with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for a Tax period beginning before the Closing Date without the
prior written consent of Seller or (ii) cause or permit the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to make any Tax election that has retroactive effect to any
Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date without the prior written
consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary but subject to Section 5.18,
Seller shall be responsible for any Mexican source capital gains or income
Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest) that may result from the
indirect transfer of the Mexican Subsidiaries pursuant to the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.02 Tax Indemnification. Seller shall indemnify the Company, Buyer,
and each Buyer Indemnitee and hold them harmless from and against (a) any Loss
attributable to any breach of or inaccuracy in any of the Tax Representations;
(b) any Loss attributable to any breach or violation by Seller of, or failure
of Seller to fully perform, any covenant, agreement, undertaking or obligation
in this Article VI; (c) all Taxes of the Company or relating to the business
of the Company for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, including but not limited to,
any income tax, value added tax, customs duties or similar taxes resulting
from any breach of the IMMEX status of the Mexican Subsidiaries in Pre-Closing
Tax Periods; (d) all income or franchise Taxes of any member of an Affiliated
Group (other than an Affiliated Group that includes Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)) of which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor of the Company or
its Subsidiaries) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date that are
imposed on the Company or its Subsidiaries under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6 or any comparable provisions of foreign, state or local Law (but
excluding any such liability for such Taxes to the extent directly

 



52  or indirectly attributable to membership in any Affiliated Group for any
period (or any portion of a period) beginning after the Closing Date); and (e)
any and all Taxes of any Person imposed on the Company or its Subsidiaries
arising under the principles of transferee or successor liability or by
contract, if the liability for such Taxes relates to an event or transaction
both occurring before the Closing Date and effected or entered into by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date, in each of the
above cases, together with any out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including
attorneys and accountants fees) incurred in connection therewith; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall not be responsible for, and shall
have no obligation to indemnify and hold Company, Buyer, or any Buyer
Indemnitee harmless from and against (1) Taxes resulting from (A) any
transactions occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing outside the
ordinary course of business or (B) any breach by Buyer of Section 6.01(c), or
(2) Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are treated as a liability in the
calculation of Closing Working Capital. Seller shall reimburse Buyer for any
Taxes of the Company that are the responsibility of Seller pursuant to this
Section 6.02 within ten (10) Business Days after payment of such Taxes by
Buyer or the Company, which reimbursements, in the aggregate, shall not
exceed an amount equal to the Purchase Price.

Section 6.03 Straddle Period. In the case of Taxes that are payable with
respect to a taxable period that begins on or before and ends after the
Closing Date (each such period, a "Straddle Period"), the portion of any such
Taxes that are treated as Pre-Closing Taxes for purposes of this Agreement
shall be:

(a) in the case of Taxes based upon, or related to, income or
receipts, deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the taxable
year ended on the Closing Date; and

(b) in the case of other Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the
entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the number of days in the entire period.

 

Section 6.04 Election.

 

(a) Election.



     | (i) |

Buyer and Seller agree (1) to make an Asset Sale Election with respect to the
purchase and sale of the Units of the Company hereunder and (2) that, solely
with respect to the deemed purchase (as applicable for Tax purposes) of the
Equity Securities of the Mexican Subsidiaries, Buyer is permitted to make an
election, if available under applicable Tax Law, under Section 338(g) of the
Code (together with any corresponding elections under state, local, or foreign
Law), provided that such election under Section 338(g) of the Code (together
with any corresponding elections under state, local, or foreign Law) must be
made within one year after the Closing Date and Buyer must notify Seller in
writing within five Business Days of making such elections. 

---|---|--- 
 



53 the Closing Date, Seller may, by written notice to Buyer (the "Additional Tax
Gross-Up Notice"), demand payment for any additional amount necessary to
cause Sellers after-Tax net proceeds (after taking into account any Tax with
respect to payments made under this Section 6.04(a)(ii) and any liability
under Section 6.04(a)(iii) (which for this purpose shall be treated as a
Tax)) from the sale of the Units and Acquired Assets to be equal to the after-
Tax net proceeds that Seller would have received had the Asset Sale Election
and any election under Section 338(g) of the Code (together with any
corresponding elections under state, local, or foreign Law) not been made,
taking into account all appropriate federal, state, local and foreign Tax
implications (such additional amount, the "Additional Tax Gross-Up Amount"); 
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not be liable for any such
Additional Tax Gross-Up Amount to the extent Sellers additional Tax liability
relates to the failure of any of the representations set forth in Section
3.22 to be true and correct in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
The Additional Tax Gross-Up Notice shall include an itemized calculation in
reasonable detail of the Additional Tax Gross-Up Amount along
with appropriate supporting documentation and work papers used in the
preparation thereof, but may exclude any information that is not directly
related to the calculation of the Additional Tax Gross-Up Amount. Buyer shall
have 30 days following receipt of the Additional Tax Gross-Up Notice during
which to review the Additional Tax Gross-Up Amount, together with the
supporting documentation, work papers and any other information Buyer may
reasonably request, and to notify Seller in writing of any dispute of the
Additional Tax Gross-Up Amount, which notice shall set forth in reasonable
detail each disputed item, if any, and the basis for such dispute. If Buyer
does not provide written notice to Seller within such 30 day period
disputing Sellers calculation of the Additional Tax Gross-Up Amount, then
Sellers calculation of such amount shall be deemed final. If Seller and Buyer
are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to the Additional Tax Gross-Up
Amount within 45 days following the delivery by Seller of an Additional Tax
Gross-Up Notice, such dispute shall be resolved by the Independent
Accountants. The fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne by
Buyer unless the change in the Additional Tax Gross-Up Amount is in favor of
Buyer by an amount greater than ten percent (10%) of the Additional Tax Gross-
Up Amount as set forth in the Additional Tax Gross-Up Notice, in which case
Seller shall bear all fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants.
Within five Business Days after the Additional Tax Gross-Up Amount is finally
determined under this 
---|---|--- 
 



54 Notwithstanding the foregoing, provided that Buyer has not made any election
under Section 338(g) of the Code (or any corresponding elections under state,
local, or foreign Law) other than as permitted in this Section 6.04(a),
Buyers obligation under this Section 6.04(a)(ii) shall not exceed $350,000. 
---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | Subject to Section 6.04(a)(ii), Seller shall be liable for
(and shall indemnify Buyer and the Company against any adverse consequences
arising out of any failure to pay) any Tax (other than Transfer Taxes, if
any) directly attributable to the deemed sales resulting from making the Asset
Sale Election and any election permitted to be made under Section 338(g) of
the Code (together with any corresponding elections under state, local, or
foreign Law) pursuant to Section 6.04(a)(i). To the extent any
indemnification obligation under this Section 6.04(a)(iii) is determined after
the final determination of the Additional Tax Gross-Up Amount,
Sellers indemnification obligation shall be reduced by the amount by which
the Additional Tax Gross-Up Amount would have been increased if such
indemnification obligation had been taken into account under Section
6.04(a)(ii). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iv) | Except as provided in Section 6.04(a)(i), Buyer agrees not
to make any election under Section 338(g) of the Code (or under any
corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign Law).  
---|---|--- 

(b) Allocation of Purchase Price. In connection with the Asset Sale Election
and any elections made under Section 338(g) of the Code (together with any
corresponding elections under state, local, or foreign Law) pursuant to
Section 6.04(a)(i), Seller and Buyer agree that the Purchase Price and the
Liabilities of the Company and the applicable Subsidiaries (plus other
relevant items) shall be allocated among the assets of the Company, the assets
of applicable Subsidiaries, and the Acquired Assets as shown on the allocation
schedule (the "Allocation Schedule"). A draft of the Allocation Schedule
shall be prepared by Seller and delivered to Buyer within 60 days following
the Closing Date for its approval. If Buyer notifies Seller in writing that
Buyer objects to one or more items reflected in the Allocation Schedule,
Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve any
dispute with respect to the Allocation Schedule within 30 days following
the Closing Date, such dispute shall be resolved by the Accounting Referee.
The fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne equally by Seller
and Buyer. Buyer, the Company and Seller shall file all Tax Returns (including
amended returns and claims for refund) and information reports in a manner
consistent with the Allocation Schedule, except to the extent otherwise
required by a determination (within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code). Any adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.04 herein
shall be allocated in a manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule.

 

Section 6.05 Contests. Buyer agrees to give written notice to Seller of the
receipt of any written notice by the Company, Buyer or any of Buyers
Affiliates which involves

 



55  the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any Action, in respect of
which an indemnity may be sought by Buyer pursuant to this Article VI (a "Tax
Claim");  _provided_ , _that_ failure to comply with this provision shall not
affect Buyers right to indemnification hereunder. Seller shall be entitled
(at its own expense) to participate and, at its option, take control of the
defense of any pending or threatened Tax Claim, in whole or in part
(including any resulting litigation), and to employ counsel of its choice at
its expense. If Seller elects to assume the defense of a Tax Claim, Seller
shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of all material developments relating to
such Tax Claim, and shall allow Buyer sufficient notice and opportunity to
participate in the Tax Claim to the extent of any claims for Taxes for which
Buyer (or the Company or any Subsidiary) may be liable. Neither Buyer nor
Seller shall settle or compromise (or cause to be settled or compromised) a
matter involving a claim for Taxes for which the other party may be liable
under this Agreement without the prior written consent of such other party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld. To
the extent Seller elects to control a Tax Claim pursuant to this _Section
6.05_, Seller shall use (and shall cause its Affiliates to use) its
commercially reasonable efforts to separate from any such Tax Claim any item
in respect of which an indemnity is not sought by Buyer pursuant to this
_Article VI_ , and to permit, to the greatest extent possible, Buyer to
control the contest of any such item.

 

Section 6.06 Cooperation and Exchange of Information. Seller and Buyer shall
provide each other with such cooperation and information as either of them
reasonably may request of the other in filing any Tax Return pursuant to this
Article VI or in connection with any audit or other proceeding in respect of
Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Such cooperation and
information shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions
thereof, together with accompanying schedules, related work papers and
documents relating to rulings or other determinations by any Tax
Authority. Each of Seller and Buyer shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules
and work papers, records and other documents in its possession relating to Tax
matters of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries for any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of
limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and other
documents relate, without regard to extensions except to the extent notified
by the other party in writing of such extensions for the respective Tax
periods. Prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any Tax Returns,
schedules and work papers, records and other documents in its possession
relating to Tax matters of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date, Seller or Buyer (as the
case may be) shall provide the other party with reasonable written notice and
offer the other party the opportunity to take custody of such materials.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.06 or elsewhere in this Agreement
to the contrary, Seller shall not be required to furnish to Buyer any Tax
Returns (or information related thereto) of Seller or its Affiliates (other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries), including any Tax Return of an
Affiliated Group of which Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (other than the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) is a member.

 

Section 6.07 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Any indemnification
payments pursuant to this Article VI shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price by the parties for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by
Law.

Section 6.08 Survival. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Tax Representations and this Article VI shall survive for the
full period of all applicable statutes of limitations (giving effect to any
waiver, mitigation or extension thereof) plus 60 days.

 



56 Section 6.09 Overlap. To the extent that any obligation or responsibility
pursuant to Article VIII may overlap with an obligation or responsibility
pursuant to this Article VI, the provisions of this Article VI shall govern.

 

Section 6.10 Tax Refunds. If Buyer or any of its Affiliates receives a Tax
refund arising with respect to Tax periods of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries ending on or before to the Closing Date, within fifteen (15) days
following the receipt of such Tax refund, Buyer shall pay the amount of such
Tax refund to Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section
6.10 shall require that Buyer make any payment with respect to any refund for
a Tax (and such refunds shall be for the benefit of Buyer and the Company)
that is with respect to (i) any refund of Tax that is the result of the
carrying back of any net operating loss or other Tax attribute or Tax credit
incurred in a Post-Closing Tax Period (or portion of any Straddle Period
beginning on or before the Closing Date); (ii) any refund of Tax resulting
from the payments of Taxes made on or after Closing Date to the extent Seller
has not indemnified Buyer or the Company for such Taxes; or (iii) any refund
for Tax that gives rise to a payment obligation by the Company to any Person
under applicable Law or pursuant to a provision of a contract or other
agreement entered (or assumed) by the Company on or prior to the Closing Date.

subject to Article VI) shall survive the Closing indefinitely or for the
period explicitly specified therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claims
asserted in good faith with reasonable specificity (to the extent known at
such time) and in writing by notice from the non-breaching party to the
breaching party prior to the expiration date of the applicable survival period
shall not thereafter be barred by the expiration of the relevant
representation or warranty and such claims shall survive until finally
resolved.

Section 8.02 Indemnification By Seller. Subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Article VIII, Seller shall indemnify and defend each of
Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Company) and their respective
Representatives (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnitees") against, and shall
hold each of them harmless from and against, and shall pay and reimburse each
of them for, any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the
Buyer Indemnitees based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason
of:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of
Seller contained in this Agreement (other than in respect of the Tax
Representations, it being understood that the sole remedy for any such
inaccuracy in or breach

 



61  thereof shall be pursuant to Article VI), as of the date such representation
or warranty was made, or as if such representation or warranty was made on and
as of the Closing Date (except for representations and warranties that
expressly relate to a specified date, the inaccuracy in or breach of which
will be determined with reference to such specified date); or

 

(b) any breach or non-fulfilment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to
be performed by Seller pursuant to this Agreement (other than any breach or
violation of, or failure to fully perform, any covenant, agreement,
undertaking or obligation in Article VI, it being understood that the sole
remedy for any such breach, violation or failure shall be pursuant to
Article VI).

Section 8.03 Indemnification By Buyer. Subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Article VIII, Buyer shall indemnify and defend each of
Seller and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives (collectively,
the "Seller Indemnitees") against, and shall hold each of them harmless from
and against, and shall pay and reimburse each of them for, any and all Losses
incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the Seller Indemnitees based upon,
arising out of, with respect to or by reason of:

 

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of
Buyer contained in this Agreement (other than in respect of the Tax
Representations, it being understood that the sole remedy for any such
inaccuracy in or breach thereof shall be pursuant to Article VI), as of the
date such representation or warranty was made or as if such representation or
warranty was made on and as of the Closing Date (except for representations
and warranties that expressly relate to a specified date, the inaccuracy in or

remedy for any such breach, violation or failure shall be pursuant to Article
VI). 

Section 8.04 Certain Limitations.

 

(a) Seller shall not be liable to the Buyer Indemnitees for indemnification
under Section 8.02(a) (other than with respect to a claim for indemnification
based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of any inaccuracy in
or breach of any representation or warranty in Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.03,
3.19, 3.20, 3.24 and 3.27 (the "Buyer Basket Exclusions")), until the
aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of indemnification under Section
8.02(a) (other than those based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by
reason of the Buyer Basket Exclusions) exceeds $1,100,000.00, at which point
Seller will indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees for all Losses in excess of
$1,100,000.00.

 

(b) Buyer shall not be liable to the Seller Indemnitees for indemnification
under Section 8.03(a) (other than with respect to a claim for indemnification
based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of any inaccuracy in
or breach of any representation or warranty in Sections 4.01 and 4.05, or with
respect to a claim for 

 



62  indemnification arising under Section 5.11 (the "Seller Basket Exclusions"))
until the aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of indemnification
under Section 8.03(a) (other than those based upon, arising out of, with
respect to or by reason of the Seller Basket Exclusions) exceeds
$1,100,000.00, at which point Buyer will indemnify the Seller Indemnitees for
all Losses in excess of $1,100,000.00.

(c) The maximum amount of losses for which either party is obligated to
indemnify the other pursuant to this Article VIII shall be $11,000,000.00
(the "Indemnity Cap"); _provided_ that the Indemnity Cap shall not apply to
Losses incurred by Buyer as a result of a breach of Sections 3.01, 3.02,
3.03, 3.12, 3.19, 3.22, 3.27 and Article VI or to Losses incurred by Seller
as a result of a breach of Sections 4.01 or 4.03, which Losses shall not
exceed the Purchase Price in the aggregate.

 

(d) For purposes of this Article VIII, any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty shall be determined without regard to any
materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other similar qualification contained
in or otherwise applicable to such representation or warranty.

 

(e) The amount of any Losses under Section 8.02 or Section 8.03 for which
Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, may become obligated to hold harmless,
indemnify, compensate or reimburse any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee,
as the case may be (such indemnifying party, the "Indemnitor" and such Buyer
Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be, the "Indemnitee"), shall
be reduced by (i) any Tax benefits actually realized by the Indemnitee on or
prior to the date of the claim that result from or arise out of such Losses,
net of any corresponding Tax costs incurred by such party and (ii) any
amounts recovered by the Indemnitee under applicable insurance policies or
from any other Person alleged to have responsibility. Each Indemnitor shall
pursue in good faith all claims available under such third-party insurance
coverage and from any Person alleged to have responsibility. If the Indemnitee
receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies, or from any other
Person alleged to be responsible for any Losses (which were not earlier taken
into account in calculating Losses), subsequent to an indemnification payment
by the Indemnitor, then the Indemnitee shall promptly reimburse the Indemnitor
for any payment made or out-of-pocket expense incurred by the Indemnitor in
connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount
actually received by the Indemnitee.

Section 8.05 Indemnification Procedures. The party making a claim under this
Article VIII is referred to as the "Indemnified Party", and the party against
whom such claims are asserted under this Article VIII is referred to as the
"Indemnifying Party".

(a) Third Party Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Action made or brought by any Person who is
not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or
a Representative of the foregoing (a "Third Party Claim") against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated
to provide indemnification under this Agreement (including without limitation
Section 5.10(b)), the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party
reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than 15
days after receipt of such notice of such Third Party Claim. The failure to
give such prompt written notice shall not,

 



63  however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations,
except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or
defenses by reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party
shall describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail, shall include
copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall indicate the
estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may
be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to participate in, or by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party,
to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys
expense and by the Indemnifying Partys own counsel, and the Indemnified
Party shall cooperate in good faith in such defense; _provided_ , _that_ if
the Indemnifying Party is Seller, such Indemnifying Party shall not have the
right to defend or direct the defense of any such Third Party Claim that (x)
is asserted directly by or on behalf of a Person that is a supplier or
customer of the Company, or (y) seeks an injunction or other equitable relief
against the Indemnified Party. In the event that the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, subject to Section 8.05(b), it
shall have the right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid,
dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third
Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying
Partys right to control the defense thereof. The fees and disbursements of
such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party, _provided_ ,
_that_ if in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, (A)
there are legal defenses available to an Indemnified Party that are different
from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party; or (B) there
exists a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party that cannot be waived, the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified
Party in each jurisdiction for which the Indemnified Party determines counsel
is required. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or defend
such Third Party Claim, fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in
writing of its election to defend as provided in this Agreement, or fails to
diligently prosecute the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party may, subject to Section 8.05(b), pay, compromise, defend such Third
Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon,
arising from or relating to such Third Party Claim. Seller and Buyer shall
cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with the
defense of any Third Party Claim, including making available (subject to the
provisions of Section 5.06) records relating to such Third Party Claim and
furnishing, without expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket
expenses) to the defending party, management employees of the non-defending
party as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of
such Third Party Claim.

(b) Settlement of Third Party Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
except as provided in this Section 8.05(b). If a firm offer is made to settle
a Third Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of a
financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party and
provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified
Party from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third
Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such
offer, the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm
offer within ten days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party
may continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and in such event,
the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to 

 



64  such Third Party Claim shall not exceed the amount of such settlement offer.
If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer and also fails to
assume defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle
the Third Party Claim upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to settle
such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense
pursuant to Section 8.05(a), it shall not agree to any settlement without the
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 

(c) Direct Claims. Any Action by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably
prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than 15 days after
the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Direct Claim. The failure to give
such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party
of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure.
Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in
reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence
thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of
the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days after its receipt of such notice to
respond in writing to such Direct Claim. The Indemnified Party shall allow the
Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to investigate the matter or
circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what
extent any amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim and the
Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Partys investigation by
giving such information and assistance (including access to the Companys
premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy any accounts,
documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its professional
advisors may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond
within such 30 day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have
rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall be free to
pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party on the
terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

 

(d) Cooperation. Upon a reasonable request by the Indemnifying Party, each
Indemnified Party seeking indemnification hereunder in respect of any Direct
Claim, hereby agrees to consult with the Indemnifying Party and act reasonably
to take actions reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in order to
attempt to reduce the amount of Losses in respect of such Direct Claim. Any
costs or expenses associated with taking such actions shall be included as
Losses hereunder.

(e) Tax Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
control of any claim, assertion, event or proceeding in respect of Taxes of
the Company (including, but not limited to, any such claim in respect of a
breach of the Tax Representations or any breach or violation of or failure to
fully perform any covenant, agreement, undertaking or obligation in Article
VI) shall be governed exclusively by Article VI hereof.

 

Section 8.06 Payments. Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or
finally adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this Article VIII, the
Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its obligations within fifteen (15) Business
Days of such final, non-appealable adjudication by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. The parties hereto agree that should 

 



65  an Indemnifying Party not make full payment of any such obligations within
such 15 Business Day period, any amount payable shall accrue interest from and
including the date of agreement of the Indemnifying Party or final, non-
appealable adjudication to but including the date such payment has been made
at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable to Buyers senior
debt. Such interest shall be calculated daily on the basis of a 365-day year
and the actual number of days elapsed.

Section 8.07 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
by Law.

 

Section 8.08 Effect of Investigation. The representations, warranties and
covenants of the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Partys right to
indemnification with respect thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived
by reason of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party
(including by any of its Representatives) or by reason of the fact that the
Indemnified Party or any of its Representatives knew or should have known that
any such representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate or by
reason of the Indemnified Partys waiver of any condition set forth
in Section 7.02 or Section 7.03, as the case may be.

Section 8.09 Mitigation of Damages. Each Indemnified Party shall take
commercially reasonable steps to mitigate Losses in respect of any claim for
which such Indemnified Party is seeking or may seek indemnification under this
Article VIII and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid any costs
or expenses associated with such claim and, if such costs and expenses cannot
be avoided, to minimize the amount thereof (including making good faith
efforts to recover any Losses from insurers of such Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates under applicable insurance policies); _provided_ , _however_ , any
reasonable third-party costs or expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party
for which it the prevailing party (determined as contemplated above) in
connection therewith shall be Losses for purposes of this Article VIII. No
Indemnified Party shall be required to procure or maintain any particular
insurance coverage or take any action or pursue or obtain any recovery prior
to seeking recovery for any Losses from any other party in accordance with
this Agreement.

Section 8.10 Other Recoveries. No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
recover any Loss under this Article VIII to the extent such Indemnified Party
has recovered, reduced or setoff, or with respect to clause (i) of this
Section 8.10 has the ability to receive the benefit of, such Loss from a
third party based upon the same claim giving rise to such Damage under this
Article VIII, including (i) amounts actually recovered, reduced or setoff
pursuant to indemnification under any Contract or (ii) amounts actually
recovered, reduced or setoff pursuant to any insurance policies held by or for
the benefit of such Indemnified Party (including, for these purposes, any
rights of the Company under any Contract or insurance policy to which it is a
party or by which it receives benefits) (but no Indemnified Party shall be
required to procure or maintain any particular insurance coverage) and the
amount of any Loss shall be reduced by any amount actually received by such
Indemnified Party with respect to such damages under any such insurance
coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that such recovery, reduction or setoff
shall (A) be net of any reasonable third-party costs or expenses incurred by
such Indemnified Party in obtaining such recovery, reduction or setoff, (B)
not include any loans,

 



66  contributions or payments from any Affiliate of such Indemnified Party to
such Indemnifying Party (to the extent such Affiliate has not sought or is not
seeking indemnification from the Indemnifying Party for such Damage) and (C)
not include any amounts which are self-insured (whether through retention or
otherwise). If such a recovery, reduction or setoff is actually received or
enjoyed by an Indemnified Party after it receives payment under this
Agreement with respect to any Loss from an Indemnifying Party, then a refund
equal in aggregate amount of such recovery, reduction or setoff (net of
reasonable third-party costs and expenses incurred in obtaining
such recovery, reduction or setoff) will be made promptly to such
Indemnifying Party, but only to the extent of the payment made by such
Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party, with respect to such Loss.

 

Section 8.11 Exclusive Remedies. Subject to Sections 5.07 and 10.10, the
parties acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any and all claims (other than claims arising from fraud, criminal
activity or wilful misconduct on the part of a party hereto in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein
or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in Article VI and
this Article VIII. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby waives,
to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims and
causes of action for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement it may have against the other parties hereto and
their Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives arising under or
based upon any Law, except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in Article VI and this Article VIII. Nothing in this Section 8.11 shall
limit any Persons right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any
Person shall be entitled or to seek any remedy on account of any Persons
fraudulent, criminal or wilful misconduct.

breach or default not expressly identified by such written waiver, whether of
a similar or different character, and whether occurring before or after that
waiver. No failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, remedy,
power or privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be construed
as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right,
remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.

 

Section 10.10 Governing Law; Dispute Resolution.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of Laws of any
jurisdiction other than those of the State of Delaware.

 

(b) The sole and exclusive method for resolving any claim or dispute ("Claim")
arising out of or relating to the rights and obligations of the parties under
this Agreement (other than with respect to the procedures set forth in Section
2.04(c) relating to and Disputed Amounts), whether such Claim arose or the
facts on which such Claim is based occurred prior to or after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement shall be mediation and arbitration as provided
in this Section 10.10.

 

(c) Either party may give notice of a Claim in writing to the other party and
the parties shall designate a mutually agreed mediator to resolve the Claim.
If the parties are unable to agree on a mediator, they shall submit the Claim
to JAMS, Inc. in Wilmington, Delaware, and request a panel of prospective
neutrals to conduct a mediation process, who shall be individuals
with substantial experience with equity purchase agreements and complex
commercial contracts as well as familiarity with Delaware law relevant to
transactions of this type. The mediation shall be convened within thirty (30)
days of the notice of the Claim, or as soon thereafter as is feasible. If the
mediation is unsuccessful in resolving the Claim, either party may give notice
of its intention to arbitrate the Claim in accordance with Section 10.10(d).

 

(d) Any arbitration to resolve a Claim shall be administered by JAMS, Inc. in
accordance with its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the
"Arbitration Rules") before one arbitrator to be appointed pursuant to the
Arbitration Rules to conduct any such arbitration. The arbitrator shall have
substantial experience with equity purchase agreements and complex commercial
contracts as well as familiarity with Delaware law relevant to transactions of
this type. All meetings of the parties and all hearings with respect to any
such arbitration shall take place in Wilmington, Delaware, or such
other place as the parties may designate. Each party to the arbitration shall
bear its own costs and expenses (including all attorneys fees and expenses,
except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law), and all costs and
expenses of the arbitration proceeding (such as filing fees, the arbitrators
fees, hearing expenses, etc.) shall be borne equally by the parties;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the arbitrator may, in the
arbitrators discretion, award costs and expenses to the prevailing party in
the arbitration.

 



72 (e) In the event that any party or any of such partys Affiliates, associates
or representatives is requested or required (by oral question or request for
information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena,
civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any information
concerning an arbitration or mediation proceeding conducted in accordance
with this Agreement (the "Disclosing Party"), such Disclosing Party shall
notify the other parties promptly of the request or requirement so that any
such other party may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance
with the provisions of this Section 10.10. If, in the absence of a protective
order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, the Disclosing Party or any of its
Affiliates, associates or representatives believes in good faith, upon the
advice of legal counsel, that it is compelled to disclose any such
information, such Disclosing Party may disclose such portion of the
information as it believes in good faith, upon the advice of legal counsel,
it is required to disclose; provided that the Disclosing Party shall use
reasonable efforts to obtain, at the request and expense of such other party,
an order or other assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded to
such portion of the Arbitration Information required to be disclosed as such
other party shall designate. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 10.10 to
the contrary, the parties shall have no obligation to keep confidential
any Arbitration Information that becomes generally known to and available for
use by the public other than as a result of the disclosing partys acts or
omissions or the acts or omissions of such partys Affiliates, associates
or representatives. The parties agree that, subject to the right of any party
to appeal or move to vacate or confirm any decision, judgment, ruling,
finding, award or other determination of an arbitration as provided in this
Section 10.10, the decision, judgment, ruling, finding, award or other
determination of any arbitration under the Arbitration Rules shall be final,
conclusive and binding on all of the parties hereto and any party may
institute litigation to enforce any final decision, judgment, ruling,
finding, award or other determination of the arbitration.

Section 10.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall be
deemed to be one and the same agreement. A signed copy of this Agreement
delivered by facsimile, e-mail or other means of electronic transmission
shall be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an original
signed copy of this Agreement.

 _Form of Sublease_

See attached. 

 



C-1 SUBLEASE AGREEMENT

 

THIS SUBLEASE AGREEMENT (this " _Sublease_ ") is entered into as of [●], 2016
(the " _Effective Date_ "), by and between A and G, Inc., an Illinois
corporation (" _Sublandlord_ "), and Crabar/GBF, Inc., a Delaware corporation
d/b/a GenForms (" _Subtenant_ ").

 

WITNESSETH:

WHEREAS, Sublandlord is presently the lessee of approximately 200,000 square
feet (as further described in the Master Lease, the " _Premises_ ") comprising
a portion of the building commonly known as and located at 1501 E. Cerritos
Avenue, Anaheim, California (the " _Building_ ") pursuant to that certain
Standard Form Multi-Tenant Industrial Lease (Net) dated August 11, 2000, as
amended by that certain First Amendment to Standard Form Multi-Tenant
Industrial Lease (Net) dated April 23, 2010 and that certain Second Amendment
to Standard Form Multi-Tenant Industrial Lease (Net) (" _Second Amendment_ ")
dated July 2, 2015 (collectively, the " _Master Lease_ "), between
Inland Empire Realty Holding Co., Inc. (" _Master Landlord_ "), Alstyle
Apparel and Activewear Manufacturing Company (which entity has been merged into
Sublandlord) and Sublandlord, which Master Lease is attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_ ; and

WHEREAS, Sublandlord is willing to sublet to Subtenant approximately 47,000
square feet of the Premises (as described and depicted on _Exhibit B_
attached hereto) (the " _Subleased Premises_ ") on the terms and conditions
contained herein.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, Sublandlord and Subtenant hereby
agree as follows:

1\. _DEFINED TERMS_. All capitalized terms used and not defined herein shall
have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Master Lease.

2\. _LEASED PREMISES_. Sublandlord subleases to Subtenant, and Subtenant
hereby subleases from Sublandlord, the Subleased Premises. Immediately
following the Effective Date, the Subleased Premises shall be measured using
current standards for industrial space. The result of this measurement shall
be conclusive for all purposes under this Sublease. If necessary to properly
access the Subleased Premises and to conduct Subtenants operations therein,
Subtenant shall be permitted to access the Premises on a basis as shall be
mutually determined by Subtenant and Sublandlord acting in good faith. The
Sublandlord shall provide the Subleased Premises in their "as is" condition.
Sublandlord makes no representations or warranties, whether express or
implied, with respect to the Subleased Premises or any furniture, equipment
and systems used in connection with the Subleased Premises, and Sublandlord
shall have no obligation whatsoever to prepare the Subleased Premises for
Subtenants occupancy.

 

3\. _TERM_. The term of this Sublease shall commence as of the Effective Date
and shall terminate on the expiration of the Master Lease in accordance with
the provisions thereof (the " _Term_ "), provided that if Sublandlord elects,
as permitted under the provisions of the Master Lease, to terminate the Master
Lease prior to the normal expiration date thereof (any such circumstance, an
" _Early Termination Event_ "), Sublandlord shall provide Subtenant with not
less

 



C-2  than one hundred eighty 180 days written notice in advance of an Early
Termination Event in order to provide Subtenant with sufficient time to locate
alternative space. Further, upon the occurrence of an Early Termination
Event, Sublandlord shall share with Subtenant, on a proportionate basis based
on the percentage that the Subleased Premises comprise of the Premises, any
economic benefit to Sublandlord attributable to such Early Termination Event.

4\. _MASTER LEASE_. This Sublease is subject and subordinate to the Master
Lease and to the matters to which the Master Lease is or shall be
subordinate. Except as may be inconsistent with the terms and provisions
hereof, the terms and provisions of the Master Lease shall be applicable to
this Sublease as they relate to the Subleased Premises, and shall
be incorporated into this Sublease, as if Sublandlord was the lessor under
the Master Lease and Subtenant was the lessee under the Master Lease. If the
terms of this Sublease conflict with the terms of the Master Lease, then the
terms of this Sublease shall control. Sublandlord agrees to use its best
efforts not to cause a default under the Master Lease. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Sublease, Subtenant shall not be
deemed to have assumed any obligations of Sublandlord under the Master Lease
for the benefit of Master Landlord, as this Sublease is not a direct lease
with Master Landlord, and Master Landlord shall not be a third party
beneficiary hereof. Without limiting the foregoing, Sublandlord shall make
all payments to Master Landlord under the Master Lease.

The Subtenant shall not commit or permit to be committed on the Premises
any act which would violate any term or condition of the Master Lease
(provided that Subtenant shall not be responsible for any acts or omissions by
Sublandlord or its Affiliates).

 

At Subtenants request, Sublandlord will exercise the rights and remedies
Sublandlord has under the Master Lease with respect to the Premises
(including the Subleased Premises), and at law or in equity, so designated by
Subtenant in its request, including without limitation, the enforcement of
Sublandlords remedies against Master Landlord for Master Landlords
failure to perform under the Master Lease. Such rights and remedies shall be
pursued diligently by Sublandlord. Subtenant shall be entitled to a
proportionate share of the damages and other sums obtained as the result of
the exercise of any such rights or remedies by Sublandlord insofar as they
relate to the Subleased Premises. If any such default by Master Landlord is
not cured to Subtenants reasonable satisfaction, in addition to the remedies
contained in the Master Lease and this Sublease, Subtenant shall have the
right to terminate this Sublease by furnishing written notice to Sublandlord.

5\. _SECURITY DEPOSIT_. Subtenant shall not be required to deposit a security
deposit as a condition to this Sublease.

6\. _RENT; UTILITY EXPENSES_. Subtenant shall pay to Sublandlord (i) a
monthly base rent of $0.71 per square foot (" _Monthly Base Rent_ ") for each
calendar month (or a pro rata portion thereof for any partial calendar month
during the Term based on the number of days in such month) during the first
partial year of the Extended Term as set forth in the Second Amendment on the
30th day of each such calendar month, and (ii) $7,000 in respect of property
taxes for each calendar year (or a pro rata portion thereof for any partial
calendar year during the Term based on the number of days in such year) during
the Term on the 30th day of January, commencing on January 30, 2017 (it being
agreed that the above-referenced payment in respect 

 



C-3  of property taxes shall be subject to a proportionate annual increase or
decrease, as applicable, based on annual changes in governmental property tax
assessments relating to the Premises calculated based on the percentage that
the Subleased Premises comprise of the Premises). The Monthly Base Rent shall
increase three percent (3%) per annum on January 1 of each year of the Term,
consistent with the Second Amendment. The Monthly Base Rent and the property
taxes payable by Subtenant to Sublandlord during the Term of the Sublease, as
provided in the two immediately preceding sentences, shall not be affected by
any modifications or amendments to the Master Lease. All rent due under this
Sublease shall be paid to Sublandlord at the address for notice set forth in
Paragraph 7 below in lawful money of the United States of America. Subtenant
shall not be obligated to pay to Sublandlord or to the Master Landlord
the Base Rent or any other amounts payable by Sublandlord as contemplated by
the Master Lease.

Sublandlord and Subtenant acknowledge that the Premises (including the
Subleased Premises) may share common access to applicable utility services.
Sublandlord and Subtenant will meet and confer from time to time (at least
semi-annually) in order to mutually agree upon a proportionate
expense sharing arrangement, based on the historical and anticipated use of
the Premises (including the Subleased Premises), with respect to their
respective usage of such utilities.

 

7\. _NOTICES_. Sublandlord shall specify that Master Landlord send copies to
Subtenant of all notices Master Landlord gives to Sublandlord pursuant to the
Master Lease. Additionally, Sublandlord shall send to Subtenant copies of all
notices received from Master Landlord (promptly following receipt thereof) or
delivered to Master Landlord by Subtenant (simultaneously with delivery
to Master Landlord) under the Master Lease.

Any notice, demand, objection, statement or other communication which either
party is required or desires to give to the other shall be in writing and
shall be delivered either in person or by United States registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested, with postage thereon fully prepaid,
addressed as follows:

party of such change.

 



C-4 8\. _KEYS/LOCKS; INTERNET/DATA/PHONE LINES_.

 

Sublandlord shall furnish Subtenant with such number of keys or access cards
(collectively, the " _Access Equipment_ ") as it shall reasonably request for
each corridor door entering the Subleased Premises or the Premises (if
necessary to gain access to the Subleased Premises) (and additional Access
Equipment on an order signed by Subtenant, at Sublandlords cost). Subtenant
shall have the right at its sole cost and expense to install and operate such
additional access control systems as it shall determine for the purpose of
limiting access to the Subleased Premises provided such systems are located
solely within the Subleased Premises and comply with legal requirements.

Sublandlord and Subtenant acknowledge that the Premises (including
the Subleased Premises) are served by internet, data and phone lines, the use
of which shall be allocated and shared between Sublandlord and Subtenant.
Sublandlord and Subtenant will meet and confer from time to time (at least
semi-annually) in order to mutually agree upon such sharing arrangement,
which shall be documented in a mutually acceptable letter agreement.

9\. _PEACEFUL ENJOYMENT_. Subtenant shall, and may peacefully have, hold and
enjoy the Subleased Premises, subject to the other terms hereof, so long as a
default by Subtenant under this Sublease has not occurred or if it has
occurred, the cure period for such default has not expired.

10\. _COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS_. The Subtenant shall comply in all material
respects with all governmental laws, ordinances and regulations applicable to
the use by the Subtenant of the Subleased Premises and shall promptly comply
with all governmental orders and directives for the correction, prevention and
abatement of any public or private nuisance under California law or
unpermitted use in or upon, or connected with, the Subleased Premises, all at
the Subtenants sole expense. The Subtenant shall furnish the Sublandlord with
evidence of all required licenses and permits for operation of
the Subtenants business at the Subleased Premises. The Subtenant shall not
permit at the Subleased Premises any action that would constitute a public or
private nuisance under California law.

 

11\. _STANDARDS OF THE BUILDING_. As of the Effective Date, the Premises and
the Subleased Premises are in compliance with the Master Lease and all legal
requirements and no hazardous materials are located in therein in violation of
legal requirements.

12.  _CONDEMNATION AND CASUALTY_. Sublandlord shall not exercise any rights
or make any decision with respect to a casualty or condemnation arising under
the Master Lease without Subtenants approval. Subtenant shall have the right
to terminate this Sublease at any time that Sublandlord has the right to
terminate the Master Lease.

13\. _INDEMNIFICATION BY THE SUBTENANT_. Except to the extent caused by the
Sublandlords gross negligence or willful misconduct, its breach of the Master
Lease or this Sublease, or its acts on the Premises or the Subleased Premises,
the Subtenant agrees to indemnify, protect and defend the Sublandlord and the
Master Landlord against and hold the Sublandlord and the Master Landlord
harmless from any and all loss, cost, liability, damage and expense,
including, without limitation, penalties, fines and counsel fees and 

 



C-5  disbursements, and any claims by any persons by reason of injury or death to
persons or damage to property occasioned by any use, occupancy, condition,
occurrence, happening, act, omission or negligence (collectively, " _Claims_
"), incurred in connection with or arising from: (a) any default by the

conditions of this Sublease on the Subtenants part to be observed or
performed; or (b) the use or occupancy or manner of use or occupancy of the
Premises by the Subtenant or any person claiming through or under the

including, without limitation, any act, omission or negligence in the making
or performing of any alterations.

 

14\. _INDEMNIFICATION BY THE SUBLANDLORD_. Except to the extent caused by the
Subtenants gross negligence or willful misconduct, its breach of the Master
Lease or this Sublease, or its acts on the Premises or the Subleased Premises,
the Sublandlord agrees to indemnify, protect and defend the Subtenant against
and hold the Subtenant harmless from any and all Claims incurred
in connection with or arising from: (a) any default by the Sublandlord in the
observance or performance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this
Sublease on the Sublandlords part to be observed or performed; or (b) the
use or occupancy or manner of use or occupancy of the Premises by the
Sublandlord or any person claiming through or under the Sublandlord, or of the
employees, agents, licensees or invitees of the Sublandlord, in, on, or about
the Premises during the term of this Sublease, including, without limitation,
any act, omission or negligence in the making or performing of any
alterations.

15.  _INSURANCE_. The Subtenant shall obtain and maintain during the entire
Term a policy of Commercial General Liability Insurance against claims for
bodily injury, personal injury and property damage based upon, involving or
arising out of the Subtenants occupation, use or maintenance of the
Subleased Premises and all areas appurtenant to the Subleased Premises, and
the Subtenants business operations. Such insurance shall be on an occurrence
basis providing coverage in an amount not less than Two Million Dollars
($2,000,000.00) for each occurrence. Neither the minimum insurance
requirements set forth in this Sublease, nor the limits of such insurance,
shall limit the liability of the Subtenant under this Sublease. The
Sublandlord and the Master Landlord and any lenders or other parties specified
by the Sublandlord from time to time shall be named as additional insureds
under the Subtenants insurance. All insurance companies providing insurance
pursuant to this Section shall be rated at least A-XII in _Best s Key Rating
Guide _and shall be otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Sublandlord and
licensed and qualified to do business in the State of California. Insurance
provided by the Subtenant shall be primary as to all covered claims and any
insurance carried by the Sublandlord is not excess and is non-contributing.
The Subtenant authorizes the Sublandlord to contact the Subtenants insurance
company directly in the event that the Sublandlord elects to make a claim
under the Subtenants insurance. Copies of policies or original certificates
of insurance with respect to each policy shall be delivered to the Sublandlord
prior to the Effective Date and thereafter, at least thirty (30) days before
the expiration of each existing policy.

16\. _WAIVER OF SUBROGATION RIGHTS_. Anything in this Sublease to the
contrary notwithstanding, Sublandlord and Subtenant each hereby waives any and
all rights of recovery, claim, action or cause-of-action, against the other,
its agents (including partners, both general and limited),
officers, directors, shareholders, customers, invitees, or employees, for any
loss or damage that may occur to the Subleased Premises, or any improvements
thereto, or

 



C-6  any improvements thereon, or any personal property of such party therein, by
reason of fire, the elements or any other cause which is actually insured
against by Sublandlord or Subtenant or which could be insured against under a
standard fire and extended coverage insurance policy, regardless of cause or
origin, including negligence of the other party hereto, its agents, partners,
shareholders, officers, directors, customers, invitees or employees, and
covenants that no insurer shall hold any right of subrogation against such
other party. Sublandlord and Subtenant shall advise insurers of the foregoing
waiver and such waiver shall be a part of each policy maintained by
Sublandlord and Subtenant.

17\. _ATTORNEYS  FEES_. In the event Subtenant or Sublandlord defaults in the
performance of any of the terms, covenants, agreements or conditions
contained in this Sublease and the nondefaulting party places the enforcement
of this Sublease, or any part thereof, or the collection of any sums due, or
to become due hereunder, or recovery of the possession of the Premises, in
the hands of an attorney, or files suit upon the same, the defaulting party
agrees, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to pay the nondefaulting
party all reasonable attorneys fees incurred by the nondefaulting party
if such suit is successful.

18\. _SUBTENANT S OBLIGATIONS UPON TERMINATION OF THIS SUBLEASE_. The
Subtenant shall keep the Premises in good order and condition and as
otherwise required pursuant to the Master Lease as incorporated herein. At the
expiration or sooner termination of this Sublease, the Subtenant shall
surrender and deliver up the Premises "broom clean" and in the same condition
as required to be surrendered and delivered up to the Master Lessor upon
termination of the Master Lease pursuant to the terms of the Master Lease. The
Subtenant shall repair any damage to the Subleased Premises, the Premises or
the Building caused by the Subtenants move into or out of the Subleased
Premises, the removal from the Subleased Premises of any personal property and
any alterations, additions, improvements or installations required or
permitted to be removed by or on behalf of the Subtenant, and any damage
otherwise caused by the Subtenant its agents, contractors or employees. Any of
the Subtenants personal property, fixtures, signs or equipment which shall
remain in or about the Subleased Premises after the expiration or sooner
termination of this Sublease shall be deemed conclusively to have been
abandoned and either may be retained by the Sublandlord as its property or may
be disposed of in such manner as the Sublandlord may see fit, at the
Subtenants sole cost and expense.

19\. _SUCCESSORS_. This Sublease shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of Sublandlord and Subtenant and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

20\. _ENTIRETY_. This instrument and any attached addenda or exhibits signed

a brokerage fee, finders fee or similar payment with respect to this Sublease
that is made by a party claiming by, through or under Sublandlord.

 

23\. _ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING_. Subtenant shall have the right to assign
this Lease or sublease any portion of the Premises to a subtenant or assignee
approved in writing by Sublandlord. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Subtenant
may assign this Sublease or sublet all or any portion of the Leased Premises
to an Affiliate of Subtenant without Sublandlords consent. As used herein, "
_Affiliate_ " shall mean any person or entity controlling, controlled by, or
under common control with, another person or entity.

 

24\. _NO LIABILITY_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the
Master Lease and this Sublease, in no event shall Subtenant be obligated to
pay any sums owing under the Master Lease which result from a default by
Sublandlord under the Master Lease and not Subtenants default under this
Sublease.

 

25\. _SUBTENANT DEFAULTS_. The following shall be deemed to be events of
default by Subtenant under this Sublease: (i) Subtenant shall fail to pay
when due any installment of rent or any other payment required pursuant to
this Sublease and Subtenant shall fail to cure such nonpayment within five (5)
Business Days after receipt of written notice thereof from Sublandlord; or
(ii) Subtenant shall fail to comply with any term, provision or covenant of
this Sublease (including the terms of the Master Lease incorporated herein as
modified by the provisions hereof), other than one requiring the payment of
money, and the failure is not cured with thirty (30) days after Subtenant
receives written notice thereof from Sublandlord or if the default is of such
character as to require more than thirty (30) days to cure, Subtenant fails to
commence curing such default within said thirty (30) day period or diligently
proceed thereafter. Upon the occurrence of an uncured default by Subtenant,
Sublandlord shall have all the remedies available at law and in equity,
including, without limitation, the right to terminate this Sublease.

26\. _SUBLANDLORD DEFAULTS_. If Sublandlord should fail to observe, perform or
comply with any term, provision or condition of this Sublease or the Master
Lease to be performed by Sublandlord, and if such failure continues for thirty
(30) days (five (5) Business Days in the event of a failure to pay money)
following Sublandlords receipt of notice thereof from Subtenant or Master
Landlord, Sublandlord shall be in default under this Sublease; provided,
however, that if such failure, other than the payment of money, is of such a
character as to require more than thirty (30) days to cure, Sublandlord shall
not be in default unless Sublandlord does not commence such cure within thirty
(30) days and thereafter diligently proceed curing such failure. Upon the
occurrence of an uncured default by Sublandlord, Subtenant shall have all the
remedies available at law and in equity, including, without limitation, the
right to terminate this Sublease, and if Subtenant exercises a right to cure
any such default by Sublandlord and Sublandlord fails to reimburse Subtenant
for the costs reasonably incurred by Subtenant to effect such cure within
thirty (30) days of Subtenants request therefor, in addition to Subtenants
remedies at law and in equity, Subtenant may offset such sums against sums
due and owing by Subtenant to Sublandlord under this Sublease.

 



C-8 27\. _CONSENT BY MASTER LANDLORD_. Notwithstanding all of the other terms and
provisions of this Sublease, this Sublease is conditioned upon and shall not
be effective until the full execution of the Consent Agreement (herein so
called) attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ by all parties thereto.

any reason whatsoever, this Sublease shall terminate automatically, and the
parties hereto shall be relieved of all liabilities and obligations hereunder,
except for those which accrued prior to the date of such termination.

 

29\. _COUNTERPARTS_. This Sublease may be executed in any number of

 _CONSENT AGREEMENT_

THIS CONSENT AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of
[●], 2016, by and among Inland Empire Realty Holding Co., Inc. (" _Landlord_
"), A and G, Inc. (" _Tenant_ "), and Crabar/GBF, Inc. (d/b/a Genforms) ("
_Subtenant_ ").

_WITNESSETH_ :

 

WHEREAS, Tenant is presently the lessee of approximately 200,000 square feet
(as further described in the Master Lease, the " _Premises_ ") comprising a
portion of the building commonly known as and located at 1501 E. Cerritos
Avenue, Anaheim, California, pursuant to that certain Standard Form Multi-
Tenant Industrial Lease (Net) dated August 11, 2000, as amended by that
certain First Amendment to Standard Form Multi-Tenant Industrial Lease (Net)
dated April 23, 2010 and that certain Second Amendment to Standard Form Multi-
Tenant Industrial Lease (Net) dated July 2, 2015 (the " _Master Lease_ "),
between Inland Empire Realty Holding Co., Inc. (" _Master Landlord_ "),
Alstyle Apparel and Activewear Manufacturing Company (which entity has been
merged into Sublandlord) and Sublandlord;

 

WHEREAS, Tenant, as sublandlord, and Subtenant, as sublessee, have executed
that certain Sublease dated [●], 2016 (" _Sublease_ ") with respect to the
portion of the Premises referenced therein (the " _Subleased Premises_ "), a
true and correct copy of which has been delivered to Landlord by Tenant and
Subtenant; and

 

WHEREAS, Landlord, Tenant and Subtenant desire and agree to enter into this
Agreement on the terms and conditions hereinafter provided.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of Ten Dollars and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged and confessed, and in consideration of the mutual covenants and
agreements herein contained, Landlord, Tenant and Subtenant hereby agree as
follows:

 

1\. All capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the
meaning set forth in the Master Lease.

 

2\. Landlord consents to Tenants entering into the Sublease with Subtenant
and to the terms and conditions of the Sublease, to the extent not
inconsistent with the provisions of the Master Lease. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Tenant shall remain fully liable for the performance of the
obligations under the Master Lease and under no circumstances is Subtenant
assuming any liabilities or obligations under the Master Lease. Landlord
will, however, accept the performance of the obligations under the Master
Lease by Subtenant on behalf of Tenant insofar as such performance relates to
the Subleased Premises. No failure by Subtenant to perform its obligations
under the Sublease shall constitute a defense, offset, claim or counterclaim
to Tenants obligations under the Master Lease, which shall exist independent
from the Sublease and irrespective of Subtenants performance thereunder.

 



C-12 3\. Landlord and Tenant agree to deliver to Subtenant all notices and other
written communications sent by Landlord or Tenant (as applicable) under the
Master Lease at Subtenants address stated in the Sublease, by postage
prepaid, certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. No notice or
other written communication under the Master Lease will be effective, and the
applicable periods of time to cure such defaults will not begin to run, until
Subtenant receives such notice at the location designated above. Subtenant may
change its address by furnishing fifteen (15) days prior written notice to
Landlord and Tenant of such change in address. Any and all notices required to
be given or served by the terms of this Agreement shall be in writing and
shall be deemed to have been given three (3) Business Days following deposit
in the mail as provided above.

4\. If Tenant defaults under the terms of the Master Lease, Subtenant shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to cure such default on behalf of
Tenant so long as such cure occurs during the applicable cure period, if any,
granted to Tenant under the Master Lease. Landlord shall accept such cure
from Subtenant to the same effect and extent as if Tenant had cured such
default under the Master Lease. Subtenants failure to cure a default by
Tenant under the Master Lease that is not a default by Subtenant under the
Sublease shall not affect Subtenants rights under Paragraph 6 of this
Agreement to continue the Sublease after a Termination Event as long as
Subtenant complies with Paragraph 5 of this Agreement.

 

5\. In the event the Master Lease is terminated or cancelled for any reason ("
_Termination Event_ "), including without limitation, as the result of a
default by Tenant under the Master Lease, (a) the Sublease shall automatically
terminate, (b) Subtenant shall have no further obligation to Tenant under the
Sublease, other than payment of all amounts owing to Tenant and compliance
with all provisions of this this Sublease, pursuant to the terms of the
Sublease, and (c) Subtenant shall have no obligation for any sums due and
owing by Tenant to Landlord under the Master Lease.

 

6\. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and shall be binding upon
Landlord, Tenant and Subtenant and their successors and assigns. 

7\. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal,
or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality, or
unenforceability shall not apply to or affect any other provision hereof, but
this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalidity, illegality, or
unenforceability did not exist.

 

8\. This Agreement shall be governed and construed by the laws of the State of
California. This Agreement shall not be recorded by either party hereto. This
Agreement may not be modified, altered or amended without a writing signed by
Landlord, Tenant and Subtenant.

 _Form of Transition Services Agreement_

 

See attached.

 



D-1 TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT

 

This TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of [●], 2016 by and among Ennis, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Ennis_ "), and Gildan Activewear Inc., a Canadian corporation (" _Buyer_ ").
Ennis, in its capacity as a provider of Services (as hereinafter defined)
hereunder, is referred to herein as " _Service Provider_ ", and Buyer, in its
capacity as a recipient of Services hereunder, is referred to herein as "
_Service Recipient_ ".

 

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, Ennis and Buyer have entered into a Unit Purchase Agreement, dated as
of May 4, 2016 (as it may be amended, restated, or supplemented in accordance
with its terms, the " _Purchase Agreement_ "), pursuant to which, among other
things, Ennis will sell, convey, transfer and assign to Buyer, and Buyer will
acquire from Ennis, Alstyle Apparel, LLC and its Subsidiaries (the "
_Company_ ");

WHEREAS, from and after the Closing, Ennis has agreed to provide to Buyer and
its subsidiaries the Services, on a temporary basis, in connection with the
transfer of ownership of the Company to Buyer, on the terms set forth in this
Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements of the
parties contained herein, the parties agree as follows:

 

1\. _Definitions_. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement but not defined
herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Purchase Agreement.

2\. _Services Provided_.

 

(a) During the term of this Agreement, Service Provider shall, or shall cause
one or more of its designated subsidiaries to, provide to Service Recipient
and its subsidiaries, each of the services (each, a " _Service_ ", and
collectively, the " _Services_ ") described in _Exhibit A_ , to be performed
for the period set forth in _Exhibit A_ (the " _Transition Period_ "), and on
the additional terms and conditions set forth herein and in _Exhibit A_ , as
applicable. All Services to be provided hereunder shall be provided by Service
Provider or its designated subsidiaries, or by other third-party providers
retained by Service Provider or its designated subsidiaries upon the prior
written approval of Service Recipient, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. To the extent that any Service is
provided by a subsidiary of Service Provider or an approved third-party
provider, Service Provider shall cause such subsidiary or third-party provider
to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement relating to the
provision of Services as if such subsidiary or third-party provider were a
party hereto. The parties agree that no Service (including any Additional
Service (as hereinafter defined)) shall extend beyond the Transition Period
specified in _Exhibit A_.

 

(b) If Service Recipient reasonably determines after the date hereof that
there are additional services that Service Provider historically has provided
to the Company that are not included in the Services and which are necessary
for the orderly transition of the ownership of the Company to Buyer, Service
Recipient may request that Service Provider provide such 

 



D-2  additional services (each, an " _Additional Service_ ") and Service Provider
agrees, to the extent such Additional Services can be provided by Service
Provider without undue effort or expense, to provide such Additional Services
on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. The parties shall
amend _Exhibit A_ to add any such Additional Services, but a failure to amend
_Exhibit A_ shall not void Service Providers obligations to provide such
Additional Services.

3\. _Software_. The parties hereby expressly acknowledge and agree that
nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to grant Service Recipient during
the term of this Agreement or after the termination or expiration of this
Agreement or any Transition Period, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, any
ownership right, license or sublicense right or use right (except for the use
rights through Service Provider provided hereunder during any Transition
Period) with respect to any software owned or licensed by provided by Service
Provider. Further, nothing in this Agreement shall require Service Provider
in connection with the provision of Services hereunder to violate the terms of
any software license maintained by Service Provider with any third party
software provider. In event that any such third party software provider
determines that the provision by Service Provider of any Services hereunder
requires that either Service Provider or Service Recipient to pay any license
fee in connection therewith, then Service Recipient agrees that it shall be
responsible for the payment of such license fee and shall reimburse and
indemnify Service Provider for any such license fee or other amounts that
Service Provider may be required pay to such third party software provider.
Service Recipient, in connection with its receipt of Services hereunder
agrees to conduct its operations in a manner reasonably designed not result in
a violation of any such software license.

 

4\. _Consideration_.

(a)  _Fees_. In consideration for each Service provided hereunder during the
Transition Period, Service Recipient will compensate Service Provider with the
amounts set forth in _Exhibit A_.

 

(b) _Costs_. In addition to the fees payable to by Service Recipient to
Service Provider as set forth in Section 4(a), except as otherwise provided
herein or in _Exhibit A_ , as applicable, Service Recipient shall reimburse
Service Provider for:

(i) any third party costs, without markup, which have been historically
incurred by Service Provider in connection with the provision of the Services,
provided that Service Provider has advised Service Recipient regarding such
third party costs prior to such third party costs being incurred and that
Service Recipient has provided prior written approval of such third party and
for such third party costs to be incurred; and

 

(ii) any travel expenses incurred by any employee of Service Provider if such
travel is necessary (as mutually agreed to between Service Recipient and
Service Provider, in advance) in connection with the provision of any
Services.

(c) _Invoices and Payment_. With respect to the fees and costs payable
pursuant to Sections 4(a) and 4(b), Service Provider shall invoice Service
Recipient at the beginning of each month, beginning the first day of the first
month next following the date of this Agreement, for the Services provided
hereunder for the previous month, which invoice shall set forth a

 



D-3  description of the Services provided and costs incurred during such period.
Service Recipient shall remit full payment of any invoiced amounts by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Service
Provider from time to time within thirty (30) Business Days after Service
Recipients receipt of such invoice. Any invoice not timely paid by Service
Recipient in accordance with this Section 4(c) shall bear interest on the
unpaid portion thereof from time to time at a floating per annum rate,
determined daily, equal to the prime rate (as published in the "Money Rates"
table of the Eastern U.S. Edition of The Wall Street Journal) in effect from
time to time, such interest to accrue commencing on the last day of such
thirty (30) Business Day period in respect of such invoice, and continuing
through the date of payment by Service Recipient. In addition, Service
Recipient shall reimburse Service Provider for any reasonable collection
costs and expenses connected with any overdue invoice.

(d) _Invoice Disputes_. The parties shall seek to resolve all such disputes
expeditiously and in good faith, provided that all invoices transmitted
pursuant to Section 4(c) must be paid in full upon the applicable due date
therefor and will not be delayed merely because of a dispute. To the extent
that the resolution of a dispute results in a refunded amount by Service
Provider to Service Recipient, then such refunded amount shall bear interest
at the rate specified from time to time in Section 4(c) from the original
date on which such refunded amount was first paid by Service Recipient to
Service Provider and continuing through the date such refunded amount is paid
by Service Provider to Service Recipient. Service Provider shall continue
performing the Services in accordance with this Agreement pending resolution
of any dispute.

(e) _Terminated Services_. To the extent that Service Provider terminates any
Service in accordance with Section 12, no fees or costs shall accrue in
respect of such Service(s) after the effective date of such termination. To
the extent that any Services are provided for less than a full month, any
fees for such Services will be pro-rated on a calendar day basis.

(f) _Taxes_. Service Recipient shall be responsible for all applicable state
sales and use taxes required to be paid in connection with payment for Service
Providers performance of the Services. Service Provider shall cooperate with
Service Recipient in good faith and at Service Recipients expense in order
to permit Service Recipient to establish any exemption from or reduction to,
or obtain any credit or refund of, any such sales and use taxes.

 

5\. _Certain Obligations of the Parties_.

 

(a) Service Recipient shall: (i) provide one Service Recipient-designated
point of contact for Service Provider to use for all questions and issues
relating to a specific Service, (ii) provide sufficient qualified personnel
who are capable of performing Service Recipient duties, responsibilities and

receipt of the Services, (vi) fully cooperate with and work in good faith with

(b) Service Provider shall: (i) provide one Service Provider-designated point
of contact for Service Recipient to use for all questions and issues relating

(excluding from this provision circumstances involving the death, disability,
leave of absence or termination of employment of a Project Manager). 

6\. _Performance Standard; Confidentiality_. Service Provider shall provide,
or cause its designated subsidiaries to provide, the Services in good faith

Without limiting Section 14, each party will handle and protect
from disclosure all proprietary and confidential information disclosed to it
by the other party in the same general manner as it handles and protects its
own information that it considers proprietary and confidential.

 

7\. _Security_.

(a) During the term of this Agreement, Service Recipients access to Service
Providers information technology infrastructure for applications, if any,
shall be through secured controlled processes determined by Service Provider
in consultation with Service Recipient. Service Provider shall not transfer
to Service Recipient, and Service Recipient shall not have rights in or access
to, application software/systems source code associated with shared 

 



D-5  systems through which Service Provider is providing Services to Service
Recipient hereunder. Service Recipient shall not, through reverse engineering
or any other technique or means, attempt to access such source code, and
Service Recipient will use the application software/systems only for its
intended use. Upon prior written notice to Service Recipient, Service Provider
shall have the right to deny specific personnel of Service Recipient access
to Service Providers systems in the event Service Provider reasonably
believes that such personnel pose a security concern.

 

(b) During the term of this Agreement, Service Providers access to Service
Recipients information technology infrastructure for applications, if any,
shall be through secured controlled processes determined by Service Recipient
in consultation with Service Provider. Service Recipient shall not transfer to
Service Provider, and Service Provider shall not have rights in or access to,
application software/systems source code associated with Service Recipient
systems through which Service Provider is providing Services to Service
Recipient hereunder. Service Provider shall not, through reverse engineering
or any other technique or means, attempt to access such source code, and
Service Provider will use the application software/systems only for its
intended use. Upon prior written notice to Service Provider, Service Recipient
shall have the right to deny specific personnel of Service Provider and its
subsidiaries access to Service Recipients systems in the event Service
Recipient reasonably believes that such personnel pose a security concern.

 

(c) If a security breach that relates to the Services is discovered by either
party, or if either party determines that any personnel of the other party
poses a security concern as provided above, then such party shall promptly
notify the other party of such event or determination. The parties shall,
subject to any applicable Law, cooperate with each other regarding the timing
and manner of (i) notification to their respective customers, potential
customers, employees or agents concerning a breach or potential breach of
security and (ii) disclosures to appropriate Governmental Authorities as
required by applicable law regarding such security breach or attempted
security breach and regarding the resolution of any such security concerns.

(d) Service Provider shall maintain data security protocols, disaster
recovery and contingency plans in connection with the Services and the data
and other information used or generated in connection therewith consistent
with the data security protocols, disaster recovery and contingency plans
Service Provider generally maintains with respect to the same or similar
services to and data and other information of its own business units and
subsidiaries during the Transition Periods.

 

8\. _Record Retention; Access_. Each of Service Provider and Service Recipient
shall maintain full and accurate books and records relating to the Services
provided hereunder, in accordance with past practices. With respect to
accounting, transactional and other records or information created by or for a
party by reason of its performance hereunder and necessary for a partys
use in the Companys business or otherwise or for a partys accounting, tax
or compliance purposes, on a partys request the other party will provide
copies of such records or information (to the extent in existence) in the
form maintained by such furnishing party within twenty (20) Business Days
after such request. For a period of three years after the termination or
expiration of this Agreement (or such longer period as may be required by any
Governmental Authority or by the Purchase Agreement or reasonably requested
by a party in connection with

 



D-6  disputes or litigation), upon a partys reasonable request, the other party
and their representatives and counsel will use commercially reasonable efforts
not to dispose of or destroy any of the books and records relating to the
Services provided hereunder without first offering to turn over possession
thereof to such requesting party (at a requesting partys sole expense,
including reimbursing the furnishing party for any third party expenses), by
written notice to the requesting party to the extent practicable at least
thirty (30) days prior to the proposed date of such disposition or
destruction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon request by a party, the
other party (to the extent legally permitted to erase or destroy any such
information and subject to the right of such party to maintain an archive copy
of such information (subject to confidentiality obligations set forth in this
Agreement or the Purchase Agreement) to the extent necessary to comply with
its regulatory, accounting or record retention requirements, in connection
with any litigation or dispute resolution process) shall erase or destroy all
or any part of the requesting partys confidential information in such other
partys possession or control following the completion of all Transition
Periods in which such information is necessary for the performance of Services
hereunder. Each party shall provide or make available to the other party and
its Representatives reasonable access during regular business hours and upon
two Business Days advance notice to all relevant information, documentation
and staff of such other party connected with the Services hereunder, to the
extent reasonably requested during or after the term hereof to enable such
party to verify such other partys compliance with this Agreement and to
inspect, copy and otherwise use the books and records relating to the
Services in connection with the Companys business. Such access right shall
terminate sixth months from the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

 

9\. _Force Majeure; Reduction of Services_.

 

(a) Neither party shall be liable for any loss or damage whatsoever arising
out of any delay or failure in the performance of its obligations pursuant to
this Agreement to the extent such delay or failure results from events beyond
the control of that party, including but not limited to acts of God, acts or
regulations of any Governmental Authority, war, terrorism, riots, insurrection
or other hostilities, accident, fire, flood, strikes, lockouts, industrial
disputes, shortages of fuel or financial system disruptions or delays (a "
_Force Majeure Event_ "). A party experiencing a Force Majeure Event shall
only be excused from performance of its obligations pursuant to this
Agreement for the duration of the Force Majeure Event. Upon the occurrence of
a Force Majeure Event applicable to a party, such party shall promptly give
written notice to the other party of the Force Majeure Event and its expected
duration. Any delays or failures that are excused pursuant to this Section 9
shall automatically extend the time period for the affected Service equal to
the duration of the Force Majeure Event. If any Force Majeure Event
substantially prevents, hinders or delays performance of the Services for more
than three (3) consecutive days, Service Recipient may terminate the Services
(in whole or in part) upon two (2) days written notice to Service Provider.

(b) Whenever a Force Majeure Event causes a Service Provider to allocate
limited resources between or among Service Provider, its subsidiaries and
Service Recipient, Service Provider shall not provide priority to its own
business unit or subsidiaries over Service Recipient.

 

10\. _Dispute Resolution_. In the event of any dispute between the parties
with respect to the provision of the Services pursuant to this Agreement
(excluding disputes regarding a partys

 



D-7  compliance with the applicable confidentiality provisions hereof), each
party shall designate an employee as its representative to attempt to resolve
the dispute and each such representative will use commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve the dispute promptly. If the individuals designated by the
parties are unable to resolve the dispute promptly, the dispute will be
submitted to a member of senior management of each party. Such members of
senior management will meet in person or by telephone conference at least once
in the ten-day period following the submission of the dispute to them and will
use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute promptly. If such
members of senior management are unable to resolve the dispute within 15 days
of the submission of the dispute to them, the parties may exercise any rights
or remedies available to them set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.

 

11\. _Disclaimers; Limited Liability_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 6, Service Provider make no
express or implied representations, warranties or guarantees relating to the
Services to be performed under this Agreement, including, without limitation,
any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. Upon
Service Recipients request, Service Provider shall pass through benefits
of any express warranties, if any, received from third parties relating to
the Services to the extent permitted by the terms thereof, and shall (at
Service Recipients expense, including reimbursing Service Provider for any
third party expenses) assist Service Recipient with any warranty claims
related thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth elsewhere
in this Agreement, Service Recipient acknowledges and agrees that Service
Provider shall only be responsible for compiling information from either
Service Recipients systems or from entries prepared by and received from the
Service Recipient in a bookkeeping function, and are not responsible for the
certification or the accuracy of reserves, accruals, or cut-off accuracy of
working capital items of Service Recipients financial statements, internal
controls over financial reporting, or compliance (including compliance
reporting) under its credit facilities.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
will either party or its subsidiaries be liable, whether in negligence,
breach of contract or otherwise, for any damages, losses or expenses suffered
or incurred by any other party or Person arising out of or in connection with
the rendering of Services or any failure to render Services except to the
extent that such damages, losses or expenses are caused by the willful
misconduct (including willful refusal to perform) or gross negligence of the
responsible party or any of its subsidiaries. Furthermore, in no event shall
either party or its subsidiaries be liable for any indirect, special,
punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential losses, damages or expenses
of any kind, including without limitation, loss of profits, regardless of the
form of action or the theory of recovery, even if such party has been advised
of the possibility of such damages. Each party and its subsidiaries maximum
liability for any action, regardless of the form of action, whether in tort or
contract, arising under this Agreement shall be limited to the amount of fees
payable to such party by the other party under this Agreement. Subject to the
limitation of liability set forth in the immediately preceding sentence and
the provisions of Section 3, each party agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the other party and its subsidiaries from and against any damages,
losses or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them as a result of, or
arising from, any material breach by such indemnifying party of any covenant
or agreement herein, except to the extent that such damages, losses or
expenses are caused by the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the other
party or any of its subsidiaries. The limitations on the types and amount 

 



D-8  of damages set forth in this Section 11(b) shall not apply to any damages,
losses or expenses resulting from the following: (i) any breach of Section 14,
(ii) personal injury or property damage caused by the acts or omissions of
either party, its Affiliates or its Representatives, (iii) any fraud, gross
negligence, or willful misconduct (including willful refusal to perform) of a
party, and (iv) any failure of a party or its Affiliates to remit any funds
collected on behalf the other party or its Affiliates under this Agreement.

12\. _Term and Termination_.

(a) This Agreement shall become effective on the date hereof and, unless
sooner terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, shall continue in effect for
any Service through the Transition Period.

(b) Service Recipient may terminate any or all of the Services prior to the
expiration of the term of this Agreement by providing to Service Provider
written notice of termination not less than 30 days before the date of such
earlier termination, and the provision of such Services shall terminate at the
end of such notice period.

(c) This Agreement may be terminated in whole, but not in part, by either
party if:

 

(i) such party makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors or
becomes insolvent, or a receiver is appointed for, or a court approves
reorganization or arrangement proceedings on, such party;

(ii) the other party is in material breach of any provision of
this Agreement, provided that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
for breach shall notify the other party of such breach and provide such other
party with 15 days to cure such breach; or

 

(iii) with respect to a particular Service, to the extent that such Service is
prohibited by applicable Law.

 

(d) The terms of Sections 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12(d) and 13-25 shall survive
the expiration or termination of this Agreement. In addition, such other
terms set forth herein, as the context requires, shall survive to the extent
required to provide full force and effect to the parties obligations and
remedies with respect thereto.

 

13\. _Non-Solicitation of Employees_. For a period of one year from the date
of this Agreement, neither party nor any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates
shall, without the prior written approval of the other party, directly or
indirectly, solicit any employees of the other party or any of their
respective subsidiaries or Affiliates providing, receiving, coordinating or
participating in the provision, receipt or coordination of Services
hereunder, to terminate their relationship with such other party or such
subsidiary or Affiliate, either for itself or for any other person or entity.
To the extent consistent with the Purchase Agreement, the foregoing
prohibition shall not apply to individuals hired as a result of the use of an
independent employment agency (so long as the agency was not directed to
solicit a particular individual) or as a result of the use of a
general solicitation (such as a newspaper advertisement or on radio or
television) not specifically directed to employees of the other party or its
subsidiaries providing, receiving, coordinating or participating in the
provision, receipt or coordination of Services hereunder.

 



D-9 14\. _Nondisclosure of Proprietary Data_. Section 5.6 of the Purchase
Agreement shall apply to the information disclosed in connection with this
Agreement, whether orally, electronically, in writing or otherwise or
otherwise learned, acquired, retained or generated in connection with this
Agreement.

 

15\. _Independent Contractor_. The parties hereto understand and agree that
this Agreement does not make either of them an agent or legal representative
of the other for any purpose whatsoever. No party is granted, by this
Agreement or otherwise, any right or authority to assume or create any
obligation or responsibilities, express or implied, on behalf of or in the
name of any other party, or to bind any other party in any manner whatsoever
without the other partys prior written consent. The parties expressly
acknowledge (i) that Service Provider is an independent contractor with
respect to Service Recipient in all respects, including, without limitation,
the provision of Services hereunder, and (ii) that the parties are not
partners, joint venturers, employees or agents of or with each other.

 

16\. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is for the sole benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective subsidiaries, and nothing expressed
or implied shall give or be construed to give any other person any legal or
equitable rights hereunder, whether as a third party beneficiary or otherwise.

 

17\. _Entire Agreement_. The Transaction Documents, including all Exhibits
attached hereto (as may be amended from time to time to reflect the inclusion
of Additional Services), constitute the entire agreement of the parties
pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior agreements
and understandings of the parties in connection therewith. Except as
otherwise specified herein, in the event of a conflict between a provision in
this Agreement and a provision in the Purchase Agreement, the provisions in
this Agreement shall control with respect to the subject matter described
herein.

 

18\. _Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement and any Exhibit attached hereto may
be amended only by an agreement in writing among all the undersigned parties
hereto. No waiver of any provision nor consent to any exception to the terms
of this Agreement or any agreement contemplated hereby shall be effective
unless in writing and signed by the party to be bound and then only to
the specific purpose, extent and instance so provided. No failure on the part
of any party to exercise or delay in exercising any right hereunder shall be
deemed a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise preclude any
further or other exercise of such or any other right.

19\. _Notices_. All notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers and
other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to
have been given (a) when delivered by hand (with written confirmation of
receipt); (b) when received by the addressee if sent by a nationally
recognized overnight courier (receipt requested); (c) on the date sent by
facsimile or e-mail of a PDF document (with confirmation of transmission) if

20\. _No Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any rights or obligations
under it are assignable by a party without the prior written consent of the
other party, and any such purported assignment is void and the assignee will
acquire no rights from such purported assignment; _provided_ , _however_ ,
either party may make an assignment in whole or part of its rights, duties
and obligations hereunder to a controlled subsidiary thereof, and provided
further that such assignment shall not relieve the assigning party of its
obligations under this Agreement.

 

21\. _Construction_. All terms defined herein have the meanings assigned to
them herein for all purposes, and such meanings are equally applicable to
both the singular and plural forms of the terms defined. "Include," "includes"
and "including" shall be deemed to be followed by "without limitation" whether
or not they are in fact followed by such words or words of like

 



D-11  import. "Writing," "written" and comparable terms refer to printing, typing,
lithography and other means of reproducing words in a visible form. Any
instrument or law defined or referred to herein means such instrument or law
as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case
of instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of any law) by
succession of comparable successor laws and includes (in the case of
instruments) references to all attachments thereto and instruments
incorporated therein. References to a Person are, unless the context otherwise
requires, also to its successors and assigns. Any term defined herein
by reference to any instrument or law has such meaning whether or not such
instrument or law is in effect. "Shall" and "will" have equal force and
effect. "Hereof," "herein," "hereunder" and comparable terms refer to the
entire instrument in which such terms are used and not to any particular
article, section or other subdivision thereof or attachment thereto.
References in an instrument to "Article," "Section" or another subdivision or
to an attachment are, unless the context otherwise requires, to an article,
section or subdivision of or an attachment to such instrument. References to
any gender include, unless the context otherwise requires, references to
all genders, and references to the singular include, unless the context
otherwise requires, references to the plural and vice versa. All accounting
terms not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned under GAAP.

 

22\. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement and any amendment hereto or
any other agreement (or document) delivered pursuant hereto may be executed
in one or more counterparts and by different parties in separate counterparts.
All of such counterparts shall constitute one and the same agreement (or other
document) and shall become effective (unless otherwise provided therein) when
one or more counterparts have been signed by each party and delivered to the
other party.

23\. _Headings_. The descriptive headings of the Articles, Sections and
subsections of this Agreement are for convenience only and do not constitute a
part of this Agreement.

 

24\. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable by any Governmental Authority, the
remaining provisions of this Agreement to the extent permitted by law shall
remain in full force and effect; provided that the essential terms and
conditions of this Agreement for both parties remain valid, binding and
enforceable; and provided that the economic and legal substance of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. In event of any such determination, the
parties agree to negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement to fulfill
as closely as possible the original intents and purposes hereof. To the extent
permitted by law, the parties hereby to the same extent waive any provision of
law that renders any provision hereof prohibited or unenforceable in any
respect.

25\. _Governing Law; Dispute Resolution_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of Laws of any
jurisdiction other than those of the State of Delaware.

 



D-12 (b) The sole and exclusive method for resolving any claim or dispute ("
_Claim_ ") arising out of or relating to the rights and obligations of the
parties under this Agreement (other than with respect to the procedures set
forth in Section 10), whether such Claim arose or the facts on which such
Claim is based occurred prior to or after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement shall be mediation and arbitration as provided in this Section 25\.

(c) Either party may give notice of a Claim in writing to the other party and
the parties shall designate a mutually agreed mediator to resolve the Claim.
If the parties are unable to agree on a mediator, they shall submit the Claim
to JAMS, Inc. in Wilmington, Delaware and request a panel of prospective
neutrals to conduct a mediation process, who shall be individuals with
substantial experience with equity purchase agreements and complex commercial
contracts as well as familiarity with Delaware law relevant to transactions
of this type. The mediation shall be convened within thirty (30) days of the
notice of the Claim, or as soon thereafter as is feasible. If the mediation is
unsuccessful in resolving the Claim, either party may give notice of its
intention to arbitrate the Claim in accordance with Section 25(d).

(d) Any arbitration to resolve a Claim shall be administered by JAMS, Inc. in
accordance with its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the "
_Arbitration Rules_ ") before one arbitrator to be appointed pursuant to the
Arbitration Rules to conduct any such arbitration. The arbitrator shall have
substantial experience with equity purchase agreements and complex commercial
contracts as well as familiarity with Delaware law relevant to transactions of
this type. All meetings of the parties and all hearings with respect to any
such arbitration shall take place in Wilmington, Delaware, or such other place
as the parties may designate. Each party to the arbitration shall bear its own
costs and expenses (including all attorneys fees and expenses, except to the
extent otherwise required by applicable Law), and all costs and expenses of
the arbitration proceeding (such as filing fees, the arbitrators fees,
hearing expenses, etc.) shall be borne equally by the parties;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the arbitrator may, in the arbitrators discretion, award
costs and expenses to the prevailing party in the arbitration.

 

(e) In the event that any party or any of such partys Affiliates, associates
or representatives is requested or required (by oral question or request for
information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena,
civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any information
concerning an arbitration or mediation proceeding conducted in
accordance with this Agreement (the " _Disclosing Party_ "), such Disclosing
Party shall notify the other parties promptly of the request or requirement so
that any such other party may seek an appropriate protective order or waive
compliance with the provisions of this Section 25\. If, in the absence of a
protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, the Disclosing Party or
any of its Affiliates, associates or representatives believes in good faith,
upon the advice of legal counsel, that it is compelled to disclose any such
information, such Disclosing Party may disclose such portion of the
information as it believes in good faith, upon the advice of legal counsel, it
is required to disclose; provided that the Disclosing Party shall use
reasonable efforts to obtain, at the request and expense of such other party,
an order or other assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded to
such portion of the Arbitration Information required to be disclosed as such
other party shall designate. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 25 to
the contrary, the parties shall have no obligation to keep confidential any
Arbitration Information that becomes generally known to and available for use
by the public other than as a result of the disclosing partys acts or
omissions or the acts or omissions of such partys

 



D-13  Affiliates, associates or representatives. The parties agree that, subject
to the right of any party to appeal or move to vacate or confirm any decision,
judgment, ruling, finding, award or other determination of an arbitration as
provided in this Section 25, the decision, judgment, ruling, finding, award or
other determination of any arbitration under the Arbitration Rules shall be
final, conclusive and binding on all of the parties hereto and any party may
institute litigation to enforce any final decision, judgment, ruling, finding,
award or other determination of the arbitration.

 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the
day and year first above written.
