controversy should arise between them regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, and such
dispute or controversy occurs at a time when such other lending relationships have been established
by either or both of the Lenders, then either Lender may potentially claim that the other Lender
has been induced by improper or conflicting motivations to make administrative decisions regarding
the Loan which are not in the best interests of the Lender asserting the claim, but which may
instead have been calculated to protect or advance the position of the accused Lender in its
overall relationship with Borrower or its principals or Affiliates. Finally, both Lenders
acknowledge that such a claim would be impossible, as a practical matter, to disprove or refute
even if untrue, and both Lenders have determined for that reason to acknowledge and assume the
risks that are inherent in the circumstances described above. Accordingly, subject to the proviso
at the end of this sentence, each Lender hereby approves all such business relationships in which
the other Lender may choose to participate, and hereby agrees for the benefit of the other Lender
that, if any dispute or controversy should hereafter arise between them regarding or in any way
relating to the Loans, such Lender shall not assert or raise against the other Lender any claim or
defense based upon any alleged conflict of interest or improper disregard by the other Lender of
the best interests of the first Lender due in whole or in part to a desire to protect or advance a
greater or conflicting interest of the sort described above, and any and all such claims and
defenses are hereby expressly waived and released absolutely and forever; <U>provided</U> that the
foregoing acknowledgments, agreements and waivers shall not (i)&nbsp;diminish the Lenders&#146; duties to

Certification</B>&#148;) or (y)&nbsp;Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or successor form) certifying that it
is entitled to the benefits of a provision of a tax convention to which the United States is a
party which completely exempts from United States withholding tax all payments to be made to it
hereunder (the &#147;<B>Form&nbsp;W-8BEN Certification</B>&#148;). In addition, if Lender previously filed a Form W-8BEN
Certification it will deliver to B Participant a new Certification prior to the first payment date
falling in the third year following the previous filing of such certification; and if it previously
filed a Form W-8ECI Certification it will deliver to B Participant, each time upon request, a new
Form W-8ECI Certification prior to the first payment date occurring in each of its subsequent
taxable years. Each Lender agrees to deliver to B Participant such other or supplemental forms as
may at any time be required as a result of changes in applicable law or regulation in order to
confirm or maintain in effect its entitlement to exemption from U.S. withholding tax on any
payments hereunder. B Participant may withhold and pay to applicable governmental authorities any
withholding tax required from distributions to Lenders, and no payments to any Lender shall be
required to be grossed-up as a consequence of such withholding. If any withholding amounts are
required to be advanced on behalf of any Lender that is a non-U.S. person, such Lender shall
promptly upon written notice reimburse the Lender making such advance for the withheld amount.
