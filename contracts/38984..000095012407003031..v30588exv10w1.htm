B Participant may perform any of its obligations under this Agreement by or through its Affiliates, agents, employees or attorneys, _provided_ that the costs and fees of such Affiliates, agents, employees or attorneys shall be borne exclusively by B Participant unless such costs and fees constitute, for purposes of this Agreement, either (i) Borrower Reimbursable Costs, in which case B Participant shall only look to Borrower for reimbursement therefor pursuant to the Loan Documents and which shall otherwise be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, or (ii) Post-Acquisition Costs, in which case such Post-Acquisition Costs shall be paid in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement.

In the event that, notwithstanding the intent of the parties hereto, the conveyance, transfer and assignment contemplated hereby is not recognized as such, this Agreement shall constitute a security agreement under applicable law, and, in furtherance thereof B Participant shall be deemed to have granted, and does hereby grant, to A Participant a security interest in the Loans for the benefit of A Participant and its assignees as security for B Participants obligations hereunder, which pledge will be perfected by the possession of the promissory notes and participation certificates with respect to the Loans on behalf of A Participant by a financial institution agreed to by the Lenders.

 C. _Disbursements for Borrower Reimbursable Costs_.

 F. _Duty To Fund_. Nothing in this _Section 3_ shall relieve B Participant of its obligation to fund each Disbursement when and as required by the Loan Documents and this Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall B Participants total exposure for a particular Loan principal be required to exceed the maximum current commitment for such Loan set forth on  _Exhibit E_, as same may be changed through a Modification.

respect to the Notes and Loans in any calendar month, including Default

fees, extension fees, late fees, and other loan fees and assumption fees. If

Each Lender shall be solely responsible for any taxes, breakage costs, swaps or other hedge agreements, any regulatory requirements (including capital adequacy requirements and LIBOR requirements) that are specific or personal to such Lender as an entity. 

  

 E. _B Participant s Duty To Advise A Participant; Delivery of Default Notices_. B Participant shall deliver to A Participant such information relating to the Loans as A Participant may reasonably request from time to time; _provided, however_ , that to the extent A Participant requests information which is dependent on B Participant obtaining such information from a Borrower, Guarantor or other third party, it shall not be a breach by B Participant hereunder if B Participant fails to provide such information to A Participant because a Borrower, Guarantor or other third party has failed to provide such information to B Participant. B Participant shall also use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly advise A Participant of any matter of which B Participant becomes aware relating to the Loans, any of the Collateral, or any Borrower that, in B Participants commercially reasonable judgment, materially and adversely affects the interests of the Lenders hereunder. B Participant shall deliver to A Participant a copy of any written notices of default sent to a Borrower or Guarantor. 

  

 F. _Limitation on B Participant s Liability_. Neither B Participant nor any of its officers, directors, employees, attorneys or agents shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by them or any one of them under or in connection with the Loans, the Collateral or any portion thereof or this Agreement, except for B Participants gross negligence, willful misconduct or material breach of this Agreement. B Participant shall incur no liability to A Participant by acting in good faith upon any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (including telegram, cable, telex, e-mail or telecopy) reasonably believed by B Participant to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper party.

releases of the condominium common areas so long as such partial releases are
effected in substantial compliance with all of the pertinent requirements and
conditions of the Loan Documents. B Participant is further authorized to
release or assign any lien granted to or held by B Participant upon any
Collateral upon payment of any Loan in full and satisfaction in full of all
of the Secured Obligations with respect to a Loan and upon termination of
this Agreement.

   ##### 

  

  

 6. _DEFAULTS; ACQUISITION OF COLLATERAL_. 

  

 A. _Notice of Default to Other Lender_.

Each Lender shall promptly forward to the other Lender copies of any and all notices, correspondence and other materials that may be sent to or received by the first Lender in connection with any such default by a Borrower. 

  

 B. _Discretion of B Participant in Responding to Defaults of Borrower_. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under any of the Loan Documents, B Participant shall determine the response to such default and course of action with respect to such default, and B Participant shall have no such duty to consult with A Participant, including, without limitation, (i) the selection of attorneys to be used in connection with any action, whether judicial or otherwise, to protect the respective interests of the Lenders in the Loan and the Collateral, (ii) the declaration and recording of a notice of such default and the acceleration of the maturity of the Loan, (iii) the institution of proceedings to foreclose the Loan Documents securing the Loan pursuant to the power of sale contained therein or through a judicial action, (iv) the institution of proceedings against any Guarantor, (v) the acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, (vi) the purchase of the real property Collateral at a foreclosure sale or trustees sale or the purchase of the personal property Collateral at a Uniform Commercial Code sale, and (vii) the institution or continuation of proceedings to obtain a deficiency judgment against such Borrower or any Guarantor. 

  

 C. _Acquisition of Collateral_. If title to any or all of the Collateral is now owned or hereafter acquired by B Participant by foreclosure, by deed in lieu of foreclosure, by power of sale or by sale pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code, or otherwise, title to all such Collateral so acquired shall be held in the name of a limited liability company or such other entity as may be approved by the B Participant (the "Ownership Entity") (whether already in existence or formed by B Participant for such purpose), in which B Participant or its wholly-owned subsidiary or Affiliate shall be the sole managing member and in which B Participant (or its wholly-owned subsidiary or Affiliate) shall have a membership interest and A Participant shall have a membership interest that allows it to receive interest and principal payments in accordance with _Sections 4_ and  _7D_ hereof. The purposes of the Ownership Entity shall be to hold the Collateral pending sale, complete construction of such Project, sell any Condo Units, and operate the Collateral as efficiently as possible in order to minimize financial loss to the Lenders and to sell the Collateral as promptly as practicable in a way designed to minimize financial loss to the Lenders. If so determined by B Participant, in its sole discretion, B Participant may cause its interest in any Ownership Entity, but not that of the A Participant, to be held through a Taxable REIT Subsidiary (as defined in the Tax Code) with respect to B Participant, and B Participant shall have the right to make the necessary elections under the Tax Code. Nothing in this _Section 6C_ or anything else in this Agreement shall be deemed to affirmatively require B Participant to acquire all or any portion of the Collateral in the event of significant environmental contamination thereof. 

  

 D. _Management and Disposition of Acquired Collateral; Expenses_. All decisions concerning the management and maintenance of the Collateral acquired by the Ownership Entity 

   ##### 

  

    

shall be made in the manner set forth in _Section 7_ hereof. During the
period that the Collateral acquired by any Ownership Entity is subject to A
Participants and B Participants Participation interests, all expenses shall
be funded by B Participant (to the extent not payable out of revenues) and
shall accrue interest at the Interest Rate. 

  

 7. _ASSET MANAGEMENT OBLIGATIONS OF B PARTICIPANT_. After foreclosure of the Security Instrument or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or acquisition of the Collateral by power of sale or pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code, B Participant shall serve as asset manager for the acquired Collateral and shall manage such Collateral in accordance with the Servicing Standards and _Section 7F_, subject to the specific rights and obligations set forth herein. B Participant shall perform such asset management obligations at no cost or expense to the Lenders other than the Asset Management Fees payable to B Participant by the Lenders pursuant to  _Section 7I_ hereof and reimbursement for the reasonable expenses referred to in _Section 7D_ hereof that are advanced or incurred by B Participant in connection with its obligations under this _Section 7_ in accordance with said _Section 7D_. B Participant may perform, at no additional cost to Lenders, any of its obligations hereunder by or through its Affiliates, agents, employees or attorneys (but the B Participant shall remain liable therefor). B Participant shall supervise and coordinate the construction, ownership, management, leasing and preservation of the Collateral as well as all other matters involved in the administration and preservation of the Collateral. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, B Participant shall administer the Collateral in accordance with the following:

 (iv) B Participant shall cause the Ownership Entity to distribute monthly reports to the Lenders reflecting any net operating income (less reasonable reserves as set forth in the REO Budget) from the Collateral. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (v) If required because the Project has not been completed, or if set forth in the REO Budget, B Participant shall cause the Ownership Entity to enter into contracts for the completion and maintenance of the Project, including contracts with the general contractor, the Project architect and the major subcontractors. 

   

 (vi) B Participant shall cause the Ownership Entity to enter into and consummate contacts for the sale of Condo Units pursuant to parameters determined by B Participant, which parameters need not require a minimum selling price for any such Condo Unit greater than the Condo Minimum Sales Price for such Condo Unit. The guidelines described in this  _Section 7A(vi)_ shall collectively be referred to herein as the "Sales Guidelines". 

   

 (vii) Following acquisition of the Collateral as provided herein, B Participant (A) shall have the right but not the obligation to terminate the property manager or the exclusive sales agent (if any) and (B) shall have the sole right to hire and terminate property managers, sales agents and, if the Project is not then fully complete at the time in question, contractors, architects and other design and construction professionals and consultants. 

   

 (viii) B Participant shall cause the Ownership Entity to maintain property, casualty and liability insurance that is materially similar to the insurance required to be provided by Borrower immediately prior to the acquisition of the Collateral and materially similar to the insurance customarily maintained for similar properties in the relevant market.

 C. _Collection of Revenue_. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, B Participant shall have the exclusive right and obligation to collect any and all revenues generated by the Collateral (including proceeds from the sale of Condo Units), deposit such revenues into an interest bearing account for the benefit of the Lenders, and pay all Post-Acquisition Costs from such revenues. All such revenues shall be distributed at the times and in the manner provided in _Section 7D_ hereof. 

   ##### 

  

  

 D. _Allocation of Expenses_. B Participant shall use its reasonable efforts to recover from the operation of the Collateral all reasonable expenses incurred by B Participant in connection with the management of the Collateral in accordance with this Agreement.

 E. _B Participant s Duty To Advise A Participant_. In addition to the requirements of  _Section 7A_ hereof, after acquisition of the Collateral, B Participant shall deliver to A Participant such monthly reports relating to the Collateral as A Participant may reasonably request. B Participant shall also use its reasonable efforts promptly to advise A Participant of any matter of which B Participant becomes aware relating to any of the Collateral that, in B Participants reasonable judgment, materially affects the interests of the Lenders hereunder. 

  

 F. _Standard of Care_. B Participant shall exercise the same degree of care in the management of the Collateral that B Participant would exercise if such Collateral were being held by B Participant for its own account alone, and B Participant shall manage the Collateral in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements. Neither B Participant nor any of its officers, directors, employees, attorneys or agents shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by them or any one of them under this Agreement or in connection with the Collateral or any portion thereof, except for gross negligence, willful misconduct or material breach of this Agreement. B Participant shall incur no liability to A Participant by acting in good faith upon any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (including telegram, cable, telex or telecopy) reasonably believed by B Participant to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper party. 

   #####

 (vi) Execute any written release of a Borrower, any Guarantor, any Mezzanine Lender, or any other party now or hereafter liable for the payment of a Loan or the performance of any other obligation relating thereto, including in connection with any Guaranty, any Environmental Indemnity, or the Mezzanine Intercreditor Agreement, or amend in any way any Mezzanine Intercreditor Agreement or Third Party Intercreditor Agreement or enter into any other agreement with a Mezzanine Lender.

Net Collections shall be applied in the order of priority set forth in _Section 7D_ hereof, and B Participant shall wire transfer to A Participant, within five (5) Business Days after B Participants receipt, seventy percent (70%) of the Net Collections received by B Participant after first deducting therefrom any sums required by the purchase agreement (i) to be held back in order to cover post-closing re-prorations and/or (ii) to be deposited into escrow in order to cover the Ownership Entitys contingent liabilities, if any, under the purchase agreement for representations and warranties that survive the closing. Upon release to the Ownership Entity of any amounts referred to in clauses (i) or (ii) above, B Participant shall send A Participant 70% thereof. 

  

 I. _Asset Management Fee and Other Compensation Payable to B Participant_. In consideration of B Participants performing its obligations under this _Section 7_, the Lenders shall pay to B Participant, in lieu of any servicing fees, a monthly asset management fee (the "Asset Management Fee") in an amount equal to one-twelfth of 0.25% multiplied by the outstanding, principal balance of the affected Loan or the outstanding principal balance immediately prior to foreclosure. The Asset Management Fee shall be payable monthly in advance to B Participant, from the revenues generated by the Collateral, and B Participant is hereby authorized to deduct the Asset Management Fee from such revenues generated by the Collateral in accordance with _Section 7D_ hereof. To the extent such fee is not paid from revenues generated from the Collateral, such fee shall be advanced by B Participant as a Protective Advance or Post-Acquisition Cost, such amount shall accrue interest at the Interest Rate for the applicable Loan and shall be paid to B Participant on a monthly basis or at the time of sale of the Collateral before any distribution of Net Collections to Lenders in accordance with _Section 7D_ hereof. 

  

 J. _Participant REIT Compliance_. A Participant acknowledges it has been advised by B Participant that B Participant is a REIT or owned by REIT and that the manner in which mortgaged property taken through foreclosure or other means is managed could subject the REIT to a 100% tax on its net income from "prohibited transactions" such as the sale of inventory. A Participant further acknowledges that it has been advised by B Participant that there is an election that the REIT can make for foreclosure property that can allow it to avoid having prohibited transaction income, but only if the property is managed in accordance with the rules for that election. Any such election and the attendant tax return filings shall be the sole responsibility of B Participant, and A Participant shall have no responsibility or liability in connection therewith. B Participant acknowledges that A Participant does not have expertise in this area. B Participant shall be solely responsible for determining the specifics of how to comply with the REIT provisions of the Tax Code. A Participant shall have no obligation to determine how to comply with the relevant Tax Code provisions. B Participant shall only comply with the REIT provisions of the Code to the extent such compliance is reasonable, practical, and consistent with the terms of this Agreement. A Participant shall have no 

   ##### 

  

    

obligations under this _Section 7J_. B Participants specific approval shall
be required for continued construction on the property except as otherwise
permitted under this Agreement, for the engagement of a manager for the
property other than a third party manager not affiliated with A Participant
or B Participant, for any sales or business plan that entails a holding
period of more than 3 years for the property and for any leasing of the
property except in accordance with this Agreement. This _Section 7J_ shall
terminate from and after the date on which the B Participant is no longer
wholly or partially owned by a REIT. 

  

 8. _PAYMENTS_. 

  

 A. _Application of Principal and Certain Other Payments by A Participant_. If after the Effective Date B Participant receives principal payments (except to the extent such payments are entitled to be retained by B Participant as expressly provided herein) under a Loan then after payment of any Borrower Reimbursable Costs with respect to such Loan, B Participant shall forward to A Participant on the fifteenth (15) day of each month (or if the fifteen (15th) day is not a Business Day, the immediately following Business Day of the month) A Participants seventy percent (70%) interest in such principal payments received in the prior calendar month, and B Participant shall retain the remainder of such payments received in the prior calendar month. Payments which are not received in immediately available funds shall not be deemed to have been received by B Participant until B Participant shall have fully collected such principal payments. B Participant shall not be required to remit to A Participant any amount not actually collected by B Participant. If B Participant receives reimbursements for Borrower Reimbursable Costs (including Protective Advances) from a Borrower, B Participant shall first use such funds to reimburse itself for Borrower Reimbursable Costs (and any accrued and unpaid interest thereon). If B Participant receives any insurance proceeds or condemnation payments under a Loan, which funds are not used to repair, rebuild or restore the related Project in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, or if there are insurance or condemnation proceeds that have not been disbursed following such repair, restoration or rebuilding, then, subject to the terms of the Loan Documents, after payment of any unreimbursed Borrower Reimbursable Expenses and Protective Advances, B Participant shall forward to A Participant on the fifteenth (15th) day of each month (or if the fifteen (15th) day is not a Business Day, the immediately following Business Day of the month) following receipt, A Participants seventy percent (70%) interest in such proceeds or payments, and B Participant shall retain the remainder of such payments. All payments of principal, insurance and condemnation proceeds received by A Participant shall be used to reduce the principal amount of the A Participation. 

  

 B. _Application of Other Payments_. Each payment received by B Participant on account of a Loan other than payments described in Section 8A above, , whether received directly from a Borrower or any other Person liable for the payment of all or any portion of such Loan shall be applied as follows: first, to B Participants Borrower Reimbursable Costs and other permitted Loan costs payable to B Participant (and accrued and unpaid interest thereon); second, described in  _Section 4_. 

   #####

 B. _No Warranty of Payment_. The representations and warranties of B Participant set forth in _Section 9A_ hereof or otherwise contained in this Agreement shall in no event be construed as a warranty or guarantee by B Participant as to (i) future payments by any Borrower or Guarantor, (ii) any Borrowers or any Guarantors future compliance with or performance of any of the terms and conditions contained in the Loan Documents, or (iii) the collectibility of the Loans.

In addition to the representations and warranties of Fremont set forth in the Purchase Agreement, A Participant hereby represents and warrants to B Participant, as of the Effective Date, as follows: 

   

 (i) _Authorization_. A Participant has received all such authorizations of A Participants board of directors and such other bodies or Persons as are necessary to authorize (i) A Participants execution of this Agreement, and (ii) the consummation by A Participant of the transactions contemplated hereby, and all such authorizations remain in full force and effect. 

   

 (ii) _Relationship Between A Participant and Borrowers_. A Participant is not a partner or joint venturer with any Borrower, nor is A Participant an agent of any Borrower, or vice versa; and, except as set forth in the Loan Documents or as otherwise disclosed to B Participant in writing, A Participant has no interest whatsoever in any Borrower or, except pursuant to this Agreement, any of the Collateral. 

   

 (iii) _No Cross-Default or Cross-Collateralization_. No Loan is cross-defaulted with any other loan from A Participant and the Collateral does not secure any other loan from A Participant. 

   

 (iv) _Brokers_. A Participant has not dealt with any broker, investment banker, agent (excluding counsel) or other Person who may be entitled to any commission or compensation in connection with the sale of the Loans to B Participant. 

   

 (v) _Contravention_. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor consummation by A Participant of the transactions contemplated hereby nor compliance by A Participant with the terms, conditions and provisions herein set forth (or any of them) will conflict with or result in a breach of any of the material terms, conditions or provisions of (a) any material contractual obligation to which A Participant is now a party or the terms of the Loan Documents, (b) any judgment or order, writ, injunction, decree or demand of any court applicable to A Participant, or (c) any applicable requirement of law in any material respect. 

   

 (vi) _Solvency_. As of the Effective Date and after giving effect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, A Participant: (a) owns and will own assets the fair saleable value of which are (1) greater than the total amount of liabilities (including contingent obligations) of A Participant, and (2) greater than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of A Participants then existing debts as they become absolute and matured considering all financing alternatives and potential asset sales reasonably available to A Participant; (b) has capital that is not insufficient in relation to its business as presently conducted or any contemplated or undertaken transaction; and (c) does not intend to incur and does not 

   ##### 

  

    

believe that it will incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they
become due. A Participant has not entered into this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement with the actual intent to
hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor. 

  

 B. _No Warranty of Payment_. The representations and warranties of A Participant set forth in _Section 10A_ hereof or otherwise contained in this Agreement shall in no event be construed as a warranty or guarantee by A Participant as to (i) future payments by any Borrower or Guarantor, (ii) any Borrowers or Guarantors future compliance with or performance of any of the terms and conditions contained in the Loan Documents, or (iii) the collectibility of any Loan. 

  

 11. _RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LENDERS_. It is expressly understood and agreed that, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, as between themselves the Lenders shall occupy the status of, act as and be considered independent contractors and neither Lender shall in any event be considered an agent, creditor, partner or employee of the other Lender, it being the intent of the Lenders that this Agreement shall not constitute nor be construed to create a security agreement or partnership or joint venture of any kind between A Participant and B Participant. Neither Lender shall have a fiduciary relationship of any kind with the other Lender, and nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, is intended or shall be construed to impose upon either Lender any obligations with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except as expressly set forth herein. No REMIC election shall be made in respect of any of the Loans. 

  

 12. _ASSIGNMENT; OTHER LOANS BY LENDERS; PURCHASE BY MEZZANINE LENDER_. 

  

 A. _In General, No Assignment_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 21_ hereof with respect to B Participants right to use an Affiliate to perform one or more of its obligations under this Agreement, or as otherwise provided in this _Section 12_ with respect to each Lenders right to sell sub-participation interests in the Loans or assign its entire interest in this Agreement, or as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, neither Lender shall sell participations in its participation interest or assign this Agreement, or any rights hereunder, to any other Person whomsoever, without the prior written consent of the other Lender, which consent may be given or withheld in the other Lenders reasonable discretion. Any such sale, sub-participation or assignment without the consent of the other Lender shall be absolutely void and of no force or effect whatsoever. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither B Participant nor A Participant shall sell, transfer or assign any interest in a Loan or any servicing in the Loans if such sale, assignment or transfer is not permitted under the related Loan Agreement. B Participant may not assign its rights and obligations as servicer (other than to an Affiliate and without relief from B Participants servicing obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of A Participant). Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding on and shall inure to the benefit of A Participant and B Participant and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 B. _Assignments_. Notwithstanding _Section 12A_, either Lender (a "Transferring Lender") may, in the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable Law, at any time assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, 

   ##### 

  

    

without limitation, all of its commitment to make Disbursements) to the other
Lender, any Affiliate of the other Lender or to a Permitted Transferee (each
an "Acquiring Lender"), subject to the following provisions: 

   

 (i) If B Participant is the Transferring Lender, such assignment shall be of the entire interest of such Transferring Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, the Loans, the Loan Agreements and the other Loan Documents. If A Participant (or any assignee of A Participant) is the Transferring Lender, such assignment shall be of the entire interest or a portion of the interest of such Transferring Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, the Loans, the Loan Agreements and the other Loan Documents, provided that in no event may there be more than ten (10) owners of the A Participation and the holders of the A Participation shall designate in writing one entity as the directing holder of such interest with full power and authority to bind all of the other holders for all purposes of this Agreement. B Participant may fully rely on all consents, approvals and other determinations made by such directing holder.. 

   

 (ii) Such assignment shall be made pursuant to a Transfer Supplement in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_, duly completed, with such immaterial changes thereto as the Transferring Lender and the transferee shall agree upon (a "Transfer Supplement"). 

   

 (iii) Any transfer to a Person which is not (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender, or (c) otherwise a Permitted Transferee shall require the prior written consent of B Participant if such transfer is by A Participant, or by A Participant if such transfer is by B Participant, which consent may be withheld by A Participant and B Participant its reasonable discretion. 

   

 (iv) If B Participant is the Transferring Lender, then such assignment shall be subject to the A Participation and all of A Participants rights under this Agreement. 

  

 C. _Assignment Procedures_. In order to effect any such assignment the Transferring Lender and the Acquiring Lender shall execute and deliver to B Participant, with a copy to A Participant (if the Transferring Lender is B Participant) a duly completed Transfer Supplement; and, upon receipt thereof, B Participant shall accept such Transfer Supplement. Upon such execution, delivery and acceptance, from and after the close of business at B Participants office in New York, New York, on the Transfer Effective Date specified in such Transfer Supplement: 

   

 (i) The Acquiring Lender shall be a party hereto and, to the extent provided in such Transfer Supplement, shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder. 

   

 (ii) The Transferring Lender thereunder shall be released from its obligations under this Agreement and shall cease to be a party to this Agreement from and after the Transfer Effective Date specified in such Transfer Supplement. 

  

 D. _Tax Treatment_. No assignment shall be effective if, in the judgment of that Lender which is not the Transferring Lender (based upon an opinion of counsel or as otherwise determined by such Lender in its reasonable discretion), such assignment would otherwise cause 

   ##### 

  

    

this participation arrangement to be a "taxable mortgage pool" under the Tax
Code or otherwise be taxable as a corporation. 

  

 E. _Release of Obligations_. Upon the consummation of the purchase and sale of the Transferring Lenders interest in the Loans as aforesaid, the Transferring Lender shall be released from all obligations and liabilities under this Agreement and the Loan Documents arising on or after the consummation of the sale contemplated by this _Section 12_. 

  

 F. _Other Loans by A Participant or B Participant; Conflicts of Interest_. B Participant shall have the right in the future to enter into additional credit arrangements and/or lending relationships with some or all of Borrowers, Borrowers principals or any Affiliates thereof, _provided_ that (i) the entering into of such additional credit arrangements and/or lending relationships is not prohibited by the Loan Documents and (ii) such other credit arrangements are not cross-defaulted with any Loan or cross-collateralized with any of the Collateral. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit or preclude the right of B Participant to exercise any rights or remedies available to it with respect to any such arrangements or relationships. In addition, A Participant and B Participant recognize that if a future dispute or controversy should arise between them regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, and such dispute or controversy occurs at a time when such other lending relationships have been established by either or both of the Lenders, then either Lender may potentially claim that the other Lender has been induced by improper or conflicting motivations to make administrative decisions regarding the Loan which are not in the best interests of the Lender asserting the claim, but which may instead have been calculated to protect or advance the position of the accused Lender in its overall relationship with Borrower or its principals or Affiliates. Finally, both Lenders acknowledge that such a claim would be impossible, as a practical matter, to disprove or refute even if untrue, and both Lenders have determined for that reason to acknowledge and assume the risks that are inherent in the circumstances described above. Accordingly, subject to the proviso at the end of this sentence, each Lender hereby approves all such business relationships in which the other Lender may choose to participate, and hereby agrees for the benefit of the other Lender that, if any dispute or controversy should hereafter arise between them regarding or in any way relating to the Loans, such Lender shall not assert or raise against the other Lender any claim or defense based upon any alleged conflict of interest or improper disregard by the other Lender of the best interests of the first Lender due in whole or in part to a desire to protect or advance a greater or conflicting interest of the sort described above, and any and all such claims and defenses are hereby expressly waived and released absolutely and forever; _provided_ that the foregoing acknowledgments, agreements and waivers shall not (i) diminish the Lenders duties to comply with their obligations set forth herein, including, without limitation, B Participants obligation hereunder to comply with the Servicing Standards, or (ii) otherwise apply to a breach of this Agreement by either Lender. 

  

 G. _Sharing of Payments_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein (including, without limitation, with respect to costs and expenses due and payable solely to B Participant), neither Lender shall obtain any payment or payments (whether voluntary or involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off or otherwise) to be applied on account of its Participation interest unless such payment or payments shall be shared by both Lenders in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If any such payment or payments are rescinded, set aside or otherwise recovered by or on behalf of the person or entity from whom the payment or payments are 

   ##### 

  

    

received, or by or for the creditors of such person or entity, then any such
payment or payments made to the other Lender pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall be returned to the Lender against whom such recovery is
made. 

  

 H. _Purchase of Affected Loan by Mezzanine Lender_. The Lenders hereby acknowledge and agree that if there is a Mezzanine Lender, the Mezzanine Lender may have the right, under certain circumstances, to purchase, in whole but not in part, one or more of the Loans in accordance with the terms of the applicable Mezzanine Intercreditor Agreement (the "Mezzanine Lender Loan Purchase"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, A Participant agrees that B Participant shall have the right, without any further consent from A Participant, to sell the entire affected Loan (including, without limitation, A Participants interest in the affected Loan) to Mezzanine Lender (or its designee) in accordance with the terms of the Mezzanine Intercreditor Agreement (and by such agreement, A Participant agrees that B Participant has the full power and authority to sell the entire affected Loan in accordance with the terms of the Mezzanine Intercreditor Agreement). In connection with such Mezzanine Lender Loan Purchase, each Lender shall have a right to the amounts due and payable to such Lender under this Agreement from the loan purchase price provided for in the Mezzanine Intercreditor Agreement, payable in accordance with the provisions of _Section 8_ hereof. In connection with the Mezzanine Lender Loan Purchase, and in time for the closing of such sale, A Participant shall (i) cause its interest in the affected Loan to be free and clear of all liens and encumbrances thereon, and upon the written request of B Participant, shall promptly deliver a written representation to B Participant that its interest in the affected Loan is so free and clear, and (ii) deliver to B Participant any original Loan Documents held by A Participant, or any of Borrowers funds escrowed with A Participant in connection with the Loan. 

  

 I. _Exercise of Buy-Sell and Redemption Rights under Third Party Intercreditor Agreements_. The Lenders hereby acknowledge and agree that pursuant to certain of the Third Party Intercreditor Agreements, the other parties (and B Participant) may have the right, under certain circumstances, to initiate buy-sell and redemption procedures in accordance with the terms of the applicable Third Party Intercreditor Agreement (the "Third Party Rights"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, A Participant agrees that B Participant shall have the right, without any further consent from A Participant, to elect to buy or sell or to redeem or accept a redemption of, the entire affected Loan (including, without limitation, A Participants interest in the affected Loan) to or from such third party not affiliated with B Participant in accordance with the terms of the Third Party Intercreditor Agreement (and by such agreement, A Participant agrees that B Participant has the full power and authority to elect to buy or sell or to redeem or accept a redemption of the affected Loan in accordance with the terms of the applicable Third Party Intercreditor Agreement). In connection with such Third Party Rights, each Lender shall have a right to the amounts due and payable to such Lender under this Agreement from the purchase or redemption price provided for in the Third Party Intercreditor Agreement, payable in accordance with the provisions of _Section 8_ hereof. In connection with the Third Party Rights, if the action taken is to sell the Loan or accept a redemption of the Loan, and in time for the closing of such sale, A Participant shall (i) cause its interest in the affected Loan to be free and clear of all liens and encumbrances thereon, and upon the written request of B Participant, shall promptly deliver a written representation to B Participant that its interest in the affected Loan is so free and clear, and (ii) deliver to B Participant any original Loan Documents held by A Participant, or any of Borrowers funds 

   ##### 

  

    

escrowed with A Participant in connection with the Loan. If B Participant
elects to purchase or redeem the portion of the affected Loan not owed by B
Participant, B Participant shall fund the purchase by means of a Protective
Advance, and such Protective Advance shall bear interest at the Interest Rate
for the affected Loan. 

  

 13. _LENDERS  TITLE INSURANCE_. The Lenders hereby acknowledge and agree that the Title Policy insuring the lien of the Security Instrument securing the Loan which is required by the Loan Documents was issued in favor of A Participant as the only insured thereunder; and has been or will be endorsed to reflect B Participant as the only insured, but that A Participant shall share in B Participants interest therein, including any recovery thereunder, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 14. _TERMINATION_. At such time as the outstanding principal amount of the A Participation has been reduced to zero, A Participant shall have no further rights or remedies under this Agreement or with respect to the Loans. 

  

 15. _NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY_. This Agreement is made for the sole benefit of A Participant and B Participant and their respective permitted successors and permitted assigns and no other Person or Persons (including, without limitation, Borrower and any other Lender) shall have any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement. 

  

 16. _LEGAL FEES RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT_. No party to this Agreement shall be responsible for the payment of the legal fees or expenses incurred by the other party hereto in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement or any subsequent modifications or supplements hereto. 

  

 17. _LITIGATION EXPENSES_. If any lawsuit or proceeding is brought by any party hereto to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the unsuccessful party or parties to any such lawsuit or proceeding shall pay to the party or parties prevailing therein all of such prevailing partys or parties court costs and reasonable legal fees and costs incurred in the prosecution or defense of such lawsuit or proceeding. 

  

 18. _BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS AND FINDER S FEES_. Each party to this Agreement hereby warrants to the other party hereto that the warranting party has had no dealings with any agent, broker or finder in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement, and each party hereto hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the other party hereto harmless from and against any and all losses, costs, liabilities or expenses for any compensation, commission, charge or fee claimed by any such agent, broker or finder with respect to this Agreement or the creation of the interests in the Loan pursuant to the provisions hereof. 

  

 19. _NOTICES_. All notices, requests, demands and consents of any kind which either of the parties hereto may be required or may desire to serve upon the other party hereto in connection with this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered (as an alternative to personal service) by registered or certified mail, or by recognized overnight courier service. Any such notice, request, demand or consent so to be served by registered or certified mail, or recognized overnight courier service, shall be delivered with all applicable delivery charges thereon fully prepaid and shall be addressed to the party so to be served as follows:

 21. _PERFORMANCE BY B PARTICIPANT AFFILIATE_. At B Participants option, any obligations to be performed by B Participant hereunder may be performed by an Affiliate of B Participant. In the event B Participant elects at any time upon notice to A Participant during the term of this Agreement to use such Affiliate, at B Participants sole cost and expense and without reimbursement from A Participant or deduction from any amounts paid by any Borrower that would otherwise be payable to A Participant, (a) B Participant shall cause every item or document that is required hereunder to be delivered, assigned, submitted or supplied to B Participant to name such Affiliate in lieu of B Participant where appropriate and shall further cause every such item or document to be delivered, assigned, submitted or supplied to such Affiliate and (b) A Participant shall cooperate with B Participant to do so.

 25. _TIME OF ESSENCE_. Time is hereby declared to be of the essence of this Agreement and of every part hereof. 

  

 26. _RIGHT TO SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE_. BOTH LENDERS HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE DAMAGES TO BE INCURRED BY ANY ONE LENDER, AS THE CASE MAY BE, AS A RESULT OF THE OTHER LENDERS DEFAULT AS DESCRIBED ABOVE WILL BE DIFFICULT, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE, TO ASCERTAIN, THAT DAMAGES WILL NOT BE AN ADEQUATE REMEDY AND, THEREFORE, THAT IT IS BOTH NECESSARY AND APPROPRIATE FOR THE REMEDY OF SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE TO BE AVAILABLE TO THE NON-DEFAULTING PARTY. 

  

 27. _REGISTER_. The B Participant shall maintain a register in which ownership of each Participation is recorded. B Participant and any agent of the B Participant may treat as the owner of a Participation the person in whose name such Participation is registered on the register on any applicable date for the purpose of receiving payments of principal of and interest and other amounts under such Participation and on any other date for all other purposes whatsoever, 

   ##### 

  

    

and none of B Participant nor any agent of B Participant shall be affected by
notice to the contrary. 

  

 28. _WITHHOLDING_. Each Lender (and any assignee) must certify to B Participant that it is either (i) a corporation organized under the laws of the United States or any State thereof (or a subsidiary of such a corporation, the separate existence of which is disregarded for federal income tax purposes) or (ii) entitled to complete exemption from United States withholding tax imposed on or with respect to any payments to be made to it hereunder in respect of any extensions of credit made pursuant to any Loan Agreement (x) under an applicable provision of a tax convention to which the United States is a party or (y) because it is acting through a branch, agency or office in the United States and any payment to be received by it hereunder is effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States. On or prior to the first date that any payment is to be made to an Acquiring Lender hereunder, or at such other times as required by United States law or as B Participant reasonably request, (i) if it is a corporation organized under the laws of the United States or any State thereof (or a subsidiary of such a corporation, the separate existence of which is disregarded for federal income tax purposes) it shall deliver to B Participant a written statement attesting that it is a corporation so organized and (ii) if it is not a corporation organized under the laws of the United States or any State thereof it shall deliver to B Participant two accurate and complete original signed copies of either (x) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or successor form) certifying that all payments to be made to it hereunder will be effectively connected to a United States trade or business (the "Form W-8ECI Certification") or (y) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or successor form) certifying that it is entitled to the benefits of a provision of a tax convention to which the United States is a party which completely exempts from United States withholding tax all payments to be made to it hereunder (the "Form W-8BEN Certification"). In addition, if Lender previously filed a Form W-8BEN Certification it will deliver to B Participant a new Certification prior to the first payment date falling in the third year following the previous filing of such certification; and if it previously filed a Form W-8ECI Certification it will deliver to B Participant, each time upon request, a new Form W-8ECI Certification prior to the first payment date occurring in each of its subsequent taxable years. Each Lender agrees to deliver to B Participant such other or supplemental forms as may at any time be required as a result of changes in applicable law or regulation in order to confirm or maintain in effect its entitlement to exemption from U.S. withholding tax on any payments hereunder. B Participant may withhold and pay to applicable governmental authorities any withholding tax required from distributions to Lenders, and no payments to any Lender shall be required to be grossed-up as a consequence of such withholding. If any withholding amounts are required to be advanced on behalf of any Lender that is a non-U.S. person, such Lender shall promptly upon written notice reimburse the Lender making such advance for the withheld amount.

 _Recitals:_  

   

 A. This Transfer Supplement is being executed and delivered in accordance with _Section 12B_ of that certain Loan Participation Agreement, dated for reference purposes only as of  _ _ ___, 2007, between _ _ _ _ as A Participant and  _ _ _ _, as B Participant (collectively, the "Lenders") (as the same may be amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, collectively the "Participation Agreement"). Initially capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings specified in the Participation Agreement.

 NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:
