to Purchaser and Purchaser will purchase from each Vista Blocker Seller,
severally and not jointly, the number of shares of each Vista Blocker set
forth across from such Vista Blocker Seller's name on the "Equity Interests
Schedule," which collectively constitute all of the outstanding Vista Blocker

actions of Purchaser) and (ii) at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall,
automatically and without any action on the part of any party, be merged with

cease. The Company shall be the surviving entity in the Merger (hereinafter
sometimes referred to for the periods on and after the Effective Time as the
"Surviving Entity"), and the separate existence of the Company, with all its
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue
unaffected by the Merger, except as provided in Section 2.5(e). The Merger
shall have the effects set forth in the DLLCA, the Certificate of Merger and

the extent related to, the Company's calculation of the Distribution Waterfall
or the transactions constituting the Pre-Closing Reorganization (other than as
expressly set forth in the Contribution Agreement); each Seller's entitlement
to the Merger Consideration or the Blocker Corporation Payment or any other
amounts payable hereunder, as applicable, shall be conditioned upon such
Seller's execution and delivery of a Letter of Transmittal. To the extent any
adjustments are made to the Distribution Waterfall by the Company in
accordance with this Agreement, such adjustments shall not increase the
aggregate amount of the Initial Purchase Price or, following adjustment
pursuant to Section 2.6 below, the Adjusted Purchase Price.

Purchaser's election.

representing all of the Vista Blocker Shares held by such Vista Blocker Seller

(v)the Company shall deliver to Purchaser a certificate, under penalties of

or its registrar and transfer agent may reasonably request at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date in order to issue the Purchaser Shares
to such Seller; and



(viii)each holder of Units (other than any holder of the Vista Blocker Units),
as a condition to its entitlement to the Merger Consideration or any other
amounts payable hereunder shall deliver to the Company a Letter of
Transmittal;



provided, that, any Seller failing to satisfy the applicable requirements of
this Section 2.3(b) prior to or at the Closing shall not be entitled to
receive its portion of the Merger Consideration until such requirements have
been satisfied or otherwise waived by Purchaser.

2.4Repaid Indebtedness; Transaction Expenses. It is contemplated by the
parties that, upon the Closing, all Indebtedness for borrowed money of the
Company Group as of the Closing Date which is listed on the "Repaid
Indebtedness Schedule" (to the extent not paid by, or on the behalf of, the
Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing) (the "Repaid Indebtedness")
will be fully repaid and that such repayment will be funded by Purchaser. In
order to facilitate such repayment, at least two (2) Business Days prior to
the Closing the Company shall obtain payoff letters in substantially final
form for the Repaid Indebtedness, which such payoff letters shall be in form
and substance customary for transactions of this type, from the applicable
agent on behalf of the Persons to whom such Repaid Indebtedness is owed, which
such payoff letters together with any related release documentation shall,
among other things, include the payoff amount 

and provide that Liens (and guarantees), if any, granted in connection
therewith relating to the assets, rights and properties of the Company Group
securing such Indebtedness and any other obligations secured thereby, shall,
upon the payment of the amount set forth in the applicable payoff letter at or
prior to the Closing, be released and terminated. In addition, it is
contemplated by the parties hereto that, upon the Closing, all of the
Transaction Expenses (to the extent not paid by, or on the behalf of, the
Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing) will be fully paid, and that
such payment will be funded by Purchaser. Subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions, covenants and obligations to be satisfied at or prior to the
Closing, in connection with the Closing, Purchaser shall make payment of the
Repaid Indebtedness and the Transaction Expenses (to the extent not paid by,
or on the behalf of, the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing) on
the Closing Date in order to discharge the amounts payable in respect thereof.
For the avoidance of doubt, any Repaid Indebtedness or Transaction Expenses
funded by Purchaser pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall be included in the
calculation of and shall constitute Indebtedness of the Company Group and
Transaction Expenses, as the case may be, as of the Adjustment Time for
purposes of Section 2.6.



2.5Conversion of Units of the Company; Payment and Exchange; Surviving Entity.



(a)At the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of any party, each Unit that is outstanding (other than
any Units held by Purchaser, directly or indirectly, including the Vista
Blocker Units following the Stock Purchase) shall thereupon be converted into
and become the right to receive a portion of the Initial Purchase Price, less
the portion of the Initial Purchase Price that constitutes the Blocker
Corporation Payment, and less the Sellers' Representative Expense Fund, as
allocated pursuant to Section 2.5(b), subject to adjustment pursuant to
Section 2.6(d) and to be paid in accordance with Section 2.2 (the "Merger
Consideration"). At the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of any party, each Unit (other than any
Units held by Purchaser, directly or indirectly, including the Vista Blocker
Units following the Stock Purchase) shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist. Each Unit held by Purchaser, directly or
indirectly (consisting of the Vista Blocker Units) shall remain as outstanding
membership units in the Surviving Entity. Each certificate held by a holder
formerly representing any Units (if certificated) and each book-entry Unit, if
any, in each case which are cancelled in accordance with this Section 2.5(a),
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive payment in accordance
with Section 2.5(d) and Section 2.6(d), if applicable.

(b)The Merger Consideration shall be allocated so that each holder of Units
(other than the Vista Blocker Units) outstanding as of the Effective Time
shall be entitled to receive upon the terms and conditions hereof, in full
settlement of such Units, a portion of the Merger Consideration in accordance
with the Distribution Waterfall.

(c)At the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Purchaser or Merger Sub, each membership interest of
Merger Sub shall be converted into one membership unit of the Surviving
Entity.

(d)After the Effective Time, each holder of Units (other than any holder of
the Vista Blocker Units) who delivers a completed and duly executed letter of
transmittal substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit G (a "Letter
of Transmittal") to the Sellers' Representative, with a copy delivered to
Purchaser, shall be entitled to receive, in exchange therefor, from the
Sellers' Representative, such portion of the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.5(b) into which such holder's Units shall have been converted as a
result of the Merger.

(e)At the Effective Time, (i) the certificate of formation and limited
liability company agreement of the Surviving Entity shall be the certificate
of formation and limited liability company agreement of Merger Sub as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended as
provided therein and under the DLLCA, and (ii) the officers and managers of
the Surviving Entity shall be the officers and managers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall cause each of the
officers and managers of the Company to tender their written resignation of
such position (in a form reasonably acceptable 

to Purchaser), immediately prior to, and effective as of, the Closing, unless
otherwise requested in writing by Purchaser to the Sellers' Representative.

(f)For the avoidance of doubt, no holder of Units shall have any rights to
appraisal or any dissenters' rights under the DLLCA, the Company LLC Agreement
or otherwise, in each case, with respect to such holder's Units or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.



2.6.Rapid Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses Adjustment.



(a)Determination of Closing Adjustment. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall prepare, in consultation with Purchaser, and no later than three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Purchaser
with its good faith estimate of the aggregate amount of all Indebtedness of
the Company Group as of the Adjustment Time ("Estimated Indebtedness"), its
good faith estimate of the aggregate amount of all Transaction Expenses as of
the Adjustment Time ("Estimated Transaction Expenses"), and the amount, if
any, by which the Initial Cash Purchase Price and the corresponding Initial
Purchase Price is to be adjusted as a result thereof (such statement setting
forth the Estimated Indebtedness, Estimated Transaction Expenses and any
adjustment to the Initial Cash Purchase Price and the corresponding Initial
Purchase Price therefrom, the "Estimated Closing Statement"). The Estimated
Closing Statement shall also include (x) a calculation of the Blocker
Corporation Cash Payment and the portion of the Initial Cash Purchase Price
payable to each holder of Units (other than Purchaser with respect to the
Vista Blocker Units) in accordance herewith, (y) reasonable supporting detail
to evidence the Company's calculations, explanations and assumptions for the
calculations of the amounts contained therein and (z) the number of Purchaser
Shares to be issued to each Seller as the Stock Consideration.



(b)Determination of Post-Closing Adjustment. No later than thirty (30) days
following the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver to the Sellers' Representative
Purchaser's calculation of the actual Indebtedness of the Company Group as of
the Adjustment Time ("Actual Indebtedness") and a calculation of the actual
Transaction Expenses as of the Adjustment Time ("Actual Transaction
Expenses"), and the amount, if any, by which the Initial Cash Purchase Price
and the corresponding Initial Purchase Price is to be adjusted as a result
thereof (such statement setting forth Actual Transaction Expenses together
with the Actual Indebtedness and any adjustment to the Initial Cash Purchase
Price and the corresponding Initial Purchase Price therefrom, the "Closing
Statement"). During the preparation by Purchaser of the Closing Statement,
Purchaser and its agents shall be provided, to the extent in the possession or
control of the Sellers or their Affiliates, with such access to the financial
books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, Outdoors LLC), as well as any relevant work papers
(provided that any accountants shall not be obliged to make any work papers
available to the except in accordance with customary disclosure procedures and
then only after such Person has signed a customary agreement relating to such
access to work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such
accountants) as it may reasonably request to enable it to evaluate the
calculations of Estimated Indebtedness and Estimated Transaction Expenses
prepared by the Company. Without the Sellers' Representative's written
consent, Purchaser shall not have the right to modify the Closing Statement or
any amounts set forth therein after Purchaser first delivers the Closing
Statement to the Sellers' Representative.

(c)Disputed Final Adjustment.



(i)No later than thirty (30) days following the delivery by Purchaser of the
calculation of Actual Indebtedness and Actual Transaction Expenses, the
Sellers' Representative shall notify Purchaser in writing whether it accepts
or disputes the accuracy of the calculation of Actual Indebtedness and Actual
Transaction Expenses. During such thirty (30) day period, the Sellers'
Representative and its agents shall be provided with such access to the
financial books and records 

of Purchaser and the Company Group as well as any relevant work papers
(provided that the accountants of the Purchaser or Company shall not be
obliged to make any work papers available to the Sellers' Representative
except in accordance with customary disclosure procedures and then only after
such Person has signed a customary agreement relating to such access to work
papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants) as it
may reasonably request to enable it to evaluate the calculations of Actual
Indebtedness and Actual Transaction Expenses prepared by Purchaser. If the
Sellers' Representative accepts the calculation of Actual Indebtedness and
Actual Transaction Expenses determined pursuant to Section 2.6(b), or if the
Sellers' Representative fails within such thirty (30) day period to notify
Purchaser of any dispute with respect thereto, then the calculation of Actual
Indebtedness determined pursuant to Section 2.6(b) shall be the "Final
Indebtedness," and the calculation of Actual Transaction Expenses determined
pursuant to Section 2.6(b) shall be the "Final Transaction Expenses," which,
in each case, shall be deemed final and conclusive and binding upon all
parties in all respects.



(ii)If the Sellers' Representative disputes the accuracy of the calculation of
Actual Indebtedness or Actual Transaction Expenses, the Sellers'
Representative shall provide written notice to Purchaser no later than thirty
(30) days following the delivery by Purchaser to the Sellers' Representative
of the calculation of Actual Indebtedness and Actual Transaction Expenses (the
"Dispute Notice"), setting forth in reasonable detail those items that the
Sellers' Representative disputes. Any amounts set forth in the Closing
Statement not raised in a Dispute Notice received by Purchaser prior to the
expiration of such 30-day period shall be deemed to have been accepted by the
Sellers' Representative and shall become final and binding upon the parties in
accordance with this Section 2.6. During the thirty (30) day period following
delivery of the Dispute Notice, Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative
shall negotiate in good faith with a view to resolving their disagreements
over the disputed items. During such thirty (30) day period and until the
final determination of Actual Indebtedness and/or Actual Transaction Expenses
in accordance with this Section 2.6(c)(ii) or Section 2.6(c)(iii), as the case
may be (as so determined, or as determined pursuant to Section 2.6(c)(i)
above, "Final Indebtedness," and "Final Transaction Expenses," respectively),
the Sellers' Representative and its agents shall be provided with such access
to the financial books and records of the Company Group and Purchaser as it
may reasonably request to enable it to address all matters set forth in any
Dispute Notice and Purchaser and its agents shall be provided with such access
to the financial books and records of Outdoors LLC as it may reasonably
request to enable it to address all matters set forth in any Dispute Notice.
If the parties resolve their differences over the disputed items in accordance
with the foregoing procedure, Final Indebtedness and/or Final Transaction
Expenses shall be the amounts agreed upon by them. If the parties fail to
resolve their differences over the disputed items within such thirty (30) day
period, then Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall forthwith jointly
request that a nationally recognized independent public accounting firm as
shall be mutually agreed by Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative (the
"Independent Accounting Firm"), acting as an expert not an arbitrator, make a
binding determination as to the disputed items in accordance with this
Agreement.



(iii)The Independent Accounting Firm will under the terms of its engagement
have no more than thirty (30) days from the date of referral and no more than
ten (10) Business Days from the final submission of information by Purchaser
and the Sellers' Representative within which to render its written decision
with respect to the disputed items (and only with respect to any unresolved
disputed items set forth in the Dispute Notice) and the final calculation of
Actual Indebtedness and/or Actual Transaction Expenses shall be based solely
on the resolution of such disputed items. The Independent Accounting Firm
shall review such submissions and base its determination solely on such
submissions. In resolving any disputed item, the Independent Accounting Firm
may not assign 

a value to any item greater than the maximum value, or less than the minimum
value, for such item claimed by the Sellers' Representative in the Dispute
Notice or by Purchaser in the Closing Statement. The decision of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be deemed final and binding upon the parties
(in the absence of manifest error or fraud) and enforceable by any court of
competent jurisdiction and the Independent Accounting Firm's final calculation
of Actual Indebtedness shall be deemed the "Final Indebtedness," and/or the
Independent Accounting Firm's final calculation of Actual Transaction Expenses
shall be deemed the "Final Transaction Expenses." The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be paid 50% by the Sellers' Representative
(on behalf of the Sellers) and 50% by Purchaser.



(d) Payment following Calculation of Final Indebtedness and Final Transaction
Expenses.



(i) Following the determination of the Final Indebtedness and the Final
Transaction Expenses pursuant to Section 2.6(c), the Initial Cash Purchase
Price and the corresponding Initial Purchase Price shall be recalculated by
substituting the Final Indebtedness for the Estimated Indebtedness in Section
2.6(a) and the Final Transaction Expenses for the Estimated Transaction
Expenses in Section 2.6(a) in the definition of "Initial Purchase Price" (the
"Adjusted Purchase Price") and if (A) the Adjusted Purchase Price is greater
than the Initial Purchase Price on the Closing Date, then Purchaser shall pay
to the Sellers' Representative (for the benefit of the Sellers pursuant to the
Distribution Waterfall) the amount of such difference by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within five (5) Business Days after such
determination; (B) the Initial Purchase Price on the Closing Date is greater
than the Adjusted Purchase Price, then within five (5) Business Days after
such determination (1) such difference shall be paid by the Sellers, severally
and not jointly (pro rata in accordance with their respective portion of the
Adjusted Purchase Price), to Purchaser; and (C) the Initial Purchase Price on
the Closing Date is equal to the Adjusted Purchase Price, there shall be no
payment or adjustment. For the avoidance of doubt, only the Initial Cash
Purchase Price portion of the Initial Purchase Price, and not the Stock
Consideration portion of the Initial Purchase Price, shall be subject to
adjustment pursuant to this Section 2.6.



(ii) All payments pursuant to this Section 2.6(d) shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in advance by
the Sellers' Representative or Purchaser, as applicable, and shall be made on
or prior to the fifth (5th) Business Day following: (A) the thirty (30) day
period following Purchaser's delivery of the calculation of the Actual
Indebtedness and Actual Transaction Expenses pursuant to Section 2.6(b) if the
Sellers' Representative does not timely dispute either of such amounts
pursuant to Section 2.6(c)(i); (B) the date of the Sellers' Representative's
and Purchaser's mutual determination of Final Indebtedness and Final
Transaction Expenses in the event the Sellers' Representative timely disputes
either of such amounts pursuant to Section 2.6(c)(i) and the Sellers'
Representative's and Purchaser's differences are resolved without the
engagement of an Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to Section 2.6(c)(ii);
or (C) the date of the Independent Accounting Firm's determination of Final
Indebtedness and/or Final Transaction Expenses pursuant to Section 2.6(c)(iii)
in the event the Sellers' Representative timely disputes either of such
amounts pursuant to Section 2.6(c)(i) and the Sellers' Representative and
Purchaser are unable to resolve their differences pursuant to Section
2.6(c)(ii).



2.7.Purchase Price Allocation. Within ninety (90) days of the determination of
the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.6(d), the Sellers'
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) shall provide Purchaser with an
allocation of the Adjusted Purchase Price (and other amounts treated as
consideration for U.S. federal income tax purposes) to the assets deemed sold
for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to this Agreement in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the Code (the "Sellers' Draft Allocation"). 

If Purchaser disagrees with the Sellers' Draft Allocation, Purchaser may,
within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Sellers' Draft Allocation,
deliver a notice (the "Purchaser's Allocation Notice") to the Sellers'
Representative to such effect, specifying those items as to which Purchaser
disagrees and setting forth Purchaser's proposed allocation of the Adjusted
Purchase Price (and other relevant amounts). During the thirty (30) day period
following delivery of the Purchaser's Allocation Notice, Purchaser and the
Sellers' Representative shall negotiate in good faith with a view to resolving
their disagreements over the disputed items. If the Sellers' Representative
and Purchaser are unable to reach such agreement the Sellers' Representative
and Purchaser shall submit all matters that remain in dispute with respect to
the Purchaser's Allocation Notice to the Independent Accounting Firm.
Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall instruct the Independent
Accounting Firm to make a determination within thirty (30) days, based solely
on the written submissions of Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers'
Representative, on the other hand, of the appropriate amount of each item in
the Sellers' Draft Allocation which remains in dispute. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall adjust the Sellers' Draft Allocation based on these
determinations. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be
performed by the Independent Accounting firm pursuant to this Section 2.7
shall be paid 50% by Purchaser and 50% by the Sellers' Representative. The
Sellers' Draft Allocation, as prepared by the Sellers' Representative if no
Purchaser's Allocation Notice has been given, as agreed upon by the Sellers'
Representative and Purchaser or as adjusted by the Independent Accounting
Firm, in each case, in accordance with this Section 2.7 (the "Purchase Price
Allocation"), shall be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto, and
Purchaser, the Company Group, and Sellers shall file all Tax Returns
(including amended Tax Returns and claims for Tax refunds) and information
reports in a manner consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation.



2.8.Withholding. Each of the Sellers, the Sellers' Representative, Purchaser
and the Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be
deducted and withheld, from the amount otherwise payable to any Person
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold, or cause to be deducted and withheld, with respect to the making of
such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law;
provided, however, Purchaser shall provide the Sellers' Representative with a
written notice of Purchaser's intention to withhold at least five (5) Business
Days prior to any such withholding and each of Purchaser, the Sellers'
Representative and the applicable Sellers shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to minimize any such Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and are timely remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

written consent of the Sellers' Representative (such consent not to be

to Article 8, the Company and the Sellers will 

not, and will cause their Subsidiaries not to, and will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause their representatives not to, (a) solicit,
initiate or encourage the submission of any proposal or offer from any Person
(other than Purchaser and its representatives) relating to the acquisition of
all or a material portion of the equity interests or any material assets of
the Company Group (including any acquisition structured as a merger,
consolidation or share exchange) or (b) enter into, maintain or continue
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish or disclose to any Person
any information in connection with any acquisition of the equity interests or
any material assets of the Company Group (including any acquisition structured
as a merger, consolidation or share exchange), and the Company shall not enter
into any letter of intent or purchase agreement, merger agreement or other
similar agreement with any Person other than Purchaser with respect to the
acquisition of all or a material portion of the equity interests or any
material assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any
acquisition structured as a merger, consolidation or share exchange). Each of
the Company and the Sellers will, and will cause their Subsidiaries to, and
will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions, negotiations or
activities with any Person other than Purchaser and its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates in connection with any acquisition of the equity interests or any
material assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any
acquisition structured as a merger, consolidation or share exchange) and will
promptly request the return or destruction of any material or information
provided to any such Person prior to the date hereof and will enforce the
terms of any existing confidentiality agreements in connection therewith.



4.4Efforts. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to satisfy the conditions to Closing set forth
herein and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the
parties shall execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the
purposes of, this Agreement. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use its and their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
any consents of third parties that are necessary or advisable pursuant to any
contracts of the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as requested
by Purchaser, in each case, to the extent reasonably requested by Purchaser;
provided, that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to (and
shall not be permitted to, without Purchaser's written consent) expend money,
commence any litigation or arbitration proceeding, or offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party in connection with
obtaining any such consents. Purchaser acknowledges that the receipt of such
consents under any applicable contracts with third parties is not a condition
to the Closing.



4.5Regulatory Approval. Without limiting the generality of Section 4.4:



(a)Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) file
(x) a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as soon as reasonably practicable following
the date hereof, but no later than ten (10) Business Days after the date
hereof and (y) any other filing or notification required pursuant to any other
competition or antitrust related legal or regulatory requirements of foreign
jurisdictions, commissions or governing bodies ("Antitrust Law") with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby within ten (10) Business Days after
the date hereof, (ii) supply as promptly as practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested or required
pursuant to any Antitrust Law, including the HSR Act, and (iii) request early
termination of the initial waiting period under the HSR Act, and otherwise
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law as soon as practicable. Purchaser shall
pay all filing fees required under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law with
respect to Purchaser's acquisition of the Equity Interests and 

the Sellers' Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, shall pay all filing
fees required under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law with respect to the
Sellers' acquisition of all or any portion of the Purchaser Shares. Except as
expressly provided in this Agreement, none of the parties will take any action
the effect of which, or refrain from taking any action the effect of
refraining from which, would be reasonably expected to materially delay or
impede the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.



(b)In connection with the efforts referenced in Section 4.4 and this Section
4.5 to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act, any other Antitrust Law, or
any state law, each of the parties shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to,
use reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate with each other in connection
with any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or
other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii)
keep Purchaser and the Sellers' Representatives informed in all material
respects of any material communication received by such party from, or given
by such party to, any Governmental Authority and of any material communication
received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in
each case, regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) to
the extent permitted by law and the applicable Governmental Authority, permit
Purchaser or the Sellers' Representative, as applicable, to review any
material communication given to it by, and consult with or notify each other
in advance of any meeting or conference with, any Governmental Authority,
including in connection with any proceeding by a private party. The foregoing
obligations in this Section 4.5(b) shall be subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement and any attorney-client, work product or other privilege, and the
parties may, as each deems advisable, reasonably redact competitively
sensitive material or designate such competitively sensitive material provided
under this Section 4.5 as "outside counsel only" material.



(c)Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if any objections are
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any
Antitrust Law or if any suit is instituted or threatened by any Governmental
Authority or any private party challenging any of the transactions
contemplated hereby as violative of any Antitrust Law or if a filing pursuant
to Section 4.5(a) is reasonably likely to be rejected or conditioned by a
Governmental Authority, then each of the parties shall use reasonable best
efforts to resolve such objections or challenges as such Governmental
Authority or private party may have to such transactions, including to vacate,
lift, reverse or overturn any order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as soon as practicable and in any event on or prior to the
Outside Date. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties
shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to
eliminate as soon as practicable any concerns on the part of, or to satisfy
any conditions imposed by, any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over
the enforcement of any applicable law, including any Antitrust Law, regarding
the legality of (i) Purchaser's acquisition of all or any portion of the
Equity Interests and (ii) the Sellers' acquisition of all or any portion of
the Purchaser Shares.



(d)In addition to the agreements set forth in Sections 4.5(a)-(c), each party
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain all necessary and appropriate consents, approvals, waivers, actions,
non-actions, or other authorizations from Governmental Authorities, with
respect to any antitrust clearance under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust
Laws, as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event prior to the
Outside Date, and that any conditions set forth in or established by any such
consents, clearances, approvals, waivers, actions, or non-actions or other
authorizations from Governmental Authorities are satisfied on or prior to the
Outside Date. Notwithstanding this Section 4.5 or anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, in no event shall the parties hereto or their Subsidiaries be
obligated to (i) proffer to, or agree to, sell, divest, lease, license,
transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or hold separate and agree to sell,
divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber before or
after the Closing, 

any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or
interest therein of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries or Purchaser and
any of its Subsidiaries (or to consent to any such sale, divestiture, lease,
license, transfer, disposition or other encumbrance by the Company and any of
its Subsidiaries or Purchaser and any of its Subsidiaries of any of their
respective assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or
interest therein), (ii) agree to any material changes (including through a
licensing arrangement) or restriction on, or other impairment of Purchaser's,
the Company's or any of their respective Subsidiaries' ability to own or
operate, any such assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines,
businesses or interests therein or Purchaser's ability to vote, transfer,
receive dividends or otherwise exercise full ownership rights with respect to
the Equity Interests or (iii) agree to other structural, behavioral or conduct
relief with respect to the behavior of Purchaser or the Company or any of
their Subsidiaries (each of the actions described in the preceding clauses
(i), (ii) and (iii), a "Remedy Action"), unless such Remedy Action(s) do not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a material impact on the benefits that
Purchaser reasonably expects to derive from the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.



4.6Contact with Employees; Customers and Suppliers. Until the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its representatives and Affiliates not
to, contact or communicate with the (a) employees (other than the employees
identified on the "Key Employees Schedule"), (b) customers, known potential
customers, suppliers, distributors or licensors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, concerning the transactions contemplated hereby without the
prior written consent of the Sellers' Representative, or (c) any other Person
known to have a business relationship with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; provided, that the foregoing clauses (b) and (c) shall not
prohibit contacts in the ordinary course of business that are unrelated to the
transactions contemplated hereby.



4.7Consents. Purchaser acknowledges that certain consents to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be required from parties to contracts or
other agreements to which the Company Group is a party and that such consents
have not been obtained and may not be obtained. Purchaser agrees that, subject
to and without limiting the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement and the covenants and agreements contained in Section 4.4, the
Sellers, the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries shall not have any
liability whatsoever to Purchaser (and Purchaser shall not be entitled to
assert any claims) arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any
consents that may have been or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or because of the default,
acceleration or termination of or loss of right under any such contract or
other agreement as a result thereof.



4.8Termination of Affiliate Agreements. At or prior to the Closing, unless
otherwise directed in writing by Purchaser or expressly provided otherwise
herein, the Company and its Affiliates shall terminate, or otherwise amend to
exclude the Company and any of its Subsidiaries as a party thereto, all
agreements and transactions to which the Company Group, on the one hand, and
any Affiliate of the Company (other than the Company Group), on the other
hand, is a party, in each case, to the extent set forth on the "Terminated
Contracts Schedule".



4.9Transition Services Agreement; Cross License Agreement. The parties agree
to cooperate to negotiate reasonably and in good faith prior to the Closing to
enter into a transition services agreement and a cross-license agreement that
are customary for agreements of that nature in this type of transaction on
substantially the terms set forth on the Transition Services Agreement
Schedule (the "Transition Services Agreement" and the "Cross License
Agreement", respectively).



4.10Section 280G. Prior to the Closing Date, in accordance with the
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder, the Company Group shall have submitted to a vote of
the equity holders of the Company or its applicable Affiliates for their
approval 

of all payments or benefits that in the absence of such a vote could
reasonably be viewed as "parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section
280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder), provided that the foregoing
covenant (x) shall only apply with respect to any such payments or benefits
that have been waived by the applicable "disqualified individual" or that are
otherwise subject to such vote, it being understood that the Company Group
shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain waivers from all applicable
"disqualified individuals," and (y) shall not apply with respect to any
arrangements entered into by or at the request of Purchaser, unless Purchaser
provides all information about such arrangements that is necessary to conduct
the vote a reasonable amount of time before the vote. Copies of all materials
produced by the Company Group in connection with such vote shall be provided
to Purchaser at least five (5) Business Days in advance of such vote for
Purchaser's review and comment, which comments the Company Group shall
consider in good faith and not unreasonably omit.

service providers of the Company Group. With respect to each such Employee
Plan, to the extent applicable, correct and complete copies of the following

which are associated with such Employee Plans, and no audit or, to the
Company's Knowledge, investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, the DOL,
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any other Governmental Authority
is pending or, to the Company's Knowledge, threatened.

Employee Plans have been established, maintained, funded and administered in
all material respects in accordance with their terms and with the applicable
requirements of ERISA, the Code and other applicable laws. Within the past
three (3) years, no member of the Company Group has taken any action to take
corrective action or make a filing under any voluntary correction program of
the Internal Revenue Service, DOL or any other Governmental Authority with
respect to any Employee Plan, and, to the Company's Knowledge, there is no
plan defect that would qualify for correction under any such program. 



(d)All contributions or other payments required to be made to or by any
Employee Plan by applicable law or by any plan document or other contractual
undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance
policies funding any Company Benefit Plan, have been timely made or paid in

hereof, have been accrued on the Financial Statements to the extent required
under GAAP.

opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service that such Employee Plan is so
qualified and, to the Company's Knowledge, nothing has occurred since the date
of such determination that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
the qualification of such Employee Plan. No trust funding any Employee Plan is
intended to meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control, within the meaning

with Section 409A of the Code.



(i)Except as expressly provided for under this Agreement, the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in
combination with another event, (i) result in or trigger the payment of any
compensation or benefits, accelerate the time of the payment or vesting of any
compensation or benefits, increase the amount of any compensation or benefits
or trigger any funding of compensation or benefits, in each case, to any
employee or other service provider or under any Employee Plan, (ii) result in
any limitation on the right, if any, of any member of the Company Group or any
other party to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from
any Employee Plan or related trust or (iii) result in any payment (whether in
cash or property or the vesting of property) to any "disqualified individual"
(as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) that would,
individually or in combination with any other such payment, constitute an
"excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). No
Employee Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under
Section 4999 of the Code, Section 409A of the Code or otherwise.

United States (i) if required to be registered has been registered, and if

available. Such Seller acknowledges that if an exemption from registration or
qualification is available, it may be conditioned on various requirements
including, but not limited to, the time and manner of sale, the holding period
for the Purchaser Shares, and on requirements relating to Purchaser which are
outside of such Seller's control, which Purchaser is under no obligation and
may not be able to satisfy.

regulations promulgated thereunder and in accordance with the restrictions set
forth in this Agreement and, if applicable, the Stockholders Agreement.

EFFECT UNDER SUCH ACT AND APPLICABLE STATE AND FOREIGN SECURITIES LAWS OR
PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT AND SUCH LAWS.

transfer set forth in a stock purchase and merger agreement, DATED AS OF
AUGUST 2, 2017, BY AND AMONG THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OTHER PARTIES THERETO (A
COPY OF WHICH IS ON FILE WITH THE SECRETARY OF THE COMPANY)."

if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then
on the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order 

to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. None of Purchaser's Subsidiaries are required
to file any forms or reports with the SEC.

registration statement (as defined in Rule 405 promulgated under the 1933 Act)
on Form S-3 under the 1933 Act. None of the information in the Registration
Statement shall, at the time the Registration Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto is filed with the SEC or at the time it becomes effective
under the 1933 Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which

and in good standing under the laws of their respective jurisdictions of

jurisdiction in which the failure to be so qualified would have a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Subsidiaries of Purchaser has all
requisite power and authority necessary to own and operate its assets and to
carry on its businesses as presently conducted, except where the failure to
have such power and authority would not have a Purchaser Material Adverse

consistent basis and presents fairly in all material respects the financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows of Purchaser as of the dates

rules of the SEC (and except that any interim financial statements are subject
to normal year-end adjustments and reclassifications and lack footnote
disclosure and other presentation items).

controls that are sufficient to provide reasonable assurances (i) that
transactions are executed in accordance with the general or specific
authorization of management of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, (ii)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets
and (iii) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing
assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to
any differences. Purchaser, based on 

its most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, has
not identified (A) any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the
design or implementation of internal controls over financial reporting that
are reasonably likely to materially and adversely affect Purchaser's ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial information or (B) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees of

forth in this Agreement which, if continuing on the Closing Date, would result
in the conditions set forth in Section 3.2(a) or Section 3.2(b) to not be

itself and its stockholders, petition a court to award damages in connection
with any breach by the other parties of the terms or conditions set forth in

("Vista") have provided, and may continue to provide after the date hereof,
the Company and certain of the Company's and its Subsidiaries' executives and
certain other employees with access to Vista's Standard Operating Procedures
("VSOPs") (information about which the Company and its Subsidiaries may
provide to the board of managers of the Company) and certain other valuable,
confidential and proprietary information of Vista (the "Vista Confidential
Information"). Purchaser agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that
(i) the VSOPs and the other Vista Confidential Information are valuable,
confidential and proprietary information and constitute trade secrets of
Vista, and the VSOPs and the other Vista Confidential Information remain the
exclusive property of Vista, (ii) the VSOPs and the other Vista Confidential
Information must not be used or disclosed in any manner by Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates unless required by law (provided that Purchaser shall (x)
promptly notify Vista of any such required disclosure so that Vista may seek
an appropriate order or other remedy protecting the VSOPs and the other Vista
Confidential Information from disclosure and (y) use commercially reasonable
efforts, at Vista's expense, to obtain such protective order, other remedy or,
if a protective order or other remedy is not obtained, confidential treatment
for any information disclosed), (iii) the terms under which the VSOPs and the
other Vista Confidential Information were provided to the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' executives and certain other employees (the "Permitted
Recipients") do not permit access to the VSOPs or other Vista Confidential
Information by any person or entity other than such Permitted Recipients, (iv)
none of Purchaser, its Affiliates or their respective directors, managers,
officers, employees or agents shall request access to the VSOPs or other Vista
Confidential Information and (v) Purchaser and its Affiliates shall have no
rights in the VSOPs or other Vista Confidential Information.



(c)For a period of two (2) years from the Closing Date, Vista and the Sellers
shall, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause their Affiliates to,
hold in confidence any nonpublic information that is proprietary or
competitively sensitive ("Sensitive Business Information") to the extent
relating to the Company Group, the Communities Business or the Sports
Business; provided, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to
information (i) that becomes available on a non-confidential basis to Vista,
the Sellers or any of their Affiliates from and after the Closing from a third
party source that is not known by Vista, the Sellers or their applicable
Affiliate to be under any obligation of confidentiality with respect to such
information, (ii) that is in the public domain or enters into the public
domain through no fault of Vista, the Sellers or any of their Affiliates in
violation of this Agreement, (iii) that Vista, the Sellers or any of their
Affiliates are required by law to disclose (provided that Vista, the Sellers
and their Affiliates shall notify 

Purchaser of any such required disclosure and use commercially reasonable
efforts, at Purchaser's expense, to obtain confidential treatment for any
information disclosed) or (iv) that is independently developed by or on the
behalf of Vista, the Sellers or any of their Affiliates or representatives
without use of or reference to the Sensitive Business Information. Nothing in
this Agreement shall prohibit Vista, the Sellers and their Affiliates from
disclosing or providing valuable, confidential or proprietary information
(including any Sensitive Business Information), to any Person in contemplation
of a sale, joint venture, business combination, recapitalization, merger or
other similar transaction involving the Outdoors Business; provided, that such
Person shall be bound by an obligation of confidentiality owed to Vista and/or
its Affiliates substantially similar to the obligations set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement as of the date of this Agreement.



9.4Expenses. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto shall be solely responsible for and shall bear all of its own
costs and expenses incident to its obligations under and in respect of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including, but not limited
to, any such costs and expenses incurred by any party hereto in connection
with the negotiation, preparation and performance of and compliance with the
terms of this Agreement (including the fees and expenses of legal counsel,
accountants, investment bankers or other representatives and consultants,
without limiting or modifying in any respect the treatment of Transaction
Expenses under this Agreement), regardless of whether the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated.



9.5Further Assurances. Each of the parties hereto shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, execute and deliver such further instruments and take such
additional action as any other party hereto may reasonably request to effect
or consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Each such party shall, on
or prior to the Closing and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, use its reasonable best efforts to fulfill or obtain the
fulfillment of the conditions precedent to the consummation of the

documents, certificates, instruments or other papers that are reasonably
required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

stamp, registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording
charges and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest)
("Transfer Taxes") incurred in connection with consummation of the Stock

fifty percent (50%) the Sellers. The Person responsible under applicable law
for filing the Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes shall prepare
and timely file such Tax Returns when due and promptly provide a copy of such
Tax Return to Purchaser or the Sellers' Representative, as applicable. The
Sellers' Representative and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, cooperate to timely prepare and file any Tax Returns or other
filings relating to such Transfer Taxes, including any claim for exemption or
exclusion from the application or imposition of any Transfer Taxes, and shall

9.7Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance.



(a)For six (6) years from and after the Closing, each of Purchaser and Merger
Sub agree that it shall, or shall cause the Company to, indemnify and hold
harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (each, a "Company Indemnified Party") against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Closing, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Closing, to the fullest extent that the Company 

or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, would have been permitted
under applicable law and its respective articles of incorporation, bylaws or
other organizational documents in effect on the date of this Agreement to
indemnify such person (including promptly advancing expenses as incurred to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable law). In the event of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (x) each Company Indemnified
Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from Purchaser
within ten Business Days of receipt by Purchaser from the Company Indemnified
Party of a request therefor; provided, that any person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification and (y)
Purchaser shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any such matter
and no settlement shall be agreed without its prior written consent. For a
period of six (6) years after the Closing, Purchaser shall not, and shall not
permit any member of the Company Group to, amend, repeal or modify (in a
manner adverse to the beneficiary thereof) any provision in any member of the
Company Group's articles of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational
documents relating to the exculpation or indemnification rights of, or
advancement of expenses to, any officers or directors, it being the intent of
the parties hereto that the officers and directors of any member of the
Company Group on the date hereof shall continue to be entitled to such
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses to the full extent of
the law.



(b)At, prior to, or immediately following the Closing, Purchaser shall
purchase (or at the request of Purchaser, the Company shall purchase, but only
with the consent of Purchaser) for any Person who is on the date hereof or who
becomes prior to the Closing Date, an officer or director of any member of the
Company Group (each such Person, a "DandO Beneficiary") a six (6) year "tail"
officers' and directors' liability insurance coverage ("DandO Insurance") under
the Company's existing officers' and directors' liability insurance policy or
a substitute policy which shall be maintained for a period of six (6) years
after the Closing Date with coverage and amounts and containing terms not less
advantageous in any material respect to the DandO Beneficiaries than the
Company's existing officers' and directors' liability insurance policy in
effect as of the date hereof with respect to all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs and expenses (including attorney's fees and expenses),
judgments, fines, losses, and amounts paid in settlement in connection with
any actual or threatened action, suit, claim, proceeding or investigation
(each a "DandO Claim") to the extent that any such DandO Claim is based on, or
arises out of, (a) the fact that such DandO Beneficiary is or was a manager,
director or officer of any member of the Company Group at any time prior to
the Closing Date or is or was serving at the request of any member of the
Company Group as a manager, director or officer of another corporation,
limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise at any time prior to the Closing Date or (b) this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in each case to the extent
that any such DandO Claim pertains to any matter or fact arising, existing or
occurring prior to or at the Closing Date, regardless of whether such DandO
Claim is asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing Date; provided
that Purchaser and the Company shall not be required to pay for any such DandO
Insurance an aggregate amount in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the
annual premium currently paid as of the date hereof by the Company Group under
its existing officers' and directors' liability insurance policy, and if the
cost of such DandO Insurance would exceed such amount, then Purchaser shall
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for an aggregate cost not
exceeding such amount or offer to the Sellers' Representative an opportunity
to pay such excess on behalf of the DandO Beneficiaries. The provisions of this
Section 9.7 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each such DandO Beneficiary and such Peron's estate, heirs and
representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
pursuant to law, the organizational documents of any member of the Company
Group, contract or otherwise.



9.8Tax Matters.



(a)Liability for Taxes. Subject to the provisions of this Section 9.8, from
and after the Closing:



(i)(A) Sellers, severally and not jointly (pro rata in accordance with their
respective portion of the Adjusted Purchase Price), shall pay, shall be liable

for Taxes of or with respect to Sellers or for which such Sellers are or may
be liable, in each case for purposes of this Section 9.8(a)(i)(A), pursuant to
Section 9.6 (including any such Taxes incurred pursuant to any Tax allocation
or Tax sharing agreement or arrangement (except, in each case, an agreement or
arrangement entered into in the ordinary course of business and not primarily
related to Taxes), by contract, as transferee or successor or otherwise) and
(B) the Vista Blocker Sellers, severally and not jointly (pro rata in
accordance with their respective direct or indirect ownership of the Vista
Blockers), shall pay, shall be liable for and shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates for all Taxes of or with respect to any
of the Vista Blockers or for which any of the Vista Blockers is or may be
liable (including pursuant to any Tax allocation or Tax sharing agreement or

the ordinary course of business and not primarily related to Taxes), by
contract, as transferee or successor or otherwise) for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period (such Taxes described in clauses (A) and (B), the "Seller Indemnified
Taxes"); provided, that any indemnification obligation pursuant to this
Section 9.8(a)(i) shall exclude (1) any Taxes that would not have arisen but
for a breach after the Closing by Purchaser, the Vista Blockers or the Company
Group of any covenant set forth in this Section 9.8, (2) any Taxes arising
from transactions or actions taken by Purchaser, the Vista Blockers, the
Company Group or any of their Affiliates on the Closing Date after the Closing
that are outside the ordinary course of business or otherwise properly treated
as occurring on the day after the Closing Date pursuant to Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) (or any similar provision of state,
local or foreign law), (3) any sales or use, payroll or other withholding
Taxes but only to the extent that (x) any Vista Blocker or any of its
Subsidiaries has collected or withheld such Taxes on or before the Closing
Date, and (y) the proceeds of which are held by any Vista Blocker or any of
its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date and (4) any Taxes taken into account in
calculating the Adjusted Purchase Price; provided, further, that any
indemnification pursuant to this Section 9.8(a)(i) shall be limited to Taxes
incurred with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods; provided, further, that (x)
with respect to any indemnity claim pursuant to Section 9.8(a)(i)(B), each
Vista Blocker Seller shall only be liable for and required to indemnify
Purchaser and its Affiliates for Taxes incurred by and attributable to the
Vista Blocker that, after the Pre-Closing Reorganization and immediately prior
to the Stock Purchase, is owned directly or indirectly by such Vista Blocker
Seller and (y) the aggregate maximum responsibility and liability of each
Seller arising from an indemnification obligation pursuant to this Agreement
shall not exceed the portion of the Blocker Corporation Cash Payment or the
portion of the Initial Cash Purchase Price, as the case may be, in each case,
as adjusted and recalculated in accordance with Section 2.6, actually received
by such Seller pursuant to this Agreement.



(ii)Purchaser shall pay, shall be liable for and shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Sellers for Taxes of or with respect to Purchaser or for
which Purchaser is or may be liable (including pursuant to any Tax allocation
or Tax sharing agreement or arrangement (except, in each case, an agreement or
arrangement entered into in the ordinary course of business and not primarily
related to Taxes), by contract, as transferee or successor or otherwise) (A)
of the Vista Blockers and the Company Group for any Post-Closing Tax Period or
(B) for which Purchaser is responsible pursuant to Section 9.6, provided that
the aggregate maximum responsibility and liability of the Purchaser arising
from an indemnification obligation pursuant to this Section 9.8(a)(ii) shall
not 

exceed the Initial Cash Purchase Price as adjusted and recalculated in
accordance with Section 2.6.



(iii)In the case of any Straddle Period, (A) real, personal and intangible
property Taxes ("Property Taxes") for the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be equal
to the amount of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during such period
that are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the entire period and (B) Taxes (other than Property Taxes)
will be computed as if such period ended on the Closing Date.



(iv)Any amounts payable by the Sellers to the Purchaser and its Affiliates
with respect to any Seller Indemnified Taxes pursuant to Section 9.8(a)(i)
shall be reduced to take account of any net Tax benefit actually received in
cash or in a reduction of Taxes of the Purchaser or its Affiliates in the
taxable year in which such indemnification payment is made or any prior
taxable year (determined on a "with and without" basis), arising from the
incurrence or payment of any such Seller Indemnified Taxes. Any indemnity
payment required to be made pursuant to this Section 9.8 shall be made no
later than the later of (x) twenty (20) Business Days after the Tax
Indemnified Party gives notice to the Tax Indemnifying Party pursuant to
Section 9.8(d)(ii), (y) five (5) Business Days before the relevant Tax Return
on which such Tax is shown is due or (z) in the case of a Tax that is subject
to a Tax Proceeding, five (5) Business Days after such Tax Proceeding is

of settlement).



(b)Tax Returns. Except as provided in Section 9.6, Purchaser shall prepare or
cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the
Vista Blockers and Company Group which are filed after the Closing Date for
any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date and for any Straddle
Period in accordance with past practice (other than as required by applicable
Tax law). No later than forty-five (45) days prior to filing any such Tax
Return, Purchaser shall submit any such Tax Return (along with, at Sellers'
Representative's reasonable request, any supporting or underlying
documentation related thereto) to the Sellers' Representative for its review,
comment and, to the extent related to Taxes for which Sellers or their
Affiliates are liable pursuant to this Agreement or the Contribution Agreement
or otherwise, approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Purchaser shall consider in good faith any revisions
as are reasonably requested by the Sellers' Representative. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, each of the parties hereto agrees to report
any taxable gain pursuant to Section 311 the Code attributable to the
Distribution based on the valuation of the equity interests in Outdoors LLC
and/or the Outdoors Business performed by Duff and Phelps Corporation (or
another financial advisor, as determined by the Company), and each of the
parties hereto shall file all Tax Returns (including amended Tax Returns and
claims for Tax refunds) and information reports in a manner consistent
therewith, other than as required by determination by an applicable Taxing
Authority within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any
corresponding provision of state or local law).



(c)Post-Closing Tax Actions. Purchaser and its Affiliates (including after the
Closing Date, the Vista Blockers and the Company Group) shall not, with
respect to any taxable period that begins prior to the Closing Date
(regardless of whether such taxable period ends prior to the Closing Date),
(i) except as otherwise required by Section 9.8(b), file, or cause to be
filed, any restatement or amendment of, modification to, or claim for refund
relating to, any Tax Return of any Vista Blocker or member of the Company
Group, (ii) make or change any Tax election (including an election under
Section 336 or 338 of the Code) with respect to any Vista Blocker or member of
the Company Group, (iii) extend or waive any statute of limitations with
respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of any Vista Blocker or member of the Company
Group or (iv) initiate discussions or examinations with a Taxing Authority or
make any voluntary disclosures with respect to Taxes of any Vista Blocker or
member of the Company Group, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), without the
prior 

written consent of the Sellers' Representative (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and in the case of clauses
(iii) or (iv) without prior written notice to the Sellers' Representative.



(d)Cooperation; Procedures Relating to Tax Claims and Tax Indemnification.



(i)Subject to the other provisions of this Section 9.8, Purchaser and the
Sellers' Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested, in connection with (i) the filing of Tax Returns, (ii) any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes and Tax Returns and (iii)
the preparation of any financial statements to the extent related to Taxes.
Such cooperation shall include the retention, and (upon the other party's
request) the provision, of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder; provided, that
the party requesting assistance shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the party providing such assistance; provided, further,
no party shall be required to provide assistance at times or in amounts that
would interfere unreasonably with the business and operations of such party.



(ii)Purchaser or the appropriate Seller, as applicable (the "Tax Indemnified
Party"), shall give notice of any matter that such Tax Indemnified Party has
determined has given rise to a right of indemnification under this Section 9.8
to the Sellers' Representative or the Purchaser, as applicable (the "Tax
Indemnifying Party") promptly (and in any event within twenty (20) Business
days) after making such determination. Such notice shall state the amount of
the Loss claimed, if known, method of computation thereof and reference to the
provisions of this Section 9.8 in respect of which such right of
indemnification is claimed, provided, that the failure to provide such notice
shall not affect the Tax Indemnified Party's right to indemnification
hereunder, except, and only to the extent that, such Tax Indemnified Party is
actually prejudiced by such failure.

(e)Tax Proceedings.



(i)The Controlling Party shall have the right to control, and the Non-
Controlling Party shall have the right to participate in any Tax Proceeding
involving a Tax Claim. Any Person receiving notice of any Tax Claim shall
provide the Purchaser or the Sellers' Representative, as applicable, notice of
such Tax Claim within ten (10) days of its receipt of such notice, provided,
that failure to comply with this provision shall not affect Purchaser's or the
Sellers' Representative's right to indemnification hereunder, except, and only
to the extent that, any Person is actually prejudiced by such failure. The
Controlling Party shall keep the Non-Controlling Party reasonably informed of
the status of such matter (including providing the Non-Controlling Party with
copies of all written correspondence regarding such matter), and the
Controlling Party shall not settle any such proceedings without the Non-
Controlling Party's written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.



(ii)Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall
(A) Purchaser be required to provide any Person with any Tax Return or copy of
any Tax Return of an affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary, aggregate or
similar group that includes Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or (B) any
Seller be required to provide any Person with any income Tax Return or copy of
any income Tax Return of such Seller.



(iii)For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement or the Contribution Agreement to the contrary, any Tax
Proceeding in respect of the Company or its 

Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including any such Tax Proceeding
in respect of any partnership Tax Return of the Company or any of its
Affiliates) shall be governed by Section 3(d)(ii)(D) of the Contribution
Agreement.



(f)Tax Refunds. Any refunds of Taxes with respect to the Vista Blockers for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period that are received by Purchaser, the Vista Blockers
or the Company Group after the Closing Date, (any such refund, a "Pre-Closing
Tax Refund"), shall be for the account of the Sellers, and Purchaser shall pay
over to Sellers' Representative for the benefit of the Sellers any such Pre-
Closing Tax Refund within fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof. Purchaser
shall cooperate with Sellers' Representative in obtaining such Pre-Closing Tax
Refunds as promptly as possible, it being understood that, (i) the Vista
Blockers and any member of the Company Group that is taxable as a corporation
for U.S. federal income tax purposes will carryback any net operating losses
for taxable periods ending on or before or including the Closing Date to prior
taxable periods as allowable by applicable Tax law and shall claim Tax refunds
as a result of such carryback (including through the filing of amended Tax
Returns) (provided, that Purchaser shall not be required to reflect the
carryback of any such net operating losses on any consolidated or combined or
unitary Tax Return of Purchaser and its Affiliates) and (ii) any such Pre-
Closing Tax Refunds will be claimed in cash rather than as a credit against
future Tax liabilities.



(g)Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter. None of the Sellers nor Purchaser
shall take any action or cause any action to be taken with respect to the
Vista Blockers or the Company Group subsequent to the Closing that would cause
the transactions contemplated hereby to constitute part of a transaction that
is the same as, or substantially similar to, the "Intermediary Transaction Tax
Shelter" described in Internal Revenue Service Notice 2001-16, 2001-1 C.B. 730
(February 26, 2001), and Internal Revenue Service Notice 2008-111 I.R.B. 1299
(December 1, 2008).



(h)Purchase Price Adjustment. Any payments under this Agreement shall be
treated by all parties as adjustments to the Adjusted Purchase Price
(including for Tax and accounting purposes), unless otherwise required by
applicable law.



(i)Tax Matters Survival. The obligations set forth in this Section 9.8 shall
remain in effect for the period of the relevant statute of limitations
applicable to the Taxes at issue.



9.9Disputes; Arbitration Procedure.



(a)Except for any dispute, claim or controversy pursuant to Section 2.6 or
Section 2.7, each of the parties hereto agrees that it will attempt to settle
any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of this Agreement through good
faith negotiations in the spirit of mutual cooperation between senior business
executives with authority to resolve the controversy.



(b)Except for any dispute, claim or controversy pursuant to Section 2.6 or
Section 2.7, any dispute, claim or controversy that cannot be resolved by the
parties hereto through good faith negotiations within thirty (30) days of
notification to the counter-party of the commencement of the dispute
resolution procedures of this Section 9.9 will then, upon the written request
of any party hereto, be exclusively resolved by final and binding arbitration
under the Delaware Rapid Arbitration Act (the "DRAA," 10 Del. C. § 5801 et
seq.) and the Delaware Rapid Arbitration Rules promulgated thereunder by the
Supreme Court of the State of Delaware. The arbitral panel shall consist of
three (3) arbitrators. If the parties cannot mutually agree upon the
selection, the arbitrators shall be selected in accordance with the DRAA. To
the extent not governed by the DRAA, such arbitrators shall be directed by the
parties to set a schedule for determination of such dispute, claim or
controversy that is reasonable under the circumstances. Such arbitrators shall
be directed 

by the parties to determine the dispute in accordance with this Agreement and
the substantive rules of law (but not the rules of procedure or evidence) that
would be applied by a federal court required to apply the internal law (and
not the law of conflicts) of the State of Delaware. The arbitration will be
conducted in the English language in Wilmington, Delaware. Judgment upon the
award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered by any court having
jurisdiction.



(c)Nothing contained in this Section 9.9 shall prevent any party hereto from
resorting to judicial process if solely injunctive or equitable relief from a
court is necessary to prevent injury to such party or its Affiliates. The
arbitral award shall be final and non-appealable. The use of arbitration
procedures will not be construed under the doctrine of laches, waiver or
estoppel to affect adversely the rights of any party hereto to assert any
claim or defense.



9.10Sellers' Representative.

(a)The Sellers' Representative is hereby approved to serve as the
representative of the Sellers by virtue of (i) the approval of the Merger by
the holders of Units (other than the Vista Blockers) in accordance with the
Company LLC Agreement, and without further action of any such holders, (ii)
the Vista Blocker Sellers' execution and delivery of this Agreement, with
respect to the matters expressly set forth in this Agreement to be performed
by the Sellers' Representative and (iii) the execution of a Letter of
Transmittal by each Unitholder Seller. Each of the Sellers hereby irrevocably
appoints the Sellers' Representative as the agent, proxy and attorney‑in‑fact
for such Seller for all purposes of this Agreement, including full power and
authority on such Seller's behalf (a) to consummate the transactions
contemplated herein, (b) to pay expenses (whether incurred on or after the
date hereof) incurred in connection with the negotiation and performance of
this Agreement, (c) to disburse any funds received hereunder to such Seller
and each other Seller (including, for the avoidance of doubt, under Article 2
hereof), (d) to execute and deliver any certificates representing the Company
Group's equity interests and execution of such further instruments as
Purchaser or Merger Sub shall reasonably request, (e) to execute and deliver
on behalf of such Seller any amendment or waiver hereto, (f) to take all other
actions to be taken by or on behalf of such Seller in connection herewith, (g)
to negotiate, settle, compromise and otherwise handle any claims relating to
the calculation of the Merger Consideration, the Initial Purchase Price and
any other amounts payable hereunder, including any claims made by any
indemnified party pursuant this Agreement, (h) to do each and every act and
exercise any and all rights which such Seller is, or Sellers collectively are,
permitted or required to do or exercise under this Agreement and (i) except as
provided for herein, refrain from taking any action to treat similarly
situated Sellers materially and adversely differently from one another. Each
of the Sellers irrevocably and unconditionally agrees (x) with the calculation
of the Distribution Waterfall and the allocation and distribution of proceeds
pursuant thereto and (y) to reimburse the Sellers' Representative on a pro
rata basis for any fees and expenses incurred by the Sellers' Representative
in its capacity as agent, proxy or attorney in fact of the Sellers in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein. At the
Closing, Purchaser shall deliver to the Sellers' Representative an amount to
be determined by the Representative, at its reasonable discretion (upon notice
to Purchaser) (the "Sellers' Representative Expense Fund") to be held in trust
to cover and reimburse the fees and expenses incurred by the Sellers'
Representative for its obligations in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated herein. Any balance of the Sellers' Representative
Expense Fund not incurred for such purposes shall be returned to the Sellers
on a pro rata basis as soon as reasonably practicable after payment of the
Sellers' Representative the amount due to it from the Sellers' Representative
Expense Fund. The grant of authority to the Sellers' Representative by the
Sellers is and shall be coupled with an interest and irrevocable and shall
survive the Closing, and all actions taken by the Sellers' Representative
under this Agreement shall be fully binding on the Sellers. Purchaser (and
after the Closing any member of the Company Group) shall have the right to
rely upon all actions taken or omitted 

to be taken by the Sellers' Representative pursuant to this Agreement, all of
which actions or omissions shall be legally binding on the Sellers and the
Unitholders.



(b)The Sellers' Representative represents and warrants to Purchaser and Merger
Sub as follows:



(i)It is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of its jurisdiction of organization. It has all requisite power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement and perform its obligations under this
Agreement.



(ii)The execution and delivery by it of this Agreement and the performance by
it of its obligations under this Agreement do not and will not conflict with
or violate any provision of, or require the consent or approval of any Person
(except for such consents or approvals which have been obtained as of the date
hereof) under (x) applicable laws, (y) its organizational documents or (z) any
contract or agreement to which it is a party.



(iii)The execution and delivery by it of this Agreement and the performance by
it of its obligations under this Agreement have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate or other analogous action on its part. This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Sellers' Representative
and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Sellers'
Representative and, assuming the due execution and delivery of this Agreement
by the other parties hereto, enforceable against the Sellers' Representative
in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
laws affecting the enforcement of creditor's rights generally and as limited
by the availability of specific performance and other equitable remedies or
applicable equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding at law or
in equity).



9.11Disclosure Schedules. Each disclosure schedule delivered pursuant to this
Agreement (each a "Schedule", and collectively, the "Schedules") shall be in
writing and shall qualify this Agreement as provided herein. The Schedules are
not intended to constitute, and shall not be construed as constituting,
representations or warranties of the Company or Purchaser except to the extent
expressly provided in this Agreement and shall not be deemed to expand in any
way the scope or effect of any of such representations or warranties. Certain
information set forth in the Schedules is included solely for information
purposes and may not be required to be disclosed pursuant to this Agreement.
The inclusion of an item in a Schedule as an exception to a representation or
warranty shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment that such
information is required to be disclosed in connection with the representations
or warranties of the Company or Purchaser nor shall such information
constitute an admission by any party hereto, as applicable, that such item
constitutes an item, event, circumstance or occurrence that is material to the
Company Group or Purchaser or constitutes a Material Adverse Effect or
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. Any fact or item that is disclosed in any
Schedule in a way as to make its relevance or applicability to information
called for by any other Schedule reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure shall be deemed to be disclosed in such other Schedule,
notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross-reference thereto.
Disclosure of any allegations with respect to any alleged breach, violation or
default under any contractual or other obligation, or any law, is not an
admission that such breach, violation or default has occurred. Headings and
subheadings have been inserted on certain Schedules for convenience of
reference only and shall not be considered a part of or affect the
construction or interpretation of such Schedules. Where the terms of a
contract or other item have been summarized or described in the Schedules,
such summary or description does not purport to be a complete statement of the
material terms of such contract or other item, and, all such summaries and
descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the contract or
item being summarized and/or described. The information provided in the
Schedules is being provided solely for the purpose of making 

disclosures to Purchaser and the Company under this Agreement. In disclosing
this information, none of the Company, Purchaser or Merger Sub waives, and
each expressly reserves any rights under, any attorney-client privilege
associated with such information or any protection afforded by the work-
product doctrine with respect to any of the matters disclosed or discussed
therein.



9.12Non-Solicit. For a period of two (2) years from and after the Closing, the
Sellers shall not, and shall cause their portfolio companies (including
Outdoors LLC and its Subsidiaries, but other than any portfolio companies of
the Sellers who have not been involved with the Businesses or any Sellers'
investment in the Company or had access to any non-public information relating
to the Businesses; provided, that the possession or knowledge of any such non-
public information relating to the Businesses by any directors, officers,
employees, or consultants who serve on a portfolio company's board or
governing body or is otherwise affiliated with or employed by such portfolio
company (such person, an "Investment Professional") shall not, solely for that
reason, be deemed imputed to such portfolio company so long as any such
Investment Professional does not directly or indirectly (through an
intermediary) furnish or provide access to any such non-public information
relating to the Businesses to the other directors, officers, employees, or
consultants (other than another Investment Professional) of such portfolio
company; further, provided, that any Vista portfolio company "best practices"
information and aggregate portfolio company data that does not include
individual employee data shall not constitute non-public information relating
to the Businesses) not to, without the prior written consent of Purchaser,
directly or indirectly by directing another Person, hire or solicit for
employment (whether as an officer, employee or consultant or other independent
contractor) any individual with a base salary of at least $50,000 who is an
employee of the Company Group as of immediately following the Closing;
provided, however, that the restrictions of this Section 9.12 shall not
prohibit (i) solicitation of any person through any general advertisement, or
any search firm engagement which, in any such case, is not directed or
targeted at any such employee or (ii) solicitation of or hiring any individual
whose employment was terminated by the Company Group after the Closing and at
least three (3) months prior to the commencement of employment discussions
with such individual.



9.13Seller Guaranties. With respect to each Seller Guaranty (as defined
below), Purchaser shall use, and from and after the Closing shall cause the
Company Group to use, commercially reasonable efforts to arrange as soon as
reasonably practicable, and subject to and effective as of the Effective Time,
for the release of the Sellers and their Affiliates (including the Outdoors
Business, but other than the Company Group) from their respective obligations
to the beneficiary of such Seller Guaranty, provided that, if Purchaser is
unable to obtain such release, Purchaser shall indemnify the Seller Parties
with respect to such Seller Guaranty from and after Closing. "Seller Guaranty"
means any guaranty issued by a Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the
Outdoors Business, but other than the Company Group) or on any of their behalf
and any keepwell, net worth maintenance agreement, letter of credit,
reimbursement obligation or letter of comfort imposing any obligations on any
Seller or its Affiliates in connection with the Communities Business or the
Sports Business that is set forth on the Seller Guaranty Schedule.



9.14NYSE Listing. Promptly following the issuance of the Stock Consideration,
Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Purchaser Shares to
be listed on the NYSE.



9.15Registration of Purchaser Common Stock.



(a)Promptly following the Closing, with respect to the MIU Holder Purchaser
Shares, prior to the Initial Lock-Up Date, with respect to the Initial Lock-Up
Shares, and prior to the Subsequent Lock-Up Date, with respect to the
Subsequent Lock-Up Shares, Purchaser shall (i) use reasonable best efforts to
prepare and file with the SEC, at Purchaser's sole cost and expense, a
Registration Statement on Form S-3, in the form of an automatic shelf
registration statement (the "Registration Statement") or an amendment to an 

existing shelf registration statement, relating to the resale of the
applicable Purchaser Shares and (ii) make any other filings required under any
applicable state or foreign securities laws, in either case, such that each of
the Sellers may (subject to Section 6.10 and the Stockholders Agreement as
applicable) resell any such Purchaser Shares without reliance on any exemption
from registration under the 1933 Act or any other such securities laws.
Purchaser agrees to use reasonable best efforts to keep the Registration
Statement continuously effective under the 1933 Act until the earlier of three
(3) years from the date of issuance of the Purchaser Shares or such shorter
period ending when all Purchaser Common Stock covered by the Registration
Statement has been sold in the manner set forth and as contemplated in the
Registration Statement (such period, the "Registration Period"). Purchaser
agrees to use reasonable best efforts to remain a WKSI (and not become an
"ineligible issuer" (as defined in Rule 405)) during the Registration Period.
If for any reason Purchaser ceases to be a WKSI or becomes ineligible to
utilize Form S-3, Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly
prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement or registration
statements on such form that is available for the resale of the Purchaser
Shares.



(b)Purchaser shall be responsible for all expenses relating to Purchaser's
compliance with this Section 9.15, including all registration and filing fees,
printing expenses, fees and disbursements of independent public accountants
for Purchaser, and fees of transfer agents and registrars. Sellers shall be
responsible for any fees of their counsel.



(c)Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold harmless: (A) the Sellers, (B) each
of their directors, managers, officers, employees, agents, partners and
Affiliates and (C) each person who controls the Sellers within the meaning of
either the 1933 Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"1934 Act"), from and against any and all losses, claims, damages or
liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject
under the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or other law ("Losses"), insofar as Losses
(or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the
Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in
any preliminary prospectus or prospectus contained therein, or in any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to the
extent that the untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or
omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
furnished to Purchaser by or on behalf of Sellers specifically for inclusion
therein.



(d)Each of the Sellers agrees to indemnify and hold harmless: (A) Purchaser,
(B) each of its managers, directors and officers and (C) each person who
controls Purchaser within the meaning of either the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act
from and against any and all Losses, insofar as Losses (or actions in respect
thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as
originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in any preliminary prospectus
or prospectus contained therein, or in any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to
state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that the
untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission was made
in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to
Purchaser by or on behalf of such Seller specifically for inclusion therein.



(e)If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9.15 is unavailable to
or is insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under the provisions
above in respect to any Losses referred to therein, then each indemnifying
party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party
as a result of such Losses (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
the relative fault of Purchaser on the 

one hand and the sellers of Purchaser Shares and any other sellers
participating in the registration statement on the other hand or (ii) if the
allocation provided by clause (i) of this Section 9.15(e) is not permitted by
applicable law, then in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only
the relative fault referred to in clause (i) of this Section 9.15(e) but also
the relative benefit of Purchaser on the one hand and of the sellers of
Purchaser Shares and any other sellers participating in the registration
statement on the other in connection with the statement or omissions which
resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative benefits received by Purchaser on the one hand
and the sellers of Purchaser Shares and any other sellers participating in the
registration statement on the other shall be deemed to be in the same
proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting
expenses) to Purchaser bear to the total net proceeds from the offering
(before deducting expenses) to the sellers of Purchaser Shares and any other
sellers participating in the registration statement. The relative fault of
Purchaser on the one hand and of the sellers of Purchaser Shares and any other
sellers participating in the registration statement on the other shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement
or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied
by Purchaser or by the sellers of Purchaser Shares or other sellers
participating in the registration statement and the parties' relative intent,
knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such
statement or omission.



(f)The Company and the sellers of Purchaser Shares agree that it would not be
just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9.15 were
determined by pro rata allocation (even if the sellers of Purchaser Shares
were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of
allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations
referred to in Section 9.15(e). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified
party as a result of the Losses referred to in Section 9.15(e) shall be deemed
to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this Section 9.15, no seller of Purchaser Shares shall be
required to contribute pursuant to this Section 9.15 any amount in excess of
the sum of (i) any amounts paid pursuant to Section 9.15(d) and (ii) the net
proceeds received by such Seller from the sale of Purchaser Shares covered by
the registration statement filed pursuant hereto. No Person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933
Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of
such fraudulent misrepresentation.



9.16Certificate Legend Removal. Pursuant to Purchaser's receipt of an opinion
of counsel reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser that registration under the
1933 Act is not required, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to
remove, or cause its registrar and transfer agent to remove, the legend set
forth in Section 6.10(b) hereof from the certificates evidencing the Purchaser
Shares issued as Stock Consideration, following a Seller's written request to
have such legend removed, subject to the terms of the Stockholders Agreement
to the extent applicable.



9.17Lockup. Without limiting the Stockholders Agreement and except as provided
in clauses (a) through (d) below, without the prior written consent of
Purchaser, each Seller party hereto and each MIU Holder (other than any MIU
Holder receiving the MIU Holder Purchaser Shares) covenants and agrees, until
(i) December 31, 2017 (such date, the "Initial Lock-Up Date") with respect to
16.7% of the Purchaser Shares received by such Seller (the "Initial Lock-Up
Shares") and (ii) December 31, 2018 (such date, the "Subsequent Lock-Up Date"
and, together with the Initial Lock-Up Date, the "Lock-Up Dates") with respect
to the remaining 83.3% of the Purchaser Shares received by such Seller (the
"Subsequent Lock-Up Shares"), not to offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge,
assign, transfer or otherwise create any interest in or otherwise dispose of
(or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or would reasonably be
expected to, result in any of the foregoing) any of the Purchaser Shares
acquired by such Seller pursuant to this Agreement. The foregoing restriction
shall not apply to transfers of Purchaser Shares: 



(a)if the Seller is a natural person, by will, by intestate succession or
pursuant to a so-called "living trust" or other revocable trust established to
provide for the disposition of property on the undersigned's death, in each
case to any member of the immediate family (as defined below) of the Seller or
to a trust the beneficiaries of which are exclusively the Seller or members of
the Seller's immediate family;



(b)if the Seller is a natural person, as a bona fide gift or gifts, including
a bona fide gift or gifts to a charity or educational institution;



(c)if the Seller is a natural person, a partnership or a limited liability
company, to a partner or member, as the case may be, of such partnership or
limited liability company or any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Seller or to
an Affiliate under common control with the Seller, by operation of law, such
as pursuant to a qualified domestic order or in connection with a divorce
settlement; provided, in each case that such transferee agrees in writing to
abide by the provisions of this Section 9.17; and



(d)pursuant to a bona fide third party tender offer made to all holders of the
Purchaser Common Stock or a merger, purchase, consolidation or other similar
transaction, involving a change of control of Purchaser, that has been
approved by the board of directors of Purchaser (and nothing in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Seller from voting in favor of any such transaction or
taking any other action in connection with such transaction).



9.18Company Unitholder Approval. Within one (1) Business Day following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company will deliver to
Purchaser the Written Consent. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company
shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof a written consent evidencing approval of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by all of the
Unitholders entitled to vote with respect thereto and (ii) request the MIU
Holders to deliver all of the items required to be delivered by such Persons
as specified in Section 2.3(b).



9.19Change of Method. To the extent reasonably requested by the Sellers'
Representative or Purchaser, each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with
respect to and consider in good faith any proposed changes to the method of
effecting the Merger, the Stock Purchase and the Pre-Closing Reorganization as
contemplated by this Agreement, including adding one or more parties as
Sellers hereunder and any assignments reasonably necessary in connection
therewith; provided, however, that no such change shall (i) alter or change
the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration, the Initial Purchase Price or
any other consideration provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect,
or be reasonably likely to adversely affect, the other party hereto, including
the tax treatment of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with
respect to such other party or any liability for taxes, or otherwise cause
such other party to incur any liability which it would not have otherwise
incurred prior to such change, or (iii) be reasonably likely to cause the
Closing to be prevented or delayed, provided, in each case, that any such
determination shall be made in good faith.

respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any
rights, benefits or obligations set forth herein may be assigned by any of the
parties hereto without the prior written consent of Purchaser and the Sellers'
Representative and any attempted assignment without such prior written consent
shall be void.



10.4Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,
but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid
under applicable law, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent of
such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such
provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.



10.5No Strict Construction. The language used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual
intent, and no rule of strict construction will be applied against any Person.
The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "herewith" and words of similar import
shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement, and article,
section, paragraph and schedule references are to the articles, sections,
paragraphs and schedules of this Agreement unless otherwise specified. The
words describing the singular number shall include the plural and vice versa,
words denoting either gender shall include both genders and words denoting
natural persons shall include all persons and vice versa. The phrases "the
date of this Agreement," "the date hereof," "of even date herewith" and terms
of similar import shall be deemed to refer to the date set forth in the
preamble to this Agreement. The word "including" or any variation thereof
means "including, without limitation" and shall not be construed to limit any
general statement that it follows to the specific or similar items or matters
immediately following it. The term "or" shall be deemed to mean "and/or". Any
reference to any particular Code section or any other law will be interpreted
to include any revision of or successor to that section regardless of how it
is numbered or classified and any reference herein to a Governmental Authority
shall be deemed to include reference to any successor thereto. Unless the
context of this Agreement otherwise requires, references to agreements and
other documents shall be deemed to include all subsequent amendments and other
modifications thereto (provided, that for purposes of the Schedules, such
references shall only include such amendments and modifications to the extent
explicitly set forth in the Schedules previously provided to the applicable
party). Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires, references to
statutes shall include all regulations promulgated thereunder. Whenever this
Agreement refers to a number of days, such number shall refer to calendar days
unless Business Days are specified. Whenever this Agreement requires that a
document or item be "made available" or "provided" to any party hereto as of
or prior to the date hereof, it shall mean that such document or item has been
provided to such party or its representatives, made available to such party or
its representatives in the electronic data room maintained in connection with
this Agreement, or in the case of Purchaser included in the Purchaser SEC
Reports, in each case at least one (1) day prior to the date of this
Agreement. Whenever this Agreement requires that any action be taken or any
consent be given in "writing", email shall be sufficient and shall be
considered a writing.



10.6Captions. The captions used in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only, do not constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not be
deemed to limit, characterize or in any way affect 

any provision of this Agreement, and all provisions of this Agreement shall be
enforced and construed as if no caption had been used in this Agreement.



10.7No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in
this Agreement (including as set forth in Section 9.7 above), nothing herein
expressed or implied is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give
to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted
successors and assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this
Agreement, such third parties specifically including employees or creditors of
the Company and its Subsidiaries.



10.8Complete Agreement. This Agreement, including the Schedules, and the
exhibits hereto, together with the other documents and instruments referred to
herein, including the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof.



10.9Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
any one of which may be by facsimile, and all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same instrument.



10.10Governing Law and Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of Delaware,
without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or
rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware. Except as to matters subject to arbitration (other than enforcement
of awards therefrom or enforcement of any party's agreement to arbitrate) as
described in Section 9.9, to the extent permitted by law, each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, only if such court declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any United States federal court sitting
in Wilmington, Delaware or, only if such Court of Chancery and such United
States federal courts decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any other state court sitting in the State of Delaware, over any suit, action
or other proceeding brought by any party arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably agrees that all
claims with respect to any such suit, action or other proceeding shall be
heard and determined in such courts.

10.11Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.



10.12Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed by any party hereto, as applicable, in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached by any party hereto, as applicable.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions, without any requirement to post or provide any bond or other
security in connection therewith, to prevent breaches of this Agreement by any
party, as applicable, and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
hereof against such party, as applicable, in any court having jurisdiction,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which the parties hereto are
entitled at law or in equity.



10.13Attorney-Client Privilege and Conflict Waiver.



(a)Kirkland and Ellis LLP has represented the Company, its Subsidiaries, certain
of the Sellers and the Sellers' Representative. All of the parties recognize
and agree the commonality of interest that exists and will continue to exist
until Closing, and the parties agree that such commonality of interest should
continue to be recognized after the Closing and such parties recognize and
agree that the certain communications between or among Kirkland and Ellis LLP,
the Company, its Subsidiaries, certain of the Sellers and the Sellers'
Representative are protected under certain privileges and doctrines, including
the attorney-client privilege and the common interest doctrine. Specifically,
the parties agree that (a) neither Purchaser nor Merger Sub shall, or shall
cause the Company Group to, seek to have Kirkland and Ellis LLP disqualified
from representing the Sellers' Representative, the Sellers and their
respective Affiliates, and each of the foregoing's respective officers,
directors, managers, employees, shareholders, equityholders, agents and
representatives (collectively, the "Seller Parties") in connection with any
dispute that may arise between the Sellers' Representative, the Seller Parties
or their respective Affiliates and Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Company in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
the Company expressly waives any claim that Kirkland and Ellis LLP has a
conflict of interest that would preclude it from engaging in such a
representation and (b) in connection with any such dispute that may arise
between the Sellers' Representative, the Seller Parties or their respective
Affiliates and Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Company, the Sellers'
Representative, the Seller Parties or their respective Affiliates involved in
such dispute (and not Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Company) will have the
right to decide whether or not to waive the attorney-client privilege that may
apply to any communications between the Company, any of its Subsidiaries and
Kirkland and Ellis LLP that occurred before the Closing in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.



(b)Purchaser further agrees, on behalf of itself, Merger Sub and, after the
Closing, on behalf of the Company, that all communications in any form or
format whatsoever between or among any of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, the Sellers'
Representative, the Seller Parties or their respective Affiliates that relate
in any way to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any dispute arising under this
Agreement (collectively, the "Deal Communications") shall be deemed to be
retained and owned collectively by the Sellers, shall be controlled by the
Sellers' Representative on behalf of the Sellers and shall not pass to or be
claimed by Purchaser or the Company. All Deal Communications that are
attorney-client privileged (the "Privileged Deal Communications") shall remain
privileged after the Closing and the privilege and the expectation of client
confidence relating thereto shall belong solely to the Sellers' Representative
and the Sellers, shall be controlled by the Sellers' Representative on behalf
of the Sellers and shall not pass to or be claimed by Purchaser or the
Company.



(c)Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Purchaser or the Company, on the one hand, and a third party other than the
Sellers' Representative or any Sellers, on the other hand, Purchaser or the
Company may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent the disclosure of
the Privileged Deal Communications to such third party and if requested by
Purchaser, the Sellers and Sellers' Representative shall assert such
privilege; provided, however, that none of Purchaser or the Company may waive
such privilege without the prior written consent of the Sellers'
Representative. In the event that Purchaser or the Company is legally required
by governmental order or otherwise to access or obtain a copy of all or a
portion of the Deal Communications, Purchaser shall immediately (and, in any
event, within two (2) Business Days) notify the Sellers' Representative in
writing (including by making specific reference to this Section) so that the
Sellers' Representative can seek (at its expense) a protective order and
Purchaser agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to assist
therewith. 74
