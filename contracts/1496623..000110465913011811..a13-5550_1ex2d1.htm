ARTICLE II

 



 

CONVERSION OF SHARES

 



 

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Shares_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, as of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or
any holders of the following securities, the following shall occur:

 



 

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $.001 per share (the " _Common
Stock_ "), of the Company that is held in the treasury of the Company and each
share of Common Stock owned by Parent, Sub or any other direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or the Company shall automatically be
cancelled without any conversion thereof and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares of Common Stock to be canceled in accordance
with _Section 2.1(a)_ and other than Dissenting Company Shares (as defined in
_Section 2.3_)) shall be converted into the right to receive from the
Surviving Corporation an amount in cash, without interest, equal to $16.00
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All such shares of Common Stock, when so
converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and retired and each holder of shares of outstanding Common Stock not
represented by certificates (the " _Common Book Entry Shares_ "), and each
holder of a certificate or certificates (the " _Common Stock Certificates_ ")
representing any such shares of Common Stock shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without interest, upon surrender of such Common Stock Certificate or Common
Book Entry Share in accordance with _Section 2.2_.

 



 

(c) Each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Company Shares)
shall be converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation,
an amount in cash, without interest, equal to $160.00 (the " _Preferred Share
Merger Consideration_ ") (which is the product of (i) ten, which is the number
of shares of Common Stock into which a share of Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock is convertible, and (ii) the Merger Consideration). All such shares of
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and each holder of
shares of outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, all of which are
uncertificated (the " _Preferred Book Entry Shares_ ," and together with the
Common Book Entry Shares, the " _Book Entry Shares_ "), shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Preferred
Share Merger Consideration with respect to which each share of Series A
Convertible Stock is convertible, without interest, upon surrender of such
Preferred Book Entry Share in accordance with _Section 2.2_.

 



 

(d) Each share of common stock of Sub (each a " _Sub Share_ "), issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into and become at the Effective Time one fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation,
which shares of common stock shall constitute the only outstanding common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(e) If at any time between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
the outstanding shares of Common Stock or Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different
class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares or any similar
event, the Merger Consideration and the Preferred Share Merger Consideration
shall be correspondingly adjusted to the extent appropriate to reflect such
stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination or exchange of shares or similar event.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Common Stock Certificates and Book Entry Shares_. (a)
_Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial
bank or trust

 



      
 

 



 

company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent hereunder
(the " _Paying Agent"_ ) for the payment of the Merger Consideration and the
Preferred Share Merger Consideration to be received by each holder of shares
of Common Stock and Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, as the case may be.
Parent will enter into a paying agent agreement in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) _Surviving Corporation to Provide Funds_. At or before the Closing, Parent
or Sub shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent cash in
an aggregate amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration for
all shares of Common Stock and the aggregate Preferred Share Merger
Consideration for all shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (such
amounts, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall cause the Exchange
Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of the holders of shares of Common Stock
and Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and (ii) promptly applied to making
the payments provided for in _Section 2.1_. The Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any purpose that is not provided for herein. The Paying Agent shall
invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, in
direct obligations of the United States of America, obligations for which the
full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide
for the payment of all principal and interest, commercial paper obligations
receiving the highest rating from either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then
publicly available), or a combination thereof, _provided_ _that_ , in any such
case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three months. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be kept in the
Exchange Fund until such time as Parent directs that such interest and other
income be delivered to Parent. To the extent that there are losses with
respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons
below the level required to make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration
as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion
of the Exchange Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure
that the Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to
make such payments. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds
of any interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of
such funds) that remains undistributed to the holders of shares of Common
Stock six months after the Effective Time of the Merger shall be delivered to
Parent at such time. Thereafter, holders of shares of Common Stock and Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock shall look only to Parent (subject to the terms
of this Agreement) as a general creditor for payment of the Merger
Consideration or Preferred Share Merger Consideration, as the case may be,
without interest, upon the surrender of any Common Stock Certificates or Book
Entry Shares held by them.

 



 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Common Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share, other than shares to be canceled
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Common Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares, as applicable,
shall pass, only upon actual delivery of the Common Stock Certificates or Book
Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Common Stock Certificates

 



      
 

 



 

or Book Entry Shares, as applicable, in exchange for the Merger Consideration
in the case of Common Stock Certificates and the Preferred Share Merger
Consideration in the case of Preferred Book Entry Shares. Upon surrender of a
Common Stock Certificate or Book Entry Shares (or delivery of such customary
affidavits and indemnities with respect to a lost certificate which the Paying
Agent and/or the Companys transfer agent may reasonably require) for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent,
the holder of such Common Stock Certificate or Book Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the
shares of Common Stock or Series A Convertible Preferred Stock theretofore
represented by such Common Stock Certificate or Book Entry Shares shall have
been converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ or _Section 2.1(c)_, as
applicable, and the Common Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or will
accrue on the cash payable upon the surrender of any Common Stock Certificate
or Book Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Common Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Common Stock
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Common Stock Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the
Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required
by reason of such Common Stock Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each Common Stock Certificate and Book
Entry Share (other than Common Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares
representing Dissenting Company Shares and Common Stock Certificates or Book
Entry Shares representing any shares of Common Stock to be canceled pursuant
to _Section 2.1(a)_) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash,
without interest, into which the shares of Common Stock theretofore
represented by such Common Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share shall have
been converted pursuant to _Section 2.1_. If any Common Stock Certificate or
Book Entry Share shall not have been surrendered prior to six years after the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such time on which any payment in
respect hereof would otherwise escheat or become the property of any
governmental unit or agency), the payment in respect of such Common Stock
Certificate or Book Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of the Paying Agent, Parent, the Company, Sub or the
Surviving Corporation or any party hereto shall be liable to any former
stockholder of the Company for any cash or interest delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Dissenting Company Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, if required by the DGCL but only to the extent
required thereby, shares of Common Stock or Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and which are held by holders who shall have neither voted in favor of the
Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have properly exercised
appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL (the " _Dissenting Company Shares_ ") shall not be exchangeable for the
right to receive the

 



      
 

 



 

Merger Consideration or the Preferred Share Merger Consideration, as
applicable, and holders of such shares shall be entitled to receive payment of
the appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the
provisions of such Section 262 of the DGCL unless and until such holders fail
to perfect or effectively withdraw or lose their rights to appraisal and
payment under such Section 262 of the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any
such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such right,
such Dissenting Company Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been
converted into and have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the
right to receive the Merger Consideration or the Preferred Share Merger
Consideration, as the case may be, without any interest thereon. Upon the
Companys receipt of any notice of election to dissent in accordance with the
provisions of such Section 262, the Company shall promptly provide Parent with
a copy of such notice of election to dissent and provide Parent, at Parents
expense, the opportunity to direct and control all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL so long as
Parent does not create obligations for the Company effective prior to the
Effective Time. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any such election to
dissent or offer to settle or settle any such election to dissent.

 



 

Section 2.4 _No Further Ownership Rights in the Shares_. From and after the
Effective Time, all shares of Common Stock and Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
retired, and the holders of shares of Common Stock and Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. All cash paid upon the
surrender of Common Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares in accordance with
the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the shares of Common Stock or Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock previously represented thereby.

 



 

Section 2.5 _Closing of Company Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares
of Common Stock nor Series A Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall thereafter be made. If, after
the Effective Time, Common Stock Certificates representing shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

 



 

Section 2.6 _Stock Options, Restricted Shares, Employee Stock Purchase Plan_.

 



 

(a) _Options_.

 



 

(i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions permitted
under the terms of the Company Stock Plans and the applicable agreements
pursuant to which Options were granted to provide that each outstanding option
to purchase Common Stock (an " _Option_ " and collectively the " _Options_ ")
granted under the Companys 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the " _Company Stock
Plans_ ") or a stand-alone award agreement with the Company, to the extent
outstanding at the Effective Time and vested at or prior to the Effective

 



      
 

 



 

Time (including any Options to the extent that such Options vest contingently
at the Effective Time of the Merger pursuant to the terms of the Company Stock
Plans or any other agreement) shall be cancelled, terminated and converted at
the Effective Time into the right to receive a cash payment, without interest,
equal to the Option Merger Consideration for each share of Common Stock then
subject to the vested Option. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall
take all actions necessary to provide that (A) each vested Option with an
exercise price per share that is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, and (B) each Option with a solely performance based vesting
condition which performance vesting condition has not been satisfied pursuant
to the terms of the Company Stock Plans or any other agreement at or prior to
the Effective Time (after giving effect to the Merger) shall, in each such
case, be canceled at the Effective Time without any cash payment being made in
respect thereof and the holder of such Option shall have no further rights in
respect thereof.

 



 

(ii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall take all
actions necessary to provide that each Option that is unvested and outstanding
at the Effective Time (other than an Option which is cancelled pursuant to
Section _2.6(a)(i)(B)_ above) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of such
Option, be assumed by Parent and converted into a stock option that represents
the right to acquire a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
shares of common stock of Parent, $0.10 par value (" _Parent Common Stock_ "),
equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to
such unvested Option, multiplied by (B) the Conversion Ratio (each, a "
_Converted Option_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that any fractional share
resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole
share. The exercise price of each Converted Option shall be equal to (I) the
exercise price of the unvested Option from which it was converted, _divided_
by (II) the Conversion Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Following
the Effective Time, each Converted Option shall continue to be governed by the
same material terms and conditions as were applicable immediately prior to the
Effective Time to the Option from which it was converted, including terms
contained in the Company Stock Plans and any option award agreement (including
the vesting schedule and provision regarding the acceleration of vesting to
which the holder of such award would be entitled in the event of certain
termination of employment events during the twelve-month period following the
Merger as set forth in the applicable award agreement but excluding provisions
relating to the administration of the Company Stock Plans and awards
thereunder), in all cases subject to restrictions related to the issuance of
shares under applicable Law.

 



 

(b) _Restricted Shares_.

 



 

(i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to provide that each share of restricted stock and each restricted stock unit
granted by the Company (a " _Restricted Share_ ") under the Company Stock
Plans or a stand-alone award agreement with the Company, to the extent
outstanding at the Effective Time and vested at or prior to the Effective Time
(including any Restricted Shares that vest contingently at the Effective Time
of the Merger pursuant to the terms of the Company Stock Plans or any other
agreement), shall be canceled and terminated in exchange for the right to
receive a cash payment, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the
number of shares of Common Stock subject to

 



      
 

 



 

such Restricted Share immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) the
Merger Consideration (the " _Restricted Stock Unit Merger Consideration_ ").

 



 

(ii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to provide that each Restricted Share that is unvested and outstanding at the
Effective Time and that is not terminated pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)(i)_
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action by Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or the holder of such Restricted Share, be assumed by Parent and
converted into a right to acquire a number of validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the
number of shares of Common Stock subject to such unvested Restricted Share
(each, a " _Converted Restricted Share_ "), multiplied by (B) the Conversion
Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that any fractional share resulting from such
multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share. With respect
to each Converted Restricted Share that vested under its original terms based,
in whole or in part, on the employees continued employment over a period of
time, following the Effective Time, each such Converted Restricted Share shall
continue to be governed by the same material terms and conditions as were
applicable immediately prior to the Effective Time to such Restricted Share
from which it was converted, including terms contained in the Company Stock
Plans and any award agreement (including the vesting schedule and provision
regarding the acceleration of vesting to which the holder of such award would
be entitled in the event of certain termination of employment events during
the twelve-month period following the Merger as set forth in the applicable
award agreement but excluding provisions relating to the administration of the
Company Stock Plans and awards thereunder), in all cases subject to
restrictions related to the issuance of shares under applicable Law. Except as
set forth on _Schedule 2.6(b)(ii)_ , with respect to each Converted Restricted
Share that vested under its original terms based, in whole or in part, on the
achievement of certain performance conditions, following the Effective Time,
each such Converted Restricted Share shall (i) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the original award agreement, be modified so that all performance
conditions shall lapse and such Converted Restricted Shares shall fully vest
on December 31, 2015, _provided_ that the holder of such Converted Restricted
Share remains continuously employed with Parent or one of its Subsidiaries
until such date; and (ii) except as set forth in the immediately preceding
clause (i), continue to be governed by the same material terms and conditions
as were applicable immediately prior to the Effective Time to such Restricted
Share from which it was converted, including terms contained in the Company
Stock Plans and any option award agreement (including the vesting schedule and
provision regarding the acceleration of vesting to which the holder of such
award would be entitled in the event of certain termination of employment
events during the twelve-month period following the Merger as set forth in the
applicable award agreement but excluding provisions relating to the
administration of the Company Stock Plans and awards thereunder), in all cases
subject to restrictions related to the issuance of shares under applicable
Law.

 



 

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, Parent
shall deliver to each holder of a Converted Option and holder of a Converted
Restricted Share an appropriate notice setting forth the terms of such
conversion. With respect to any Option that is an "incentive stock option"
(within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code) immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the parties hereto intend that such assumption and conversion
shall, to the

 



      
 

 



 

extent reasonably practicable, conform to the requirements of Section 424(a)
of the Code. In addition, any Option converted pursuant to _Section
2.6(a)(ii)_ and any Restricted Share converted pursuant to _Section
2.6(b)(ii)_ shall be converted in a manner that complies with Section 409A of
the Code (or an available exemption therefrom) and any guidance issued
pursuant to Section 409A of the Code by the U.S. Department of Treasury.

 



 

(d) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon the
exercise of the Converted Options and Converted Restricted Shares. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, and not more than ten business days
thereafter, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to the Converted Options and Converted Restricted Shares
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so
long as the Converted Options and Converted Restricted Shares remain
outstanding.

 



 

(e) All cash payments to holders of Options and Restricted Shares pursuant to
_Section 2.6(a)(i)_ or _Section 2.6(b)(i)_, respectively, shall be net of
any applicable federal and withholding Tax.

 



 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " _Conversion Ratio_ " means a fraction, the numerator of which shall be
the Merger Consideration and the denominator of which shall be the average
closing price for a share of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange over the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding (but not
including) the Closing Date.

 



 

(ii) " _Option Merger Consideration_ " shall mean, with respect to any share
of Common Stock issuable under a particular Option, an amount equal to the
excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price
payable in respect of each share of Common Stock issuable under such Option.

 



 

(g) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company or
the appropriate committee of the Board of Directors of the Company shall take
all reasonable actions, including adopting any necessary resolutions, to (i)
terminate the NetSpend Holdings, Inc. 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "
_ESPP_ ") as of immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) ensure that no
offering period under the ESPP shall be commenced on or after the date of this
Agreement, (iii) if the Closing shall occur prior to the end of the offering
period in existence under the ESPP on the date of this Agreement, cause a new
exercise date to be set under the ESPP, which date shall be the business day
immediately prior to the anticipated Closing Date, (iv) prohibit participants
in the ESPP from altering their payroll deductions from those in effect on the
date of this Agreement (other than to discontinue their participation in the
ESPP in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ESPP) and (v) provide
that the amount of the accumulated contributions of each participant under the
ESPP as of immediately prior to the Effective Time

 



      
 

 



 

shall, to the extent not used to purchase Common Stock in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the ESPP (as amended pursuant to this _Section
2.6(g))_, be refunded to such participant as promptly as practicable following
the Effective Time (without interest).

 



 

(h) _Option Merger Consideration and Restricted Stock Unit Merger
Consideration_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to
Parent a schedule setting forth the Option Merger Consideration to be paid to
the holders of Options pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)(i)_ and the Restricted
Stock Unit Merger Consideration to be paid to holders of Restricted Shares
pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)(i)_, and at or before the Closing, Parent shall
deposit with the Company such aggregate Option Merger Consideration and such
aggregate Restricted Stock Unit Merger Consideration. The Company shall
thereafter pay, less any applicable withholding pursuant to _Section 2.7_,
the Option Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Options pursuant
to _Section 2.6(a)(i)_ and the Restricted Stock Unit Merger Consideration to
be paid to holders of Restricted Shares pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)(i)_, as
the case may be, reasonably promptly (but in no event after the next payroll
date occurring after the date that is seven business days following the
Closing Date). The payment of the Option Merger Consideration paid with
respect to the Options in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_
shall be in full satisfaction of all rights and privileges pertaining to the
canceled Options, and on and after the Effective Time the holder of an Option
shall have no further rights with respect to any Option, other than the right
to receive the Option Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.6(a)(i)_
and the right to receive a Converted Option pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)(ii),_
as applicable. The payment of the Restricted Stock Unit Merger Consideration
paid with respect to the Restricted Shares in accordance with the terms of
this _Article II_ shall be in full satisfaction of all rights and privileges
pertaining to the canceled Restricted Shares, and on and after the Effective
Time the holder of a Restricted Share shall have no further rights with
respect to any Restricted Share, other than the right to receive the
Restricted Stock Unit Merger Consideration as provided in _Section
2.6(b)(i)_, and the right to receive a Converted Restricted Share pursuant to
_Section 2.6(b)(ii)_, as applicable.

 



 

Section 2.7 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payments under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ "), applicable Treasury Regulations, or any applicable
provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority by Parent,
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to such Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

 



 

Section 2.8 _Closing._ Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices
of King and Spalding LLP, 1185 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10036,
at 9:00 a.m. local time on the third (3rd) business day after the day on which
the last of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those
conditions that relate to action to be taken at the Closing, subject to the
satisfaction at the Closing of such conditions (or, to the extent legally
permitted, waiver by the party or parties

 



       
 

 



 

entitled to the benefit of such conditions)) is fulfilled or waived in
accordance with this Agreement, or at such other time and place as Parent and
the Company shall agree in writing; _provided_ , _that_ , notwithstanding the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ , if in accordance
with the foregoing the Closing were to occur prior to the date that is twelve
(12) business days after the later of (x) the date on which the Stockholder
Approval is obtained, (y) the date on which the Company shall have provided
all of the Required Information in accordance with _Section 6.14_ , and (z)
the date on which the condition set forth in _Section 7.1(c)_ is fulfilled or
waived (the " _Threshold Date_ "), then the Closing shall occur instead on the
date following the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions that is the
earliest to occur of (i) any business day specified by Parent to the Company
on or prior to the Threshold Date on no fewer than two (2) business days

state of facts or development (individually or in the aggregate) arising out
of or resulting from (a) a decrease in the market price or the trading volume
of shares of Common Stock, in and of itself, or any failure by the Company to
meet any published public estimates of the Companys revenue, earnings or
other financial performance or results of operations for any period, in and of
itself, or any failure by the Company to meet any internal budgets, plans or
forecasts of its revenues, earnings or other financial performance or results
of operations, in and of itself (but not, in each case, the facts or
occurrences giving rise or contributing to any such changes or failures, which
may be taken into account in determining whether there is a Material Adverse
Effect), (b) general political, tax, economic or business conditions in the
United States or any country or region in the world in which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries does business, or any changes therein, or general
financial, securities, credit or capital market conditions, including interest

Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the " _Core Business Contracts_ "), or (2)
any inaccuracy or breach of the representation set forth in _Section 3.4(b)_ ,
(g) the performance by Parent or any of its Affiliates of its or their express
obligations under this Agreement, or (h) any action or omission by the Company
taken at the express written request or with the prior written consent of
Parent, _provided_ that any event, change, circumstance, effect, occurrence,
condition, state of facts or development arising out of or resulting from the
matters described in (b) through (e) of this _Section 3.1_ shall not be
excluded to the extent that such event, change, circumstance, effect,

not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of,
or other equity interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company are duly
authorized validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive

binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting or
relating to enforcement of creditors rights generally or by general
principles of equity. The Board of Directors of the Company has (i) determined

increase in payments owed) or require the consent of any Person under, or give
rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation
or to the loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation of any
Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under, any provision of (i) the certificate of incorporation,

or (iii) any Law applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clause

liens, charges, mortgages, encumbrances and security interests (" _Liens_ ")
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have or reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, materially impair the ability of
the Company and its Subsidiaries to perform their material obligations
hereunder or prevent the consummation of any of the material transactions
contemplated hereby. No registration, declaration or filing with (each, a "
_Registration_ ") or authorization, permit, consent or approval (each, a "
_Consent_ ") of any domestic (federal or state), foreign or supranational,
court, arbitrator, commission, governmental body, regulatory or administrative
agency or tribunal (a " _Governmental Entity_ ") is required by or with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company or the consummation by
the Company of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby,
except for (A) compliance with and filings under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ "), (B)

Schedule, (E) as may be required in connection with the Taxes described in
_Section 6.10_ , and (F) such other Consents or Registrations the failure of
which to be obtained or made would not, individually or in the aggregate, have
or reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, materially impair

materially delay the consummation of any of the material transactions
contemplated hereby. _Section 3.4(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth

Money Transmitter Licenses, (II) each jurisdiction in which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries have applications pending for any Money Transmitter
Licenses, (III) to the extent the Company or any of its Subsidiaries does not

Subsidiaries or a Distributor to sell or reload Cards in such jurisdiction, a
general description of the contractual or other arrangements currently in
place upon which the Company or the relevant Subsidiary relies upon as a basis
for the sale or reload of NetSpend Cards by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or such Distributor in such jurisdiction without a Money
Transmitter License, and (IV) each jurisdiction which would require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to obtain a Money Transmitter License in
order for the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or a Distributor to sell or
reload Cards in such jurisdiction if the Company or relevant Subsidiary did
not have a contractual or other arrangement contemplated by clause (III), and
indicates whether any consent or approval from, or notice to or registration
with, any Governmental Entity is required in connection with the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
compliance with the provisions hereof will not, adversely affect, restrict or
inhibit, in each case in any material respect, the settlement of Card
transactions in the ordinary course consistent with past practice through the
Issuing Banks and Card Associations. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Cards_
" means any prepaid card, reloadable card, payroll card or similar instrument

(b) Each Material Contract, and each new Contract entered into or amended
after the date hereof that if in effect on such terms as of the date hereof
would have been a Material Contract (each, a " _New Material Contract_ "), is
a valid and binding obligation of the Company or its relevant Subsidiary party
thereto enforceable against the Company or such Subsidiary in accordance with
its terms and, to the best knowledge of the Company, each other party thereto,
and is in full force and effect. The Company or such Subsidiary has performed
all obligations required to be performed by it under each Material Contract or
New Material Contract and, to the best knowledge of the Company, each other
party to each Material Contract or New Material Contract has performed all
obligations required to be performed by it under

 



      
 

 



 

such Material Contract or New Material Contract, except in each case as,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have or reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company or its relevant Subsidiary party
thereto is not in violation of or in default of any obligation under (or is
not aware of any condition which with the passage of time or the giving of
notice would cause such a violation of or default under) any Material Contract
or New Material Contract to which it is a party or by which it or any of its
properties or assets is bound and, to its best knowledge, no other party is in
violation of, or in default of any obligation under, such Material Contracts
or New Material Contracts, in each case except for any violations or defaults
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be

3.21(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, the Company has not received any written
or, to the best knowledge of the Company, oral notice from any party to a
Material Contract or New Material Contract that such party intends to
terminate, cancel, not to renew or to otherwise modify or amend in any
material respect in a manner adverse to the Company, or to request a
modification or amendment of in any material respect in a manner adverse to
the Company (including any material reduction or change to pricing terms) any
such Material Contract or New Material Contract to which it is a party. For
the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that this _Section
3.21(b)_ shall not apply to any Core Business Contract (which shall be
governed instead by the provisions of _Section 3.21(c)_).

 



 

(c) Each Core Business Contract is a valid and binding obligation of the
Company or its relevant Subsidiary party thereto enforceable against the
Company or such Subsidiary in accordance with its terms and, to the best
knowledge of the Company, each other party thereto, and is in full force and
effect. The Company or such Subsidiary has performed in all material respects
all material obligations required to be performed by it under each Core
Business Contract and, to the best knowledge of the Company, each other party
to each Core Business Contract has performed in all material respects all
material obligations required to be performed by it under such Core Business
Contract. The Company or its relevant Subsidiary party thereto is not in
violation of or in default of any obligation under (or is not aware of any
condition which with the passage of time or the giving of notice would cause
such a violation of or default under) any Core Business Contract to which it
is a party or by which it or any of its properties or assets is bound and, to
its best knowledge, no other party is in violation of, or in default of any
obligation under, such Core Business Contracts, except in each case for such
violations or defaults that have not and would not reasonably be expected to
result, either individually or in the aggregate, in a material impairment of
the benefits to the Company and its Subsidiaries under the applicable Core
Business Contract. Except as set forth on _Section 3.21(c)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule, the Company has not received written or, to the best knowledge of
the Company, oral notice from any party to a Core Business Contract that such
party intends to terminate, cancel, not to renew, or to otherwise modify or
amend in any material respect in a manner adverse to the Company, or to
request a modification or amendment of in any material respect in a manner
adverse to the Company (including any material reduction or change to pricing
terms), any such Core Business Contract to which it is a party.

 



 

(d) The Company has delivered to Parent a true, accurate and complete copy of
the current version of the standard form Distributor Contract presently used
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the distribution
of Cards through Distributors that

 



      
 

 



 

are retailers or corporate employers. Since December 31, 2010, the Company has
conducted reasonable due diligence reviews with respect to each Person that
became a Distributor on or after such date, and each such Distributor was, at
the time the Company first entered into any Contract with such Distributor, in
material compliance with the credit review and applicable acceptance criteria
of the Company and its Subsidiaries for such type of Distributor. Since
December 31, 2010, the Company has conducted a reasonable due diligence review
with respect to each Distributor with which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has renewed a Distributor Contract on or after such date, and
each such Distributor was, at the time such Distributor Contract was renewed,
in material compliance with the applicable credit review and acceptance
criteria of the Company and its Subsidiaries for such type of Distributor.

of its Subsidiaries and a Distributor that is a retailer, corporate employee
or aggregator.

 



 

(ii) " _Distributor_ " means any Person through which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries distributes, markets, offers or makes available Cards for

Section 3.22 _Card Association Matters; Security Breaches; Outages_.

 



 

(a) Since December 31, 2010, there has been no failure by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to comply in any material respect with the applicable
bylaws, operating rules and identification standards manual of, and any other
rules, regulations, manuals, policies and procedures promulgated by, any Card
Association (including Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, Visas
Cardholder Information Security program, MasterCards Site Data Protection
program and Discover Networks Debit and Prepaid Operating Regulations), in
each case as may be in effect from time to time (collectively, " _Network
Rules_ "). Since December 31, 2010, the Company and its Subsidiaries have
properly responded in all material respects to all written notices from any
Card Association alleging any failure to comply with the rules and regulations
of the Card Associations. To the best knowledge of the Company, no Contract
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any Issuing Bank violates
in any material respect the Network Rules applicable thereto, and the
performance by the Company and its Subsidiaries of their respective
obligations thereunder, does not violate in any material respect any of the
Network Rules applicable thereto.

 



 

(b) The Company has implemented, and is in compliance in all material respects
with, technical measures and policies designed to reasonably assure the
integrity and security of transactions executed through its computer systems
and of all confidential or proprietary data under its control. Since January
1, 2010, there has been no actual breach of security of systems under the
control of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries involving the acquisition,
use, loss, destruction, compromise or disclosure of any personal information,
confidential or proprietary data or any other such information maintained or
stored by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries

 



      
 

 



 

has a duty or obligation under applicable Law, the Network Rules or any
Contract to maintain the security or confidentiality thereof, which breach,
either individually or collectively with all related breaches, has resulted
in, or is reasonably expected to result in, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses, interest, awards, judgments or penalties (collectively, " _Losses_ )
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of more than $25.6 million (a "
_Material Security Breach_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, no representation
or warranty is being made pursuant to this _Section 3.22_ regarding
information, confidential or proprietary data obtained by third parties from
cardholders that does not involve an actual breach of security or unauthorized
access to systems under the control of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 3.22(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule,
since January 1, 2010, there have been no facts or circumstances that would
require the Company to give notice to any customers or other similarly
situated individuals of any actual or perceived data security breaches
pursuant to an applicable Law requiring notice of such a breach.

 



 

(d) The Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies
of all current privacy policies that are used by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with regard to the collection and use of personally identifiable
information. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable Laws and policies of any Issuing Banks
or the Company and its Subsidiaries (including those policies referenced in
_Section 3.22(b)_) relating to data, the collection and use of data,
personally identifiable information and bulk commercial faxes and e-mail
(e.g., spam) applicable to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(e) Other than any Issuing Banks overdraft protection program and courtesy
cushion funds, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries offers or
sponsors any program or other practice providing for credit or loans or the
issuance of credit, charge or other cards that extend credit or loans to the
holders thereof.

 



 

(f) Each Company Financial Statement appropriately estimates and accounts for
and reflects the Chargebacks and Credit Losses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the date of such Company Financial Statement. The funds
held by or on behalf of Issuing Banks (including funds in transit from
Distributors) in respect of the Companys and its Subsidiaries Card programs
are sufficient to satisfy the liabilities associated with the loaded value
attributable to Cards issued in connection therewith.

 



 

(g) Each Card program sponsored by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (i)
has been approved by the Issuing Bank associated therewith and (ii) has been
approved by the applicable Card Association associated with the Cards issued
or to be issued with respect to such program, in the case of clauses (i) and
(ii), to the extent approval is required thereby.

 



 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " _Card Association_ " means MasterCard Inc., VISA Inc., their related
international entities, and any other card association, network, gateway
service or similar interchange or entity (including Pulse Network and other
debit card networks and links)

 



      
 

 



 

with whom the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Issuing Bank may have a
Contract for processing and/or facilitating switching settlement of
transaction media generated by holders of Cards or similar instruments issued
by licensees of such groups; _provided_ , that with respect to Issuing Banks,
the foregoing shall be limited to associations, networks and similar entities
with respect to which the Issuing Banks sponsors one or more Card programs on
behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(ii) " _Chargebacks_ " means the reversal of a Card transaction in accordance
with the applicable Network Rules including any fees, costs and expenses of
collection related thereto.

 



 

(iii) " _Credit Loss_ " means a loss resulting from the failure by a
Distributor to timely pay amounts owed by it under a Distributor Contract,
other than amounts owed by reason of a Chargeback, and the fees, costs and
expenses of collection related thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, a
settlement advance for which cleared funds are not received from the
applicable Card Association or other settlement system and which is not
otherwise repaid by the relevant Distributor or recoverable as a Chargeback
shall be considered a Credit Loss.

 



 

(iv) " _Issuing Bank_ " means a financial institution that sponsors the
Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries as a participant in a Card
Association or issues Cards (or maintains deposits) in connection with a
prepaid, payroll or other Card program marketed or distributed by the Company
or one or more of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 3.23 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. (a) Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this _Article III_ of this
Agreement or in any certificate to be delivered pursuant hereto, each of
Parent and Sub acknowledges that neither the Company nor any other Person on
behalf of the Company makes any other express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to the Company with respect to any other information
provided to Parent or Sub including any information, documents, projections,
forecasts or other material made available to Parent and Sub in certain "data
rooms" or "virtual data rooms", confidential information memoranda or
management presentations in expectation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



 

(b) In connection with the investigation by Parent and Sub of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, Parent and Sub have received or may receive from the Company
and/or its Subsidiaries certain projections, forward-looking statements and
other forecasts and certain business plan information. Parent and Sub
acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, that each of Parent and
Sub is familiar with such uncertainties, that each of Parent and Sub is taking
full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy
of all estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections, forecasts or plans), and that Parent and Sub shall have no claim
against anyone with respect thereto. Accordingly, each of Parent and Sub
acknowledges that the Company makes no representation or warranty with respect
to such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts or plans).

expected to prevent or delay materially the consummation of the Merger.

 



 

Section 4.2 _Sub_. Since the date of its incorporation, Sub has not carried on
any business or conducted any operations, and will not do so, other than the

other similar Laws affecting or relating to enforcement of creditors rights
generally or by general principles of equity. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the provisions hereof
will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or trigger or change any
rights or obligations (including any increase in payments owed) or require the
consent of any Person under, or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a material
benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under, any provision

in connection with the Taxes described in _Section 6.10_, and (F) such other

not, individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the ability of Parent
and Sub to perform their obligations hereunder or prevent or materially delay
the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

Section 4.4 _Proxy Statement_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent or Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement and any
amendments or supplements thereto and at the time of the Stockholder Meeting,

and the related fee letter ( _provided_ , that provisions in the fee letter

conditions therein, debt financing in the amounts set forth therein (the "
_Debt Financing_ ").

commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn or
rescinded. Assuming the Debt Financing is

 



      
 

 



 

funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter, the aggregate proceeds

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including without limitation, to
pay the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of shares of
Common Stock, the aggregate Preferred Share Merger Consideration to be paid to
the holders of shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, and the

to Parent, each of the other parties thereto. All commitments and other fees
required to be paid under the Debt Commitment Letter prior to the date hereof
have been paid in full.

 



 

Section 4.6 _Litigation_. Except for matters which would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
ability of Parent or Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, there are no civil, criminal, administrative or regulatory actions,
suits, claims, hearings, investigations or proceedings pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective officers or directors in his or her capacity as such,
nor is there any order, judgment, decree or injunction of any Governmental
Entity outstanding against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective officers or directors in his or her capacity as such which,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the ability of Parent or Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.7 _Brokers_. No broker, investment banker or other Person, other
than Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc., the fees and expenses of which will be paid
by Parent, is entitled to any brokers, finders or other similar fee or
commission in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Sub.

 



 

Section 4.8 _Ownership of Shares_. Neither Parent nor Sub is, nor at any time
during the last three (3) years has it been, an "interested stockholder" of
the Company as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL (other than as contemplated
by this Agreement). Other than pursuant to this Agreement and the Voting
Agreement, as of the date hereof, neither Parent nor Sub nor any of their
controlled Affiliates beneficially own (within the meaning of Section 13 of

representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Article III_, and
after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

Consideration and Preferred Share Merger Consideration, payment of the
aggregate consideration to be paid to holders of Options and Restricted Shares
in the Merger, any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by Parents
relevant financing commitments, payment of all related fees and expenses, and
assuming that the Company is Solvent immediately prior to the Effective Time
(without giving effect to any obligations which may be accelerated as a result
of the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby), each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent. For the
purposes of this _Section 4.9_ the term " _Solvent_ " when used with respect
to any Person, means that, as of any date of determination, (a) the amount of
the "fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such date,
exceed (i) the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including contingent
and other liabilities" as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally
determined in accordance with applicable federal Laws governing determinations
of the insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay
the probable liabilities of such Person on its existing debts (including
contingent liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured, (b) such
Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital
for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be
engaged following such date, and (c) such Person will be able to pay its
liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For
purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital
for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be
engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other
liabilities, as they mature" means that such Person will be able to generate
enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancings, or a
combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due.

 



 

Section 4.10 _No Other Representations_. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in this _Article IV_ or in any certificate delivered
pursuant hereto, the Company acknowledges that neither Parent, Sub nor any
other Person on behalf of Parent or Sub makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to Parent or Sub with respect to any
other information provided to the Company.

and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") than the current policies)
with respect to matters arising at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) in lieu of the purchase of such insurance by Parent, the
Company shall, at Parents option and expense, if reasonably available, prior
to the Effective Time, purchase a six-year extended reporting period
endorsement under its existing directors and officers liability insurance
coverage, and (ii) during this period, Parent shall not be required to procure
any coverage in excess of the amount that can be obtained for the remainder of
the period for an annual premium of 300% of the current annual premium paid by
the Company for its existing coverage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company may elect in lieu of the foregoing insurance, prior to the Effective
Time, to obtain and fully pay for a policy (providing coverage for the
Indemnified Parties and such officers) with a claims period of at least six
(6) years from the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect
to directors and officers liability insurance in an amount and scope no less
favorable than the Companys existing policies with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ that the
cost thereof does not exceed 300% of the aggregate amount per annum that the
Company and its Subsidiaries paid for such coverage in the last full fiscal
year (which amount for such full fiscal year is set forth on _Section 6.2(b)_
of the Disclosure Schedule). If such "tail" policy has been obtained by the
Company prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall maintain such policy in full force and effect for its full term and
shall continue to honor the Companys obligations thereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless, to
the fullest extent a Delaware corporation is permitted to indemnify its
directors and officers under applicable law, each Indemnified Party against
any Losses (including reasonable attorneys fees) and amounts paid in
settlement (to the extent such settlement is consented to by the Surviving
Corporation, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) in connection with
any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of,
relating to or in connection with (i) any acts or omissions occurring or
alleged to occur at or prior to the Effective Time in their capacities as
officers or directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or taken by
them at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including,
without limitation, acts or omissions in connection with such persons serving
as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any other entity (including as
trustee of any Employee Benefit Plan) if such service was at the request or
for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) or (ii) any acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the adoption and approval of this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or arising out of or pertaining to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm to
represent them with respect to each such matter described in this _Section
6.2(c)_ unless there is, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a
conflict on any significant issue between the positions of any two or more
Indemnified Parties.

 



 

(d) The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Surviving Corporation to) pay all reasonable expenses,
including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified
Party in successfully enforcing the indemnity obligations provided in _Section
6.2(c)_ to the same extent as (and subject to the requirements of) the
comparable expense reimbursement provisions of the Companys bylaws as in
effect on the date of this Agreement (or to such greater extent as any
amendment to the Companys bylaws after the Effective Time may permit).

 



 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company, any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or
otherwise. The provisions of this _Section 6.2_ shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit each of the
Indemnified Parties and the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce
the covenants contained in this _Section 6.2_.

 



 

(f) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person or entity and shall not be the continuing
or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets to any Person or
entity, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
such continuing or surviving entity or transferee, as the case may be, assumes
the obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, set
forth in this _Section 6.2_.

 



 

(g) The obligations and liability of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
under this _Section 6.2_ shall be joint and several.

the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than twenty percent (20%)
of the Common Stock and Series A Convertible Preferred Stock together on an
as-converted basis outstanding as of the consummation of such purchase or
other acquisition, or any tender offer or exchange offer by any Person or
"group" (as defined in or under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) that, if
consummated in accordance with its terms, would result in such Person or
"group" beneficially owning more than twenty percent (20%) of the Common Stock
and Series A Convertible Preferred Stock together on an as-converted basis
outstanding as of the consummation of such tender or exchange offer; (B) a
merger, consolidation, recapitalization, reorganization, reclassification,
business combination or other similar transaction involving the Company
pursuant to which the stockholders of the Company immediately preceding such
transaction hold less than eighty percent (80%) of the voting equity interests
in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction; (C) a sale,
transfer, lease, license, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or acquisition
or disposition of more than twenty percent (20%) of the consolidated net

dissolution or other winding up of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole.

 



 

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
for an Acquisition Transaction (with all references to twenty percent (20%) in
the definition of Acquisition Transaction being treated as references to fifty

the definition of Acquisition Transaction being treated as a reference to
fifty percent (50%)) made by a third party on terms that the Companys Board
of Directors shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisor), taking into account (A) any good
faith proposal by Parent to amend or modify the terms of this Agreement and
(B) all reasonably available legal, financial and regulatory aspects of such
Acquisition Proposal and the timing and likelihood of consummation of such
Acquisition Transaction, would be more favorable to the stockholders of the
Company (in their capacity as such) than the Merger.

 



 

(b) Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to, immediately
cease or cause to be terminated any and all activities, discussions or
negotiations with any Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall promptly after the date of this Agreement instruct each Person
which has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement with or for the
benefit of

 



       
 

 



 

the Company relating to an Acquisition Transaction (with all references to 20%
in the definition of Acquisition Transaction being treated as references to
fifty percent (50%) for these purposes) to promptly return or destroy all
information, documents, and materials relating to the Company or its
businesses, operations or affairs heretofore furnished by the Company or any
of its Representatives to such Person or any of its Representatives in
accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreement. Subject to

of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII _and the
Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, nor shall they

knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
furnish to any Person (other than Parent, Sub or any designees of Parent or
Sub) any information or data relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or afford to any Person (other than Parent, Sub or any designees

(vi) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding _Section 6.3(b)_, prior to the receipt of the Stockholder
Approval, if (i) the Company or its Representatives receive an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the Companys Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors, constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead
to, a Superior Proposal, (ii) the Companys Board of Directors concludes in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, that the failure to take action with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal would be inconsistent with the Companys Board of Directors
fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law,
(iii) such Acquisition Proposal was not the result of a breach of this
_Section 6.3_ and (iv) the Company provides to Parent in accordance with
_Section 6.3(e)_ the information required under _Section 6.3(e)_ to be
delivered by the Company to Parent, then, so long as the foregoing conditions
in the immediately preceding clauses (i)-(iv) remain satisfied, the Company
may take the following actions: (x) furnish information to the third party
making such Acquisition Proposal (a " _New Bidder_ "), _provided_ _that_ (A)
the Company receives from the New Bidder an executed confidentiality agreement
(the terms of which are no less favorable to the Company in any substantive
respect than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, except that (I)
such confidentiality agreement may not include any provision calling for an
exclusive right to negotiate with the Company and may not restrict the Company
in any way from complying with this Agreement, including prohibiting the
Company from providing information or written materials to Parent and (II)
such confidentiality agreement need not contain any "standstill" or other
comparable provisions), and (B) the Company shall promptly (and in any

 



      
 

 



 

event within twenty-four (24) hours) provide to Parent any non-public
information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided
to any such New Bidder which was not previously provided to Parent or its
Representatives; and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with the New
Bidder and its Representatives with respect to the Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(d) Except as set forth in this _Section 6.3_, neither the Companys Board of
Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw, amend,
modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent, or publicly propose to
withhold, withdraw, amend, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent,
the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve, adopt, endorse or recommend
any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) propose publicly to approve, adopt, endorse
or recommend any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in clause (i),
(ii), (iii) or in the proviso to _Section 6.3(f)_, in each case whether taken
by the Companys Board of Directors or any committee thereof, being referred
to as a " _Company Board Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
receipt of the Stockholder Approval, the Companys Board of Directors may
(A)(x) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or (y) enter into an
agreement providing for an Acquisition Transaction that constitutes a Superior
Proposal if: (I) the Company shall have received a Superior Proposal that was
not solicited in breach of _Section 6.3(b)_ and the Company shall have
otherwise complied in all material respects with the material obligations of
_Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.3_; (II) the Companys Board of Directors shall
have determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors) that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (III) the Company
has previously notified Parent in writing that it intends to take such action
(a " _Section 6.3 Notice_") (it being understood that the Section 6.3 Notice
shall not constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change for purposes of
this Agreement); (IV) the Company shall have made its Representatives
available to discuss with Parents Representatives any proposed modifications
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement during the five (5) business day
period following delivery by the Company to Parent of the first Section 6.3
Notice delivered to Parent; (V) if Parent shall have delivered to the Company
a written, binding and irrevocable offer capable of being accepted by the
Company to alter the terms or conditions of this Agreement during such five
(5) business day period, the Companys Board of Directors shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors), after considering the terms of such offer by Parent,
that the Superior Proposal giving rise to such Section 6.3 Notice continues to
be a Superior Proposal; and (VI) in the case of clause (y) above, the Company
concurrently terminates this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1(f)_;
or (B) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change other than in respect of
an Acquisition Proposal if the Companys Board of Directors shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors) that the failure to effect such Company Board
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, if (x) the Company has previously delivered to Parent a
Section 6.3 Notice (it being understood that the Section 6.3 Notice shall not
constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change for purposes of this
Agreement), (y) the Company shall have made its Representatives available to
discuss with Parents Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement during the five (5) business day period
following delivery by the Company to

 



      
 

 



 

Parent of the first Section 6.3 Notice delivered to Parent, and (z) if Parent
shall have delivered to the Company a written, binding and irrevocable offer
capable of being accepted by the Company to alter the terms or conditions of
this Agreement during such five (5) business day period, the Companys Board
of Directors shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors), after considering the terms of
such offer by Parent that the failure to effect such Company Board
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. If any Superior Proposal that is the subject of clause (A) of
the foregoing sentence is revised, including any revision to price, then the
Company shall deliver to Parent a new Section 6.3 Notice and again comply with
the requirements of clause (A) of this _Section 6.3(d)_ (with all references
to five (5) business days being treated as references to three (3) business
days for such purposes) with respect to such revised Superior Proposal, on
each occasion on which a revised Superior Proposal is submitted. For the
avoidance of doubt, all information provided to Parent pursuant to this
_Section 6.3_ will be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(e) From and after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall notify
Parent promptly (but in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) orally and in
writing of the receipt of any inquiries, discussions, negotiations, proposals
or expressions of interest with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, including
providing the identity of the third party making, submitting, inquiring about
or expressing interest with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, and (i) if
it is in writing, a copy of such Acquisition Proposal and any related draft
agreements and other written material setting forth the terms and conditions
of such Acquisition Proposal and (ii) if oral, a summary thereof (including
the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal). The Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed on a prompt and timely basis of the status and
details of any such Acquisition Proposal and with respect to any change to the
material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal within twenty-four (24) hours
of any such change. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
not to, enter into any Contract with any Person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is or shall
become party to any Contract, in each case, that prohibits the Company from
providing such information to Parent.

 



 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Companys Board of Directors
from (i) taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the
provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and (ii) making
any disclosure to the Companys stockholders that the Companys Board of
Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that the failure to make such disclosure would reasonably be expected
to be a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Law (it being agreed that the issuance by the Company or the
Companys Board of Directors of a "stop, look and listen" statement pending
disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act shall not in and of itself constitute a
Company Board Recommendation Change); _provided_ , _however_ , that any
disclosure of a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
other than (A) a "stop, look and listen" communication limited solely to the
type contemplated by Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, (B) any express
rejection of any applicable Acquisition Proposal or (C) any express
reaffirmation of its recommendation to its stockholders in favor of the
Merger, shall be deemed to be a

 



      
 

 



 

Company Board Recommendation Change. No change, withdrawal or modification in
the recommendation of the Companys Board of Directors to the Companys
stockholders with respect to this Agreement or the Merger shall change the
approval of the Board of Directors of the Company for purposes of causing any
state takeover Law (including Section 203 of the DGCL) or other state Law to
be inapplicable to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to restrictions
of applicable Law (including antitrust Laws), the Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to Parents
Subsidiaries and their respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
financial advisors, financing sources and other representatives (collectively,
the " _Representatives_ "), upon reasonable notice, reasonable access during
normal business hours during the period from and after the date hereof to the
Effective Time or any earlier termination of this Agreement to all their
respective properties, facilities, agents, personnel, books, contracts,
commitments and records and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably promptly to Parent (a) a
copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed
or furnished by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of Federal
or state securities laws and (b) all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may withhold the portions of such
documents and information to the extent that the failure to so withhold such
information would reasonably be expected to eliminate or waive the rights of
such party to assert an attorney-client or attorney work product privilege
with respect thereto or otherwise violate the terms of a confidentiality
agreement or obligation of non-disclosure in any Contract with a third party
in effect on the date of this Agreement, or would contravene any applicable
Laws, or result in significant antitrust risk for the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company ( _provided_ that the Company will use its
reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements
under circumstances in which any of the preceding restrictions apply); and
_provided_ _further_ that such investigation or access shall not unreasonably
disrupt the Companys operations. No investigation made pursuant to this
Section shall affect any representation or warranty in this Agreement or any
condition to the obligations of the parties hereto to consummate the Merger.
All information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ shall be subject to
the confidentiality agreement between the Company and Parent, dated November
14, 2012 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). In connection with the
continuing operation of the business of the Company and the Companys
Subsidiaries between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the Company shall
consult in good faith on a regular and frequent basis with the Representatives
of Parent and its Subsidiaries with regard to material operational
developments and the general status of ongoing operations pursuant to
procedures reasonably requested by Parent, its Subsidiaries or such
Representatives, _provided_ that such procedures are not unreasonably
disruptive to the operations of the Company and shall not require disclosure
of information not required to be disclosed by the preceding provisions of
this _Section 6.4_.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification_. (a) Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
reasonable actions, and to do, or cause to be done,

 



      
 

 



 

and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, as
promptly as practicable, the Merger, including (i) the identification and
obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
Registrations (including filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the
taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or
waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity,
including the filing under the HSR Act referred to in _Section 6.5(b)_ and
any required filings, notices or consents with state banking departments or
similar agencies required in connection with a change of control of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company holding licenses as a money
transmitter (the " _Money Transmitter Licenses_ "), (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) subject to
_Section 6.12_, the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the Merger, including, when reasonable, seeking to have any
stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental
Entity vacated or reversed, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and to fully carry
out the purposes of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
obligations set forth in this sentence shall not be deemed to have been
breached as a result of actions by the Company expressly permitted under
_Section 6.3_; _provided_ _further_ , that, with respect to the obligations
to obtain a consent or an approval relating to a change of control of the
Money Transmitter Licenses (or any pending registrations for Money Transmitter
Licenses) in any jurisdiction, if such consent or approval in such
jurisdiction is not obtained prior to June 19, 2013, Parent and the Company
agree to use reasonable best efforts to identify possible alternatives
reasonably satisfactory to Parent that eliminate the need to obtain such
approvals or consents in such jurisdiction, including, without limitation, by
(x) entering into arrangements reasonably satisfactory to Parent (or
consenting to the entry by Subsidiaries of the Company into arrangements
reasonably satisfactory to Parent) with third parties that possess the
necessary licenses providing the ability to create agency relationships to
enable the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Distributors and reloaders of
Cards managed by the Company and its Subsidiaries to provide money
transmission services for the Company and its Subsidiaries from and after the
Effective Time to permit the continued servicing of business relationships of
the Company and its Subsidiaries until receipt of such consents or approvals,
(y) to the extent feasible, ceasing operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as of the Effective Time, in one or more jurisdictions to the
extent the operations in such jurisdiction require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to have a Money Transmitter License, so long as such cessation of
operations is not reasonably expected to result in the loss of 1.9% or more of
the aggregate revenues of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the twelve (12)
month period ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, and/or (z)
obtaining written assurances reasonably acceptable to Parent from the
applicable state banking department or similar agency that such consent or
approval is forthcoming and no adverse action will be taken against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the continued conduct of
the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable) in the applicable
jurisdiction notwithstanding the pendency of any such approval or consent
(clauses (x), (y) and (z) collectively, " _Alternate Arrangements_ "). Without
limiting the rights of Parent or Sub under _Section 7.1_ or this _Section
6.5_, each of the Company and Parent agrees to use reasonable best

 



      
 

 



 

efforts to implement and cause any Alternate Arrangements reasonably
satisfactory to it to become effective as promptly as reasonably practicable
after July 19, 2013 in order to permit the Effective Time to occur as promptly
as reasonably practicable thereafter (subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in _Article VII_).

 



 

(b) Without limitation of the foregoing, (x) each of Parent and the Company
undertakes and agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with
each other and submit in good faith (based on the Companys past practices
with respect to such filings) as soon as practicable, and in any event within
forty five (45) days after the date hereof, all required filings, notices or
consents in connection with the Money Transmitter Licenses for the
jurisdictions set forth on _Schedule 6.5(b)_ with the applicable state
banking departments or similar agencies, and (y) each of Parent and the
Company undertakes and agrees to file as soon as practicable, and in any event
prior to ten (10) business days after the date hereof, a Notification and
Report Form under the HSR Act with the United States Federal Trade Commission
(the " _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ "). Each of Parent and the Company shall
(i) respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries received from the FTC
or the Antitrust Division for additional information or documentation and to
all inquiries and requests received from any State Attorney General or other
Governmental Entity in connection with antitrust matters, and (ii) not extend
any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with the FTC
or the Antitrust Division not to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto.

 



 

(c) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any Regulatory Law or if any order, judgment, decree
or injunction of any Governmental Entity is instituted by any Governmental
Entity or any private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated
hereby as violative of any Regulatory Law: (x) each of the parties hereto
shall use its reasonable best efforts to: (i) oppose or defend against any
such objection, order, judgment, decree or injunction to prevent or enjoin
consummation of this Agreement (and the transactions contemplated herein);
and/or (ii) take such action as reasonably necessary to overturn any action by
any Governmental Entity or private party to block consummation of this
Agreement (and the transactions contemplated herein), including by defending
any objection, order, judgment, decree or injunction brought by any
Governmental Entity or private party in order to avoid entry of, or to have
vacated, overturned or terminated, including by appeal if necessary, any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing or the other
transactions contemplated herein, or, subject to _Section 6.5(d)_, in order
to resolve any such objections, proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, trust or otherwise, the
sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent or its
subsidiaries or of the Company or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that each of
the parties hereto shall cooperate with one another in connection with all
proceedings related to the foregoing and Parent shall have final decision-
making authority with respect thereto; and (y) Parent agrees to take the
actions set forth on _Section 6.5(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedules in
accordance with the terms set forth therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to amend or waive the
provisions of any Contract, or to pay any consent or similar fees or payments,
or divest any assets or enter into commitments regarding the conduct of

 



      
 

 



 

its business or licensing of technology or know-how, in each case unless such
action is conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Regulatory Law_ " means the Sherman Act, as amended, the
Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, any Law analogous to the HSR Act or otherwise regulating antitrust or
merger control matters and in each case existing in foreign jurisdictions, and
all other Federal, state and foreign, if any, statutes, rules, regulations,
orders, decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines and other Laws that are
designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate (i) foreign investment
or (ii) actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of
trade or lessening of competition.

 



 

(d) Subject to _Section 6.5(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule and _Section
6.5(e)_, nothing in this Agreement (including in _Sections 6.5(a)_ , _(b)_ or
_(c)_ ) shall require any party or its Subsidiaries to (i) propose, negotiate,
or offer to commit or agree to or effect by consent decree, hold separate
order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license, disposition or hold
separate of (A) any asset of Parent or its Subsidiaries, or (B) any asset of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, in the case of this clause (B) only, if such
sale, divestiture, license, disposition or hold separate with respect thereto
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the expected benefits of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to Parent, (ii) (A) conduct or agree to conduct
the business of Parent or its Subsidiaries in any particular manner or agree
to any restrictions or limitations with respect to the business of Parent or
its Subsidiaries, or (B) conduct or agree to conduct the business of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in any particular manner or agree to any
restrictions or limitations with respect to the business of the Company or its
Subsidiaries if, in the case of this clause (B) only, such conduct, agreement,
restrictions or limitations with respect thereto, would, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
expected benefits of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
Parent, or (iii) agree to any other order, action or regulatory condition of
any regulatory body, whether in an approval proceeding or another regulatory
proceeding that if effected, would be adverse to Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries and would have an effect that is material
measured in relation to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (any
of the foregoing, a " _Burdensome Effect_ "). Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries shall propose,
negotiate or offer to commit to any sale, divestiture, license, disposition or
hold separate of any asset contemplated to be held by the Surviving
Corporation following the consummation of the Merger or agree to conduct the
business of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries in any particular
manner or agree to any restrictions or limitations with respect to the
business of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, in each case
without the prior written consent of Parent.

 



 

(e) If Parent elects to propose, negotiate, or offer to commit to and effect
by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, any sale, divestiture,
license, disposition, prohibition or limitation or other action of a type
described in _Section 6.5(d)_ with respect to any assets or businesses of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or effective as of the Effective Time, the
Company or its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries,
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to, reasonably cooperate in all respects as requested by
Parent in connection with any such sale, divestiture, license, disposition,
prohibition or limitation or other action of a type described in _Section
6.5(d)_, so long

 



      
 

 



 

as such sale, divestiture, license, disposition, prohibition or limitation or
other action is to be effective only as of the Effective Time.

 



 

(f) Each party shall (i) promptly notify the other party of any written
communication to that party from the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any State
Attorney General or any other Governmental Entity and, subject to applicable
Law, permit the other party and its outside counsel to review in advance any
proposed written communication to any of the foregoing; (ii) not agree to
participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry concerning this
Agreement or the Merger unless it consults with the other party in advance
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat, in each case to the
extent reasonably practicable; and (iii) furnish as promptly as reasonably
practicable the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings, and
written communications (and a reasonable explanation of the substance of oral
communications) between them and their affiliates and their respective
representatives on the one hand, and any government or regulatory authority or
members or their respective staffs on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement and the Merger.

 



 

(g) Each of the Company, Parent and Sub shall give notice as promptly as
reasonably practicable to the other parties of (i) the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would be
likely to cause (A) any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
made by it (and in the case of Parent, made by Sub) to be untrue or inaccurate
in any material respect or (B) any covenant, condition or agreement contained
in this Agreement not to be complied with or satisfied by it (and in the case
of Parent, by Sub) in any material respect; (ii) any written notice or other
communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger; and
(iii) in the case of the Company, any change or development that is reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or materially impair or delay the
ability of the Company and its Subsidiaries to consummate the Merger or, in
the case of Parent and Sub, any change or development that is reasonably
likely to materially impair or delay the ability of Parent or Sub to
consummate the Merger.

 



 

Section 6.6 _Benefit Plans_. (a) For a period of not less than twelve (12)
months after the Effective Time, Parent agrees to cause the Surviving
Corporation (i) to maintain the base salary or base wages of the employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries that are no less favorable than the base
salary or base wages in effect for each such employee on the date of this
Agreement; and (ii) to maintain employee benefits (other than equity-based
plans) that are, in the aggregate, at least substantially comparable to either
(x) the Employee Benefit Plans (other than equity-based plans) in effect on
the date of this Agreement or (y) employee benefits (other than equity-based
plans) in effect for similarly situated employees of Parent, at Parents
election.

 



 

(b) In addition to the agreement set forth in _Section 6.6(a)_, from and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, to honor in accordance with their respective terms
(as in effect on the date of this Agreement, including any amendment or
termination provisions thereof), all the Companys employment, severance,
change in control, retention, transition and termination agreements, in each
case as disclosed in _Section 6.6(b)(i)_ of the Disclosure Schedule,
including any change in control

 



      
 

 



 

provisions contained therein. In addition, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor the obligations of the Company under the existing
indemnification agreements between the Company and its directors and officers
set forth on _Section 6.6(b)(ii)_ of the Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(c) In the event that the employment of an employee who was an employee of the
Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time is
terminated by Parent or the Surviving Corporation for any reason other than
for "Cause" (as such term is defined in the Amended and Restated NetSpend
Holdings, Inc. 2004 Equity Incentive Plan) within 90 days following the
Closing Date, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, to make a payment in a single lump-sum, within fifteen (15) days
of the date of termination, to such terminated employee equal to the annual
cash bonus amount that is properly accrued on the books of the Surviving
Corporation in the ordinary course consistent with past practices in
accordance with the terms of the NetSpend Holdings, Inc. 2013 Bonus Program
with respect to such employee as of the date of termination, subject to
applicable withholding taxes.

 



 

(d) To the extent that employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries become
eligible to participate in any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement
maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including any severance
plan), then for all purposes, including determining eligibility to
participate, vesting, early retirement and benefit accrual, service with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time shall be
treated as service with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such service shall not be recognized (i) for purposes of
benefit accrual and eligibility for early retirement under any defined benefit
plan, (ii) eligibility for retiree welfare benefit plans, or (iii) to the
extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits. In
addition, all such plans shall waive any pre-existing conditions, actively-at-
work exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation by and
coverage of such employees to the extent such conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods were satisfied or waived under the applicable Company plan and
shall provide that any expenses, co-payments, and deductibles paid or incurred
during the applicable plan year on or before the Effective Time by or on
behalf of any such employees shall be taken into account under applicable
Parent benefit plans for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions.

 



 

(e) On and after the date hereof, no future offering periods will be commenced
under the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company shall terminate
the Employee Stock Purchase Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. With
respect to the offering period in progress as of the date hereof, no new
participants shall be permitted to commence participation in the plan, no
current participant shall be permitted to increase his or her contributions to
the plan, and, at the earlier of the conclusion of the offering period and
immediately prior to the Effective Time, accumulated contributions will be
applied to the purchase of Common Stock in accordance with the plans terms
(and such Common Stock will be converted into the Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.1_).

 



 

(f) The provisions of this _Section 6.6_ are for the sole benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including
for the avoidance of doubt any employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries),
other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted

 



      
 

 



 

successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies,
with respect to the matters provided for in this _Section 6.6_ under or by
reason of any provision of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement,
including the provisions of this _Section 6.6_, shall be considered, or
deemed to be, an amendment to or modification of any Employee Benefit Plans or
any other agreements for purposes of ERISA or otherwise.

 



 

(g) The Company agrees to terminate, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
the employment of the executives set forth on _Section 6.6(g)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule, and shall provide to Parent for its review and reasonable
approval, within a reasonable time prior to termination of the executives, all
severance agreements, releases and other documents relating to such
termination of employment to the extent they differ from the terms of the
employment agreements of the terminated executives in effect prior to the date
hereof. Parent agrees to treat, and shall cause the Company to treat, the
terminations of employment pursuant to this _Section 6.6(g)_ as "terminations
without cause" by the Company for purposes of the employment agreements of the
terminated executives. Parent also acknowledges that each Option and
Restricted Share held by a terminated executive shall become fully vested
immediately prior to the effectiveness of termination of employment in
accordance with an amendment to the awards made to such executives.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Fees and Expenses._ (a) Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the
party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is
consummated.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 6.7(d)_, the Company agrees:

 



 

(i) to pay Parent a fee equal to $52.6 million (the " _Termination Amount_ ")
if this Agreement is terminated by (A) Parent pursuant to _clause (i)_ of
_Section 8.1(d)_ (in which case, the Termination Amount shall be payable
within two (2) business days of such termination) or (B) the Company pursuant
to _Section 8.1(f)_ (in which case, the Termination Amount shall be payable
at the time of such termination); or

 



 

(ii) to pay Parent a fee equal to the Termination Amount if (A) this Agreement
is terminated (x) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(b)(i)_ or _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ or (y) by Parent pursuant to _clause
(ii)_ of _Section 8.1(d)_, and (B) in the case of a termination under
_Section 8.1(b)(i)_, after the date hereof and prior to receipt of the
Stockholder Approval, or, in the case of a termination under _Section
8.1(b)(iii)_, after the date hereof and prior to the Stockholder Meeting, or,
in the case of a termination under _clause (ii)_ of _Section 8.1(d)_, after
the date hereof and prior to the date of termination, an Acquisition Proposal
shall have been made and not withdrawn and (C) within twelve (12) months after
such termination either the Company enters into a definitive agreement
relating to an Acquisition Proposal (which need not be the same Acquisition
Proposal referred to in clause (B) above) or any transaction contemplated by
an Acquisition Proposal (which need not be the same Acquisition Proposal
referred to in clause (B) above) is consummated (in which case, the
Termination Amount shall be payable within two (2) business days after such
event and any payment received pursuant to _Section 6.7(e)_ shall be credited
against such payment); it being

 



       
 

 



 

understood that, for purposes of clause (C) of this _Section 6.7(b)(ii)_ , all
references to twenty percent (20%) in the definition of Acquisition
Transaction shall be treated as references to fifty percent (50%) and the
reference to eighty percent (80%) in the definition of Acquisition Transaction
shall be treated as a reference to fifty percent (50%).

 



 

(c) The Termination Amount payable by the Company pursuant to _Section 6.7(b)_
shall be made by wire transfer of same day funds. The parties acknowledge that
the agreements contained in this _Section 6.7_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, none of the Company, Parent or Sub would enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due
pursuant to this _Section 6.7_ , and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
or Sub commences a suit which results in a binding nonappealable judgment
rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction against the Company for any
amounts set forth in this _Section 6.7_ the Company shall pay to Parent or Sub
its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such
suit. In addition, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due by it
pursuant to this _Section 6.7_ , interest shall accrue on such amount from the
date such payment was required to be paid pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement until the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to three (3)
percent plus the prime interest rate published in _The Wall Street Journal_ on
the date such interest begins accruing.

 



 

(d) Parent agrees that the payment provided for in _Section 6.7(b)_ shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, its Subsidiaries, stockholders and
Representatives against the Company, its Subsidiaries, stockholders and
Representatives upon termination of this Agreement under circumstances giving
rise to an obligation of the Company to pay the amounts set forth in _Section
6.7(b)_ and such remedy shall be limited to the aggregate of the sums
stipulated in such _Section 6.7(b)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
herein shall relieve any party from liability for fraud or from the willful
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement. In no event shall the Company be required to pay to
Parent more than one Termination Amount pursuant to _Section 6.7(b)_.

 



 

(e) The Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to the Expenses if either
Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to (i) _Section
8.1(b)(i)_ and at any time prior to receipt of the Stockholder Approval an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made and not withdrawn or (ii) _Section
8.1(b)(iii)_ and at any time prior to the Stockholder Meeting an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been made and not withdrawn, _provided_ , _that_ none of
Parent or Sub shall have breached in any material respect or failed to perform
in any material respect any of their respective material obligations under
this Agreement. For purposes of this _Section 6.7(e)_ , all references to
twenty percent (20%) in the definition of Acquisition Transaction shall be
treated as references to fifty percent (50%) and the reference to eighty
percent (80%) in the definition of Acquisition Transaction shall be treated as
a reference to fifty percent (50%). The term " _Expenses_ " shall mean all
documented out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by Parent in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including all
fees and expenses of accountants, attorneys, investment bankers and financial
advisors (but excluding corporate overhead or salaries payable to employees or
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall the amount of Expenses exceed $10 million; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for fraud

 



      
 

 



 

or from the willful breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, shall use reasonable efforts to consult with each
other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, unless
it has made reasonable efforts to do the foregoing, shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation,
except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange
(including NASDAQ) or regulatory or Governmental Entity to which the relevant
party is subject or submits, wherever situated, in which case the party
required to make the release or public statement shall use its reasonable best
efforts to allow the other party or parties hereto reasonable time to comment
on such release or public statement in advance of such issuance (it being
understood that the final form and content of any such release or public
statement, as well as the timing of any such release or public statement,
shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party). The parties agree
that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit B_.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Sub_. Parent will take all action necessary (a) to cause Sub to
perform its obligations under this Agreement to consummate the Merger on the

investments other than as specifically contemplated by this Agreement.

preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications
or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use,
transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp Taxes, any transfer,
recording, registration and other fees and any similar Taxes which become
payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(together with any related interest, penalties or additions to Tax, "
_Transfer Taxes_ "). All Transfer Taxes shall be paid by the Surviving
Corporation and expressly shall not be a liability of any holder of Common
Stock or Preferred Stock.

 



 

Section 6.11 _State Takeover Statutes_. The Company and its Board of Directors
shall (i) take all action necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute
or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Merger, this
Agreement, the Voting Agreement or the transactions provided for in this
Agreement or the Voting Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover statute or
similar statute becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement, the Voting
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting
Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger, this
Agreement, the Voting Agreement and all of the transactions provided for in
this Agreement and the Voting Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
reasonably practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and the
Voting Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or
regulation on the Merger, this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement, the Voting Agreement or the transactions provided for in this
Agreement or the Voting Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Litigation and Proceedings_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate, at Parents expense, in the defense or settlement
of any stockholder litigation against the Company or its directors and any
other lawsuit or proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, relating to
or challenging this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The
Company agrees that it shall not settle or offer to settle any litigation or
other legal proceeding against the Company or any of its directors or
executive officers, by any stockholder of the Company or otherwise, relating
to this Agreement or the Merger without the prior written consent of Parent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

Companys Board of Directors, or an appropriate committee of non-employee

and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
derivative securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by each individual who is a director or executive officer of
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Subsidiaries to provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause

advisors and representatives (collectively the " _Company Representatives_ ")
to provide, all customary cooperation in connection with the arrangement of
the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or any

obligations or liabilities with respect to such agreements or documents prior

(b) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and
the Company Representatives from and against any and all Losses suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the debt financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or other Available Financing and

any information utilized in connection therewith (except with respect to
matters arising out of a material misstatement in or failure to state a
material fact pertinent to the information provided by or on behalf of the
Company pursuant to _Section 6.14(a)_ or any fraud or any intentional

promptly upon written request by the Company, reimburse the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries (including those of its
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents

(c) Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of
Parent and Sub shall use, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to
use, their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange and consummate the debt financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter or other Available
Financing, including using reasonable best efforts to (x) satisfy on a timely
basis (taking into account the expected timing of any marketing period) all
conditions to funding in the Debt Commitment Letter or other Available
Financing and such definitive agreements to be entered into pursuant thereto
(other than any condition where the failure to be so satisfied is a direct
result of the Companys failure to furnish information or perform in all
material respects its other obligations required to be delivered or performed
under this Agreement (including _Section 6.14(a)_ )), to the extent applicable
to Parent, Sub or their respective Subsidiaries and (y) negotiate, execute and
deliver definitive agreements with respect to such Available Financing
materially consistent with the terms and conditions (including the "flex"
provisions) contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or other Available
Financing. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a current basis in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing
or any other Available Financing. Subject to the terms and upon satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or other Available
Financing, Parent and Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the
lenders and the other Persons providing such debt financing to provide the
Available Financing on the Closing Date, _provided_ that nothing in this
Agreement shall require Parent, Sub or any of its Subsidiaries to litigate or
initiate any other action or proceeding against any Financing Party. In the
event any portion of the Available Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions (including any "flex" provisions) contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letter, and such portion is reasonably required to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
without limitation, to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid to
the holders of shares of Common Stock, the aggregate Preferred Share Merger
Consideration to be paid to the holders of shares of Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock, and the aggregate consideration to be paid to holders of
Options and Restricted Shares as a result of the Merger, and all fees and
expenses related to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (A) Parent shall immediately notify the Company and (B) Parent and
Sub shall use, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, their
reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain Alternative Financing, upon terms
and conditions not materially less favorable to Parent and its Subsidiaries

promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event. Parent shall
promptly notify the Company in writing (I) if Parent has actual knowledge of
any breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to
any breach or default) by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter, or (II) of
the receipt by Parent or Sub of any written notice or other written
communication from any Financing Party with respect to any actual breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment
Letter. Parent and Sub shall not consent to (1) any amendment or modification
to, or any waiver of any provision under, the Debt Commitment Letter if such
amendment, modification or waiver

 



      
 

 



 

imposes new or additional conditions, or otherwise expands any of the
conditions, to the receipt of the Debt Financing, extends the timing of the
funding of the commitments thereunder, or reduces the aggregate cash amount of
the funding commitments thereunder, or otherwise amends, modifies or waives,
any provision of the Debt Commitment Letter, in any such case where such
amendment, modification or waiver described in this clause (1) would
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially adversely
affect the ability of Parent and Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger ( _provided_ , _that_
Parent and Sub may replace or amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders,
lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have
not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof) or (2) early
termination of the Debt Commitment Letter unless it has been replaced by
Alternative Financing in accordance with _Section 6.14_. Parent shall furnish
to the Company a copy of any amendment, modification, waiver or consent of or
relating to the Debt Commitment promptly upon execution thereof (which copy
may be redacted in the manner described in _Section 4.5(a)_ ). Parent and Sub
shall use, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, reasonable
best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the Debt Commitment Letter until
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, are
consummated. Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 6.14(c)_ or
in any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall Parent or Sub be
required (y) to amend or waive any of the terms or conditions of this
Agreement or (z) to consummate the Closing any earlier than the date set forth
in _Section 2.8_.

 



 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Financing Parties_ " means the lenders,
underwriters, placement agents, and initial purchasers, as applicable, party
to the Debt Commitment Letter or any Alternative Financing.

reasonable best efforts to cause its shares of common stock to no longer be
quoted on the NASDAQ and to be de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 6.16 _Standstill Agreements_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement through the earlier of the Effective Time and the date this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_ , neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall amend, modify or waive any provision of any
confidentiality agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal or standstill
agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (other
than any involving Parent), unless the Companys Board of Directors determines
after consulting with legal counsel that the failure to terminate, amend,
modify or waive such provision would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

contained in _Section 3.21(c)_ shall be deemed to be true and correct in all
material respects so long as the failure of such representations or warranties

relationship with any Core Counterparty, including as a result of a material
diminution of the aggregate rights and benefits to the Company and its
Subsidiaries under the Core Business Contracts with such Core Counterparty,
taken as a whole, or a material increase in the aggregate obligations and
duties of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the Core Business Contracts

warranties of the Company contained in the second sentence of _Section
3.22(f)_ shall be deemed to be true and correct in all material respects so

(ii) if any Governmental Entity issues an order, decree or ruling or takes any
other action permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger and such order, decree, ruling or other action

_provided_ _that_ the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to any party whose failure to

postponement thereof) to obtain the Stockholder Approval in accordance with
this Agreement, the Stockholder Approval is not obtained; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ if the Company has breached in any material respect any
of its material obligations under this Agreement and such breach was the cause
of, or resulted in, the failure to obtain the Stockholder Approval at the
Stockholder Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof; or

 



 

(c) by Parent, if the Company breaches or fails to perform any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement (other
than with respect to _Section 6.3_ ), in any case, as a result of which a
condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _7.2(b)_ would not have been
satisfied prior to or as of the Termination Date and, in any such case, such
breach (if curable) has not been cured within 30 days after notice to the
Company ( _provided_ _that_

 



      
 

 



 

Parent or Sub is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty
or covenant contained in this Agreement);

 



 

(d) by Parent if (i) the Board of Directors of the Company (or any committee

or proposes an intent to do so, or (ii) the Company shall have breached in any
material respect any of its material obligations under _Section 6.1_ or
_Section 6.3_ ;

 



 

(e) by the Company, if Parent or Sub breaches or fails to perform any of its

any termination pursuant to this _Section 8.1(f)_ , pays Parent the
Termination Amount as set forth in _Section 6.7(b)_ ; _provided_ ,

under _Sections 6.1_ or _6.3_.

 



 

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in _Section 8.1_ , this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Sub or the Company, other than
the penultimate sentence of _Section 6.4_ , _Section 6.7_ , this _Section 8.2_
and _Section 9.6_ , which provisions shall survive such termination, and
except to the extent that such termination results from fraud or a willful
breach by a party of any representation, warranty or covenant set forth in
this Agreement in which case the party at fault shall not be released or
relieved from any liabilities or damages. The rights granted pursuant to this
_Section 8.2_ to the Company shall be enforceable solely by the Company, in
its sole and absolute discretion, on behalf of the stockholders of the Company
and it is agreed that neither this provision nor any other provision of this
Agreement is intended to provide the stockholders of the Company (or any party
acting on their behalf) the ability to seek prior to the Effective Time the
enforcement of, or directly seek any remedies pursuant to, this Agreement. For
avoidance of doubt as to the parties intent with respect to control of
determinations regarding the Companys rights under this Agreement to
terminate, amend, make any waiver or consent under, or enforce this Agreement,

stockholders of the Company, such rights shall exclusively belong to the
Company (acting expressly through the Companys Board of Directors) in its
sole discretion.

be amended, modified, or supplemented by the parties hereto in a manner
adverse to such Financing Parties without the

 



      
 

 



 

express written consent of the Financing Parties, this Agreement may be
amended by the parties at any time before or after receipt of the Stockholder
Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that after receipt of the Stockholder
Approval, there shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further
approval by the stockholders of the Company without the further approval of
such stockholders; and _provided_ , _further_ , that after receipt of the
Stockholder Approval, no such amendment or modification shall be made that
reduces the amount or changes the form of Merger Consideration or otherwise
materially and adversely affects the rights of the Companys stockholders
hereunder, without the further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement
may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each
of the parties.

parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject to the proviso of _Section

the party against whom the waiver is to be effective). Any agreement on the
part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure
of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver_. A
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_ , an amendment of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.3_ or an extension or waiver pursuant to

designee of its Board of Directors.
