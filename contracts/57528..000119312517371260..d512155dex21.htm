(except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Snyders-Lance,
Inc." and with such modifications as may be required by  _Section_ __ _

Time, the bylaws of the Company shall be amended and restated to be identical

Time shall cease to be the directors and officers of the Company.

ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES;

CLOSING PAYMENTS

 

Section 2.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or any holders of any securities of the Company or the sole shareholder of
Merger Sub:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than (i) shares of
Company Common Stock owned directly by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (ii) shares of Company Common Stock owned by any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time (together with the shares of Company Common Stock referred
to in the immediately preceding clause (i), the " _Excluded Shares_ "), in
each case of clause (i) and clause (ii) of this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_ other
than shares of Company Common Stock held in trust accounts, managed
accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or
agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties, shall be
automatically converted into the right to receive $50.00 in cash (the " _Per
Share Merger Consideration_ "), payable to the holder thereof, without
interest, in the manner set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.2_. At the Effective
Time, all of the shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate
and uncertificated interest formerly representing any shares of Company Common
Stock (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration for each such share of Company
Common Stock, payable without interest, in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
2.1_ and  _Section_ __ _ 2.2_.

(b) _Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time as described in clause (i) of _Section_ __ _
2.1(a)_ shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of
any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist. Each Excluded Share
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time as described
in clause (ii) of _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_ shall be converted into such number
of shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation such that each direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company that owned capital stock in
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall own the same
percentage of the outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Effective Time without any payment of consideration
therefor.

 



3 (c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, or such
higher number of such shares as may be necessary to give effect to the second
sentence of Section 2.1(b).

 

Section 2.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent and Merger Sub shall
enter into an agreement (in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company) with
a paying agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration. Prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,
with the Paying Agent for the benefit of the record holders of Company Common
Stock (other than Excluded Shares), a cash amount in immediately available
funds necessary and sufficient for the Paying Agent to make all payments
under  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_ (such cash amount being hereinafter referred
to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
purpose other than as set forth in this _Article II_. The Paying Agent shall
invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent solely in (i) direct short-term
obligations of the United States of America, (ii) obligations for which the
full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide
for the payment of principal and interest, (iii) commercial paper rated P-1 or
A-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, (iv) in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion, (v) in money market funds having a rating in the highest
investment category granted by a nationally recognized credit rating agency
at the time of acquisition or (vi) a combination of any of the foregoing,
provided that, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity
exceeding three months. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in
excess of the aggregate amounts payable under _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_ shall be
returned to Parent in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2(d)_. No
such investment or losses thereon shall relieve Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this
_Article II_ or affect the amount of Per Share Merger Consideration payable to
holders of Company Common Stock, and to the extent that there are any losses
with respect to any such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any
reason below the level required for the Paying Agent to make prompt cash
payment under  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_, Parent shall promptly provide
additional cash to the Paying Agent to add to the Exchange Fund so as to
ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient
for the Paying Agent to make such payments under _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_.
Parent shall pay all charges and expenses of the Paying Agent in connection
with the exchange of Company Common Stock for the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event
not later than the third (3rd) Business Day following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each record holder, as of
the Effective Time, of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ "), which have converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.1_, a form 

 



4  of letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
such Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a
Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the Paying
Agent shall issue and deliver to the holder of such Certificate, by check or
wire transfer (as specified in the letter of transmittal), a cash amount (less
any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.6_) equal to
the product of (i) the Per Share Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate and
such Certificate shall then be canceled. Promptly after the Effective Time
and in any event not later than the third (3rd) Business Day following the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall issue and deliver to each holder, as of
the Effective Time, of interest formerly representing uncertificated shares
of Company Common Stock that were represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry
Shares_ "), which have converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_, a
check or wire transfer for an amount of cash (less any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.6_) equal to the product of (A)
the Per Share Merger Consideration and (B) the number of such Book-Entry
Shares, without such holder being required to deliver a Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent. No interest shall be paid
or accrued for the benefit of holders of the shares of Company Common Stock
on the Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, it shall be a condition of
payment that such Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall
be properly transferred and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Per Share Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_, each Certificate shall be deemed
at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
upon such surrender the Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 2.1_.

 

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers of shares of the Company Common Stock on the stock transfer books
of the Company. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to
the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall
be cancelled and, subject to compliance with the procedures set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_, exchanged for the cash amount to which the holder
thereof is entitled pursuant to this _Article II_ (less any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.6_) to be paid in the manner
specified in the letter of transmittal to an account designated by such
holder.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. At any time after the date that is twelve
(12) months after the Closing Date, Parent shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the
proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. Any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore
complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look

 



5  only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar laws) for payment of the amount to which such holder
is entitled as a result of the Merger (upon due surrender of such holders
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof), without
any interest thereon.

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary
amount and upon such terms as may be reasonably required by Parent
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject
to  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(d)_, Parent) will deliver, in exchange for shares of
Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) represented by such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, an amount in cash (less any required
Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.6_) equal to the product of
(i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares)
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate and (ii) the Per
Share Merger Consideration.

Section 2.3. _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to provide that each option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock granted pursuant to the Company Equity Plans or otherwise (other than
pursuant to the ASPP) (each, an " _Option_ ") that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, vest in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to the
Option such that (i) all time-vesting Options shall fully vest (to the extent
unvested) and (ii) all performance-vesting Options granted under
the Companys 2017 Enterprise Incentive Plan shall vest based on the actual
level of performance for the quarter ending on or before the Effective Time,
pro-rated based on the proration schedule set forth in  _Section_ __ _
2.3(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all actions necessary to provide that that each Option that
is outstanding and vested as of the Effective Time, shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company,
the holder of that Option or any other Person, be cancelled and terminated and
converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive from Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, but no later than thirty (30) days following the Effective
Time, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Option,
multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration
over the per share exercise price of such Option, less any Taxes required to
be withheld in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.6_. For the avoidance of
doubt, if there is no excess under subsection (ii), then the holder of such
Option shall not be entitled to receive any amounts under this _Section_ __ _
2.3(a)_ and such Option shall be cancelled and terminated in accordance with
this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_.

(b) _Restricted Stock_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all actions necessary to provide that at the Effective Time, each outstanding
award of restricted stock in respect of shares of Company Common Stock granted
under a Company Equity Plan or otherwise (each, a " _Restricted Stock Award_
") shall fully vest (to the extent unvested) such that

 



6  (i) all time-based restrictions shall lapse in accordance with such
Restricted Stock Awards applicable terms and conditions, and (ii) all
performance-vesting Company Restricted Stock Awards granted under the
Companys 2017 Enterprise Incentive Plan shall vest and be payable based on
the actual level of performance for the quarter ending on or before the
Effective Time, pro-rated based on the proration schedule set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule. Upon such vesting, each
share of Company Common Stock underlying each Restricted Stock Award shall be
treated as Company Common Stock for all purposes of this Agreement, with any
applicable Taxes withheld in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.6_.

 

(c) _Restricted Stock Units_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all actions necessary to provide that each award of restricted stock
units (including any performance-vesting restricted stock units) in respect of
shares of Company Common Stock granted under a Company Equity Plan or
otherwise (each, a " _Company RSU_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
vest in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to the Company RSU
such that (i) all time-vesting Company RSUs shall fully vest (to the
extent unvested) and all time vesting restrictions shall lapse and (ii) all
performance-vesting Company RSUs shall vest and be payable assuming all
performance-vesting conditions have been satisfied at the target level of
performance, pro-rated based on the number of days in the performance period
preceding the Closing Date. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all actions necessary to provide that each Company RSU that
is outstanding and vested as of the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company

covenants in _Section_ __ _ 4.2_ hereof), if between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class by reason of the occurrence of, or record date for, any share
dividend or distribution, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
share split (including a reverse share split), merger, combination, issuer

prior to such event.

 

Section 2.5. _No Liability_. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, none of the parties to this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent will be liable to any shareholders of the Company or other Person
in respect of any cash properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 

Section 2.6. _Withholding Rights_ _._ Each of Parent, the Company, the

entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any other applicable state,

the applicable Governmental Authority. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority by
Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the

Agreement as having been paid to the Persons otherwise entitled to the payment
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent,
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may
be.

Company and each of its Subsidiaries have all Governmental Authorizations

Company Material Adverse Effect. Since July 1, 2015, the Company has not
received any written notice from any Governmental Authority regarding (i) any
actual or possible violation of any Governmental Authorization, or any failure

Acquisition Proposal the Company Board, or a committee thereof, determines in

_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not effect a Change of

Termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_ with respect to a Superior
Proposal unless: (A) the Company Board, or a committee thereof, in good faith
determines (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the
failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (B) the Company
notifies Parent in writing, at least four (4) Business Days in advance (and
two (2) Business Days in advance, if such notification relates to the Superior
Proposal, in respect of which a notification had previously been made, and
terms of which Superior Proposal materially changed), that it intends to
effect a Change of Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal or
effect a Fiduciary Termination pursuant to Section 6.3(a) with respect to
a Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the identity of the Person
who made such Superior Proposal and the material terms and conditions of such

a Fiduciary Termination pursuant to Section 6.3(a) with respect to a Superior
Proposal, if requested by Parent, the Company shall negotiate in good faith
with Parent during such four (4) Business Day period (or such two (2)
Business Day period, as the case may be) to make such revisions to the terms
of this Agreement so that failure to effect such Change of Recommendation or

inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and
(D) the Company Board, or a committee thereof, shall have considered in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor) any changes to this Agreement offered in writing by Parent in a
manner that would form a binding contract if accepted by the Company and shall
have determined in good faith that the Superior Proposal would continue
to constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes offered in writing by
Parent were to be given effect.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
at any time prior to the time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained,
the Company Board, and a committee thereof, may also effect a Change of
Recommendation in the absence of a Superior Proposal if an Intervening Event
shall have occurred and be continuing; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not effect a Change of Recommendation in connection with an
Intervening Event unless: (A) the Company Board, or a committee thereof, in
good faith determines (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that, in light of such Intervening Event, the failure to take such action
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; (B) the Company notifies Parent in writing, at
least four (4) Business Days in advance (and two (2) Business Days in advance,
if such notification relates to the Intervening Event, in respect of which
a notification had previously been made, and circumstances of which
Intervening Event materially changed), which notice shall not itself
constitute a Change of Recommendation and shall (x) state that an Intervening
Event has occurred and that the Company Board, or a committee thereof, has
determined that in light of such Intervening Event, the failure to effect a
Change of

 



44  Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and that the Company intends
to take such action and (y) specify the details of such Intervening Event and
the basis upon which the Company Board intends to effect a Change of
Recommendation; (C) after providing such notice and prior to making such
Change of Recommendation in connection with an Intervening Event, if
requested by Parent, the Company shall negotiate in good faith with Parent
during such four (4) Business Day period (or such two (2) Business Day period,
as the case may be) to make such revisions to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement so that the failure to make such Change of Recommendation
would no longer be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and (D) the Company Board, or a
committee thereof, shall have considered in good faith any changes to this
Agreement offered in writing by Parent in a manner that would form a binding
contract if accepted by the Company and shall have determined in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to
effect a Change of Recommendation with respect to such Intervening Event would
still be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.

 

(e) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _
4.3_ shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Company Board, or any
committee thereof, from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under

Company from providing to Parent such material terms and conditions and other
information.

Governmental Authority to delay the consummation of the Transactions, except
with the prior written consent of the other parties which consent shall not be

shall be responsible for paying all filing fees under the HSR Act and any
other applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions.

(b) To the extent permissible under applicable Law, each of Parent and the
Company shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in _Section_ __ _
4.4(a)_ to obtain all requisite approvals, clearances and authorizations for
the Transactions under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate with each other in connection with

46  proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) promptly inform the other
party of any substantive communication received by such party from, or given
by such party to, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of

communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, in each case regarding any of the Transactions contemplated
hereby, (iii) permit the other partys authorized Representatives to consult

valuation, pricing, and other competitively sensitive terms in the Contracts
of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries, (B) to remove
references concerning proposals from third parties with respect to the
Company, (C) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (C) as
necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns. Without
limiting the generality of the Buyer Parties undertaking pursuant to this
Section 4.4, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Parent shall have the principal responsibility for devising and
implementing the strategy for obtaining any necessary approvals, clearances,
and authorizations for the Transactions HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws,

_Section_ __ _ 4.4_, as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event
later than the Termination Date, and Parent shall take the lead in all
meetings and communications with any Governmental Authority in connection
with obtaining any necessary Antitrust Laws or competition clearances. All
expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses

 

(c) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and the Effective
Time, none of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall, and each of the Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall not permit any of their respective
Subsidiaries to, take any action or enter into any transaction, or any
agreement to effect any transaction (including by merger or acquisition),
that would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially hinder or materially
delay the ability of the parties to (i) obtain the expiration or termination
of the waiting period under the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Law
applicable to the Transaction or (ii) obtain any authorizations, consents,
orders, and approvals of any Governmental Authorities necessary for the
consummation of the Transactions.

 



47 (d) Without limiting the generality of the Buyer Parties undertaking pursuant
to this  _Section_ __ _ 4.4_, Parent agrees to defend through litigation on
the merits any claim under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation law
that is asserted in court by any Governmental Authority or any other party, in
order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order
or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent
the Closing from occurring prior to the Termination Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such litigation in no way limits the obligation of the
Parent to use its reasonable best efforts to close the Transactions prior to
the Termination Date.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
Parent and the Company shall, in order to permit the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.1(b)_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.1(c)_ as
promptly as practicable and advisable, (i) propose, negotiate, commit to,
effect and agree to, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the

have a similar effect, (ii) create, terminate, or divest relationships,
ventures, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or any of its

would limit Parents freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to

interests, product lines or properties of the Company, or its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ that any such sales, divestitures, licenses, holdings,
dispositions, restrictions, changes or similar effects are conditioned upon
and become effective only from and after the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
further, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall require
Parent or the Company to take, or cause to be taken, or commit to take, or
commit to cause to be taken, any divestiture, license, hold separate, sale
or other disposition, of or with respect to assets, businesses or product
lines of (x) Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or (y) the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, if in the case of clause (y), doing so will have or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the foregoing, in no event shall the
Company (and the Company shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to) propose,
negotiate, effect or agree to any such actions without the prior written
consent of Parent.

Section 4.5. _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect
to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Thereafter (unless and until
a Change of Recommendation has occurred in compliance with  _Section_ __ _
4.3(d)_ or this Agreement has been terminated), neither the Company nor the
Buyer Parties shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or
other public announcement (to the extent not previously issued or made in
accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or
the other Transactions without the prior written consent of the other party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
except as may be required by Law or by the applicable rules of any stock
exchange (in which case such party shall not issue or cause the publication of
such press release or other public announcement without prior consultation
with the other party).

 



48 Section 4.6. _Access and Reports_. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the
sharing of information, from the date hereof until the earlier of the
Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VI_
, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to, upon reasonable prior written notice, (a) afford to
Parent and Parents Representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours and without disruption of business to all of the Companys and its
Subsidiaries properties (including production facilities), books, Contracts,
commitments, records and correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or
electronic form), officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial
advisors and other Representatives, (b) use reasonable efforts to afford
Parent and Parents Representatives reasonable access to the facilities of the
Companys or its Subsidiaries suppliers that manufacture finished goods or
otherwise provide significant raw materials to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case during normal business hours, without disruption of
business, and subject to provision by Parent and such Representatives of
customary confidentiality undertakings and such other reasonable restrictions
and conditions that such suppliers may demand, and (c) the Company shall
furnish, or cause its Subsidiaries to, promptly furnish to Parent (i) a copy
of each report, schedule and other document filed or submitted by it pursuant
to the requirements of any securities Laws (and the Company shall deliver to
Parent a copy of each report, schedule and other document proposed to be filed
or submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of any securities
Laws not less than two (2) Business Days prior to such filing) and a copy of
any communication (including "comment letters") received by the Company from
the SEC concerning compliance with any securities Law and (ii) all other
information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business, properties and
personnel as Parent may reasonably request from time to time. Except for
disclosures permitted by the Confidentiality Agreement, Parent and Parents
Representatives shall hold information received from the Company pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 4.6_ in confidence in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation, or information received, pursuant
to this  _Section_ __ _ 4.6_ shall modify any of the representations and
warranties of the parties hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such
investigation or consultation shall not be conducted in such a manner as to
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any significant interference with the
prompt and timely discharge by such employees of their normal duties. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access
to or to disclose information where, in the reasonable good faith judgment of
the Company, such access or disclosure is reasonably likely to jeopardize any
work product or attorney-client privilege or contravene any Law or breach any
Contract to which the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party or by which they
are bound.

 

Section 4.7. _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions, (b) any Actions commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Company or
the Knowledge of Parent, as the case may be, threatened against, relating to
or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries
that relate to the Transactions, (c) the discovery of any fact or
circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which, causes or is reasonably likely to
cause (i) any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or (ii) a material failure of
the Buyer Parties, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, as the
case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition, or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied under this Agreement, in each case, if and
only to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy or failure would reasonably
be expected to

 



49  result in any of the conditions to the obligations of the Company or the
Buyer Parties, as applicable, set forth in _Article V_ not being satisfied at
the Closing or satisfaction of those conditions being materially delayed in
violation of any provision of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.7_ shall not (A)
cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any other provision of this
Agreement, (B) limit the remedies available to the party receiving such notice
or (C) result in any disclosure by the Company to be deemed to amend
or supplement the Company Disclosure Schedule or constitute an acceptance of
any exception to any representation or warranty; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to
any information provided under this _Section_ __ _ 4.7_. The parties agree
that the Companys and Parents respective compliance or failure of compliance
with this _Section_ __ _ 4.7_ shall not be taken into account for purposes
of determining whether the condition referred to in _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_, respectively, shall have been satisfied.

 

Section 4.8. _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent shall and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent authorized or permitted under
the NCBCA or other applicable Law, any individual who is now, or has been at
any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries
who is or was serving at the request of Company or any of its Subsidiaries as
a director, officer, manager, employee, fiduciary, agent or trustee (or
equivalent position) of another Person (collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ")
against any and all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including
attorneys fees and disbursements), fines, liabilities, judgments, and amounts
that are paid in settlement in any threatened (in writing) or actual claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or
administrative (each, a " _Claim_ "), based in whole or in part on, or arising
in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is
or was a director or officer of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or served
at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director,
officer, manager, employee, fiduciary, agent or trustee of another Person,
prior to the Effective Time, (ii) matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, including this Agreement and the Transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, or (iii) actions or omissions by an Indemnitees taken at
the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each of (i), (ii), and
(iii), collectively " _Indemnity Proceedings_ "), in each case, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at, or after the Effective Time; in each case,
to the same extent such Indemnitees are indemnified as of the date of this
Agreement by the Company pursuant to applicable Law, the Company Charter
Documents, and indemnification agreements in existence on the date of this
Agreement and the Subsidiary Documents (collectively, the " _D andO
Indemnification Agreements_"). To the extent permitted under the NCBCA or
other applicable Law, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to promptly advance all out-of-pocket expenses of each Indemnitee in
connection with any Indemnity Proceeding as such expenses (including
attorneys fees and disbursements) are incurred upon receipt from such
Indemnitee of a request therefor (accompanied by invoices or other relevant
documentation) in accordance with the procedures set forth in the DandO
Indemnification Agreements in existence on the date of this Agreement; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the director or officer of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to whom expenses are advanced undertakes, to the extent required
under the NCBCA or other applicable Law, to repay such advanced expenses to
the Surviving Corporation

 



50  if it is ultimately determined that such director, or officer is not
entitled to indemnification under applicable Law or the DandO Indemnification
Agreements. In the event any Indemnity Proceeding is brought against any
Indemnitee (and in which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnitee
hereunder), Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective
Subsidiaries shall cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to
defend against and respond thereto; _provided_ , that none of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in such Indemnity
Proceeding with respect to any Indemnitee unless such settlement, compromise
or consent includes a release of such Indemnitee from all liability arising
out of such Indemnity Proceeding or such Indemnitee otherwise consents in
writing.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, and
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, fulfill
and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
pursuant to: (i) each indemnification agreement in effect between any of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and any Indemnitee as set forth in  _Section_ __
_ 4.8(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule; and (ii) any indemnification
provision, expense advancement provision and any exculpation provision set
forth in the Company Charter Documents and the Subsidiary Documents in effect
on the date of this Agreement. The articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation and equivalent organizational documents of the Surviving
Corporations Subsidiaries shall contain the provisions with respect to
indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation from liability at least
as favorable as the indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation from
liability provisions set forth in the Company Charter Documents and the
Subsidiary Documents on the date of this Agreement, and, during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the Effective Time, such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that could adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any Indemnitee.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension
of the directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policies and the Companys existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_"),
in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6)
years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to
any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the
coverage provided under the Companys existing policies with respect to any
actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission,
neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such
capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated
hereby); _provided_ that the Company shall give Parent a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the selection of such "tail" policy and the
Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments
made by Parent with respect thereto. If the Company or the Surviving
Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall continue to maintain in
effect, for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date

 



51  hereof with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are
no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing
policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall purchase
comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than as provided
in the Company s existing policies as of the date hereof. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to, and in no event shall the Company be permitted to, without
Parents prior written consent, expend for the policies pursuant to this
section an aggregate premium amount in excess of 300% of the amount per annum
the Company paid in its last full fiscal year; _provided_ that if the
aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective
Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 4.8_: (i) are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Person who is now, or who
has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior
to the Effective Time, an Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her personal
representatives, (ii) shall be binding on Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and their respective successors and assigns, (iii) are in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such Person may have, whether pursuant to Law, Contract, any Company
Plan, the Company Charter Documents, the Subsidiary Documents, or otherwise
and (iv) shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be
terminated or modified in any manner so as to adversely affect any Indemnitee
without the consent of such Indemnitee.

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
respective successors or permitted assigns (each, an " _Indemnifying Party_
") (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of such Indemnifying Party assume all the
obligations of such Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.8_.
In addition, if upon or following any merger, consolidation or sale of assets
any Indemnifying Party is or becomes a direct or indirect Subsidiary of
another Person, the ultimate parent entity of such Indemnifying Party shall
guaranty the obligations of such Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 4.8_.

 

Section 4.9. _Shareholder Litigation_. From and after the date hereof, the
Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of any Actions
commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing to the
Company against the Company and/or its directors or executive officers
relating to this Agreement, the Merger and/or the other
Transactions contemplated hereby and shall keep Parent fully informed (to the
extent not inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under
applicable Law) regarding any such Action. Each of the Company and Parent
shall consult and cooperate with the other in connection with the defense or
settlement of any such Action. The Company shall not agree to any settlement
of any such Action (including derivative claims) without Parents prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 



52 Section 4.10. _Fees and Expenses_. Except as provided in  _Section_ __ _
4.4_ and _Article VI_ , all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees
or expenses, whether or not the Transactions are consummated.

Section 4.11. _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to
cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative
securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with that
certain No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding
such matters. 

Section 4.12. _NASDAQ Stock Market Delisting; Deregistration_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be
done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
applicable Laws and rule and policies of the NASDAQ Stock Market to enable
the de-listing by the Surviving Corporation of the Company Common Stock from
the NASDAQ Stock Market and the deregistration of the Company Common Stock
under the Exchange Act promptly after the Effective Time.

Section 4.13. _Benefits Matters_. Parent shall or shall cause the Company to
provide, with respect to the period beginning with the Effective Time and
ending on July 31, 2019, to each Company Employee who was employed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and remains
employed by the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries after
the Effective Time (each an " _Affected Employee_ " and, collectively, the "
_Affected Employees_ ") (other than any Company Employees covered by a
collective bargaining agreement), (i) base salary or wages, annual cash bonus
or cash incentive compensation opportunities and employee benefits that are in
the aggregate, no less favorable than the base salary or wages, annual cash
bonus or cash incentive compensation opportunities and employee benefits
(excluding the 2017 Enterprise Incentive Plan (but including the value of
other equity compensation), deferred compensation and stock purchase plans)
provided to each such Affected Employee by the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) severance
benefits that are no less favorable than benefits available in the programs
listed in Section 4.13(ii) of the Disclosure Schedule.

 

(a) Parent shall or shall cause the Company to provide that any employee
benefit plans of the Parent or any of its Affiliates in which
Affected Employees are entitled to participate following the Effective Time
(" _Parent Plans_ ") take into account for purposes of eligibility, vesting,
accrual and level of benefits (but not for benefit accruals under defined
benefit pension plans and eligibility for retiree health and welfare plans
and eligibility for retirement treatment under long-term incentive plans),
service by such Affected Employees as if such service were with Parent, to the
same extent such service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (except to the extent it would result in a
duplication of benefits for the same period of service).

 



53 (b) With respect to Parent Plans, Parent shall (i) cause there to be waived
for each Affected Employee any eligibility requirements or pre-existing
condition limitations or waiting period requirements to the extent it would
not then apply to an Affected Employee under the comparable plan of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) in determining any deductible, co-
insurance and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, during the calendar year in
which the Affected Employee commences participation in a Parent Plan, give
effect to amounts paid by such Affected Employees under similar plans
maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(c) With respect to Affected Employees, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Company to honor, fulfill and discharge the Companys and its Subsidiaries
obligations under all Company Plans, and all employment, change in control or
severance agreements entered into prior to the date hereof; _provided_ , that,
except as may be required to satisfy the obligation to provide severance
benefits pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.13(ii)_, the foregoing shall not limit
the ability of Parent, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, modify
or terminate any such agreements or Company Plans in accordance with their
terms. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of any Company Plan or any
agreement between an Affected Employee and the Company or any Subsidiary
containing a definition of "change in control" or "change of control", the
Closing shall be deemed to constitute a "change in control" or "change of
control."

(d) Parent agrees that, with respect to the annual cash incentive plans set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.13(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "
_Annual Incentive Plans_ "), it shall, or shall cause the Company, to pay each
participant in an Annual Incentive Plan (each an " _Incentive Plan
Participant_ ") who is employed by the Company on the Closing Date, the
prorated amount of each Incentive Plan Participants incentive opportunity, at
the target level of performance as of the Effective Time, with respect to the
portion of the performance period that occurs prior to the Closing Date, with
such payment to be made no later than the thirtieth day following the Closing
Date.

 

(e) Each cash performance award (each a " _Cash Performance Award_ ") granted
pursuant to the Companys 2015, 2016 or 2017 Long-Term Performance Incentive
Plan for Officers and Key Managers that is outstanding as of the date hereof
and which remains outstanding as of the Effective Time shall, as of

give the Company written notice of any (A) material breach or default by a
Debt Financing Source or any party to any definitive document related to the
Financing of the Debt Letters or any definitive document related to the
Financing, (B) actual or threatened withdrawal, repudiation or termination in

obligation of confidentiality. Parent shall not take any action, or fail to
take any action, that would result in, or that would reasonably be expected to
result in, a breach or default in, or a failure to satisfy, any Funds Certain
Provisions (as defined in the Debt Letters) under the Debt Letters. Parent
may amend, modify, replace, terminate, assign or agree to any waiver under the
Debt Letters without the prior written approval of the Company, _provided_ ,
that Parent shall not, without the Companys prior written consent,
permit any such amendment, replacement, modification, assignment, termination
or waiver to be made to, or consent to any waiver of, any provision of or
remedy under the Debt Letters which would (A) reduce the aggregate amount of
the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or
original issue discount) such that the aggregate funds that would be available
to Parent on the Closing Date, together with the other financial resources of
Parent, would not be sufficient to provide the funds required to be funded on
the Closing Date to consummate the Merger and to pay all fees and expenses
reasonably expected to be incurred in connection therewith and payable on the
Closing Date, or (B) impose new or additional conditions to the Financing or
otherwise amend, modify or expand any of the conditions to the Financing or
otherwise expand, amend, modify or waive any provision of the Debt Letters in
a manner that in any such case would reasonably be expected to (1) materially

satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) on the Closing Date, (2)
materially adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights
against the Debt Financing

 



56  Sources or any other parties to the Debt Letters or the definitive
agreements with respect thereto or (3) materially adversely affect the ability
of Parent to timely consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
may modify, supplement or amend the Debt Letters to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not
executed the Debt Letters as of the date of this Agreement to the extent that
the aggregate commitments of the Debt Financing Sources to provide the
Financing are not reduced as a result of any such modification, supplement or
amendment (it being understood and agreed that the aggregate amount of the
commitments will be reduced from time to time in accordance with the provision
of the Debt Letters). In the event that new commitment letters and/or fee
letters are entered into in accordance with any amendment, replacement,
supplement or other modification of the Debt Letters permitted pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 4.19(a)_, such new commitment letters and/or fee letters
shall be deemed to be the "Debt Letters" for all purposes of this Agreement
and references to "Financing" herein shall include and mean the financing
contemplated by the Debt Letters as so amended, replaced, supplemented or
otherwise modified, as applicable. To the extent that after giving effect to
any reduction in the Financing permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 4.19_, no
commitments remain outstanding under the Debt Letters, Parent may terminate
the Debt Letters. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any
amendment, modification, waiver or replacement of the Debt Letters. If funds
in the amounts set forth in the Debt Letters, or any portion thereof, become
unavailable, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event to (x) notify the Company
in writing thereof, (y) use reasonable best efforts to obtain Permanent
Financing (on terms and conditions that are not materially less favorable to
Parent, taken as a whole, than the terms and conditions as set forth in the
Debt Letters, taking into account any "market flex" provisions thereof)
sufficient to enable Parent to consummate the Merger and (z) use reasonable
best efforts to obtain a new financing commitment letter that provides for
such Permanent Financing and, promptly after execution thereof, deliver to the
Company true, complete and correct copies of the new commitment letter and
the related fee letters (in redacted form reasonably satisfactory to the
Persons providing such Permanent Financing removing the fee amounts, pricing
caps, the rates and amounts included in the "market flex" and other economic
terms that could not adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability or
termination of the Financing) and related definitive financing documents with
respect to such Permanent Financing. Upon obtaining any commitment for any
such Permanent Financing, such financing shall be deemed to be a part of the
"Financing" and any commitment letter for such Permanent Financing shall be
deemed the "Debt Letters" for all purposes of this Agreement. Parent shall
pay, or cause to be paid, as the same shall become due and payable, all fees
and other amounts that become due and payable under the Debt Letters.

year; provided, that the financial statements required to be delivered

statement under such Act on Form S-3 and (C) to the extent requested in
writing by Parent, provide to Parent reasonably available information for

prior to the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days after written notice thereof is

such breach would cause, or result in, the failure of any of the conditions
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_ to be
satisfied.

 

Section 6.5. _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.

of no effect with no liability to any Person on the part of any party hereto

Termination Fee, Parent Fee, or Regulatory Termination Fee pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.5_, (ii) subject to the limitations set forth in  _Section_
__ _ 6.5(f)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.5(g)_, no such termination shall relieve
any of the parties of liability for damages (which the parties acknowledge and

include the benefit of the bargain and/or premium lost by a companys
shareholders or equity holders, as applicable (taking into consideration all
relevant matters, including other combination opportunities and the time

consequence of an act undertaken or a failure to take an act by the breaching
party with the knowledge that the taking of such act or the failure to take
such act would cause a breach of this Agreement.

 



64 (b) In the event that:

 

(i) (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
either _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_ (Termination Date) or _Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_
(Company Shareholder Approval), or by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _
6.4(b)_ (Breach of Representation) as a result of a breach by the Company, (B)
any Person shall have publicly disclosed a bona fide Acquisition Proposal
after the date hereof and prior to such termination, which Acquisition

pursuant to Section 6.2(b), which Acquisition Proposal had not been withdrawn
prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting), and (C) within twelve (12) months
after such termination the Company shall have entered into a definitive
agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, which Acquisition
Proposal is subsequently consummated ( _provided_ , that for purposes of this
clause (C) the references to "20%" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal"
shall be deemed to be references to "50%"); or

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _
6.4(a)_; or 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _
6.3(a)_;

 

then the Company shall:

(A) in the case of clause (i) above, on the date on which the Company
consummates the Acquisition Proposal referred to in subclause (i)(C) above,
pay Parent the Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 6.3(c) _then Parent shall

such termination, pay or cause to be paid to the Company, in each case, an
amount equal to $198,600,000 (the " _Parent Fee_ "), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds (it being understood that in no event shall Parent
be required to pay Parent Fee on more than one occasion).

 



65 (d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to (1) _ Section 6.2(a)_ and, at the time of such termination, any
of the conditions set forth in Section 5.1(b) or Section 5.1(c) (if and only
if the applicable event giving rise to the failure of such condition
under Section 5.1(c) to be satisfied arises in connection with the failure of
any waiting period (or any extension thereof) applicable to the Transactions
to expire or be terminated or any approvals, consents or clearances be
obtained, in each case, under or in relation to the HSR Act), shall not have
been satisfied due to the refusal by Parent to divest, license, hold separate,
sell or otherwise dispose of any of the assets, businesses or product lines of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) _Section 6.2(c)_ (if, and only if,
the applicable Injunction arises in connection with the failure of any waiting
period (or any extension thereof) applicable to the Transactions to expire or
be terminated or any approvals, consents or clearances be obtained, in each
case, under or in relation to the HSR Act due to the refusal by Parent to
divest, license, hold separate, sell or otherwise dispose of any of the
assets, businesses or product lines of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries),
and at the time of such termination referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above,
the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 5.2(a) and Section 5.2(b)
(other than those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied other
than at Closing) shall have been satisfied or waived in accordance with this
Agreement, then Parent shall promptly, but in no event later than three (3)
Business Days after the date of such termination, pay or cause to be paid to
the Company, in each case, an amount equal to $50,000,000.00 (the "
_Regulatory Termination Fee_ "), by wire transfer of immediately available
funds (it being understood that in no event shall Parent be required to pay
the Regulatory Termination Fee on more than one occasion).

(e) The Buyer Parties and the Company acknowledge that the agreements
contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except for (i)
an order of specific performance as and only to the extent expressly
permitted by _Section_ __ _ 7.8_, (ii) any fraud or Willful Breach by the
Buyer Parties of this Agreement and (iii) the remedies available under the
Confidentiality Agreement, the parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree
that:

(i) The Companys receipt of Parent Fee pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.5(c)
_or Regulatory Termination Fee pursuant to Section 6.5(d), as the case may
be, together with the rights and remedies available to the Company in the
indemnification and reimbursement provisions of _Section_ __ _ 4.8_ (but
subject in all cases to the limitations set forth in this Agreement), shall
be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Company and its Subsidiaries against
the Buyer Parties and any of their respective former, current, or future
general or limited partners, shareholders, managers, members, directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates or agents (the " _Buyer Party Obligors_ ") and
the Debt Financing Sources for any loss suffered with respect to this
Agreement, the Transactions, the termination of this Agreement, the failure
of the Merger to be consummated or any breach of this Agreement by the Buyer
Parties.

(ii) In light of the difficulty of accurately determining actual damages with
respect to the foregoing, upon any such termination of this Agreement (A) the
payment of Parent Fee pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.5(c)_ or
Regulatory Termination Fee pursuant to Section 6.5(d), as the case may be,
which constitutes a reasonable estimate of the monetary damages that will be
suffered by the Company and its Subsidiaries by reason of breach or
termination of this Agreement, shall be in full and complete satisfaction of
any and all monetary damages of the Company and its Subsidiaries arising out
of or related to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby (including, any breach by the Buyer Parties), the termination of this
Agreement, the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and any claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any
such breach, termination or failure against the Buyer Party Obligors or the
Debt Financing Sources; and (B) after being paid such

 



66  amounts in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (x) none of the Buyer
Party Obligors or the Debt Financing Sources shall have any further liability
or obligation to the Company or its Subsidiaries relating to or arising out
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any such breach,
termination or failure and (y) in no event will the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, be entitled to seek to recover or obtain against any of the
Buyer Party Obligors or the Debt Financing Sources any other monetary damages,
any recovery or judgment in excess of Parent Fee or the
Regulatory Termination Fee, as applicable, or any other remedy based on a
claim in Law or in equity with respect thereto, including consequential,

or the Transactions (including, any breach by the Buyer Parties), the

an order of specific performance as and only to the extent expressly
permitted by Section 7.8 and (ii) any fraud or Willful Breach by the Company
of this Agreement, the parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that:

 

(i) Parents receipt of the Termination Fee from the Company pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer
Parties and their respective Affiliates against the Company, its Subsidiaries
and any of their respective former, current, or future general or limited
partners, shareholders, directors, officers, employees, managers, members,
Affiliates or agents (the " _Company Obligors_ ") for any loss suffered with
respect to this Agreement, the Transactions (including any breach by the
Company), the termination of this Agreement, the failure of the Merger to
be consummated or any breach of this Agreement by the Company.

(ii) In light of the difficulty of accurately determining actual damages

constitutes a reasonable estimate of the monetary damages that will be
suffered by the Buyer Parties by reason of breach or termination of this
Agreement shall be in full and complete satisfaction of any and all monetary
damages of the Buyer Parties arising out of or related to this Agreement, the
Transactions (including, any breach by the Company that is not a Willful
Breach), the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent

further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party.

 

Section 7.4. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written

assign, in their sole discretion and without the prior written consent of the
Company, any of or all of their rights, interests and obligations under this

shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its obligations hereunder.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon,

negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with _Section_ __ _
7.3_ without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters

Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof, shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or

exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court
therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery

may not be enforced in or by such courts. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, each of the parties hereto hereby consents to the service of
process in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.10_; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing herein shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process

respective Affiliates Representatives) arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the Debt Letters or the Financing shall be brought and determined
in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York and that any
such legal action or proceeding shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of New York without regard to the
conflicts of law rules of such State that would result in the application of

available in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York,
then any such 

 



70  legal action or proceeding may be brought in any federal court located in

of the parties hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the
aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its property, generally and

Each of the parties agrees not to commence any action, suit or proceeding
involving any Debt Financing Sources (or any of their respective Affiliates or
their or their respective Affiliates officers, directors, employees, agents
and representatives) relating thereto except in the courts described above in
New York, other than actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce
any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such court in New York as
described herein. Each of the parties further agrees that notice as provided
herein shall constitute sufficient service of process and the parties further
waive any argument that such service is insufficient. Each of the parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by
way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or
proceeding involving any Debt Financing Sources (or any of their respective
Affiliates or their or their respective Affiliates officers,
directors, employees, agents and representatives) arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, the Debt Letters or the Financing or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, (x) any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in New York as described herein for
any reason, (y) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction
of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of

Section 7.8. _Specific Enforcement_.

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in any court specified in _Section_ __ _ 7.7_,
without bond or other security being required, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The
parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific performance is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for
any such breach.

 



71 (b) Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
(i) the other party has an adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any
party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

 

Section 7.9. _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party to this Agreement will be
cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy contained in this
Agreement, at Law or in equity. The exercise by a party to this Agreement of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise by it of any other remedy.
