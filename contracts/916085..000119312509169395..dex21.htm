v STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of July 20,
2009 (the " _Effective Date_ "), is by and among Health Net, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), Health Net of the Northeast, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Seller_ "), Oxford Health Plans, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (" _Buyer_ "), and, solely with respect to _Section 8.16_,
UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, a Minnesota corporation (" _Guarantor_ ")
(each a " _party_ " and together, the " _parties_ "). 

WHEREAS, the Subsidiaries of Seller identified on _Schedule A_ (each an "
_Acquired Company_ " and together, the " _Acquired Companies_ ") and Health
Net Life Insurance Company, a California corporation (" _HN Life_ "), are
engaged in the Acquired Business.

WHEREAS, Buyer desires to directly purchase all of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of the Acquired Companies (other than that of Health Net of New
Jersey, Inc., which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of FOHP, Inc. (which is also
an Acquired Company)) as of the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Shares_ "),
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

WHEREAS, subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, on the Closing
Date, Buyer or its designated Affiliates shall enter into, and Seller or its
designated Affiliates shall enter into, the Business Transition Agreement and
the Administrative Services Agreements.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I.

PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE SHARES

Section 1.1 _Purchase and Sale_. At the Closing, on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Seller hereby sells, assigns,
transfers, conveys and delivers to Buyer, and Buyer hereby purchases, all of
the Shares, free and clear of all Liens, except for restrictions on transfer
imposed by the Securities Act and state securities laws.

Section 1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the provisions of _ARTICLE VI_ , the closing
of the purchase and sale contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ")
shall take place in Los Angeles, California at the offices of Latham and Watkins
LLP, at 10:00 a.m. Pacific time on the second Business Day after the date on
which each of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE V_ (other than conditions
that are satisfied by the delivery of documents or the payment of money at the
Closing) have been satisfied or waived by the party or parties entitled to the
benefit of such conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Closing may
occur at such other place, at such other time or on such other date as Parent
and Buyer may mutually agree. The date on which the Closing actually occurs or
is deemed to have occurred is hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing
Date_." Subject to the provisions of _ARTICLE VI_ , a partys failure to
consummate the purchase and sale provided for in this Agreement on the date
and time and at the place determined pursuant to this _Section 1.2_ will not
result in the termination of this Agreement and will not relieve any party of
any obligation under this Agreement. Section 1.3 _Closing Obligations_.

(a) At the Closing, Parent and Seller shall deliver, or cause its applicable
Subsidiary to deliver, to Buyer:

(i) certificates representing the Shares, duly endorsed (or accompanied by

(iii) a certificate, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer,
certifying that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are exempt
from withholding under Section 1445 of the Code;

(iv) a Transitional Trademark License Agreement, substantially in the form

(v) a Business Transition Agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto

(x) an executed Resignation and Release from each of the officers and
directors of each Acquired Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
resignations shall not terminate such individuals status as employees of
Parent, Seller or their respective Subsidiaries;



 

2 (xi) evidence, reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, that, subject to  _Section
4.8_, the Terminated Agreements have been terminated and all claims against
any Acquired Company or its Subsidiaries thereunder have been released;

(xii) a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of Parent, certifying that
(except as otherwise provided under _Section 4.8_) all indebtedness or
guarantees of indebtedness for borrowed money of the Acquired Companies owed
to financial institutions, Parent, Seller or other Persons has been paid in
full and all Liens on assets of the Acquired Companies securing such borrowed
money have been released prior to the Closing;

(xiii) an executed officers certificate as required in  _Section 5.2(c)_
herein; and

(xiv) a customary incumbency certificate, certified by an appropriate
executive officer of Parent and Seller, attesting to the authority of the
signatory on behalf of Parent and Seller of this Agreement and each other

(b) At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver, or cause its applicable Affiliates to
deliver, to Seller:

(i) An amount equal to (A) sixty million dollars ($60,000,000) (the " _Initial
Business Payment_ "), plus (B) the difference of two hundred ninety million
dollars ($290,000,000) minus the amount, if any, of the Estimated Closing
Adjusted Tangible Net Equity Deficit (such difference, the " _Estimated
Adjusted Tangible Net Equity Payment_ " and, together with the Initial
Business Payment, the " _Closing Payment_ "), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Seller in writing;

(ii) the Administrative Services Agreements;

(iv) the Business Transition Agreement; 

(v) the Non-Competition Agreement;

3 (viii) a customary incumbency certificate, certified by an appropriate officer

this Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which Buyer is a party;
and

(ix) an executed officers certificate as required in _Section 5.3(c)_
herein.

Section 1.4 _Post-Closing Payments_. The procedures for settlement of any
disputes relating to this _Section 1.4_ are set forth in _Section 1.5_
hereof.

(a) _Commercial Business Renewal Payments_.

(i) No later than ten (10) Business Days following the Closing Date, Seller
shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a schedule (the " _Initial Membership
Statement_ ") of Employer Groups (listing the name and tax identification
number of each Employer Group and listing covered individuals and dependents
(including covered and enrolled spouses, domestic partners and other
dependents)), as of (x) the earlier of the date that is ninety (90) days prior
to the Closing Date and December 31, 2009 and (y) as of the Closing Date,
covered under: (A) commercial Fully Insured Contracts to which any of the
Acquired Companies or HN Life (with respect to the Acquired Business) is a
party, and (B) commercial ASO Contracts to which any of the Acquired Companies
or HN Life (with respect to the Acquired Business) is a party, in both
cases (A) and (B), other than contracts with CMS or any Governmental Entity
for the provision of benefits to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. The
Initial Membership Statement shall also separately list the Employer Groups
for which an Acquired Company or HN Life (with respect to the Acquired
Business) has proposed to provide coverage or services under Fully Insured
Contracts or ASO Contracts pursuant to outstanding quotations (the "
_Outstanding Quotes_ ") made by such entities as of the Closing Date. Seller
may provide Buyer with an updated list of Outstanding Quotes, reflecting all
Outstanding Quotes as of the Closing Date, within thirty (30) days following
the Closing Date (the " _Outstanding Quote Statement_ "). Seller shall
include, with the Initial Membership Statement or any Outstanding Quote
Statement, documents reasonably necessary to verify such quotations and the
terms thereof. For purposes of this _Section 1.4(a)_, to the extent that an
Employer Group listed on the Outstanding Quote Statement accepts an
Outstanding Quote and enters into a Fully Insured Contract or ASO Contract
with an Acquired Company or HN Life (with respect to the Acquired Business)
within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date or, if such Outstanding
Quote is irrevocable, within the period during which the Outstanding Quote is
outstanding, such Employer Group and each individual that is a Commercial
Member of such Employer Group (such Employer Groups, " _Additional Quoted
Group(s)_ ") shall be listed on a Membership Renewal Statement and taken into
consideration in calculating the Membership Renewal Amounts to be paid to
Seller hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Employer Group with
fewer than fifty-one (51) eligible employees (under  



 

4  applicable Law) that accepts an Outstanding Quote within ninety (90) days
following the Closing Date shall also be considered an Additional
Quoted Group, regardless of whether Seller listed the applicable Outstanding
Quote on the Initial Membership Statement or an Outstanding Quote Statement or
whether Seller provides documents reasonably necessary to verify such
quotations and the terms thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, employees of
Seller and its Affiliates and their dependents shall not count as Commercial
Members, nor shall any individuals covered through the exercise of a COBRA or
state continuation coverage option or any individual covered pursuant to an
individual conversion option count as Commercial Members.

(ii) After the Closing Date and for all periods prior to and including the
second anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Transition Date_ "), Buyer
shall deliver to Seller, on each January 31 and July 31 and on the date that
is thirty (30) days after the Transition Date, a Membership Renewal
Statement. Each Membership Renewal Statement shall contain a calculation of
the Membership Renewal Amount as of the preceding December 31 or June 30 or as
of the Transition Date (each such date, a " _Membership Renewal Statement
Date_ "), as the case may be. To the extent that payment of a Membership
Renewal Amount causes the Net Business Payment Amount to exceed the amount of
the Initial Business Payment, Buyer shall pay such excess to Seller.

(iii) For purposes of this _Section 1.4(a)_:

(A) " _Commercial ASO Members_ " means covered individuals and dependents
under (1) commercial ASO Contracts to which any of the Acquired Companies or
HN Life (with respect to the Acquired Business) is party or (2) any
Transferred ASO Contract.

(B) " _Commercial Insured Members_ " means covered individuals and dependents
under Fully Insured Contracts to which any of the Acquired Companies or HN
Life (with respect to the Acquired Business) is party.

(C) " _Commercial Members_ " means Commercial ASO Members and Commercial
Insured Members.

(D) " _Fully Insured Contract_ " means a contract for the provision of a broad
spectrum of medical health benefits to an individual or group under which the
risk of loss is borne by the insurer (including contracts pursuant to which
the insured bears a portion of the risk through deductibles, co-payments or
other member cost-sharing features). For the avoidance of doubt, a contract
for the provision of secondary medical health benefits pursuant to a
"MedPrime" plan shall be considered to be a "Fully Insured Contract."



 

5 (E) " _Membership Renewal Statement_ " means an itemized list (by Employer
Group, listing covered individuals and dependents and their status as a
Commercial Insured Member or Commercial ASO Member), prepared as of the
applicable Membership Renewal Statement Date, of the cumulative number of
Commercial Members that meet all of the following criteria: (1) their
Employer Group was reflected on the Initial Membership Statement (including as
updated to include any Additional Quoted Groups); (2) they were not listed on
a previous Membership Renewal Statement; and (3) Buyer has directly Renewed
coverage for their Employer Group on a Legacy United Entity Plan.

(F) " _Membership Renewal Amount_ " means the sum of (1) $350 per Commercial
Member Renewed on a commercial Legacy United Entity Plan pursuant to a Fully
Insured Contract and (2) $50 per Commercial Member Renewed on a commercial
Legacy United Entity Plan pursuant to an ASO contract.

(G) " _Net Business Payment Amount_ " means (1) all Membership Renewal Amounts
previously paid (or calculated and not paid) by Buyer to Seller pursuant to
_Section 1.4(a)(iii)_, plus (2) the 2010 Estimated Medicare Revenue-Based
Payment Amount paid (or calculated and not paid) by Buyer to Seller pursuant
to  _Section 1.4(b)(iii)(A)_, if any, plus (3) the 2010 Buyer Medicare
Revenue True-Up Payment made (or calculated and not made) by Buyer to Seller
pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)(iii)(C)(1)_, if any, minus (4) the 2010
Seller Medicare Revenue True-Up Payment made (or calculated and not made) by
Seller to Buyer pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)(iii)(C)(2)_, if any, plus (5) the
2011 Estimated Medicare Revenue-Based Payment Amount made (or calculated and
not made) by Buyer to Seller pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)(iv)(A)_, if any,
plus (6) the 2011 Buyer Medicare Revenue True-Up Payment made (or calculated
and not made) by Buyer to Seller pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)(iv)(C)(1)_, if
any, minus (7) the 2011 Seller Medicare Revenue True-Up Payment made (or
calculated and not made) by Seller to Buyer pursuant to _Section
1.4(b)(iv)(C)(2)_, if any, minus (8) the 2012 Estimated United Product
Difference Amount made (or calculated and not made) by Seller to Buyer
pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)(iv)(D)(2)_, plus (9) the 2012 Estimated United
Product Difference Amount made (or calculated and not made) by Buyer to Seller
pursuant to  _Section 1.4(b)(iv)(D)(2)_, plus (10) the 2012 Buyer Opt-In
True Up Payment made (or calculated and not made) by Buyer to Seller pursuant
to _Section 1.4(b)(iv)(D)(3)(I)_, if any, minus (11) the 2012 Seller Opt-In

Medicare Revenue-Based Payment Amount paid (or  



 

6  calculated and not paid) by Buyer to Seller pursuant to _Section
1.4(b)(v)(E)_, if any, plus (13) the 2012 Buyer Medicare Revenue True-
Up Payment made (or calculated and not made) by Buyer to Seller pursuant to
_Section 1.4(b)(v)(G)(1)_, if any, minus (14) the 2012 Seller Medicare
Revenue True-Up Payment made (or calculated and not made) by Seller to Buyer
pursuant to  _Section 1.4(b)(v)(G)(2)_, if any, plus (15) the Medicaid
Revenue-Based Payment Amount paid (or calculated and not paid) by Buyer to
Seller pursuant to _Section 1.4(c)(iv)_, if any.

(H) " _Renew_ " or " _Renewed_ " means the enrollment (directly), in a
commercial Legacy United Entity Plan, of a Commercial Member of an Employer
Group that is listed on the Initial Membership Statement or is an Additional
Quoted Group (in each case, without regard to whether such Commercial Member
was listed on such Initial Membership Statement or an Outstanding
Quote Statement); _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to any such
Employer Group which, as of the date of the Initial Membership Statement, is
enrolled for the provision of health plan medical benefits pursuant to client
contracts with both Seller or its Affiliates, on one hand, and Buyer or its
Affiliates, on the other hand, "Renew" or "Renewed" means the enrollment, in a
commercial Legacy United Entity Plan, by a covered individual and his or her
enrolled dependents reflected on the Initial Membership Statement; _provided_
, _further_ , that, in the event any Employer Group that was not listed on the
Initial Membership Statement pursuant to _Section 1.4(a)(i)(x)_ or as an
Additional Quoted Group, and, immediately prior to enrollment with Seller or
its Affiliates, such Employer Group was enrolled for the provision of health
plan medical benefits pursuant to a client contract with Buyer or its
Affiliates, such Employer Group shall not be considered "Renewed" for
purposes of this _Section 1.4(a)_.

(b) _Medicare-Based Payments_.

(i) _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this _Section 1.4(b)_:

difference of $450,000,000 less Closing Adjusted Tangible Net Equity;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Closing Adjusted Tangible Net Equity is
greater than $450,000,000, then the Closing Adjusted Tangible Net Equity
Amount shall be $290,000,000. If the Estimated Adjusted Tangible Net Equity
Payment is greater than the Closing Adjusted Tangible Net Equity Amount, then
Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the Estimated Adjusted Tangible
Net Equity Payment less the Closing Adjusted Tangible Net Equity Amount. If
the Closing Adjusted Tangible Net Equity Amount is greater than the Estimated
Adjusted Tangible Net Equity Payment, then Buyer shall pay to Seller an
amount equal to the Closing Adjusted Tangible Net Equity Amount less the
Estimated Adjusted Tangible Net Equity Payment.

(iii) On the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to
Seller, an amount (the " _First Anniversary Adjusted Tangible Net Equity
Payment_ ") equal to:

0.5 multiplied by ((A) Closing Adjusted Tangible Net Equity less (B) the
Closing Adjusted Tangible Net Equity Amount less (C) any preceding Excess
Adjusted Tangible Net Equity Payments).

(iv) Subject to _Section 1.4(e)(ii)_, no later than five (5) Business Days
prior to the Transition Date, Seller, with the cooperation and assistance of
Buyer, shall prepare or cause to be prepared in good faith an unaudited
combined estimated income statement and estimated balance sheet for all
of the Acquired Companies as of and for the twelve (12) month period ended on
the Transition Date (the " _Estimated Final Combined Financial Statement_ ").
The Estimated  



 

20  Final Combined Financial Statement shall be for the same period used for the
Actual Final Combined Financial Statement, and shall include an estimated
Loss Reserve as provided in _Section 1.4(h)_. Seller shall promptly cause a
copy of the Estimated Final Combined Financial Statement to be delivered to
Buyer. Seller shall also deliver to Buyer, together with the Estimated Final
Combined Financial Statement, a calculation of the estimated Quarterly Net
Payment due from Buyer to Seller or from Seller to Buyer with respect to the
stub period beginning on the first day of the quarter in which the Transition
Date occurs and ending on the Transition Date, calculated in accordance with
_Section 1.4(e)_ (the " _Estimated Final Net Payment_ "). Each of the
Estimated Final Combined Financial Statement or Estimated Final Net Payment
shall be final and binding on the parties, and shall not be subject to any
dispute resolution process (including, without limitation, the provisions of
_Section 1.5_).

(v) On the Transition Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller, an amount (the "
_Second Anniversary Adjusted Tangible Net Equity Payment_ ") equal to:

(A) Closing Adjusted Tangible Net Equity less (B) the Closing Adjusted
Tangible Net Equity Amount less (C) the First Anniversary Adjusted Tangible

applicable Law and Governmental Entities, withdraws an amount of cash or
other assets from any of the Acquired Companies with a value greater than the
cumulative Adjusted Tangible Net Equity Payments made by Buyer as of the date
of any such withdrawal, Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount of any such
excess (any such payments, " _Excess Adjusted Tangible Net Equity Payments_
").

(e) _Profit and Loss Payments_.

(i) Subject to _Section 1.4(e)(ii)_, for the period beginning on the Closing
Date and ending on the Transition Date, no later than thirty (30) days
following the end of each quarter, Seller, with the cooperation and assistance
of Buyer, shall prepare or cause to be prepared an unaudited combined income
statement and balance sheet for all of the Acquired Companies as of and for
such quarter (each, a " _Quarterly Combined Financial Statement_ "). The first
Quarterly Combined Financial Statement shall be based on the stub period
beginning on the day after the Closing Date and ending on the last day of the
quarter in which  



 

21  the Closing occurs. In addition to the Quarterly Combined Financial
Statement for the final period, Seller, with the cooperation and assistance of
Buyer, shall prepare or cause to be prepared an unaudited combined actual
income statement and balance sheet for all of the Acquired Companies for the
twelve (12) month period ending on the Transition Date (the " _Actual Final
Combined Financial Statement_ "), and the Quarterly Net Payment reflected
thereon (which shall be for the stub period beginning on the first day of the
quarter in which the Transition Date occurs and ending on the Transition Date)
(the " _Actual Final Net Payment_ ") shall include an actual Loss Reserve as
provided in _Section 1.4(h)_. Seller shall promptly cause a copy of each such
Quarterly Combined Financial Statement and Actual Final Combined Financial
Statement to be delivered to Buyer along with a certificate of a duly
authorized officer of Parent certifying that such statement has been prepared
in good faith. The Quarterly Combined Financial Statements and the Actual
Final Combined Financial Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP,
consistently applied in accordance with the accounting policies and practices
used to prepare the unaudited combined financial statements of the Acquired
Companies as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008 insofar as such
accounting policies and practices are consistent with GAAP (except, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Quarterly Net Payments derived therefrom shall not
include any provisions or reserves for loss adjustment expenses in accordance
with  _Section 1.4(h_). Seller shall also deliver to Buyer, together with
each Quarterly Combined Financial Statement, a calculation of the Quarterly
Net Payment with respect to such period. Notwithstanding any requirements of
GAAP or any other provision of this Agreement, for the purpose of the
Quarterly Net Payment, the Actual Final Net Payment, and the Termination Date
Net Payment, it is the intent of the parties that net income and net loss as
reflected on the Quarterly Combined Financial Statements and the Actual Final
Combined Financial Statement shall: (A) include Fully Insured Contracts, ASO
Contracts, Medicare Revenue Contract (subject to the provisions of _Section
1.4(b)_ regarding profit and loss sharing, if applicable), and the NJ
Medicaid Contract (unless Buyer has made the Buyer Medicaid Election), (B) in
the case of net income, reflect any liabilities for Taxes of the Acquired
Companies during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the
Transition Date and (C) in the case of net loss, reflect the U.S. federal and
Connecticut income Tax benefit of any net losses incurred by the Acquired
Companies (excluding net losses incurred by Health Net Services (Bermuda)
Ltd.) during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the
Transition Date, in each case with such liabilities for Taxes or net losses
determined on a hypothetical basis by reference to the separate results of
each of the Acquired Companies.

(ii) Notwithstanding _Sections 1.4(d)(v)_ and _1.4(e)(i)_ , in the event that
all of the Administrative Services Agreements are terminated pursuant to
their terms prior to the Transition Date (the date of such termination, the "
_ASA Termination Date_ "), (A) the Estimated Final Net Payment shall be equal
to zero (0) for purposes of _Section 1.4(d)(v)(E)_ and _(F)_ and (B)
neither Seller nor Buyer shall be obligated to make any remaining payments
under _Section 1.4(e)(i)_. In  



 

22  lieu thereof, however, no later than thirty (30) days after the ASA
Termination Date, Seller, with the cooperation and assistance of Buyer,
shall prepare or cause to be prepared an unaudited combined estimated income
statement and estimated balance sheet for all of the Acquired Companies (the "
_Termination Date Combined Financial Statement_ "). The Termination Date
Combined Financial Statement shall be for the period commencing on the first
day following the last day of the period covered by any preceding Quarterly
Combined Financial Statement for which a Quarterly Net Payment has been made
(or, if no such payment has been made, the Closing Date) and ending on the
ASA Termination Date. The Termination Date Combined Financial Statement shall
be prepared based on the historical administrative costs of the Acquired
Companies, as adjusted to take into consideration the wind-down of the
Acquired Business as contemplated by the Transaction Documents. The
Termination Date Combined Financial Statement shall include an actuarially
determined provision for medical costs and loss adjustment expenses as of the
ASA Termination Date for all claims through the winding up and running out
period of the Acquired Business; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Termination
Date Combined Financial Statement shall not include any reserves for
Unreserved Claims or loss adjustment expenses related to such Unreserved
Claims (" _Termination Date Loss Reserves_ "). The amount of such Termination
Date Loss Reserves shall be calculated in accordance with GAAP, consistently
applied in accordance with the accounting policies and practices used to
prepare the unaudited combined financial statements of the Acquired Companies
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008, insofar as such accounting
policies and practices are consistent with GAAP. Net income and net loss as
reflected on the Termination Date Combined Financial Statement shall be
determined in accordance with the last sentence of _Section 1.4(e)(i)_.
Seller shall promptly cause a copy of the Termination Date Combined Financial
Statement to be delivered to Buyer within such thirty-day period, together
with a calculation of the Quarterly Net Payment with respect to such period
due from Buyer to Seller or from Seller to Buyer (the " _Termination Date Net
Payment_ ").

(iii) In the event that the 2011 Novation has occurred and Buyer has opted-out
of the 2011 Medicare Bid, no later than thirty (30) days following the end of
each quarter during the year ended December 31, 2011, Buyer shall prepare or
cause to be prepared an unaudited income statement for the Buyer Medicare
Affiliate, including actual GAAP revenues, medical costs, 2011 Operating
Costs and the corresponding net income or loss for the 2011 Medicare Revenue
Period attributable to the Medicare Revenue Contract (each, a " _2011 Buyer
Medicare Income Statement_ "). Buyer shall promptly cause a copy of each such
2011 Buyer Medicare Income Statement to be delivered to Seller along with a
certificate of a duly authorized officer of Buyer certifying that such
statement has been prepared in good faith. The 2011 Buyer Medicare Income
Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied in
accordance with the accounting policies and practices used to prepare the
unaudited combined financial statements of the Acquired Companies as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2008 insofar as such accounting policies and
practices are  



 

23  consistent with GAAP. Buyer shall also deliver to Seller, together with each
2011 Buyer Medicare Income Statement, a calculation of the 2011 Seller
Novated Medicare Profit (Loss) Portion with respect to such period.

(iv) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies to
segregate the cash and securities held by such entities into notional accounts
as set forth in this _Section 1.4(e)(iv)_. The Acquired Companies shall
administer and manage all of the cash and securities deemed to be included in
the notional accounts described below pursuant to Section 2.7 of the
Administrative Services Agreements and in accordance with the investment
policy attached as Schedule 2.7 of the Administrative Services Agreements.

(A) Prior to the Closing, Parent or Seller shall have caused the Acquired
Companies to have an amount equal to the Estimated Adjusted Tangible Net
Equity Payment in cash or cash equivalents. As of the Closing Date, the
Acquired Companies shall be deemed to have deposited into a notional account
of Buyer an amount of cash and cash equivalents held by the Acquired Companies
as of such date equal to the Estimated Adjusted Tangible Net Equity Payment
(the " _Buyer TNE Account_ "). After the Closing Date, each time that Buyer
makes an Adjusted Tangible Net Equity Payment, funds a Capital and Surplus
Deficiency or makes a payment under the last sentence of _Section
1.4(d)(ii)_, an additional amount of cash and cash equivalents held by the
Acquired Companies as of such date (as determined by Seller) equal to such
Adjusted Tangible Net Equity Payment, Capital and Surplus Deficiency funded
by Buyer or payment under the last sentence of _Section 1.4(d)(ii)_ shall be
deemed to be deposited into such Buyer TNE Account, and such amount shall be
deemed to be debited from the Seller Commercial Account. All interest income,
dividend income and realized capital gains or losses attributable to the
securities deemed to be held in the Buyer TNE Account shall be added to or
deducted from (as applicable) the amount deemed to be held in the Buyer TNE
Account. 

(B) All of the other cash, cash equivalents and securities of the Acquired
Companies (i.e., other than the cash and cash equivalents deemed to be
included in the Buyer TNE Account) shall be segregated into the " _Seller
Commercial Account_ " which shall be adjusted for each Adjusted Tangible Net
Equity Payment made by Buyer as described above. All interest
income, dividend income and realized capital gains or losses attributable to
the securities deemed to be held in the Seller Commercial Account until the
Transition Date shall be held for the benefit of Seller and thereafter for the
benefit of Buyer. In addition, after the Closing Date, each time that Parent
funds a Capital and Surplus Deficiency, an amount of cash, cash equivalents
and securities held by the Acquired Companies shall be deemed to be deposited
into the Seller Commercial Account. 



 

24 (C) Prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent or Seller shall
have caused the Acquired Companies to have, in cash or cash equivalents, an
amount equal to the First Anniversary Adjusted Tangible Net Equity Payment in
the Seller Commercial Account. Prior to the Transition Date, Parent or Seller
shall have caused the Acquired Companies to have, in cash or cash
equivalents, an amount equal to the Second Anniversary Adjusted Tangible Net
Equity Payment in the Seller Commercial Account. For the avoidance of doubt,
any realized capital gains or losses based on the actions described in this
subparagraph shall be attributable to the Seller Commercial Account.

(v) With respect to the Quarterly Net Payments other than the Actual Final
Net Payment:

(A) If the amount of the Quarterly Net Payment is a positive number, Buyer
will pay such amount to Seller.

(B) If the amount of the Quarterly Net Payment is a negative number, Seller
will pay the absolute value of such amount to Buyer.

(vi) With respect to the Actual Final Net Payment:

(A) If the Actual Final Net Payment is greater than the Estimated Final Net
Payment, then Buyer will pay the difference between the two amounts
to Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, such payment will not be based on the
absolute value of such amounts.

(B) If the Estimated Final Net Payment is greater than the Actual Final Net
Payment, then Seller will pay the difference between the two amounts to Buyer.
For the avoidance of doubt, such payment will not be based on the absolute
value of such amounts.

(vii) With respect to the Termination Date Net Payment:

(A) If the amount of the Termination Date Net Payment is a positive number,
Buyer will pay such amount to Seller.

(B) If the amount of the Termination Date Net Payment is a negative number,
Seller will pay the absolute value of such amount to Buyer.



 

25 (viii) If the sum of the Quarterly Net Payments, the Actual Final Net Payment
and the Termination Date Net Payment that are allocated to the Shares of the
Election Companies pursuant to Section 4.6(b) and Schedule F of this Agreement
is a negative number and thereby results in a net reduction to the purchase
price for the Shares of either of the Election Companies (as defined in
_Section 4.6(c)_) pursuant to _Section 4.6(b)_ and _Schedule F_ of this
Agreement (the " _Net P andL Purchase Price Reduction_"), then to the extent
the Election Companies basis in the Commercial Members for federal income
tax purposes, adjusted as provided in _Section 4.6(c)_ to reflect the Net PandL
Purchase Price Reduction (the " _Actual Member Tax Basis_ "), is less than
the federal income tax basis the Election Companies would have had in the
Commercial Members if the Buyer had only paid the greater of (i) the portion
of the Initial Business Payment allocated to the Election Companies or (ii)
the Membership Renewal Amount for each Commercial Member of the Election
Companies that Renewed (the " _Target Member Tax Basis_ "), Seller shall pay
to Buyer an amount equal to the net present value of: (1) 35% multiplied by
(2) the difference between (A) the Target Member Tax Basis and (B) the Actual
Member Tax Basis; _provided_ , _however_ , Seller shall not be required to pay
more than $5,000,000 (the " _Gross-Up Cap_ ") under this _Section
1.4(e)(vii)_. The net present value of the amount calculated in the previous
sentence shall be determined using a 10% discount rate and assuming that the
calculated amount would have been amortizable by Buyer over a period of 15
years beginning on the Closing Date. Subject to the Gross-Up Cap, Buyer shall
be paid on a fully grossed up basis in order to reflect the additional
adjustments to the Actual Member Tax Basis caused by the payment of
any amounts pursuant to this _Section 1.4(e)(vii)_. Buyer and Seller shall
work together in good faith to calculate the Actual Member Tax Basis, the
Target Member Tax Basis and any amount required to be paid by Seller to Buyer
pursuant to this  _Section 1.4(e)(vii)_. Seller shall pay Buyer any amount
required to be paid pursuant this _Section 1.4(e)(vii)_ as soon as
practicable following the Transition Date.

the amount of the 2010 Medicare Loss for the relevant period (if any), minus
(11) if applicable, the amount of the 2011 Buyer Non-Novated Medicare Profit

applicable, the amount of the 2011 Seller Novated Medicare Profit for the
relevant period, minus (14) if applicable, the amount of the 2011
Seller Novated Medicare Loss, minus (15) to the extent reflected in the
applicable Quarterly Combined Financial Statements, any amount received by

Acquired Company and provide written notice of such advance to Parent, and
Parent shall be liable to Buyer for the full Capital and Surplus Contribution
Amount actually funded by Buyer.

(j) _Timing of Payments_. Any payments pursuant to this _Section 1.4_ that
may be disputed pursuant to  _Section 1.5_ below shall be made promptly by
the party required to pay such amount, but in no event later than five (5)
Business Days following the final determination of such payment amount
pursuant to _Section 1.5_, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated by the recipient in writing.

Section 1.5 _Dispute of Payment Amounts_. Except with respect to disputes
governed under _Section 1.4(f)_, this _Section 1.5_ shall govern the
resolution of any disputes between the parties with respect to (i) the
preparation of the Initial Membership Statement, any Membership Renewal
Statement, the 2010 Medicare Actual Income Statement, the 2011 Medicare Actual
Income Statement, the 2012 Medicare Actual Statement of Revenues, the Medicaid
Statement of Revenues, the Closing Date Combined Balance Sheet, any Quarterly

the 2012 Actual Medicare Revenue-Based Payment Amount, the Medicaid Revenue-

").

(a) The receiving party (the " _Recipient_ ") shall have forty-five (45) days
following delivery of each applicable Calculation Statement to it (the "
_Objection Period_ ") to provide written notice (the " _Objection Notice_ ")
to the other party (the " _Preparer_ ") of any good faith objection to the
Calculation Statement, which objection shall be set forth with reasonable
detail in such Objection Notice; _provided_ , _however_ ,  



 

32  that, the Objection Period shall be sixty (60) days following delivery of
the Closing Date Combined Balance Sheet (i) with respect to the calculation
of the Closing Adjusted Tangible Net Equity and (ii) with respect to the
Actual Final Combined Financial Statement and the Termination Date Combined
Financial Statement; and _provided_ , _further_ , that, following the
final determination of Closing Adjusted Tangible Net Equity, neither the
First Anniversary Adjusted Tangible Net Equity Payment nor the Second
Anniversary Tangible Net Equity Payment may be objected to absent mathematical
error. The Preparer shall reasonably cooperate with the Recipient and shall
provide the work papers used by the Preparer or its representatives in
preparing the applicable Calculation Statement, as reasonably requested by the
Recipient. Unless the Recipient timely delivers an Objection Notice before
the expiration of the applicable Objection Period, the Calculation Statement
shall be deemed to have been accepted and approved by the Recipient and shall
thereafter be final and binding upon the Recipient for purposes of this
_Section 1.5_ (and any amounts to be paid pursuant to _Section 1.4_ hereof
shall thereupon be paid within five (5) Business Days). To the extent any
portion of a Calculation Statement shall not be expressly objected to, such
matters shall be deemed to have been accepted and approved by the Recipient
and shall be final and binding upon the Recipient for purposes hereof, and the
undisputed portion of any payments to be made with respect to such Calculation
Statement shall be made within five (5) Business Days in accordance with
_Section 1.4_. If the Recipient timely delivers an Objection Notice before
the expiration of the Objection Period, then those aspects of the applicable
Calculation Statement objected to in the Objection Notice shall not
thereafter be final and binding until resolved in accordance with this
_Section 1.5_.

(b) Following receipt of any Objection Notice, the parties shall discuss in
good faith the applicable objections set forth therein for a period of thirty
(30) days thereafter and shall, during such period, attempt to resolve the
matter or matters in dispute by mutual written agreement. If the parties reach
such an agreement, such agreement shall be confirmed in writing and the
applicable Calculation Statement prepared solely for purposes of
this Agreement shall be revised to reflect such agreement, which agreement
(and Calculation Statement, as so revised) shall thereafter be final and
binding upon the parties for purposes of this _Section 1.5_ (and any amounts
to be paid pursuant to _Section 1.4_ hereof shall thereupon be paid within
five (5) Business Days).

(c) If the parties are unable to reach a mutual agreement in accordance with
_Section 1.5(b)_ hereof during the thirty (30) day period referred to
therein, then the parties shall jointly select an office of
PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, Ernst and Young LLP or KPMG LLP or, with respect
to any dispute regarding the calculation of (i) Loss Reserves, Reden and Anders,
Ltd. or (ii) Termination Date Loss Reserves, Milliman, Inc. or another
independent, nationally recognized actuarial firm mutually acceptable to the
parties (as applicable, the " _Independent Expert_ "), who, acting as an
expert and not as an arbitrator, shall resolve those matters still in dispute
with respect to the applicable Calculation Statement in accordance with this
_Section 1.5_. If the parties fail to agree on an Independent Expert within
five (5) Business Days after the expiration of the thirty (30) day period,
either party may request the American  



 

33  Arbitration Association to appoint such an Independent Expert (or another
accounting firm if any of the accounting firms named above decline to or
are disqualified from accepting the dispute), and such appointment shall be
conclusive and binding upon the parties. The Independent Experts resolution
of the matters in dispute, including any adjustments to the applicable
Calculation Statement made by the Independent Expert, shall be final and
binding on the parties (and any amounts to be paid pursuant to _Section 1.4_
hereof shall thereupon be paid within five (5) Business Days). Within twenty
(20) days of the appointment of the Independent Expert, each party shall
deliver a written presentation of its position to the Independent Expert and
the other party, and the parties will then have fifteen (15) days to prepare a
written response to the other partys presentation. The Independent Expert
may also request written responses from the parties to specific questions at
any time, which shall be delivered to the Independent Expert and the other
party. The Independent Expert shall make a determination as soon as
practicable and in any event within sixty (60) days (or such other time as the
parties shall agree in writing) after its engagement. Notwithstanding anything
set forth in this _Section 1.5_, the scope of any dispute to be resolved by
the Independent Expert pursuant to this _Section 1.5_ shall be limited to
whether the applicable Calculation Statement was prepared in accordance with
the policies and practices required under  _Section 1.4_, or whether there
were mathematical errors in the applicable Calculation Statement or the
calculation of any measures therein, and, except for the foregoing matters,
the Independent Expert shall not make any further determination. In resolving
any disputed item, the Independent Expert may not assign a value to any
particular item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by any
party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by any party, in
each case as presented to the Independent Expert. Each party agrees to
cooperate with the other parties and with the Independent Expert to resolve
any dispute.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, including without
limitation any provision stating that remedies shall be cumulative and not
exclusive and any provisions for indemnification, this _Section 1.5_ provides
the sole and exclusive method for resolving any and all disputes of each and
every nature whatever that may arise between or among the parties with
respect to the Calculation Statements or any amount reflected thereon or
calculated therefrom or required to be reflected thereon or calculated
therefrom (other than the calculation of Buyer Costs under _Section 1.4(e)_).
As between the parties, Seller and Buyer hereby irrevocably waive, relinquish
and surrender on their own behalf and on behalf of their respective Affiliates
and representatives all rights to, and agree that they will not attempt, and
shall cause their Affiliates and representatives not to attempt, to, resolve
any such dispute or disputes in any manner other than as set forth in this
_Section 1.5_, including without limitation through an indemnification claim
or litigation. Seller and Buyer further agree on their own behalf and on
behalf of their respective Affiliates and representatives that if one or more
of them should initiate any attempt to resolve any such dispute or disputes in
any manner other than the sole and exclusive manner set forth in this
_Section 1.5_, such initiators shall pay and reimburse all fees, costs and
expenses incurred by any other party as a result of, in connection with or
related to such attempt or attempts. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event
that the  



 

34  Independent Expert declines to resolve any disputes regarding the
calculation of Buyer Costs under _Section 1.4(e)_, such disputes may be
resolved in accordance with _Section 8.6_. Nothing in this _Section 1.5(d)_
shall prohibit Buyer from exercising its right of offset in _Section 7.3_.

(e) Each party shall bear the fees and expenses of its respective independent
certified public accountants incurred in performing services pursuant to this
_Section 1.5_. If the Independent Expert is selected to resolve differences
between the parties in accordance with _Section 1.5_, Buyer, on the one hand,
and Seller and Parent, on the other hand, shall each pay one-half of the fees
and expenses, including any retainers, of such firm in performing services
pursuant to this _Section 1.5_.

Section 1.6 _Closing Costs; Transfer Taxes and Fees_. Parent shall be
responsible for and shall pay (a) all documentary, sales, use, stamp and
transfer Taxes and any other Taxes or fees imposed by reason of the transfer
of the Shares provided hereunder (and any deficiency, interest or penalty
asserted with respect thereto) and, at its expense, file any associated Tax
Returns; and (b) all recording, filing, title and registration fees or other
charges in connection with or as a direct result of the transfer of the
Shares. Each party shall be responsible for its own costs incurred in
connection with applying for new Permits and obtaining the transfer of
existing Permits which may be lawfully transferred.

cause HN Life and the Acquired Companies to afford Buyer and its
Representatives (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) reasonable
access during normal business hours to all of the properties, executive
personnel, Contracts and Other Agreements and other books and records of the
Acquired Companies and HN Life (to the extent that such books and records
relate to the Acquired Business) and shall promptly deliver or make available,
or cause to be delivered or made available, to Buyer such other information
concerning the business, properties, assets and executive personnel of the
Acquired Companies and HN Life (to the extent that such information relates to
the Acquired Business) as Buyer may from time to time reasonably request;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Buyer and its Representatives shall provide
Parent with reasonable advance notice and obtain Parents consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) before contacting any executive
personnel of Parent, HN Life or the Acquired Companies and (ii) Parent shall
not be required to (or cause its Subsidiaries, HN Life or any of the Acquired
Companies to) afford such access or furnish such information to the extent
that doing so would result in the loss of attorney-client privilege. Buyer
shall hold, and shall cause its representatives to hold, all Evaluation
Material and Highly Confidential Evaluation Material (each as defined in
the Confidentiality Agreement) in confidence in accordance with the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement and otherwise comply with the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement (including, without limitation, with respect to the
treatment of Highly Confidential Evaluation Material). In the event of the
termination of this Agreement for any reason, Buyer promptly shall return or
destroy all Evaluation Material and all Highly Confidential Evaluation
Material in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.
Between the Effective Date and the Closing Date, Parent and Seller shall
deliver to Buyer the final monthly unaudited consolidated balance sheets and
statements of income of the Acquired Companies that are prepared by Parent or
its Affiliates in the ordinary course of business.

(b) Following the Closing Date, each party, in addition to its obligations
pursuant to the Administrative Services Agreements, shall allow the other
party, upon reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours, through
its Affiliates, employees and representatives, (x) the right to examine and
make copies, at its expense, of the books and records relating to the
Acquired Business, and (y) reasonable access to its employees, in the case of
either clause (x) or (y), for any reasonable purpose relating to the business
of the Acquired Business or the Acquired Companies, including, without
limitation, the preparation or examination of Tax Returns, regulatory and
statutory filings and financial statements and the conduct of any litigation
or otherwise, or the conduct of any regulatory, policyholder, client or other
dispute resolution whether pending or threatened. Each party shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, maintain the books and records of the Acquired
Business for examination and copying by the other party for a period of not
less than six (6) years following the Closing Date or any longer period as
mandated by applicable Law or  



 

56  contract, after which, each party may destroy such records in its
discretion. Access to such records shall not unreasonably interfere with the
business operations of the party granting access.

(c) Except as set forth in Section 9.1(d) of the Administrative
Services Agreements, Buyer (on behalf of itself, its Affiliates and, after
the Closing Date, the Acquired Companies) agrees that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the Transaction Documents,
neither Buyer nor its Affiliates (including, after the Closing Date, the
Acquired Companies) shall have access to the Caremark Agreement (other than
the Pharmacy Benefits Services Agreement between Health Net Pharmaceutical
Services, Health Net of New York, Inc. and CaremarkPCS Health, L.P., dated
November 28, 2007, as amended, excluding Addendum A thereto). Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that the agreements between each Acquired Company and
Health Net Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. or MHN Services, Inc. with respect
to pharmacy benefit management services (including mail order, retail
network, claims processing, specialty pharmacy and other administrative
services) (collectively " _PBM Services_ ") and behavioral health services,
respectively, are expected to remain in effect as of the Closing Date with
such amendments as are necessary to effectuate the purposes of each
Administrative Services Agreement and this Agreement. After the Closing Date,
Seller shall administer such agreements substantially in the same manner as
such contracts were administered prior to the Closing Date. Seller represents
that all agreements for PBM Services that are in effect as of the Closing
Date, or that are entered into by Seller on behalf of each of Acquired
Company after the Closing Date, contain competitive information that is
confidential to the vendor, manufacturer, and other third parties (each a "
_Third Party_ ") and to Sellers Affiliates. Seller represents
that disclosure of pricing or other confidential or competitive information
directly to each Acquired Company or its Affiliates could result in
termination of such agreements or allegations of breach by any such Third
Party, or otherwise result in a loss of competitive pricing and terms for
each Acquired Company. Seller and each Acquired Company agree to cooperate to
obtain permission from such Third Parties to provide limited personnel of each
Acquired Company with access to a redacted version of any such agreements for
PBM Services, solely on a need-to-know basis; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the failure to obtain the permission of any such Third Party shall not excuse
the performance of each Acquired Companys obligations under the applicable
Administrative Services Agreement or otherwise constitute a breach by Seller
of its obligations under such Administrative Services Agreement. Each Acquired
Company may confirm that it is receiving the benefit of the PBM Services by
engaging an independent auditor reasonably acceptable to Seller, to perform a
confidential review of such agreements of which such Acquired Company is not a
party. Prior to performing the confidential review, the independent auditor
shall enter into a confidentiality agreement, reasonably acceptable to Seller
and the applicable Third Party.

4.3(f)_), each party will use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to

4.3(f)_, each party further agrees to take, or cause to be taken, all other
actions reasonably necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other Regulatory Law as

any other Regulatory Law or enter into any agreement with a Governmental

as promptly as practicable and advisable, to respond to any inquires received
and supply as promptly as practical any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested and to take all other actions reasonably
necessary to cause approval to be obtained from the relevant Governmental
Entities.

connection with each partys obligations under _Section 4.3(a)_, _Section
4.3(b)_ and _Section 4.3(c)_, subject to _Section 4.3(f)_, and to the
extent permissible under applicable Law, each party shall use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate with each other in connection with
any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other
inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) promptly
inform the other parties of any communication received by such party from, or
given by such party to, any Governmental Entity and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
(iii) permit the other parties, or their legal counsel, to review any
communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any
meeting or conference with, any Governmental Entity or, in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, with any other Persons, (iv) give the
other parties the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and

attending any meetings or conferences, keep the other promptly and reasonably
apprised with respect thereto and (vi) cooperate in the filing of any
memoranda, white papers, filings, correspondence, or other written

(e) Subject to _Section 4.3(f)_, if necessary to obtain any regulatory

is formally commenced) with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
under any Regulatory Law or other applicable Law, or if any suit or
proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, is instituted by
any Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any of the

promptly respond to any inquiry or investigation by any Governmental Entity
regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, (ii) oppose or defend against any Action brought by any

59  entry of, or have vacated, overturned or terminated, any order or judgment
preventing consummation of this Agreement (and the transactions
contemplated herein), and/or (iv) take such action as reasonably necessary in
order to resolve any such objections or challenge as such Governmental Entity
or private party may have to such transactions under such Regulatory Law, or
other applicable Law, so as to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to the
terms of a joint defense agreement, if applicable, each party shall cooperate
with the other parties in connection with all proceedings related to the
foregoing and Buyer shall have sole discretion and final decision making
authority to initiate and/or agree to any resolution pursuant to provision
(iv) of this subparagraph (e) above at any time;  _provided_ , _further_ ,
that any such decision taken by Buyer to resolve any such matters pursuant to
provision (iv) of this subparagraph (e) shall not (x) effect Buyers
obligation to make the Closing Payment and the payments described in _Section
1.4_ herein in the amounts set forth herein or (y) without the prior written
consent of Parent, materially increase the obligations to be performed or the
cost and expense of performance, by Parent, Seller or their respective
Subsidiaries under this Agreement or the Transaction Documents.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in connection
with obtaining the necessary approvals or clearances described in this
_Section 4.3_, (i) no party nor any of its Affiliates shall (x) be required
to sell, hold separate or otherwise divest or dispose of any assets or its
business, in a specified manner, or (y) permit the sale, holding separate or
other divestiture or disposition of, any assets or business, in a specified
manner; (ii) in no event shall Buyer or its Affiliates be required to (A) pay

required to agree to such matters, (B) agree not to compete in any geographic
area or line of business, or materially restrict the manner in which,
or whether, Buyer, the Acquired Companies, or any of their Affiliates may
carry on business in any geographic area, or (C) agree to any condition or
provision that would, or would be reasonably likely to, prevent Buyer from
renewing the Acquired Business on a Legacy United Entity Plan in accordance
with this Agreement and the Transaction Documents or would have a material
adverse effect on the Acquired Business, taken as a whole; and (iii) Buyer and
its Affiliates shall be permitted to acquire any Equity Interest in, acquire
all or substantially all of the assets of, merge, consolidate, enter into a
share exchange or business combination, or enter into any other similar

Section 4.4 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Seller shall give written
notice to Buyer, and Buyer shall give written notice to Seller, promptly upon
becoming aware of any occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which
occurrence or failure to occur has caused, or could reasonably be expected
to cause, any condition to the obligations of any party as set forth under
_ARTICLE V_ to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to
be satisfied. In the event that Seller provides Buyer with a written notice
stating that any representation or warranty  



 

60  made under _ARTICLE II_ of this Agreement was when made, or has subsequently
become, untrue in any respect, Seller shall provide such written notice to
Buyer via written update to the Seller Disclosure Schedule, _provided_ that,
for purposes of determining the fulfillment of the condition precedent set
forth in _Section 5.2(b)_, no such update shall be given effect except for

without the consent of the other, except where such release is required by
applicable Law or pursuant to the rules or regulations of any
securities exchange or any other regulatory requirements. _Schedule 4.5_
sets forth the representatives of Buyer and Seller authorized to provide the
consent contemplated by the preceding sentence. Without limiting the
obligations of the parties or their Affiliates under the Transaction
Documents, each party agrees to cooperate with each other party to develop and
implement a plan with respect to the communication of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents to members,
Employer Groups, brokers and providers of the Acquired Business.

Parent shall deliver the Tax Returns described in this  _Section 4.6(a)(i)_
to Buyer for its review, comment, and approval. Parent shall make all such
changes as are reasonably requested by Buyer, and shall deliver the Tax
Returns, completed as approved by Buyer and duly executed by an authorized
person, to the Buyer no later than ten (10) days prior to the due date
(including extensions) for filing such Tax Returns. Buyer shall file or cause
to be filed all such Tax Returns on or prior to the due date (including

61 (ii) _Tax Periods Ending on or Prior to the Closing Date  Consolidated
Tax Returns_. For all Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date,
Parent shall cause the Acquired Companies to join in any consolidated, unitary
or combined Tax Return of Parent, and Parent shall timely pay any such Taxes

practice complies with applicable Law. 

(iii) _Tax Information_.

shall deliver the Deferred Tax Inventory of the Acquired Companies as of the
Closing Date and pro forma federal and state income Tax Returns (or similar
documentation) to support such inventory.

Net Equity and the preparation of the Closing Date Combined Balance Sheet
pursuant to _Section 1.4(d)(ii)_, Parent shall provide, in addition to any

1.4(e)(ii)_.

(iv) _Straddle Periods_. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file

shall deliver the Tax Returns described in this _Section 4.6(a)(iv)_ to
Parent for its review, comment and approval. Buyer shall make all changes with
respect to Straddle Returns as are reasonably requested by Parent. Parent
shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the Taxes due as reflected on such

respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and to the extent such Taxes are not
included or reflected on the Closing  



 

62  Date Combined Balance Sheet, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the
due date (including extensions) for filing such Straddle Returns. All
Straddle Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practices
of Parent, to the extent such past practice complies with applicable Law.
Where Taxes involve a Straddle Period, such Taxes shall be calculated as
though the taxable year of the Acquired Company terminated as of the close of
business on the day preceding the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in the case of a Tax not based on income, receipts, proceeds, profits or
similar items, Taxes shall be equal to the amount of Tax for the taxable
period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of
days from the beginning of the taxable period through to the Closing Date and
the denominator of which shall be the number of days in the taxable period.

(v) _Amended Tax Returns_. After the Closing Date, Buyer, to the extent
permitted by Law, shall have the right to amend, modify or otherwise change
all Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies, other than Tax Returns described in
_Section 4.6(a)(ii)_, for all Tax periods; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
such amendment, modification or change that has the effect of increasing the
Acquired Companies Tax liability for any Tax period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date (other than an amendment, modification or change required by
applicable Tax Laws or to correct a material misstatement of fact) shall not
be made without the prior written consent of Parent, which written consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(vi) _Dispute Resolution_. If there is disagreement between Buyer and Parent
as to whether a change to any Tax Return is "reasonably requested" for
purposes of this _Section 4.6(a)_ and _Section 4.6(g)_, Buyer and Parent
shall act in good faith to resolve any such dispute prior to the date on which
such Tax Return is required to be filed. In the event Buyer and Parent are
unable to resolve any dispute in good faith, Buyer and Parent shall mutually
request the Independent Expert to resolve any issue in dispute. The fees,
costs and expenses of the Independent Expert shall be allocated equally
between the Buyer and Parent.

(b) _Purchase Price Allocation_. The consideration paid by Buyer to
Seller pursuant to this Agreement shall be allocated among the Acquired

Buyer in making the election provided for by Section 338(h)(10) of the Code
and Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 of the Treasury regulations and any comparable
election under state, local or foreign Tax Law (the " _Section 338(h)(10)
Election_"). Buyer and Parent shall cooperate fully in making the Section
338(h)(10) Election, including the filing of all required IRS forms and
related forms under state, local or foreign Tax Law. Prior to the Closing
Date, Buyer shall prepare an IRS Form 8023 with respect to each of the
Election  



 

63  Companies, which shall be attached hereto as _Schedule 4.6(c)_. On the
Closing Date Parent shall execute and deliver the fully completed Forms 8023
to Buyer. Buyer shall file the Forms 8023 on or prior to the due date for
filing such Forms 8023. The Closing Payment with respect to the Election
Companies shall be allocated among the assets of the Election Companies in
accordance with Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Allocation"). The Allocation shall be
delivered by Parent to Buyer within 60 days after the Closing Date for Buyers
approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Parent and Buyer
shall work in good faith to resolve any disputes relating to the Allocation.
If Parent and Buyer are unable to resolve any such dispute within 30 days
after Buyers receipt of the Allocation, such dispute shall be resolved by
the Independent Expert, the costs of which shall be borne equally by each
party. Buyer, Parent and their Affiliates shall file their respective Tax
Returns (including IRS Form 8883) in all respects and for all
purposes consistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Election and the Allocation
and no party shall take any position (whether in audits, Tax Returns or
otherwise) that is inconsistent with the making of the Section 338(h)(10)
Election or the Allocation with respect to each of the Election Companies
unless required to do so by applicable Law. If the consideration paid by Buyer
to Seller pursuant to this Agreement is adjusted in any manner as provided in
this Agreement, the Allocation shall be adjusted as mutually agreed by Buyer
and Seller to reflect such adjustments to the consideration paid pursuant to
this Agreement.

(d) _Tax Disputes_.

(i) Within ten (10) Business Days after Buyer or the Acquired Companies
receives written notice of any Tax contest, audit or other proceeding
relating to any Taxes for which Seller has an indemnification obligation
pursuant to _Section 7.1_ (each a " _Tax Contest_ "), Buyer will notify
Parent in writing of such Tax Contest. Parent shall have thirty (30) days
after receipt of such notice to elect to undertake, conduct, and control
(through counsel of its own choosing and at its own expense) the settlement or
defense thereof, and Buyer and the Acquired Companies and their respective
Affiliates shall cooperate in connection therewith as reasonably requested by
Parent. If within thirty (30) days after the receipt of Buyers notice Parent
does not notify Buyer that Parent elects (at its cost and expense) to
undertake the defense thereof, or gives such notice and thereafter fails to
contest such claim in good faith, Buyer shall have the right to contest,
settle, or compromise such claim and Buyer shall not thereby waive any right
to indemnity for such claim under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that none of Buyer or the Acquired Companies shall pay or settle any such
claim without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Buyer shall have the right to
participate in any Tax Contest which is reasonably expected to have the effect
of increasing Buyers or the Acquired Companies Tax liability for any Tax
period ending after the Closing, and Parent shall not settle or compromise
any such Tax Contest without Buyers prior written consent, which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ , _further_ , that Buyer
shall consent to any settlement or compromise if Parent fully indemnifies
Buyer for any increase in Buyers or the Acquired Companies Tax liability.



 

64 (ii) Notwithstanding _Section 4.6(d)(i)_, Parent shall control and be
solely responsible for the audit, other administrative proceeding or inquiry
or judicial proceeding involving the consolidated income Tax Return of Parent.
Without the written consent of Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, Parent shall not settle any such audit or proceeding to the extent
such settlement would increase any Tax liability of the Acquired Companies for
any Tax period ending after the Closing Date. Except as set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall have the sole discretion to
settle any audit, other administrative proceeding or inquiry or judicial
proceeding involving the consolidated income Tax Return of Parent.

(e) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All tax-sharing or similar agreements with
respect to or involving any Acquired Company shall be terminated as of the
Closing Date, and after the Closing Date the Acquired Companies shall not be
bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

(f) _Cooperation_. Parent, Buyer, and the Acquired Companies shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other parties, in
connection with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this
_Section 4.6_ and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes. Such cooperation shall include signing any Tax Returns, amended Tax
Returns, claims or other documents necessary to settle any Tax controversy,
the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records
and information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Such cooperation shall be provided as soon as
reasonably possible and without undue delay.

(g) _Unified Loss Rule Election_. If any of the Shares are "loss shares" for
purposes of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36 after taking into account
the effects of all applicable rules of law, including any adjustments under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36(b), (c), or (d)(5)(iii), then Parent
shall elect pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(A) to
reduce a portion of Parents Tax basis in the Shares of the relevant Acquired
Company by an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the amount of such loss
over the total amount of such Acquired Companys "Category A," "Category B,"
"Category C" assets (as defined in Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-36(d)(4)) and Class VI and Class VII assets (as defined in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.338-6(b)(2)) of "Category D" assets, taking into
account the Closing Payment, the post-closing payments described in _Section
1.4_, and any other adjustments resulting from a final determination of the
application of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36. If Parent is required
by this _Section 4.6(g)_ to make such an election, no later than thirty (30)
days prior to the due date (including extensions) for filing Parents U.S.
federal consolidated income Tax Return, Parent shall deliver a fully
completed "Section 1.1502-36 Statement" (as defined in, and in  



 

65  the form and manner prescribed by, Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-36(e)(5)) to Buyer for its review, comment, and approval, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Parent shall make all such changes
as are reasonably requested by Buyer, and shall file the "Section 1.1502-36
Statement" with Parents timely filed U.S. federal consolidated income Tax
Return. 

Section 4.7 _Consents_.

(a) To the extent that the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the performance by Seller of its obligations under the
Transaction Documents require the consent or approval of a third party to any
Contract or Other Agreement with any Acquired Company, Parent and/or Seller
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, and/or to cause such
Acquired Company to obtain, such consents or approvals. Buyer and Seller
further agree that, although Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other
in attempting to obtain all such consents and approvals, any failure to obtain
any consents by Parent or Seller shall not constitute a breach of this
Agreement by Parent or Seller, so long as it has met the standard in the
previous sentence. All administrative costs and expenses (including, by way of
example, document preparation and expenses of mailing) in connection with
obtaining the consents contemplated by this  _Section 4.7_ shall be borne by
Seller. In no event shall any of Buyer, Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries be obligated to disburse any funds as a result of assessments or
requirements of another party to any such Contract or Other Agreement in
order to obtain such consents.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, prior to the Closing, Seller shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause HNNY to assign or transfer each
of the Touchstone Agreements to Seller or another Subsidiary of Parent (other
than an Acquired Company), subject to the receipt of any required consents or
approvals from Touchstone and its Affiliates or a Governmental Entity.
Between the Effective Date and the Closing Date, Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such consents or approval in accordance with (and
subject to)  _Section 4.7(a)_. In the event that Seller does not obtain such
consents or approvals prior to the Closing, from and after the Closing, Buyer
shall, or shall cause HNNY to, promptly pay to Seller any amounts received
from Touchstone or its Affiliates under the Touchstone Agreements by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller in
writing. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) any such amounts shall be independent
of (and shall neither increase nor decrease) any payment made under _Section
1.4_ or (ii) if the Touchstone Agreements are not assigned or transferred
prior to the Closing, no receivables or other amounts related to the
Touchstone Agreements shall be included on any of the financial statements
prepared under _Article I_.

Section 4.8 _Intercompany Obligations_.

(a) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.8_, effective as of the Closing Date,
subject to the receipt of any required consents of Governmental Entities,
Seller will terminate and will cause its Affiliates to terminate each Contract
and Other  



 

66  Agreement between or among any of the Acquired Companies and Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller, including the Intercompany Agreements (the " _Terminated
Agreements_ "). All remaining amounts due between or among the Acquired
Companies and Seller or any Affiliate of Seller upon termination of such
Contract and Other Agreements will be settled by the relevant party
within twenty (20) Business Days of the Closing Date. Without limitation to
the foregoing, on or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall, or shall cause
its applicable Affiliates to, cancel the Surplus Note. For the avoidance of
doubt, the failure to obtain any required consent of any Governmental Entity
shall not relieve Seller, on the one hand, or the Acquired Companies, on the
other hand, of their liabilities to each other for any amounts outstanding
between Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Acquired
Companies, on the other hand, that would otherwise have been settled pursuant
to this _Section 4.8_, except that the Surplus Note shall be cancelled
without any consideration to Seller.

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Closing Date, the parties agree
to cooperate to effect the termination of the Joint Enterprise Agreement,
effective as of March 31, 2005, by and among HN Life, Health Net Insurance of
Connecticut and HNINY, as amended on May 26, 2005. The parties agree to
cooperate in transferring the New York stand-alone Medicare Part D membership
under such agreement to one or more similar plans of Buyer or its Affiliates
as directed by Buyer.

Section 4.9 _Dissolution; Names_. After the run-off of all claims under the
Administered Contracts of an Acquired Company, Seller may deliver written
notice to Buyer requiring that Buyer, at the election of Seller,
take commercially reasonable efforts to either (a) dissolve such Acquired
Company in accordance with applicable Law or (b) change the name of such
Acquired Company so that it no longer includes the name "Health Net" or any
derivative thereof. Seller acknowledges in connection with the foregoing that
(i) any such action is subject to regulatory approval; (ii) because such
action is subject to regulatory approval, due to timing and other
considerations, dissolution may not be a reasonable alternative and,
therefore, it may be necessary for Buyer to take other action to eliminate an
Acquired Company (such as a merger into another entity); (iii) in no event
shall Buyer be required to post any bond, set aside any funds or otherwise
provide any type of financial or similar guarantee or otherwise agree to any
material condition, restriction or other covenant relating to its or any
business of its Affiliates in connection with such dissolution; and (iv) in
no event shall Seller or its Affiliates use as a defense against any
indemnification claim or other right by Buyer and its Affiliates under this
Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents that Buyer has failed to take
commercially reasonable efforts to dissolve an Acquired Company. Buyer shall,
upon request, keep Seller reasonably informed of its progress in dissolving or
changing the name of any Acquired Company.

Section 4.10 _Certain Employee Matters_.

(a) Within twenty (20) Business Days after the Effective Date, Seller shall
provide to Buyer a complete and accurate list (which shall identify the name,
job title and job grade of such Business Employees) by employer of all
Business Employees  



 

67  that are full-time provider network administration employees or sales and
account management employees (the " _Designated Employees_ ");  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer and its Affiliates shall not be permitted to extend
offers of employment to such Designated Employees except in accordance with a
transition plan mutually acceptable to Buyer and Seller or with the
prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld)
and _provided further_ that the list of Designated Employees may be updated
upon the mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller at any time prior to the Closing
Date. Any such permitted offer of employment with respect to a Designated
Employee may be effective as of any date on or after the Closing Date. As used
in this Agreement, " _Business Employees_ " means each employee of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries whose principal office is in Connecticut, New Jersey
or New York, who provides services exclusively for the Acquired Business and
who is identified by title on _Schedule 4.10_ , as may be updated by Parent
not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing with respect to any
employees whose employment has been terminated for any reason between the
Effective Date and the date of such schedule and new hires during such period.

(b) Subject to the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld), Buyer shall be permitted, during the
period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the Transition Date, to
extend offers of employment on such terms and conditions (including standard
background checks) as Buyer, in its sole discretion, shall determine, to those
Business Employees (other than Designated Employees) whom it desires to hire.
With respect to any such Business Employees, (i) Buyer shall furnish written
notice to Parent within five (5) days prior to extending an offer of
employment to any Business Employee, and (ii) the employment commencement
date of any Business Employee who accepts an offer of employment with Buyer or
one of its Affiliates shall not occur until at least thirty (30) days have
elapsed from the date of receipt of such offer of employment. Any Business
Employee who accepts an offer of employment with Buyer or one of its
Affiliates (a " _Hired Employee_ ") shall be deemed to have incurred a
termination of employment with Parent or its Affiliates due to a voluntary
resignation by such Business Employee for purposes of any employee benefit
plan or personnel policy or procedure maintained by Parent or its Affiliates.
Neither Parent nor its Affiliates shall incur any obligation or
liability with respect to the hiring of any Hired Employee. Buyer will have
no obligations or liabilities with respect to any current or former employees
of Parent or its Affiliates, other than obligations and liabilities with
respect to Hired Employees that arise on or after the date on which such
Hired Employees commence employment with Buyer or its Affiliates.

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee of
Parent or its Affiliates any right with respect to continued employment by
Parent or its Affiliates, nor shall anything herein interfere with the right
of Parent or its Affiliates to terminate the employment of any of its
employees at any time, with or without cause, or restrict Parent or its
Affiliates in the exercise of its independent business judgment in modifying
any of the terms and conditions of the employment of any of its employees.
Nothing herein shall constitute an agreement by Buyer to assume or be bound by
any previous or existing employment agreement or  



 

68  arrangement between Parent (or any of its Affiliates) and any Hired
Employee, or a guaranty that any Hired Employee shall be entitled to remain in
the employment of Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) for a specified period of
time. Prior to or after the Closing, neither Buyer nor its Affiliates shall be
obligated to pay any amount, whether sales incentive, commission or other
compensation, to any current or former employee of Parent or its Affiliates
or to any Hired Employee in connection with such employee or Hired Employees
relationship with Parent or its Affiliates prior to Closing.

(d) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 4.10(a)_ or _(b)_ , if (and only
if) this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _ARTICLE VI_ prior to the
Closing Date, then Buyer and its Affiliates shall not, for a period lasting
until the first anniversary of the date of such termination, directly or
indirectly, solicit for employment any Designated Employee. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither Buyer nor its Affiliates (to the extent controlled by
Buyer and/or Guarantor) shall be restricted from hiring any Designated
Employee who (i) has been terminated by, or who voluntarily leaves
employment with, Parent or its Affiliates (provided that Buyer has not
breached this clause), (ii) responds to a general solicitation of employment
not specifically directed at Designated Employees or (iii) is referred to
Buyer or its Affiliates by search firms, employment agencies or other similar
entities; _provided_ that such entities have not been specifically instructed
by Buyer or its Affiliates to solicit the Designated Employees.

(e) No provision of this Agreement shall create any third party beneficiary
rights in any Business Employee or Hired Employee, or any beneficiary or
dependents thereof, or any collective bargaining representative thereof, with
respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of employment and benefits
that may be provided to any Hired Employee.

Section 4.11 _No Negotiations_. From and after the Effective Date until the
Closing Date, neither Parent nor Seller shall, directly or indirectly, and
neither Parent nor Seller shall authorize any Affiliate, officer, director,
employee, representative or agent to, solicit, initiate, enter into, engage in
or conduct any discussions or negotiations with, or provide any non-
public information to, or enter into any agreement or letter of intent with
any Person or group of Persons regarding any Competing Transaction. Each of
Parent, Seller, and their controlled Affiliates, shall promptly (and in any
event within two (2) Business Days) notify Buyer of (a) the receipt by
Parent, Seller, or any of their controlled Affiliates of any written
inquiries, or proposals or requests for information concerning a Competing
Transaction, or (b) Parent or Seller becoming aware that any such written
inquiries or proposals have been received by Parents or Sellers non-
controlled Affiliates or by Parents, Sellers or their Affiliates investment
bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other representatives
and shall provide Buyer with a copy of all written materials relating to such
inquiries, proposals or requests. As of the Effective Date, Parent and Seller
shall, and shall direct their respective officers, directors, employees,
representatives and agents to, cease all discussions or negotiations with any
Person (other than Buyer and its Affiliates) relating to a Competing
Transaction. A " _Competing Transaction_ " means any of the following (other
than any transaction contemplated by this Agreement): (w) any sale of stock or
other Equity Interests in any Acquired Company or



 

69  Seller, (x) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
or other similar transaction by any Acquired Company or Seller, (y) any sale,
lease, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets
of any Acquired Company or Seller in a single transaction or a series of
related transactions, or (z) any agreement to endorse a carrier other than
Buyer or its Affiliates in a renewal rights transaction with respect to the
Acquired Business. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Parent and its officers, directors,
employees, representatives and agents shall be permitted (without the consent
of, or notice to, Buyer or its Affiliates) to solicit, initiate, enter into,
engage in or conduct any discussion or negotiations with, provide any
information to, enter into any agreement or letter of intent with, any Person
or group of Persons, and/or consummate a transaction regarding (i) any sale of
stock or other Equity Interests in Parent, (ii) a merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, or other similar transaction involving Parent
or its Affiliates, other than the Acquired Companies or Seller, or (iii) any
sale, lease, transfer or other disposition of the assets of Parent or its
Affiliates, other than the Acquired Companies or Seller, in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, with respect to any transaction described in the foregoing clauses (ii)
or (iii) that (A) would be a Triggering Event (as defined in _Section 4.15_)
if such transaction occurred on or after the Closing Date, Parent (or its
successor) shall perform or cause to be performed the obligations set forth in
_Section 4.15_ as if a Triggering Event had occurred or (B) includes HN
Life, Parent (or its successor) shall take such action prior to the
consummation of such transaction so as to ensure that the obligations of HN
Life under the Transaction Documents will be binding on HN Life or
its successor after the consummation of such transaction.

Section 4.12 _Assignment of Certain ASO Contracts; Delivery of
Intercompany Agreement Amendments_.

(a) Parent and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assign to
an Acquired Company the ASO customer contracts to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than any of the Acquired Companies) is a party relating to

and/or Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide for access
to one or more of Parents or Sellers leased provider networks for the HN
Life Business to be effective as of and after the Closing and for so long as

capital stock or outstanding equity interests of Parent by the holders thereof

Closing of the following additional conditions:

(a) Buyer shall have performed in all material respects the covenants and
obligations required to be performed by it under this Agreement on or prior to
the Closing;

(b)(i) the representations and warranties of Buyer in _ARTICLE III_ that are
qualified by reference to materiality, a Material Adverse Effect or words of
similar import are true and correct on the Closing Date as if they were made
at and as of Closing (other than such representations and warranties that
address matters only as of a certain date, which need only be true
and correct as of such certain date), and (ii) the representations and
warranties of Buyer in _ARTICLE III_ that are not so qualified are true and
correct in all material respects on the Closing Date as if they were made at
and as of Closing (other than such representations and warranties that
address matters only as of a certain date, which need only be true and correct
in all material respects as of such certain date), except, in each case, for
representations and warranties the breach of which has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on Buyers ability
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby;

(c) Seller shall have received a certificate signed by an executive officer of
Buyer to the effect of _Section 5.3(a)_ and  _Section 5.3(b)_; and

(d) on the Closing Date, Buyer shall have delivered to Parent and Seller the
Closing Payment as provided in _Section 1.3(b)_ and executed copies of each
of the Transaction Documents to which Buyer or any of its Affiliates is a
party.

the transactions set forth in _Section 1.1_ contemplated hereby may be
abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:

(a) by the written consent of Buyer, Parent and Seller;

(i) if a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity shall
have issued an Order or taken any other action permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions set forth in _Section
1.1_ and such Order or other action shall have become final and nonappealable;
or

(ii) if the Closing shall not have occurred prior to May 1, 2010 (the "

Termination Date may, from time to time be extended by either Parent or Seller
or Buyer, by written notice to the other parties, to August 1, 2010 (the "
_Extended Termination Date_ "), in the event that all conditions to the
Closing other than those set forth in _Section 5.1(b), 5.1(d), 5.1(e) or
5.2(e)_ (the " _Regulatory Conditions_ ") have been or are reasonably capable
of being satisfied at the time of such extension and the Regulatory
Conditions have been or are reasonably capable of being satisfied on or prior
to the Extended Termination Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 6.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be
available to any party whose failure to fulfill materially any covenant or
obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date;

(c) by Buyer if, since the Effective Date, there has been a change, event,
circumstance, development or effect that, individually or in aggregate, has
had a Material Adverse Effect;

(d) prior to the Closing, by written notice to Parent and Seller from

at the Closing (a " _Terminating Seller Breach_ "), and (ii) such Terminating
Seller Breach is not curable, or if curable, is not cured within twenty (20)
Business Days after written notice of such Terminating Seller Breach is given
to Parent by Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 6.1(d)_ shall not be available to Buyer
if Buyers action or failure to act has been a principal cause of or resulted
in the failure of the transaction to be consummated on or prior to such date;
and

(e) prior to the Closing, by written notice to Buyer from Parent or Seller, if
both (i) there has been a material breach of covenant on the part of Buyer,
or if a representation or warranty of Buyer set forth in this Agreement shall
be untrue in  



 

76  each case such that the conditions specified in _Section 5.3(a)_ or _(b)_
would not be satisfied at the Closing (a " _Terminating Buyer Breach_ "), and
(ii) such Terminating Buyer Breach is not curable, or if curable, is not cured
within twenty (20) Business Days after written notice of such Terminating
Buyer Breach is given by Seller or Parent to Buyer;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 6.1(e)_
shall not be available to Parent or Seller if Parent or Sellers action or
failure to act has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of
the transaction to be consummated on or prior to such date.

Section 6.2 _Procedure for and Effect of Termination_. In the event that this
Agreement is terminated and the transactions set forth in _Section 1.1_ are

notice of such termination and abandonment shall forthwith be given to the
other parties and this Agreement (and all representations, warranties and
covenants hereunder) shall terminate and the transactions set forth in
_Section 1.1_ shall be abandoned without any further action; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that _Section 4.5_, _Section 4.10(d)_, this _Section 6.2_ and
_ARTICLE VIII_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement. If this
Agreement is terminated as provided herein, no party hereto shall have any
liability or further obligation to any other party under the terms of this
Agreement except with respect to any liabilities or Losses arising out of any
fraud by a party with respect to any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement in which case any
and all remedies available to the other parties either in Law or equity
(including specific performance) shall be preserved and survive
the termination of this Agreement.

ARTICLE VII.

INDEMNIFICATION

Section 7.1 _Indemnification by Parent and Seller_. Notwithstanding
any investigation made by or on behalf of Buyer or the results of any such
investigation and notwithstanding any fact known by Buyer at the time of the
Closing, subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 7.3_, from and
after the Closing, Parent and Seller, jointly and severally, shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Buyer, its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Acquired Companies) and each of their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents and representatives (the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ")
from and against any and all Losses, to the extent arising or resulting from
any of the following:

(a) any breach of any covenant of Parent or Seller contained in this
Agreement;

(b) any breach by the Administrator of the Administrative Services
Agreements;

(c) any breach by Seller or HN Life of the Business Transition Agreement;

(d) any breach by Parent or its applicable Subsidiaries of the Claims
Servicing Agreements, Transitional Trademark License Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents;



 

77 (e) any Pre-Closing Liabilities; and

(f) any Excluded Liabilities.

Section 7.2 _Indemnification by Buyer and the Acquired Companies_.
Notwithstanding any investigation made by or on behalf of Parent or Seller, or
the results of any such investigation and notwithstanding any fact known by
Parent and Seller at the time of the Closing, from and after the Closing,
Buyer and the Acquired Companies, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Seller, each of its Affiliates and each of its officers, directors, employees,
agents and representatives (the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from and
against any and all Losses, to the extent arising or resulting from any of the
following:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer contained in this
Agreement;

(b) any breach of any covenant of Buyer contained in this Agreement;

(c) any breach by the Acquired Companies of the Administrative Services
Agreements;

(d) any breach by United of the Business Transition Agreement;

(e) any breach by Buyer or its applicable Affiliates of the Claims Servicing
Agreements, the Transitional Trademark License Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents;

(f) any Buyer Cost not taken into consideration in the calculation of any
Quarterly Net Payment; and

(g) any Assumed Liability.

Section 7.3 _Right of Offset; Limitations on Indemnity_.

(a) Buyer may offset any amounts to which it may be entitled under the terms
of this Agreement, the Claims Servicing Agreements, the Business Transition
Agreement and the Administrative Services Agreements and other Transaction
Documents against amounts otherwise payable by it under this Agreement, other
than the First Anniversary Adjusted Tangible Net Equity Payment. Each of
Parent and Seller may offset any amounts to which it may be entitled under the
terms of this Agreement, the Claims Servicing Agreements, the Business
Transition Agreement, the Administrative Services Agreements and the other
Transaction Documents against amounts otherwise payable by it under this
Agreement. Neither the exercise of, nor the failure to exercise, such right of
offset shall constitute an election of remedies or limit Buyer in any manner
in the enforcement of any other remedies that may be available to it hereby.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or
the Claims Servicing Agreements to the contrary, (i) in no event shall  



 

78  Parent or Seller be required to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party
pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ or _(c)_ in any amount exceeding the sum of
all Adjusted Tangible Net Equity Payments paid or payable under this Agreement
(the " _Cap Amount_ "); and (ii) in no event shall Buyer be required to
indemnify any Seller Indemnified Party pursuant to  _Section 7.2(c)_ or
_(d)_ in any amount exceeding the Cap Amount.

(c) No party hereto shall be liable to the others for Losses that constitute
lost profits or indirect, consequential or punitive damages (in each case,
except to the extent constituting Third Party Claims) claimed by such other
party or parties, as the case may be, resulting from such first partys
breach of its representations, warranties or covenants hereunder or under the
Transaction Documents or Claims Servicing Agreements.

(d) Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification with
respect to (i) any matter to the extent such matter was taken into account in
the calculation of any Quarterly Net Payment or other payment pursuant to
_Section 1.4_, (ii) if any adjustment under _Section 1.5_ has been made with
respect to such matter, (iii) any matter to the extent of the reserve for such
matter that was included in the Closing Date Combined Balance Sheet or the
balance sheet included in the final Quarterly Combined Financial Statement in
accordance with _Section 1.4_, or (iv) any matter to the extent Parent,
Seller or their respective Affiliates have reimbursed such Buyer Indemnified
Parties for such matter under the Administrative Services Agreements, the
Claims Servicing Agreements or the Business Transition Agreement. Seller
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification with respect to
(A) any matter to the extent such matter was a Buyer Cost taken into account
in the calculation of any Quarterly Net Payment or other payment pursuant to
_Section 1.4_, (B) any matter if any adjustment under  _Section 1.5_ has
been made with respect to such matter, or (C) any matter to the extent Buyer
or its Affiliates have reimbursed such Seller Indemnified Parties for such
matter under the Administrative Services Agreements, the Claims Servicing
Agreements or the Business Transition Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _ARTICLE VII_ , neither
Parent nor Seller shall be required to defend or hold harmless the Buyer
Indemnified Parties from and against any Losses arising or resulting from (i)
any grievances, appeals, inquiries, complaints or investigations contemplated
by Article VII of the Administrative Services Agreements that are not lawsuits
or proceedings, unless and/or until Seller or its Affiliates have failed to
address such matters in accordance with the Administrative Services Agreements
or such matters are not addressed by the Administrative Services Agreements,
or (ii) any Pre-Closing Liability, unless such Pre-Closing Liability has
become due and payable and Seller or its Affiliates have failed to timely pay
or otherwise satisfy such Pre-Closing Liability in the ordinary course of
business consistent with the Acquired Companies practices prior to Closing
(other than any Pre-Closing Liability that is being disputed in good faith by
appropriate proceedings);  _provided_ that this limitation shall not apply to
any Losses arising from or resulting from any Third Party Claim against a
Buyer Indemnified Party (other than an Acquired Company).



 

79 (f) Without limiting the foregoing, to the extent that a specific reserve for
a litigation matter in excess of $1,000,000 has been reflected in the Closing
Date Combined Balance Sheet, Actual Final Combined Financial Statement or
Termination Date Combined Financial Statement (each, an " _Acquired Reserve_
"), Buyer agrees to first exhaust such Acquired Reserve prior to seeking
indemnification from a Seller Indemnified Party. From and after the earlier of
the ASA Termination Date and Transition Date, to the extent that Buyer or its
Affiliates determine in accordance with GAAP that all or a portion of any
Acquired Reserve (other than the Loss Reserve or Termination Date Loss
Reserve) is no longer necessary or that the litigation matter for which such
Acquired Reserve was established has been satisfied for an amount less than
such Acquired Reserve, within five (5) Business Days, Buyer shall pay the
amount of such unnecessary or unused Acquired Reserve to Seller by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller.
For purposes of the foregoing, if there are litigation matters aggregated
within a class action, the reserves relating to such matters shall be
aggregated in measuring the size of the Acquired Reserve with respect to such
class action. 

Section 7.4 _Indemnification Procedures_.

(a) _Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Third Party Claims_. Except as
otherwise provided in _Section 4.6(d)_ (Tax Matters), if any party (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") receives written notice of the commencement of any
Action or the assertion of any claim by a third party or the imposition of any
penalty or assessment for which indemnity may be sought under _Section 7.1_
or _7.2_ (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), and such Indemnified Party intends to
seek indemnity pursuant to this _ARTICLE VII_ , the Indemnified Party shall
promptly provide the other party or parties, as applicable (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") with written notice of such Third Party Claim, stating
the nature, basis and the amount thereof, to the extent known, along with
copies of the relevant documents evidencing such Third Party Claim and the
basis for indemnification sought. Failure of the Indemnified Party to give
such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability on account
of this indemnification, except if and solely to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party will
have fifteen (15) days from receipt of any such notice of a Third Party Claim
to give notice to assume the defense thereof (but, in any event, at least five
(5) Business Days prior to the date that an answer to such Third Party Claim
is due to be filed). If notice to the effect set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence is given by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party
will have the right to assume the defense of the Indemnified Party against
the Third Party Claim with reputable counsel, subject to the approval of the
Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. So long as the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the
Third Party Claim in accordance herewith, (i) the Indemnified Party may retain
separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the
defense of the Third Party Claim, and (ii) the Indemnified Party will not
file any papers or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party. Neither the Indemnified Party nor the
Indemnifying Party may concede, settle or compromise any Third Party Claim  



 

80  without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, except the Indemnifying Party may settle or compromise
such Third Party Claim to the extent that the sole relief provided (other
than, for the avoidance of doubt, confidentiality obligations pursuant to such
settlements or compromises) is monetary damages that are paid in full by the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party receives a complete release with
respect to the subject matter thereof. If (A) the Indemnifying Party fails to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim within fifteen (15) days after
receipt of the notice of the Third Party Claim, (B) the Indemnified Party
reasonably determines that there is a conflict of interest that prevents the
Indemnifying Party from adequately representing the interests of the
Indemnified Parties with respect to such Third Party Claim, or (C) (1) the
Third Party Claim seeks relief other than the payment of monetary damages, and
(2) the subject matter of a Third Party Claim relates to the ongoing
operations of the Indemnified Party (other than the run-off of the Acquired
Companies), which, if decided against the Indemnified Party, would have an
adverse effect that is not immaterial on the ongoing business or reputation of
Indemnified Party, then (subject to the preceding sentence) the Indemnified
Party against which such claim has been asserted will (upon delivering notice
to such effect to the Indemnifying Party) have the right to undertake the
defense of such claim (and the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the
Indemnified Party for its reasonable out of pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable fees of outside counsel) for such defense) and the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate therein at its own
cost; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated
to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction. The parties will cooperate in any such defense and give each
other reasonable access to all information relevant thereto. 

(b) _Procedures for Non Third Party Claims_. Except as otherwise provided in
_Section 4.6(d)_ (Tax Matters), the Indemnified Party will notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing reasonably promptly of its discovery of any
matter that does not involve a Third Party Claim, giving rise to the claim of
indemnity pursuant hereto. Such notice shall state the nature basis and
amount of the claim to the extent known, and include copies of the relevant
documents and the basis for indemnification sought. The failure so to notify
the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from
liability on account of this indemnification, except only to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying
Party will have thirty (30) days from receipt of any such notice to give
notice of dispute of the claim to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying
Party notifies the Indemnified Party that it does not dispute the claim
described in such notice or fails to notify the Indemnified Party within
thirty (30) days after delivery of such notice by the Indemnified Party
whether the Indemnifying Party disputes the claim described in such notice,
the Loss in the amount specified in the Indemnified Partys notice will be
conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to recover the amount of such Loss from the
Indemnifying Party in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
_ARTICLE VII_. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its liability
with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
will proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute for a
period of at  



 

81  least thirty (30) days, and if such dispute is not resolved through such
negotiation prior to the expiration of such period, such dispute may
be resolved in accordance with _Section 8.6_.

(c) For purposes of this _ARTICLE VII_ , all Losses shall be computed net of
(i) any Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party, (ii) any
insurance benefits actually realized from a Person other than an Indemnified
Partys Affiliates, and (iii) any amounts recovered from any third parties
based on claims the Indemnified Party has against such third parties which
reduce the Losses that would otherwise be sustained; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, in the cases of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), the timing of the receipt
or realization of insurance proceeds or Tax benefits or recoveries from third
parties shall be taken into account in determining the amount of reduction of
Losses. Each Indemnified Party agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to pursue any claims or rights it may have against any non-Affiliate
insurer, which would reduce the amount of Losses otherwise incurred by such
Indemnified Party. In the event an Indemnifying Party pays for an Indemnified
Partys Losses pursuant to this _ARTICLE VII_ , such Indemnifying Party shall
be subrogated to the rights the Indemnified Party has against any non-
Affiliate insurer or other third party with respect thereto (and, upon the
reasonable request of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall
take appropriate actions necessary to transfer and assign such rights to the
Indemnifying Party).

Section 7.5 _Survival_. Except as provided in the following sentence, the
terms and provisions of this Agreement shall survive the Closing of the
transactions contemplated hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
all representations and warranties contained in Article II and Article III of
this Agreement shall not survive the Closing or the termination of this
Agreement and shall thereafter have no further force or effect.

Section 7.6 _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Except (i) as provided in the
following sentence, (ii) for any equitable relief or specific performance
sought under _Section 8.9_ (Equitable Relief and Specific Performance),
including with respect to a breach of _Section 4.9_ (Dissolution; Names),
_Section 4.10_ (Certain Employee Matters),  _Section 4.11_ (No
Negotiations) and _Section 4.15_ (Change in Status), and for equitable relief
or specific performance sought under the Non-Competition Agreement or other
Transaction Documents, and (iii) with respect to a claim brought on the basis
of fraud, from and after the Closing, the indemnification provisions of this
_ARTICLE VII_ shall be the sole and exclusive right and remedy of each party
(including the Seller Indemnified Parties and the Buyer Indemnified Parties),
and each such party hereby waives any other right or remedy (statutory,
equitable, common law or otherwise), for any breach of the other partys
representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements contained in
this Agreement or the Transaction Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
_Section 1.5_ provides the sole and exclusive method for resolving any and
all disputes related to, arising out of or in connection with any matters that
are the subject of _Section 1.5_, other than with respect to fraud.

Section 7.7 _Compliance with Express Negligence Rule_. All releases,
disclaimers, limitations on liability, and indemnities in this Agreement,
including those in this _ARTICLE VII_ , shall apply even in the event of the
sole, joint, and/or concurrent negligence, strict liability, or  



 

82  fault of the party whose liability is released, disclaimed, limited, or
indemnified; _provided_ , _however_ , that the limits described in this 
_Section 7.7_ shall not apply in cases of fraud. Each party agrees that this
paragraph constitutes a conspicuous legend.

Section 7.8 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification
payments made pursuant to this _ARTICLE VII_ shall be treated by the parties
as adjustments to the Closing Payment unless otherwise required by applicable
Law.

ARTICLE VIII.

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 8.1 _Amendment and Modification_. This Agreement may be amended,
modified or supplemented, only by a written agreement signed by each of the

Agreement.

Section 8.2 _Waiver of Compliance; Consents_. Any failure of Buyer, on the one
hand, or Parent or Seller, on the other hand, to comply with any obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived by Buyer, or Parent or
Seller, respectively, only by a written instrument signed by the party
granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict
compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure. Whenever this Agreement requires or permits consent by or on behalf
of any party hereto, such consent shall be given in writing in a manner
consistent with the requirements for a waiver of compliance as set forth in
this _Section 8.2_.

84 Section 8.6 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal laws of the state of New York applicable to agreements made and to be
performed entirely within such state, without regard to the choice of law
principles thereof. Each of Buyer, Parent and Seller hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally consents to submit to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of
the courts of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, the
City of New York, and of the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York (the " _Chosen Courts_ ") for any litigation arising out
of or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance
of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to
commence any litigation relating thereto except in such courts), waives any
objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation in the Chosen Courts
and agrees not to plead or claim in any Chosen Court that such litigation
brought therein has been brought in any inconvenient forum. The Parties waive
the right to trial by jury with respect to any claims hereunder.

Section 8.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission or by electronic mail with a pdf scanned
attachment) in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

Section 8.8  _Interpretation_. The article and section headings contained in
this Agreement are solely for the purpose of reference, are not part of the
agreement of the parties and shall not in any way affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. The parties are sophisticated, represented
by counsel and jointly have participated in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement and there shall be no presumption or burden of proof favoring
or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

Section 8.9 _Equitable Relief and Specific Performance_. The parties hereto
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not to be performed in accordance with the terms hereof
and that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in
the Chosen Courts, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at Law or in equity.

Section 8.10 _Entire Agreement; Further Assurances_. This Agreement (including
the agreements, schedules, exhibits, documents or instruments referred to
herein), the Transaction Documents and, until the Closing Date, the
Confidentiality Agreement embody the entire agreement and understanding of the
parties hereto in respect of the subject matter hereof and thereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties, or between any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof. The parties hereto agree that, on and after the Closing
Date, they shall execute any documents, instruments or conveyances of any kind
which may be reasonably necessary to carry out any of the provisions hereof.

Section 8.11 _Schedules; Exhibits_. All Schedules, Exhibits and Disclosure
Schedules referred to in this Agreement shall be attached hereto and are
incorporated by reference herein. To the extent a state of facts or the
occurrence of any event is described in the Seller Disclosure Schedule for
purposes of qualifying a representation, warranty or covenant of Seller
contained in  



 

85  the Agreement, the existence of such a state of facts or the occurrence of
such event shall not be deemed to constitute a breach of such
representation, warranty or covenant of the Seller under this Agreement. Any
disclosure contained in any section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other section of such Seller
Disclosure Schedule as though fully set forth in such other section for which
the applicability of such disclosure is reasonably apparent on the face of
such disclosure. The disclosure of any item or information in any section of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall not (i) be deemed to constitute an
admission, or otherwise imply, that any such item or information is material
or would result in a Material Adverse Effect or created measures for
materiality for the purposes of the Agreement, or (ii) represent
a determination by the Seller that such item occurred or was incurred other
than in the ordinary course of business. In no event shall the listing of any
matters in the Seller Disclosure Schedule be deemed or interpreted to broaden
or otherwise amplify any representations, warranties or covenants contained
