Matters), if any party (the &#147;<U>Indemnified Party</U>&#148;) receives written notice of the commencement of any Action or the assertion of any claim by a third party or the imposition of any penalty or assessment for which indemnity may be
sought under <U>Section&nbsp;7.1</U> or <U>7.2</U> (a &#147;<U>Third Party Claim</U>&#148;), and such Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity pursuant to this <U>ARTICLE VII</U>, the Indemnified Party shall promptly provide the other party or

Third Party Claim and the basis for indemnification sought. Failure of the Indemnified Party to give such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability on account of this indemnification, except if and solely to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party will have fifteen (15)&nbsp;days from receipt of any such notice of a Third Party Claim to give notice to assume the defense thereof (but, in any event, at least five (5)&nbsp;Business
Days prior to the date that an answer to such Third Party Claim is due to be filed). If notice to the effect set forth in the immediately preceding sentence is given by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party will have the right to assume the
defense of the Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim with reputable counsel, subject to the approval of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. So long as the Indemnifying Party has assumed
the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance herewith, (i)&nbsp;the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, and (ii)&nbsp;the Indemnified Party will
not file any papers or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party. Neither the Indemnified Party nor the Indemnifying Party may
concede, settle or compromise any Third Party Claim </FONT>
