AGREEMENT 

  

  ARTICLE I 

  

  THE MERGER 

  

    Section 1.1 _ The Merger. _ 

  

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, at the Effective Time, the Company and Merger Sub shall consummate the Merger pursuant to which (i) Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, (ii) the Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger and shall continue to be governed by the DGCL, and (iii) the Merger shall have the effects set forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

 (b) At the Effective Time, the Company Charter shall, by virtue of the Merger, be amended and restated in its entirety so as to read in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_, and as so amended shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended so as to read in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_. 

  

  

    
 Section 1.2 _ Closing. _ The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., New York time, at the offices of Covington and Burling LLP, The New York Times Building, 620 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York, 10018, no later than the third (3rd) business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied or waived (other than any such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), unless another time, date or place is agreed by the Company and Parent. The date on which the Closing actually takes place is referred to as the " _Closing Date_." Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), then the Closing shall occur instead on the date following the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions (subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing) that is the earlier to occur of (a) any business day during the Marketing Period as may be specified by Parent on no less than two (2) business days\' prior notice to the Company and (b) the second (2nd) business day following the final day of the Marketing Period. 

  

    
 Section 1.3 _ Effective Time. _ Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause an appropriate certificate of merger or other appropriate documents (in any such case, the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed and filed on the Closing Date (or on such other date as Parent and the Company may agree) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time such Certificate of Merger shall have been duly filed with, and accepted by, the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or such other date and time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger, such date and time hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_." From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all rights, privileges, powers and 

        

property of the Company and Merger Sub, and all of the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, and
duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  

    
 Section 1.4 _ Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. _ The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be appointed as the directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, from and after the Effective Time, shall continue as the officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporation\'s certificate of incorporation and bylaws. 

  

    
 Section 1.5 _ Subsequent Actions. _ If at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be advised, that any deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement. 

  

    
ARTICLE II 

  

  CONVERSION OF SECURITIES 

   

    Section 2.1 _ Conversion of Capital Stock. _ At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holders of any securities of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company:

  

  

 (a) _ Conversion of Common Stock._ Each share of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the Company (the " _Common Stock_ " or " _Capital Stock_ " and each such share, a " _Share_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other than Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive in cash an amount per Share (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) equal to $17.55, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). From and after the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2_, without interest thereon. 

  

 (b) _ Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Common Stock._ All Shares owned by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 (c) _ Merger Sub Common Stock._ Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub prior to the Effective Time (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing Merger Sub Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of 

  

       

  

common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

  

 (d) _ Adjustment to Merger Consideration._ The applicable Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Capital Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Capital Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 2.1(d)_ shall be construed to permit the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any other Person to take any action that is otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. 

  

  

    
 Section 2.2 _ Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates. _ 

  

  

 (a) _ Paying Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall designate a reputable bank or trust company, which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act as the payment agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). Prior to or at the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration with respect to Shares converted into the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by _Section 2.1(a)_, Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly deposit additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that any investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker\'s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article II_. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation on the earlier of one year after the Effective Time or full payment of the Exchange Fund. 

   

 (b) _ Procedures for Surrender._ As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than two (2) business days after the Effective Time), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the Paying Agent to mail (and make available for collection by hand) to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and, in each case, whose Shares were converted pursuant to _Section 2.1_ into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify (each, a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share for cancelation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents reasonably acceptable to the Company as may be appointed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, together with a Letter of Transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant 

  

      

  

to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for
each Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, to
be mailed (or made available for collection by hand if so elected by the
surrendering holder) within five (5) business days following the later to
occur of (A) the Effective Time or (B) the Paying Agent\'s receipt of such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share, and
the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. The Paying Agent shall accept such
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent
may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that (1) the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in
proper form for transfer and (2) the Person requesting such payment shall have
paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment
of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of
the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of
the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not
required to be paid. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-
Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry
Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
2.2_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the applicable
Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this _Article II_,
without interest thereon.

   

 (c) _ Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares._ At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement. 

   

 (d) _ Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability._ At any time beginning on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund that have not been disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the Paying Agent\'s routine administrative procedures, to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other than Shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other than Dissenting Shares), and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 (e) _ Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1_; _provided_ that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may 

  

      

  

reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

  

    
 Section 2.3 _ Dissenting Shares_.  

  

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to, but did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Rights_ ") shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the Appraisal Rights (it being understood that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares to the extent afforded by the Appraisal Rights); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares under the Appraisal Rights, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder\'s Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, and a Letter of Transmittal, in each case in accordance with _Section 2.2_. 

  

 (b) The Company shall give prompt written notice (with email from counsel being sufficient) to Parent and Merger Sub of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Shares, of any withdrawals of such demands and of any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to Appraisal Rights, and Parent and Merger Sub shall have the right to participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands, withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of such demands.

 Section 2.4 _ Treatment of Company Equity Awards. _ 

  

  

 (a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed to in writing between a holder of Company Options and Parent, (i) each outstanding, unvested and unexercised option to purchase Shares (the " _Company Options_ ") under any Company Equity Plan shall become immediately vested and exercisable in full, and (ii) each Company Option that remains outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (including each Company Option that becomes vested and exercisable pursuant to clause (i)) shall be canceled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such canceled Company Option shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancelation of such Company Option and in settlement thereof, a payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of (A) the total number of Shares for which such Company Option remains outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share previously subject to such Company Option (such amount being hereinafter referred to as the " _Option Consideration_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the exercise price per share under any Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be canceled as of the Effective Time without payment therefor and shall have no further force or effect. The Option Consideration shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event later than its first payroll date 

  

      

  

that is at least five (5) business days after the Closing. From and after the
Effective Time, any such canceled Company Option shall no longer be
exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder
to the payment of the Option Consideration.

   

 (b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed to in writing between a holder of any Restricted Awards and Parent, all outstanding restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance stock units (the " _Restricted Awards_ ") under any Company Equity Plan shall become immediately vested (and, in the case of performance stock units, such vesting will be in the amounts corresponding to actual achievement of applicable performance goals applicable thereto, which, in the event that the Closing shall occur prior to June 30, 2017, will be determined in good faith by the Compensation Committee of the Company Board of Directors by assuming achievement of performance goals for any period of the applicable performance period that has not been completed as of the Closing (the " _Open Performance Period_ ") taking into consideration historical levels of the Company\'s performance with respect to the applicable performance goals during the period of time corresponding to the Open Performance Period) and all restrictions thereupon shall lapse, and such Restricted Awards shall be canceled in exchange for the right to receive, with respect to each Share for which such Restricted Award remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration, which shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event later than its first payroll date that is at least five (5) business days after the Closing. From and after the Effective Time, any such canceled Restricted Award shall only entitle the former holder thereof to the payment of the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (c) The Company shall take all necessary corporate actions (including the passing of appropriate resolutions of the Company Board of Directors or any committee thereof) to effectuate the treatment of the Company Options and Restricted Awards (collectively, the " _Company Equity Awards_ ") as contemplated by this _Section 2.4_. 

  

  

    
 Section 2.5 _ Additional Payment Matters; Withholding. _ All amounts payable pursuant to _Section 2.4_ shall be paid without interest (unless otherwise noted). Any payments made pursuant to _Section 2.4_ shall be net of all applicable withholding Taxes that Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be required to deduct and withhold under applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation and remitted to the appropriate taxing authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 (b) As of the date hereof: (i) the Equity Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and has not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect or otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any respect; (ii) the Equity Commitment Letter is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Merger Sub, Parent, and the Equity Investor; (iii) except for the Equity Commitment Letter delivered to the Company, there are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements relating to the Equity Financing or the Equity Commitment Letter that could affect the amount, availability or conditionality of the Equity Financing, to which Merger Sub, Parent, or any of their respective affiliates is a party; and (v) assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to Merger Sub\'s and Parent\'s obligation to consummate the Merger (pursuant to _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_), to the knowledge of Merger Sub and Parent, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to (A) constitute a default or breach on the part of Merger Sub, Parent or their respective affiliates with respect to the Equity Financing and the Equity Investor under any term of the Equity Commitment Letter, (B) result in a failure of any condition of the Equity Commitment Letter, or (C) result in any portion of the Equity Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to Parent\'s obligation to consummate the Merger (pursuant to _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_) and the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company in _Article III_ and compliance with the covenants and obligations of the Company under this Agreement, the aggregate net proceeds of the Equity Financing, together with available cash on hand at the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, will be sufficient for the satisfaction 

  

      

  

of all of Merger Sub\'s and Parent\'s obligations under this Agreement,
including the payment in cash of the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant
to _Section 2.1(a)_, all amounts to be paid pursuant to  _Section 2.4_,
the payment of all associated costs and Expenses (including any repayment or
refinancing of indebtedness of the Company required in connection therewith
and the Expenses payable by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.3_) and the
payment of all other amounts required to be paid by Parent and Merger Sub in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions. There are no conditions
precedent or other contingencies related to the funding or investing, as
applicable, of the full amount of the Equity Financing, other than as
expressly set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof,
assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to Merger Sub\'s and Parent\'s
obligation to consummate the Merger (pursuant to _Section 7.1_ and 
_Section 7.2_), neither Merger Sub nor Parent has any reason to believe
that any of the conditions to the Equity Financing will not be satisfied or
that the full amount of the Equity Financing will not be available to Merger
Sub on the date of the Closing.

   

 (c) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company the limited guarantee of the Equity Investor with respect to certain matters on the terms specified therein (the " _Guarantee_ "). The Guarantee is in full force and effect (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Company) and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Equity Investor, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. No event has occurred that would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of, or a default under, the Guarantee on the part of the Equity Investor. 

  

  

    
 Section 4.8 _ Ownership and Operations of Merger Sub. _ Parent owns beneficially and of record all of the outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions, has engaged in no other business activities, has conducted its operations only as contemplated hereby, and has not incurred any liabilities or other obligations (other than to the Company pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise in connection with the consummation of the Transactions). 

   

    
 Section 4.9 _ Brokers and Other Advisors. _ No broker, investment banker, financial advisor, agent or other Person is entitled to any broker\'s, finder\'s, financial advisor\'s, agent\'s or other similar fee or commission in connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries. 

  

    
 Section 4.10 _ No Agreements with Stockholders. _ Other than the Support Agreements, as of the date hereof, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or any other Person on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or their respective affiliates has entered into any contract, commitment, agreement, instrument, obligation, arrangement, understanding or undertaking, whether written or oral, with any stockholder of the Company (where such stockholder has entered into such contract, commitment, agreement, instrument, obligation, arrangement, understanding or undertaking in his or her or its capacity as a stockholder of the Company), including any "lock up" or similar arrangements pertaining to the Capital Stock of the Company held by such stockholder. 

  

    
 Section 4.11 _ No Agreements with Management. _ Other than this Agreement, as of the date hereof, there are no contracts, commitments, agreements, instruments, obligations, arrangements, understandings or undertakings, whether written or oral, between Parent or Merger Sub or any of their affiliates or Representatives, on the one hand, and any member of the Company\'s management or the Company Board of Directors, on the other hand, relating in any way to the Transactions or the operations of the Company after the Effective Time. 

  

    
 Section 4.12 _ Solvency. _ Neither Merger Sub nor Parent is entering into this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries. After giving effect to the Transactions, including the Financing, the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, all amounts to be paid pursuant to 

        

 _Section 2.4_, the payment of all associated costs and Expenses (including
any repayment or refinancing of indebtedness of the Company required in
connection therewith and the Expenses payable by Parent pursuant to _Section
9.3_) and the payment of all other amounts required to be paid by Parent and
Merger Sub in connection with the consummation of the Transactions and to
allow Merger Sub and Parent to perform all of their obligations under this
Agreement, and assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to Merger Sub\'s
and Parent\'s obligations to consummate the Merger and the accuracy of the
representations and warranties in _Article III_ and compliance with the
covenants and obligations of the Company under this Agreement, the Surviving
Corporation will be Solvent as of and immediately after the Effective Time.
For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ " means that, as of
any date of determination and with respect to any Person: (a) the present
"fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a
consolidated basis, is greater than the total amount of "liabilities,
including contingent liabilities," of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a
consolidated basis, as of such date, (b) the present "fair saleable value" of
the assets of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, is
not less than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability
of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, on their
existing debts and liabilities as they become absolute and matured (the quoted
terms in clause (a) and (b) as are generally determined in accordance with
applicable federal or state Laws governing determination of insolvency of
debtors), (c) such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, are
not engaged in business, and are not about to engage in business, for which
such Person\'s and its Subsidiaries\' assets, on a consolidated basis,
would constitute unreasonably small capital, and (d) such Person and its
Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, intend to, and believe that they will,
pay their debts and liabilities as they mature.

  

    
 Section 4.13 _ Investigation; Limitation on Warranties; Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties_.  Each of Parent and Merger Sub has conducted its own independent review and analysis of the business, operations, assets, intellectual property, technology, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and acknowledges that each of Parent and Merger Sub has been provided access to personnel, properties, premises and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for such purposes. In entering into this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub has relied solely upon its independent investigation and analysis of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that it has not been induced by and has not relied upon any representations, warranties or statements, whether express or implied, made by the Company, any Company Subsidiary, or any of their respective affiliates, stockholders, controlling persons or Representatives that are not expressly set forth in this Agreement, whether or not such representations, warranties or statements were made in writing or orally. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree that, except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in _Article III_, (a) the Company does not make, and has not made, any representations or warranties relating to itself or its business or otherwise in connection with the Merger and Parent and Merger Sub are not relying on any representation or warranty except for those expressly set forth in _Article III_, (b) no Person has been authorized by the Company to make any representation or warranty relating to itself or its business or otherwise in connection with the Merger, and if made, such representation or warranty must not be relied upon by Parent or Merger Sub as having been authorized by such party and (c) any estimates, projections, predictions, data, financial information, memoranda, presentations or any other materials or information provided or addressed to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Representatives are not and shall not be deemed to be or include representations or warranties unless any such materials or information is the subject of any express representation or warranty set forth in _Article III_.

referred to in either of clause (A) or (B), in a Superior Proposal, the
Company may take the following actions: (A) furnish non-public information to
the Person making such Competing Proposal, if, and only if, prior to so
furnishing such information, the Company receives from such Person an executed
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (B) engage in discussions
or negotiations with such Person with respect to the Competing Proposal;
_provided_ that, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event
within forty-eight (48) hours) following the Company taking such actions as
described in clauses (A) and (B) above, the Company shall (1) provide written
notice to Parent of such Superior Proposal or the determination of the
Company Board of Directors as provided for in clause (ii) above, as applicable
and (2) provide to Parent any information concerning the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries provided to such Person which was not previously provided
to Parent.

  

 (d) The Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) following the receipt of any written Competing Proposal, provide Parent with the material terms of any such Competing Proposal (including, if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such Competing Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to disclose the identity of the Person making such Competing Proposal if such disclosure is prohibited by the terms of a confidentiality agreement with such Person. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably prompt basis (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours of any material development) of the status and details (including amendments) of any such Competing Proposal and provide Parent with any documents describing or evidencing any such Competing Proposal. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 5.2(a)_ and _Section 5.2(b)_, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company Board of Directors may, if the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the proper exercise of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_ (including payment of the applicable Company Termination Fee) and concurrently enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board of Directors may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 5.2(e)_ unless: 

    

 (i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least seventy-two (72) hours in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its intention to terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal and substantially complete copies of all forms of agreements with respect to such Superior Proposal); 

  

 (ii) prior to terminating this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and its affiliates in good faith (to the extent Parent and its affiliates also have notified the Company that they so seek to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter and the Guarantee, as applicable, so that the Competing Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal; and 

  

 (iii) taking into account all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be offered in writing by Parent pursuant to this _Section 5.2(e)_ as described above, the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with the Company\'s outside legal and financial advisors that such Competing Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal 

   

      

   

(it being understood and agreed that any change to the financial or other
material terms of a Competing Proposal that was previously the subject of a
notice hereunder shall require a new notice to Parent as provided above, but
with respect to any such subsequent notices, references herein to a "seventy-
two (72) hours" shall be deemed references to "forty-eight (48) hours").

    

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 5.2(a)_ or _Section 5.2(b)_, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company Board of Directors may take any of the actions described in clauses (A), (C), (D) of _Section 5.2(b)(i)_ or, solely for the purposes of such clauses (A), (C) and (D), clause (F) of _Section 5.2(b)(i)_ if, following the occurrence of an Intervening Event, (i) the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the proper exercise of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law and (ii) the Company Board of Directors shall have (A) first provided prior written notice to Parent that it is prepared to effect a Change of Recommendation, which notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of the facts and circumstances relating to such Intervening Event, and (B) complied, as applicable, with the requirements set forth in _Section 5.2(e)_ as if such provisions related to an Intervening Event instead of a Superior Proposal.  

  

 (g) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates) from the restrictions on "business combinations" contained in Section 203 of the DGCL (or any similar provision of applicable Law) or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply, or agree to do any of the foregoing, in each case unless such actions are taken substantially concurrently with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_. Nothing contained in this _Section 5.2_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board of Directors from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with respect to a Competing Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or any other similar communication to stockholders or (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (which shall be deemed to not constitute a Change of Recommendation); _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such rules would otherwise have under this Agreement, including whether there has been a Change of Recommendation. 

  

  

    
 Section 5.3 _ Proxy Statement. _ The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, subject to providing Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such filing and giving good faith consideration to including any such reasonable comments provided by Parent, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than fifteen (15) business days) after the date hereof, a preliminary Proxy Statement (the " _Preliminary Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the Merger as required by the Exchange Act. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish to the Company the information relating to it required by the Exchange Act to be included in the Preliminary Proxy Statement. The Company shall obtain and furnish the information required to be included in the Preliminary Proxy Statement, shall provide Parent with any comments and copies of all correspondence that may be received from the SEC or its staff or any other Governmental Entities with respect thereto, shall respond promptly to any such comments made by the SEC or its staff or any other Governmental Entities with respect to the Preliminary Proxy Statement (after providing Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such response and giving good faith consideration to including any such reasonable comments provided by Parent), shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company\'s stockholders at the earliest reasonably practicable date and shall use its reasonable best efforts (subject to _Section 5.2_) to obtain the necessary approval of the Merger by its stockholders. If, at any time prior to the Special Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, 

        

any of their respective affiliates, this Agreement or the Transactions
(including the Merger), should be discovered by the Company or Parent which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so
that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or

occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which any such Continuing
Employee has satisfied his or her deductible and whether he or she has reached
the out-of-pocket maximum under any health plan of Parent or an Subsidiary of

 (b) by either Parent or the Company, if the Effective Time shall not have occurred by 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)_ shall not be available to any party whose breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement has been the primary cause of the Effective Time not occurring prior to the Outside Date and (ii) Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)_ during the pendency of any proceeding brought by the Company for specific performance of this Agreement; 

  

 (c) by either Parent or the Company, if a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction, that is within a jurisdiction that is material to the business and operations of the Company, shall have issued a final, non-appealable order, decree or ruling in each case permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)_ shall 

  

      

  

not be available to any party whose breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement has been the primary cause

 (e) by Parent, prior to the Effective Time, if there has been a breach by the Company of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company set forth in this Agreement, which breach would result in any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ not being satisfied and is not curable prior to the Outside Date, or if curable prior to the Outside Date, has not been cured within the earlier of (i) thirty (30) calendar days after the receipt of notice thereof from Parent or (ii) three (3) business days before the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that this Agreement may not be terminated pursuant to this _Section 8.1(e)_ if Parent or Merger Sub are then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement that would cause a condition set forth in _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.3_ not to be satisfied;

 Section 8.2 _ Effect of Termination. _ In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section 8.1_, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party or parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and there shall be no liability hereunder on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, any Parent Related Party, the Company or any Company Related Party, except that the Confidentiality Agreement, _Section 6.3_, _Section 6.14(c)_, _Section 6.14(d)_, this _Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_, and _Section 9.3_ through _Section 9.13_ shall survive such termination; _provided_ that nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for its actual and intentional fraud, or for Willful Breach of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination. 

  

    
 Section 8.3 _ Termination Fee; Limitation of Liability_.  

  

  

 (a) The Company shall be required to pay to Parent, or its designee, the Company Termination Fee in any of the following events ( _provided_ that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion): 

    

 (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_; 

  

 (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_; or 

  

 (iii) (A) this Agreement is terminated by (1) Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ (but in the case of a termination by the Company, only if at such time Parent would not be prohibited from terminating this Agreement pursuant to the proviso to _Section 8.1(b)_), or (2) Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_, or (3) Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_; (B) any Person shall have publicly disclosed a _bona fide_ Competing Proposal after the date hereof and prior to such termination and such Competing Proposal has not been publicly withdrawn prior to such termination; and (C) during the period commencing as of immediately following entry into this Agreement and ending twelve (12) months following such termination, the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement providing for a Competing Proposal (which Competing Proposal is subsequently consummated, whether during or following such 12-month period) or consummates a transaction contemplated by such Competing Proposal; _provided_ that for purposes of this _Section 8.3(a)(iii)_, each reference to "15%" in the definition of "Competing Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%". 

    

 (b) Payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be made to the account or accounts designated by Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds (i) in the case of _Section 8.3(a)(i)_, within three (3) business days of the date of such termination, (ii) in the case of _Section 8.3(a)(ii)_, on the date the Company enters into a definitive agreement providing for such Superior Proposal, and (iii) in the case of _Section 8.3(a)(iii)_, concurrently with the consummation of the transaction contemplated by such Competing Proposal. 

  

 (c) Each of the parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay the amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a Legal Proceeding that results in a final non-appealable judgment in its favor, the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and Expenses (including attorneys\' fees and expenses) in connection with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on the amount of such payment from the date such payment was required to be made under this _Section 8.3_ until the actual date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the prime interest rate published in _The Wall Street Journal_ on the date such interest begins accruing. 

  

 (d) The parties further acknowledge and agree that the Company Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and 

  

      

  

Merger Sub in the circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is due
and payable, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
by Parent and Merger Sub while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, under
circumstances where the Company Termination Fee is due and payable, in no
event shall Parent\'s right to receive monetary damages pursuant to this
_Section 8.3_ be greater than the Company Termination Fee (together with any
amounts, if any, due under _Section 8.3(c)_). In the event Parent receives
the Company Termination Fee pursuant to  _Section 8.3(b)_, such payment
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and its Subsidiaries, the
Equity Investor, the Financing Sources or any other financing source of
Parent, and any of their respective former, current or future officers,
directors, partners, stockholders, equityholders, controlling persons, general
or limited partners, managers, members, affiliates, agents or other
Representatives (each, a " _Parent Related Party_ ") for the loss suffered as
a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated, and under
circumstances where such Company Termination Fee is due, upon payment of such
amount, none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Company Related
Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the Transactions.

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, under no circumstances will the collective monetary damages payable by any Parent Related Party for breaches under this Agreement, the Guarantee or the Equity Commitment Letter exceed an amount equal to $38,760,000 in the aggregate for all such breaches, _plus_  any amounts payable by Parent pursuant to the Company\'s rights to be indemnified or reimbursed by Parent in accordance with _Section 6.14(c)_, _Section 6.14(d) _, and _Section 9.3_ (collectively, the " _Parent Liability Limitation_ "). In no event will any of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, affiliates, agents or other Representatives (each, a " _Company Related Party_ ") seek or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or award in excess of the Parent Liability Limitation against the Parent Related Parties and in no event will the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be entitled to seek or obtain any monetary damages of any kind in excess of the Parent Liability Limitation against the Parent Related Parties for, or with respect to, this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including for any breach by Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub), the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or any claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure. Other than Guarantor\'s obligations under the Guarantee and the Equity Commitment Letter and other than the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement, in no event will any Parent Related Party or any other Person other than Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub have any liability for monetary damages to the Company or any other Person relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in _Section 8.3(d)_ or _Section 8.3(e)_ shall limit the right of a party to bring or maintain any Legal Proceeding (i) for injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to the extent provided in _Section 9.13_, unless and until this Agreement has been terminated and the Company Termination Fee has been paid to Parent in accordance with _Section 8.3(b)_ and (ii) against the other parties or their affiliates arising out of or in connection with a breach of the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that while the Company may pursue an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to the extent provided in _Section 9.13_ and monetary damages, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to pursuant to _Section 9.13_ and monetary damages.

 (c) _ Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission, ".pdf," or other electronic transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

  

 (d) _ Entire Agreement, No Third-Party Beneficiaries._ This Agreement (i) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among or between any of the parties hereto, with respect to the subject matter hereof and (ii) is not intended to, nor shall it, confer upon any other person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. 

  

      

  

 (e) _ Governing Law, Jurisdiction._ This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any conflicts of laws principles that would result in the application of the Law of any other state or jurisdiction. Each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery, or, if (and only if) such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware or, to the extent they have subject matter jurisdiction, Federal courts of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware, and the respective appellate courts from the foregoing (all of the foregoing, collectively, the " _Delaware Courts_ "), in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or therewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding except in the applicable Delaware Court, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in the applicable Delaware Court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in the applicable Delaware Court and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in the applicable Delaware Court. Each party agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in accordance with _Section 12(a) _. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law. 

  

 (f) _ Waiver of Jury Trial._ EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE MERGER AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

 (g) _ Assignment._ This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of each of the other parties hereto, and any assignment without such consent shall be null and void; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and Merger Sub may assign, in their sole discretion and without the consent of any other party hereto, any or all of their rights, interests and obligations hereunder to each other or to one or more direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent in connection with the assignment of the rights, interests and obligations of Parent and/or Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement to such direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, and any such assignee may thereafter assign, in its sole discretion and without the consent of any other 

  

      

  

party, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one
or more additional direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent in
connection with the assignment of the rights, interests and obligations of
such assignee under the Merger Agreement to such additional direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such assignment shall relieve
Parent or Merger Sub of any of their respective obligations under this
Agreement. Subject to the preceding two sentences, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

  

 (h) _ Severability of Provisions._ If any term or other provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible. 

   

 (i) _ Specific Performance._ The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any party hereto failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (i) the parties hereto will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof; and (ii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Agreement and without that right, Parent would not have entered into this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that each party hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity and any party hereto seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each party hereto irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security. 

  

 (j) _ Amendment._ No amendment or modification of this Agreement shall be effective unless it shall be in writing and signed by each of the parties hereto, and no waiver or consent hereunder shall be effective against any party unless it shall be in writing and signed by such party. 

  

 (k) _ Binding Nature._ This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall be enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 (l) _ No Recourse._ Parent and Merger Sub agree that Stockholder will not be liable for claims, losses, damages, expenses and other liabilities or obligations resulting from or related to the Merger Agreement or the Merger (other than any liability for claims, losses, damages, expenses and other liabilities or obligations solely to the extent arising under, and in accordance with the terms of, this Agreement), including the Company\'s breach of the Merger Agreement. 

  

      

  

 (m) _ No Presumption._ This Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement. 

   

 (n) _ No Agreement Until Executed._ This Agreement shall not be effective unless and until (i) the Merger Agreement is executed by all parties thereto and (ii) this Agreement is executed by all parties hereto. 

  

 (o) _ No Ownership Interest._ Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in Parent or Merger Sub any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to the Stockholder Securities. All rights, ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the Stockholder Securities shall remain vested in and belong to Stockholder, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any authority to manage, direct, restrict, regulate, govern, or administer any of the policies or operations of the Company or exercise any power or authority to direct Stockholder in the voting of any of the Stockholder Securities, except as otherwise specifically provided herein.

All such notices shall be delivered, either personally, by mail, or by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given, by or at the direction of the board of directors, the president or the secretary, and if mailed,      

such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United
States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the stockholder at his, her or its
address as the same appears on the records of the Corporation. If given by
electronic transmission, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered (a) if by
facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the
stockholder has consented to receive notice; (b) if by electronic mail, when
directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented
to receive notice; (c) if by a posting on an electronic network together with
separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of
(1) such posting, and (2) the giving of such separate notice, and (3) if by
any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder.
Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to
the Corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (1) the
Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive
notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such consent and (2) such
inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the
Corporation or to the transfer agent. Attendance of a person at a meeting
shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person
attends for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting
to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called
or convened.

  

 Section 5. _ _ _Stockholders List._ The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall make, at least 10 days before every meeting of the stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, and/or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation. In the event that the Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. 

  

 Section 6. _ _ _Quorum._ Except as otherwise provided by applicable law or by the Corporation\'s certificate of incorporation, a majority of the outstanding shares of the Corporation entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of stockholders. If less than a majority of the outstanding shares are represented at a meeting, a majority of the shares so represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time in accordance with Section 7 of this Article II, until a quorum shall be present or represented. 

   

 Section 7. _ _ _Adjourned Meetings._ When a meeting is adjourned to another time and place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time, place, if any, thereof, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting, at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. 

  

 Section 8. _ _ _Vote Required._ When a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders, unless the question is one upon which by express provisions 

        

of an applicable law or of the Corporation\'s certificate of incorporation a
different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern
and control the decision of such question. Where a separate vote by class is
required, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares of such class present
in person or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such
class, unless the question is one upon which by express provisions of an
applicable law or of the Corporation\'s certificate of incorporation a
different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern
and control the decision of such question.

  

 Section 9. _ _ _Voting Rights._ Except as otherwise provided by the DGCL or by the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation or any amendments thereto, every stockholder shall at every meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of common stock held by such stockholder. 

  

 Section 10. _ _ _Proxies._ Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person(s) to act for him, her or it by proxy. Every proxy must be signed by the stockholder granting the proxy or by his, her or its attorney-in-fact. No proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the Corporation generally. 

  

 Section 11. _ _ _Action by Written Consent._ Unless otherwise provided in the Corporation\'s certificate of incorporation, any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent(s) in writing, setting forth the action so taken and bearing the dates of signature of the stockholders who signed the consent(s), shall be signed by the holders of outstanding shares of stock having not less than a majority of the shares entitled to vote, or, if greater, not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, or the Corporation\'s principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book(s) in which proceedings of meetings of the stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation\'s registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, provided, however, that no consent(s) delivered by certified or registered mail shall be deemed delivered until such consent(s) are actually received at the registered office. All consents properly delivered in accordance with this Section 11 shall be deemed to be recorded when so delivered. No written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated consent delivered to the Corporation as required by this Section 11, written consents signed by the holders of a sufficient number of shares to take such corporate action are so recorded. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. Any action taken pursuant to such written consent(s) of the stockholders shall have the same force and effect as if taken by the stockholders at a meeting thereof. Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any and all purposes for which the original writing could be used; provided that such copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing. 

  

 Section 12. _ _ _Action by Electronic Transmission Consent._ An electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted by a stockholder or proxyholder, or by a person or persons authorized to act for a stockholder or proxyholder, shall be deemed to be written, signed and dated for the purposes of this Section 12; provided that any such telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission sets forth or is delivered with information from which the Corporation can determine 

        

(A) that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was
transmitted by the stockholder or proxyholder or by a person or persons
authorized to act for the stockholder or proxyholder and (B) the date on
which such stockholder or proxyholder or authorized person or persons
transmitted such telegram, cablegram or electronic transmission. The date on
which such telegram, cablegram or electronic transmission is transmitted
shall be deemed to be the date on which such consent was signed. No consent
given by telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission shall be deemed
to have been delivered until such consent is reproduced in paper form and
until such paper form shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its
registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business
or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which
proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded if, to the extent and
in the manner provided by resolution of the board of directors of the
Corporation.

ARTICLE V 

CERTIFICATES OF STOCK 

  

    Section 1. _ _ _Form._ Every holder of stock in the
Corporation shall be entitled to have a certificate, signed by, or in the name
of the Corporation by (i) the chairman or vice chairman of the board of
directors, or the president or a vice-president and (ii) by the treasurer or
an assistant treasurer, or the secretary or an assistant secretary of the
Corporation, certifying the number of shares owned by such holder in the
Corporation; provided that the board of directors may provide by resolution or
resolutions that some or all of the outstanding shares shall be
uncertificated shares. If shares are certificated and such a certificate is
countersigned (1) by a transfer agent or an assistant transfer agent other
than the Corporation or its employee or (2) by a registrar, other than the
Corporation or its employee, the signature of any such chairman of the board,
president, vice-president, secretary, or assistant secretary may be
facsimiles. In case any officer(s) who have signed, or whose facsimile
signature(s) have been used on, any such certificate(s) shall cease to be such
officer(s) of the Corporation whether because of death, resignation or
otherwise before such certificate(s) have been delivered by the Corporation,
such certificate(s) may nevertheless be issued and delivered as though the

        

person or persons who signed such certificate(s) or whose facsimile
signature(s) have been used thereon had not ceased to be such officer(s) of
the Corporation. All certificates for shares shall be consecutively numbered
or otherwise identified. The name of the person to whom the shares represented
thereby are issued, with the number of shares and date of issue, shall be
entered on the books of the Corporation. Shares of stock of the Corporation
shall only be transferred on the books of the Corporation by the holder of
record thereof or by such holder\'s attorney duly authorized in writing, upon
surrender to the Corporation of the certificate(s) for such shares endorsed by
the appropriate person(s), with such evidence of the authenticity of such
endorsement, transfer, authorization, and other matters as the Corporation
may reasonably require, and accompanied by all necessary stock transfer
stamps. In that event, if the shares so transferred are represented by
certificates, it shall be the duty of the Corporation to issue a new
certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate(s), and
record the transaction on its books. The board of directors may appoint
a bank or trust company organized under the laws of the United States or any
state thereof to act as its transfer agent or registrar, or both in connection
with the transfer of any class or series of securities of the Corporation.

  

    
 Section 2. _ _ _Lost Certificates._ The board of directors may direct a new certificate(s) to be issued in place of any certificate(s) previously issued by the Corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen, or destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new certificate(s), the board of directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen, or destroyed certificate(s), or his or her legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate.

If no record date is fixed by the board of directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be the close of business on the day immediately preceding the day on which notice is given, or if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day immediately preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. 

  

    
 Section 4. _ _ _Fixing a Record Date for Action by Written Consent._ In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors, and which date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of directors is required by statute, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation\'s registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors and 

        

prior action by the board of directors is required by statute, the record
date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in
writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on
which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

  

    
 Section 5. _ _ _Fixing a Record Date for Other Purposes._ In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment or any rights of the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purposes of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. 

  

    
 Section 6. _ _ _Registered Stockholders._ Prior to the surrender to the Corporation of the certificate(s) for a share(s) of stock represented by certificates with a request to record the transfer of such share(s), or in the case of uncertificated shares prior to receipt of a request to record the transfer of such share(s), the Corporation may treat the registered owner as the person entitled to receive dividends, to vote, to receive notifications, and otherwise to exercise all the rights and powers of an owner. The Corporation shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share(s) on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof. 

  

    
 Section 7. _ _ _Subscriptions for Stock._ Unless otherwise provided for in the subscription agreement, subscriptions for shares shall be paid in full at such time, or in such installments and at such times, as shall be determined by the board of directors. Any call made by the board of directors for payment on subscriptions shall be uniform as to all shares of the same class or as to all shares of the same series. In case of default in the payment of any installment or call when such payment is due, the Corporation may proceed to collect the amount due in the same manner as any debt due the Corporation.
