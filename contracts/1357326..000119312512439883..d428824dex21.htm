iii  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (" _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into
as of October 28, 2012, by and among: RIVERBED TECHNOLOGY, INC., a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "); OCTAGON ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Acquisition Sub_ "); and
OPNET TECHNOLOGIES, INC., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Certain
capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in _Exhibit A_.

 

RECITALS

A. Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company have determined that it is in the
best interests of their respective stockholders for Parent to acquire the
Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

B. In furtherance of the contemplated acquisition of the Company by Parent, it
is proposed that Acquisition Sub make an exchange offer (the " _Offer_ ") to
acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, in
exchange for consideration, per share of Company Common Stock, comprised of:
(i) $36.55, net to the seller in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ "); _plus_
(ii) 0.2774 of a share of Parent Common Stock (the " _Stock Consideration_ ")
(the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration or any
different consideration per share of Company Common Stock that may be paid
pursuant to the Offer in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Offer Price_
"), without interest thereon and subject to any required Tax withholding.

 

C. It is further proposed that, after acquiring shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer, Acquisition Sub shall merge with and into the Company
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (the
merger of Acquisition Sub with and into the Company being referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Merger_ ").

 

D. In order to induce Parent and Acquisition Sub to enter into this Agreement
and to consummate the Contemplated Transactions, concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company
are executing and delivering tender and support agreements in favor of Parent
and Acquisition Sub (the " _Stockholder Agreements_ "). 

E. In order to induce Parent and Acquisition Sub to enter into this Agreement
and to consummate the Contemplated Transactions, concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of Alain J. Cohen, Marc A.
Cohen, Pradeep Singh, Yevgeny Gurevich, Patrick Malloy and Russell Elsner are
executing and delivering noncompetition agreements to be effective as of
Closing.

AGREEMENT

The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

 

Section 1\. The Offer



   1.1 | Conduct of the Offer. 
---|--- 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with _Section 8_, Acquisition Sub shall commence (within the meaning of Rule
14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the date of this Agreement, but in no event later than the 10th business
day after the date of this Agreement (unless another date shall be agreed to
in writing by Parent and the Company); _provided, however_ , that Acquisition
Sub shall not be required to commence the  Offer, and the 10 business day period (or such other period as shall be
agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company) referred to in this sentence
shall be accordingly extended, if the Company shall not: (i) have: (A)
provided to Parent on a timely basis all information reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with the preparation of the Offer Documents; or (B)
reviewed and provided comments to Parent on the Offer Documents on a timely
basis; (ii) have given: (A) Parent and its legal counsel reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC; or (B) reasonable consideration to any such comments
provided by Parent or its legal counsel; and (iii) be prepared to file with
the SEC immediately following commencement of the Offer, and to disseminate to
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, the Schedule 14D-9. (The date
on which Acquisition Sub commences the Offer, within the meaning of Rule
14d-2 under the Exchange Act, is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer
Commencement Date_.")

 

(b) The obligation of Acquisition Sub to accept for payment, and pay for,
shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant
to the Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction or (if permitted)
waiver of (and shall not be subject to any other conditions): (i) the
condition (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") that there shall be validly tendered
(and not withdrawn) a number of shares of Company Common Stock (excluding
shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery
procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of
such guarantee) that, together with any shares of Company Common Stock owned
by Parent or Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Acceptance Time,
represents a majority of the Adjusted Outstanding Share Number; and (ii) the
other conditions set forth in _Exhibit B_ (the Minimum Condition and the
other conditions set forth in _Exhibit B_ are referred to collectively as the
" _Offer Conditions_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Adjusted
Outstanding Share Number_ " shall be the sum of: (A) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Acceptance Time; _plus_ (B) an additional number of shares up to (but not
exceeding) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable
upon the conversion, exchange or exercise, as applicable, of all options,
warrants and other rights to acquire, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for, Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior
to the Acceptance Time (other than the Top-Up Option).

(c) Parent and Acquisition Sub each expressly reserves the right, in its sole
discretion to: (i) increase the Offer Price; and (ii) waive any Offer
Condition or make any other changes to the terms and conditions of the Offer;
_provided, however_ , that without the prior written consent of the Company,
neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall: (A) amend, modify or waive the
Minimum Condition; or (B) make any change to the Offer that: (1) changes the
form of consideration to be delivered by Acquisition Sub pursuant to the
Offer; (2) decreases the Offer Price or the number of shares of Company Common
Stock sought to be purchased by Acquisition Sub in the Offer; (3) amends or
modifies any condition set forth in  _Exhibit B_ in any manner adverse to the
holders of Company Common Stock; (4) imposes any conditions to the Offer in
addition to the Offer Conditions; (5) except as provided in _Section 1.1(d)_,
extends or otherwise changes the expiration date of the Offer; or (6)
otherwise amends the Offer in any manner adverse (other than in an immaterial
respect) to the holders of Company Common Stock. Subject to the prior
satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction, or waiver by
Parent or Acquisition Sub, of the other Offer Conditions, as soon as
practicable after the Expiration Date, Acquisition Sub shall: (x) consummate
the Offer in accordance with its terms; (y) accept for payment all shares of
Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the
Offer ( _provided, however,_ that with regard to shares of Company Common
Stock tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet
been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee, Acquisition
Sub shall be under no obligation to make any payment for such shares unless
and until such shares are delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such
guarantee); and (z) pay and issue the Offer Price in exchange for each share
of Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the
Offer. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued by virtue
of the   Offer, no dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any such fractional share
interest, and such fractional share interest will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Each holder
of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder) shall, in lieu of such
fractional share, be paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest
whole cent), without interest, determined by multiplying such fraction by
the closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq Stock
Market on the date the Acceptance Time occurs.

(d) The Offer shall initially be scheduled to expire on the later of: (x) 20
business days following the Offer Commencement Date (calculated as set forth
in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act); and (y)
December 17, 2012 (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the
Company)(the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ," such date or such subsequent date
to which the expiration of the Offer is extended in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to the parties respective
termination rights under  _Section 8.1_: (i) if, as of the scheduled
Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived,
Acquisition Sub may, in its discretion (and without the consent of the Company
or any other Person), extend the Offer on one or more occasions, for an
additional period of up to 20 business days per extension, to permit such
Offer Condition to be satisfied; (ii) Acquisition Sub shall extend the Offer
from time to time for: (A) any period required by any Legal Requirement, any
interpretation or position of the SEC, the staff thereof or the Nasdaq Stock
Market applicable to the Offer; (B) periods of up to 20 business days per
extension, until any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to
the consummation of the Offer under the HSR Act and any foreign antitrust or
competition-related Legal Requirement shall have expired or been terminated;
and (C) any period of up to five business days per extension until
the Marketing Period shall have been completed; (iii) if on any scheduled
Expiration Date, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall not have received the
Financing and Parent, acting reasonably and in good faith, shall have
determined that the Financing contemplated by _Section 6.12(a) _will not be
received by Parent or Acquisition Sub at the anticipated Acceptance Time,
Acquisition Sub shall extend the Offer, on one or more occasions, for an
additional period of up to five business days per extension to permit Parent
or Acquisition Sub to receive the Financing contemplated by _Section
6.12(a)_; and (iv) if, as of the scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer
Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived, at the request of the
Company, Acquisition Sub shall extend the Offer on one or more occasions for
an additional period of up to 20 business days per extension, to permit such
Offer Condition to be satisfied; _provided, however,_ that in no event shall
Acquisition Sub: (1) be required to accept for payment, and pay for, shares of
Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the
Offer until the Marketing Period shall have been completed; (2) be required
to extend the Offer beyond the first business day immediately following the
Outside Date; or (3) be permitted to extend the Offer beyond the first
business day immediately following the Outside Date without the prior written
consent of the Company. If Parent determines not to exercise the Top-Up
Option because the exercise of the Top-Up Option in accordance with the terms
and conditions set forth in _Section 1.4_ would violate applicable Legal
Requirements, then Acquisition Sub shall elect to provide for a "subsequent
offering period" of three business days in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under
the Exchange Act ( _provided_ that Acquisition Sub shall be entitled, in its
discretion and without the consent of the Company or any other Person, to
provide for one or more extensions thereof). Acquisition Sub shall not
terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration Date without the prior
written consent of the Company except in the event that this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 8_.

(e) On the Offer Commencement Date, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall: (i)
cause to be filed with the SEC, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto,
the " _Schedule TO_ "), which will contain or incorporate by  reference: (A) Acquisition Subs offer to exchange shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer (the " _Offer to Exchange_ "); (B) a preliminary
prospectus containing the information required under Rule 14d-4(b)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (the " _Preliminary Prospectus_ "); and (C)
forms of the related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement; (ii)
file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (or similar successor
form) to register the offer and sale of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer (including amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Registration
Statement_ "), which Registration Statement shall include the Preliminary
Prospectus; and (iii) cause the Offer to Exchange, the Preliminary Prospectus
and related documents to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company
Common Stock as and to the extent required by the United States securities
laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder. Parent
and Acquisition Sub shall use reasonable efforts to cause such Schedule TO and
Registration Statement, and all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto
(collectively, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and the filing and dissemination
thereof to comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as applicable, and the rules and
regulations thereunder and with all other applicable Legal Requirements. The
Company and its legal counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Offer Documents (including all amendments and supplements
thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC and Parent and Acquisition
Sub shall give reasonable consideration to any such comments. Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall promptly notify the Company and its legal counsel upon
the receipt of any comments received by Parent, Acquisition Sub or their
legal counsel from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents,
or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Offer
Documents, and shall promptly provide the Company and its legal counsel with
copies of all written correspondence between them and their Representatives,
on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, or, if not in writing, a
description of such communication. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall give the
Company and its legal counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in
preparing the proposed response of Parent and Acquisition Sub to comments
received from the SEC or its staff and to provide comments on any proposed
response thereto, and Parent and Acquisition Sub shall give reasonable
consideration to any such comments. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the
Company: (1) shall use reasonable efforts to respond promptly to any comments
of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer; and
(2) to the extent required by the applicable requirements of United States
securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder, shall use reasonable efforts to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents to the extent such information
shall be or shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and
Parent and Acquisition Sub shall take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents, as supplemented or amended to correct such information, to be filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by the United States securities laws
and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder, to be
disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock. The Company shall
promptly furnish to Parent and Acquisition Sub all information concerning the
Acquired Corporations and the Companys stockholders that may be required or
reasonably requested in connection with any action contemplated by this
_Section 1.1(e)_.

(f) If, between the date of this Agreement and the date on which any
particular share of Company Common Stock is accepted for payment pursuant to
the Offer, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or shares of Parent
Common Stock, as the case may be, are changed into a different number or
class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of
shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, or if a
record date with respect to any such event shall occur during such period,
then each of the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted.

 

(g) Without limiting the generality of _Section 9.13_, Parent shall cause to
be provided to Acquisition Sub all of the funds necessary to purchase any
shares of Company Common Stock that Acquisition Sub becomes obligated to
purchase pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause Acquisition Sub to comply
with, on a timely basis, all of Acquisition Subs obligations under this
Agreement.

 



4 1.2 Company Actions.

 

(a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer and represents
and warrants to Parent and Acquisition Sub that the Companys board of
directors, at a meeting duly called and held, has by the unanimous vote of all
directors of the Company: (i) determined that this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to
and in the best interests of the Companys stockholders; (ii) approved and
adopted this Agreement and approved the Contemplated Transactions, including
the Offer and the Merger, in accordance with the requirements of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "); (iii)
declared the advisability of this Agreement; (iv) resolved to recommend that
the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer and tender their shares of
Company Common Stock to Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Offer and, to the
extent required to consummate the Merger, approve this Agreement (the
unanimous recommendation of the Companys board of directors that the
stockholders of the Company accept the Offer and tender their shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and approve this Agreement being
referred to as the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "); (v) to the extent
necessary, adopted a resolution having the effect of causing the Company not
to be subject to any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition,"
"interested stockholder," "business combination" or similar restriction set
forth in any state takeover law or other Legal Requirement that might
otherwise apply to the Stockholder Agreements, the Offer, the Merger or any of
the other Contemplated Transactions; and (vi) directed that the approval of
this Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of the Company, as promptly
as practicable after the Acceptance Time, if required to consummate the Merger
under the DGCL. Subject to _Section 5.3_, the Company consents to the
inclusion of the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents.

(b) Contemporaneously with the filing by Parent and Acquisition Sub of the
Schedule TO and the Registration Statement, or as promptly as practicable
thereafter on the Offer Commencement Date, the Company shall file with the SEC
and (contemporaneously with the dissemination of the Offer to Exchange, the
Preliminary Prospectus and related documents) disseminate to holders of
shares of Company Common Stock a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "
_Schedule 14D-9_ ") that shall reflect the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the information required by _Section 1.3(b)_ and, subject only
to _Section 5.3_, shall reflect the Company Board Recommendation. The Company
shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9 and the filing and
dissemination thereof to comply in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and
with all other applicable Legal Requirements, and shall ensure that the
Schedule 14D-9 and, if required by applicable Legal Requirements, the
Registration Statement, include: (i) the opinion of the financial advisor
referred to in _Section 3.26_; and (ii) a fair summary of the financial
analysis conducted by such financial advisor in accordance with all applicable
Legal Requirements. Parent and its legal counsel shall be given reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 (including any
amendment or supplement thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC and
the Company shall give reasonable consideration to any such comments. The
Company shall promptly notify Parent and its legal counsel upon the receipt of
any comments from the SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments or
supplements, to the Schedule 14D-9, and shall promptly provide Parent and its
legal counsel with copies of all written correspondence between them and their
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, or, if not
in writing, a description of such communication. The Company shall give Parent
and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in preparing the
proposed response of the Company to comments received from the SEC or its
staff and to provide comments on any proposed response thereto, and the
Company shall give reasonable consideration to any such comments. Each of
Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company: (1) shall use reasonable efforts to
respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9; and (2) to the extent required by the applicable requirements
of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder or by other
applicable Legal Requirements, shall use reasonable efforts to promptly
correct

 



5  any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 to the extent
that such information shall be or shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect and the Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the
Schedule 14D-9, as supplemented or amended to correct such information, to be
filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Legal
Requirements, to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common
Stock. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company all
information concerning Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Offer that may be
required or reasonably requested in connection with any action contemplated by
this  _Section 1.2(b)_.

(c) The Company shall promptly provide to Parent: (i) a list of the
Companys stockholders, non-objecting beneficial owners, mailing labels and
any available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of
all record holders of shares of Company Common Stock and lists of securities
positions of shares of Company Common Stock held in stock depositories, in
each case accurate and complete as of the most recent practicable date; and
(ii) such additional information (including updated lists of stockholders,
non-objecting beneficial owners, mailing labels and lists of securities
positions) and such other assistance as Parent may reasonably request in
connection with the Offer or the Merger.

1.3 Directors.

(a) Effective upon the Acceptance Time and from time to time thereafter,
Parent shall be entitled to designate, to serve on the Companys board of
directors, the number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number,
determined by multiplying: (i) the total number of directors on the Companys
board of directors (giving effect to any increase in the size of the Companys
board of directors effected pursuant to this _Section 1.3(a)_); _by_ (ii) a
fraction having a numerator equal to the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock then beneficially owned by Parent or Acquisition Sub
(including all shares of Company Common Stock accepted for payment pursuant to
the Offer), and having a denominator equal to the total number of shares
of Company Common Stock then issued and outstanding ( _provided_ that, in no
event shall Parents director designees constitute less than a majority of the
entire board of directors of the Company). The Company shall take all action
necessary to cause Parents designees to be elected or appointed to the
Companys board of directors, including seeking and accepting resignations of
incumbent directors and, if such resignations are not obtained, increasing the
size of the Companys board of directors. From and after the Acceptance Time,
to the extent requested by Parent, the Company shall also: (A) use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent the resignation of
each individual who is an officer of any of the Acquired Corporations; and
(B) cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the number of
members, rounded up to the next whole number, on: (1) each committee of the
Companys board of directors; and (2) the board of directors of each
Subsidiary of the Company (and each committee thereof) that represents at
least the same percentage as individuals designated by Parent represent on the
board of directors of the Company. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
_Section 1.3_, the Company shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that, at
all times after the Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time, at least
two of the members of the Companys board of directors are individuals who
were directors of the Company on the date of this Agreement (" _Continuing
Directors_ "); _provided, however_ , that: (x) if at any time after the
Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time there shall be only one
Continuing Director serving as a director of the Company for any reason, then
the Companys board of directors shall cause an individual selected by the
remaining Continuing Director to be appointed to serve on the Companys
board of directors (and such individual shall be deemed to be a Continuing
Director for all purposes under this Agreement); and (y) if at any time after
the Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time no Continuing Directors
remain on the Companys board of directors, then the Companys board of
directors shall appoint two individuals who are not officers, employees or
Affiliates of the Company, Parent or Acquisition Sub to serve on the Companys
board of directors (and such individuals shall be deemed to be Continuing
Directors for all purposes under this Agreement).

 



6 (b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the
Companys board of directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. In connection with the
performance of its obligations to cause Parents designees to be elected or
appointed to the Companys board of directors, the Company shall promptly
take all actions, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information
with respect to the Company and its officers and directors, as Section 14(f)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder require; _provided,_ that the
Companys obligations under _Section 1.3(a)_ shall be subject to the
Companys timely receipt of the information with respect to Parent and its
nominees, officers, directors and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder. The provisions of this _Section 1.3_
are in addition to, and shall not limit, any right that Acquisition Sub,
Parent or any Affiliate of Acquisition Sub or Parent may have (with respect
to the election of directors or otherwise) under applicable Legal Requirements
as a holder or beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock.

 

(c) Following the election or appointment of Parents designees to the
Companys board of directors pursuant to  _Section 1.3(a)_ and until the
Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall
be required to authorize any of the following actions of the Company (each, an
" _Adverse Action_ "), to the extent the action in question could reasonably
be expected to affect adversely the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
(other than Parent or Acquisition Sub): (i) any action by the Company with
respect to any amendment or waiver of any term or condition of this
Agreement, the Merger, the Promissory Note or the certificate of incorporation
or bylaws of the Company; (ii) any termination of this Agreement by the
Company; or (iii) any extension by the Company of the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or
Acquisition Sub, or any waiver or assertion of any of the Companys rights
under this Agreement. The approval of any Adverse Action by a majority of the
Continuing Directors shall constitute the valid authorization of the
Companys board of directors with respect to such Adverse Action, and no other
action on the part of the Company or by any other director of the Company
shall be required to authorize such Adverse Action.

1.4 Top-Up Option.

(a) The Company hereby grants to Parent and Acquisition Sub an irrevocable
option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only on the terms and conditions
set forth in this  _Section 1.4_, to purchase from the Company the number of
newly-issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Company Common Stock
(the " _Top-Up Shares_ ") equal to the lesser of: (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company
Common Stock owned by Parent or Acquisition Sub at the time of exercise of the
Top-Up Option, constitutes at least one share more than 90% of the number of
shares of Company Common Stock that would be outstanding on a fully-diluted
basis (which assumes conversion or exercise of all derivative securities
regardless of the conversion or exercise price, the vesting schedule or other
terms and conditions thereof) immediately after the issuance of all shares of
Company Common Stock subject to the Top-Up Option; or (ii) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock that the Company is authorized to
issue under its certificate of incorporation but that are not issued and
outstanding (and are not subscribed for or otherwise committed to be issued or
reserved for issuance) at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option.

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Parent or Acquisition Sub, in whole
or in part, at any time at or after the Acceptance Time. If: (i) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Acquisition Sub immediately
following the Acceptance Time does not constitute at least one share more than
90% of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that are then outstanding
on a fully-diluted basis; (ii) the exercise of the Top-Up Option would result
in Parent or Acquisition Sub owning at least one share more than 90% of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that are then outstanding on a fully-
diluted basis; and (iii) the exercise of the Top-Up Option in accordance with
this _Section 1.4_ would not violate any applicable legal requirements, then
the Top-Up

 



7  Option shall be exercised by Parent or Acquisition Sub. The aggregate
purchase price payable for the shares of Company Common Stock being purchased
by Parent or Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall be
determined by multiplying the number of such shares by the Offer Price (it
being understood that, if Parent elects to exercise the Top-Up Option, the
Offer Price for purposes of this _Section 1.4(b)_ shall be equal to: (A) the
Cash Consideration; _plus_ (B) the dollar amount determined by multiplying the
Stock Consideration by the average of the closing sale prices of a share of
Parent Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market for each
of the 10 consecutive trading days prior to the date on which the Top-Up
Option is exercised). Such purchase price may be paid by Parent or Acquisition
Sub, at its election either: (1) in cash, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds; or (2) by: (x) paying in cash, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an amount equal to not less than the aggregate
par value of the Top-Up Shares; and (y) executing and delivering to the
Company a full recourse promissory note having a principal amount equal to
the aggregate purchase price pursuant to the Top-Up Option less the amount
paid in cash pursuant to the preceding clause "(x)" (the " _Promissory Note_
"). The Promissory Note: (I) shall be due on the first anniversary of the
date of execution and delivery thereof; (II) shall bear simple interest at the
rate of 3% per annum, payable in arrears at maturity; (III) shall be full
recourse against Parent and Acquisition Sub; (IV) may be prepaid, in whole or
in part, at any time without premium or penalty; and (V) shall have no other
material terms. Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company acknowledge and agree
that, in any appraisal proceeding related to this Agreement, the fair value
of the shares of Company Common Stock subject to the appraisal proceeding
shall be determined in accordance with the DGCL without regard to the exercise
by Parent or Acquisition Sub of the Top-Up Option, any shares of Company
Common Stock issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option or the Promissory Note.

(c) In the event Parent or Acquisition Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up
Option, Parent or Acquisition Sub shall deliver to the Company a notice
setting forth: (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that Parent or
Acquisition Sub intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option; (ii) the
manner in which Parent or Acquisition Sub intends to pay the applicable
exercise price; and (iii) the place and time at which the closing of the
purchase of such shares of Company Common Stock by Parent or Acquisition Sub
is to take place. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt
of such notice, notify Acquisition Sub of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock then outstanding, the number of shares of Company Common Stock
then outstanding on a fully-diluted basis and the number of Top-Up Shares. At
the closing of the purchase of such shares of Company Common Stock, Parent or
Acquisition Sub shall cause to be delivered to the Company the consideration
required to be delivered in exchange for such shares, and the Company shall
cause to be issued to Parent or Acquisition Sub (as the case may be) a
certificate representing such shares. Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledge
that any Top-Up Shares issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act and that all such Top-Up Shares will be
issued in reliance upon an applicable exemption from registration under the
Securities Act. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub hereby represents and
warrants to the Company that Parent and Acquisition Sub are, and will be, upon
the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, "accredited investors," as defined in Rule
501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Acquisition Sub agrees that the
Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option are being and will be acquired by Parent or Acquisition Sub for the
purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in
connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the
Securities Act).

(d) Without the prior written consent of the Company, the right to exercise
the Top-Up Option granted pursuant to this Agreement may be exercised only
once and shall not be assigned by Parent or Acquisition Sub. Any attempted
assignment in violation of this _Section 1.4(d)_ shall be null and void.

 



8 Section 2\. THE MERGER

 

2.1 Merger of Acquisition Sub into the Company. At the Effective Time, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in

") shall take place at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, 201 Redwood

_Closing Date_ "), which shall be no later than the second business day after

waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in
_Section 7_ (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements) waiver of those conditions) or at
such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing by the parties.
Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a certificate of merger
satisfying the applicable requirements of the DGCL shall be duly executed by
the Company in connection with the Closing and, concurrently with or as soon
as practicable following the Closing, filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware. The Merger shall become effective upon the date and
time of the filing of such certificate of merger with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as may be specified in such
certificate of merger with the consent of Parent (the time as of which the
Merger becomes effective being referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

2.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. Unless
otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time:

(a) the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended in its entirety pursuant to the Merger at the Effective Time or
immediately thereafter to conform to the certificate of incorporation of
Acquisition Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except
that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "OPNET Technologies,
Inc." and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein
or by applicable Legal Requirements;

 

(b) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated at
the Effective Time or immediately thereafter to conform to the bylaws of
Acquisition Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and, as
so amended, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Legal Requirements;
and 

(c) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after
the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are directors and
officers of Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. 

 



9 ---|--- 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or any stockholder
of the Company:

 

(i) any shares of Company Common Stock then held by the Company (or held in
the Companys treasury) shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

(ii) any shares of Company Common Stock then held by any wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company shall remain issued and outstanding and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 

(iii) any shares of Company Common Stock then held by Parent, Acquisition Sub
or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor;

(iv) except as provided in clauses "(i)," "(ii)" and "(iii)" above and subject
to _Section 2.5(b)_, _Section 2.5(c)_, _Section 2.6(e)_ and  _Section
2.7_, each share of Company Common Stock then outstanding shall be converted
into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration
(the " _Merger Price_ "), without interest thereon; and 

(v) each share of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Acquisition
Sub then outstanding shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) If, during the Pre-Closing Period, the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as the case may be, are changed into a
different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, or if
a record date with respect to any such event shall occur during such period,
then the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration shall be appropriately
adjusted.

(c) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued by virtue of
the Merger, no dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any such fractional share
interest, and such fractional share interest will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Each holder
of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder) shall, in lieu of such
fractional share, be paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest
whole cent), without interest, determined by multiplying such fraction by the
closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market on
the Closing Date.

 

(d) At the Effective Time, shares of Company Restricted Stock that vest as a
result of the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, will be treated
as outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and converted automatically into
the right to receive the Merger Price pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)(iv)_. ---|--- 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") to receive the funds and shares of Parent
Common Stock for purposes of effecting the payment and distribution of the
Merger Price contemplated by _Section 2.5(a)(iv)_. Promptly after the
Effective Time, Parent shall: (i) issue and deliver or cause to be delivered,
to the Exchange Agent evidence of shares in book-entry form representing the
aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to
_Section 2.5(a)(iv)_ in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock; and (ii) deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent:
(A) cash in an amount representing the aggregate Cash Consideration payable
pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)(iv)_ in exchange for outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock; and (B) from time to time as needed, cash in amounts
that are sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
_Section 2.5(c)_, in each case, to be paid in respect of Stock Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares by the Exchange Agent in accordance with this
Agreement. Such funds and evidence of Parent Common Stock deposited with the
Exchange Agent are referred to herein as the " _Payment Fund_." Such funds, to
the extent cash, shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by
Parent, in its sole discretion, pending payment thereof by the Exchange Agent
to the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock. Earnings from such
investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent, and no part of
such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of shares of Company
Common Stock.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent will
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to the Persons who, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, were record holders of certificates representing shares of
Company Common Stock (" _Stock Certificates_ ") or non-certificated shares of
Company Common Stock represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "): (i)
a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that delivery
of Stock Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Stock
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Stock Certificates to the
Exchange Agent); and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Upon surrender of a Stock Certificate
or a Book-Entry Share to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together with a duly
executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably
required by the Exchange Agent or Parent: (A) the holder of such Stock
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Price payable to such holder pursuant to  _Section
2.5(a)(iv)_ in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Stock Certificate or Book-
Entry Share; and (B) the Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered
shall be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of any shares of
Company Common Stock which are not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment of the Merger Price may be made to a Person other than the
holder in whose name the Stock Certificate so surrendered is registered, if
any such Stock Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer, and such holder shall pay any transfer or other
similar Taxes or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such
Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Payment of the Merger Price with
respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to a Person in whose name such
Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 2.6(b)_, each Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed,
from and after the Effective Time, to represent solely the right to receive
the Merger Price for each share of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by
such Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share. If any Stock Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a
condition to the payment of any cash amount pursuant to  _Section
2.5(a)(iv)_, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Stock
Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such
sum as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with
respect to such Stock Certificate. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on
any cash payable to holders of Stock Certificates pursuant to the provisions
of this  _Section 2_. (c) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to holders
of Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares as of the date 180 days after the
date on which the Merger becomes effective shall be delivered to Parent upon
demand, and any holders of Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have
not theretofore surrendered their Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with this _Section 2.6_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for
satisfaction of their claims for payment pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)(iv)_.
None of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder or former holder of Company
Common Stock or to any other Person with respect to any cash amounts delivered
to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law,
escheat law or similar Legal Requirement.

(d) At the Effective Time, holders of Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights as stockholders of the Company, and the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer
of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on such stock
transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a
valid Stock Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
such Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as
provided in this _Section 2.6_.

 

(e) The Exchange Agent, Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as the Exchange Agent, Parent,
Acquisition Sub or the Surviving Corporation determines in good faith is
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or any provision
of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other Legal Requirement. To
the extent any such amounts are so deducted or withheld and remitted to
the appropriate Governmental Body, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 

(f) If any Stock Certificate has not been surrendered by the earlier of: (i)
the fifth anniversary of the date on which the Merger becomes effective; or
(ii) the date immediately prior to the date on which the consideration that
such Stock Certificate represents the right to receive would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Body, then such consideration
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claim or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



   2.7 | Dissenting Shares. 
---|--- 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, shares of
Company Common Stock held by a holder who has made a proper demand for
appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL and who has otherwise complied with all applicable provisions
of Section 262 of the DGCL (any such shares being referred to as " _Dissenting
Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses
such holders appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to
such shares) shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the
Merger Price in accordance with  _Section 2.5(a)(iv)_, but shall be entitled
only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting
Shares.

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect or otherwise), then such shares shall be deemed automatically to
have been converted into, as of the Effective Time, and to represent only,
the right to receive the Merger Price in accordance with _Section_   _2.5(a)(iv)_ , without interest thereon, upon surrender of a Stock
Certificate or Book-Entry Share representing such shares in accordance with
_Section 2.6_.

 

(c) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt
notice of any demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any
other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL; and (ii) the opportunity to participate
in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not make any payment or
settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such
demand, notice or instrument unless Parent shall have given its prior written
consent to such payment or settlement offer.

2.8 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Acquisition
Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Acquisition Sub, in the
name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

Section 3\. Representations and Warranties of the Company

Except as disclosed in any Company SEC Document filed with the SEC on or after
March 31, 2012 and prior to the date of this Agreement and publicly available

including and giving effect to any factual or historical statements included

(a) The Company has no Subsidiaries except for the Company Subsidiaries, and
neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries owns any capital stock
of, or any equity interest of any nature in, any other Entity, other than the

to Parent accurate and complete copies of the currently effective certificate
of incorporation, bylaws and other charter and organizational documents of the
respective Acquired Corporations, including all amendments thereto. The
Company is not in violation of its certificate of incorporation.

Requirements, in each case as previously disclosed to Parent in writing, or as
required by this Agreement) in a manner that would materially affect any
Company Associate.

(i) No Company Employee Plan or Company Employee Agreement provides (except
at no cost to the Acquired Corporations), or reflects or represents any

insurance, retiree health benefits or other retiree employee welfare benefits
to any Person for any reason, except as may be required by Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (" _COBRA_ ") or other
applicable Legal Requirements. Other than commitments made that involve no
future costs to any of the Acquired Corporations, to the knowledge of the
Company, no Acquired Corporation has ever represented, promised or contracted
(whether in oral or written form) to any Company Associate (either
individually or as a group) or any other Person that any such Company
Associate or other Person would be provided with retiree life insurance,
retiree health benefits or other retiree employee welfare benefits, except to
the extent required by COBRA or other applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(j) Each of the Acquired Corporations has, prior to the Effective Time,
complied in all material respects with the health care continuation
requirements of COBRA, the requirements of the Family and Medical Leave Act of
1993, as amended, the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and any similar provisions of
state law applicable to any Company Associate.

(k) Each of the Company Employee Plans and Company Employee Agreements is and
has been established, operated and administered in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and with applicable Legal Requirements, including
ERISA, the Code, applicable U.S. and non-U.S. securities laws and
regulations and applicable foreign Legal Requirements. The Acquired
Corporations have performed in all material respects all obligations required
to be performed by them under, are not in material default or violation of,
and have no knowledge of either any material default or violation by any
other party to, or any circumstances that exist that are reasonably expected
to result in a material default or violation of, the terms of any Company
Employee Plan or Employee Agreement. Each Company Employee Plan intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and each trust intended to be
qualified under Section 501(a) of the Code has obtained a favorable
determination letter (or opinion letter, if applicable) as to its
qualified status under the Code, incorporates or has been amended to
incorporate all provisions required to comply currently applicable
legislation, and to the Companys knowledge, there has been no event,
condition or circumstance that has resulted, or, would reasonably be expected
to result in disqualification under the Code. There are no actions, suits or
claims pending, threatened in writing, or to the Companys knowledge,
reasonably anticipated (other than routine claims for benefits) against any
Company Employee Plan or against the assets of any Company Employee Plan. No
breach of fiduciary duty has occurred as a result of which any of the Acquired
Corporations or one its fiduciaries has a currently outstanding
material liability or would reasonably be expected to incur a material
liability. Each  Company Employee Plan (other than any Company Employee Plan to be terminated
prior to the Effective Time in accordance with this Agreement) can be amended,
terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time in accordance
with its terms, without material liability to any of the Acquired Corporations
(except for benefits protected under Section 411(d) of the Code or Section
204(g) of ERISA and other than ordinary administration expenses). No Company
Employee Plan is under audit, investigation or other Legal Proceeding by the
Company, the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Labor, or any other
Governmental Body, nor is any such audit, investigation or Legal Proceeding
pending, threatened in writing, or, to the Companys knowledge, anticipated.
No "prohibited transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or
Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt under Section 408 of
ERISA, has occurred with respect to any Company Employee Plan. All material
contributions, premiums and expenses to or in respect of each Company Employee
Plan have been paid in full or, to the extent not yet due, have
been adequately accrued on the appropriate Acquired Corporations financial
statements.

(l) None of the Acquired Corporations has incurred in the past six years or
reasonably expects to incur, either directly or indirectly (including as a
result of an indemnification obligation), any material liability under Title I
or IV of ERISA or the penalty, excise tax or joint and several liability
provisions of the Code or any foreign Legal Requirement relating to employee
benefit plans (including Section 406, 409A, 502(i), 502(l), 4069 or 4212(c) of
ERISA, or Section 4971, 4975 through 4980 of the Code), or under any
agreement, instrument or Legal Requirement pursuant to or under which any of
the Acquired Corporations or any Company Employee Plan has agreed to indemnify
or is required to indemnify any Person against liability incurred under, or
for a violation or failure to satisfy the requirements of, any such agreement,
instrument or Legal Requirement, and to the Companys knowledge, no event,
transaction or condition has occurred, exists or is reasonably expected to
occur which would reasonably result in any such material liability to any of
the Acquired Corporations or, after the Closing, to Parent.

(m) Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, nor the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger or any of the other Contemplated
Transactions (either alone or in combination with another event, whether
contingent or otherwise) will: (i) result in any bonus, severance, change in
control or other compensatory payment or benefit to any current or former
employee, consultant or director of any of the Acquired Corporations (whether
or not under any Company Employee Plan or Company Employee Agreement), except
for payments of the Merger Price as provided in this Agreement; (ii)
materially increase the benefits payable or provided to, or result in a
forgiveness of indebtedness for, any such employee, consultant or director;
(iii) accelerate the vesting, funding or time of payment of any compensation,
equity award or other similar benefit; or (iv) give rise directly or
indirectly to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant
to 280G of the Code. The Company has provided Parent with a list of
individuals who are "disqualified individuals" within the meaning of Section
280G of the Code with respect to the Offer or the Merger or any of the other
Contemplated Transactions.

(n) Under each Company Employee Plan that is a single employer defined
benefit plan, as of the last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to
the date of this Agreement, the actuarially determined present value of all
"benefit liabilities," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as
determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in the Company
Employee Plans most recent actuarial valuation, which such actuarial
valuation has been Made Available to Parent) did not exceed the then current
value of the assets of such Company Employee Plan, and there has been no
material adverse change in the financial condition of such Company Employee
Plan (with respect to either assets or benefits) since the last day of
the most recent plan year. The fair market value of the assets of each funded
Foreign Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Foreign Plan funded
through insurance or the book reserve established for any Foreign Plan,
together with any accrued contributions, is  sufficient in all material respects to procure or provide for the accrued
benefit obligations with respect to all current and former participants in
such Foreign Plan, as determined according to the actuarial assumptions and
valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to and
obligations under such Foreign Plan. Neither the execution of this Agreement
nor the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions shall cause any the
assets or insurance obligations to be materially less than the benefit
obligations under such a single employer defined benefit plan or funded
Foreign Plan.

(o) None of the Acquired Corporations maintains any plan, agreement or
arrangement, whether formal or informal, that provides material benefits in
the nature of severance or has outstanding any liabilities with respect to
material severance benefits.

material liability arising out of an indemnification, guarantee, hold harmless
or similar agreement) relating to any insurance contract held under or
purchased to fund an Company Employee Plan, the issuer of which, to the
Companys knowledge, is or was insolvent or in reorganization or the payments
under which were suspended.

(q) Except for the Company Option Plans and the ESPP and as set forth in _Part
3.17(q)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, none of the Acquired Corporations
maintains any plan, program or arrangement or is a party to any contract that
provides any material benefits or provides for material payments to any Person
in, based on or measured by the value of any equity security of, or interest
in, the Acquired Corporations.

 

(r) No Acquired Corporation has undertaken any option re-pricing or option
exchange program with respect to current Company Options.

(s) With respect to each Company Employee Plan and with respect to each state
workers compensation arrangement that is funded wholly or partially through
an insurance policy or public or private fund, all premiums required to have
been paid by the Acquired Corporations to date under such insurance policy or
fund have been paid, all premiums required to be paid by the Acquired
Corporations under the insurance policy or fund through the Closing Date will
have been paid on or before the Closing Date and, as of the Closing Date, to
the Companys knowledge, there will be no material liability of any the
Acquired Corporations under any such insurance policy, fund or ancillary
agreement with respect to such insurance policy in the nature of a retroactive
rate adjustment, loss sharing arrangement or other actual or contingent
material liability arising wholly or partially out of events occurring prior
to the Closing Date, other than routine claims for benefits.

(t) The Company has provided Parent with a list of all current employees by
position of each of the Acquired Corporations as of the date of this
Agreement, and correctly reflects, in all material respects, their wage or
salary, any other compensation payable to them (including compensation payable
pursuant to bonus, deferred compensation, commission or severance
arrangements), their dates of employment and their positions and work
locations.

for, any collective bargaining agreement or other Contract with a labor
organization or works council representing any of its employees and there are
no labor organizations or works councils representing, purporting to   represent or, to the Companys knowledge, seeking to represent any employees
of any of the Acquired Corporations. During the three years prior to the date
of this Agreement, none of the Acquired Corporations has had any strike,
slowdown, work stoppage, organizing campaign, dispute or controversy
concerning union representation, by or with respect to any of its employees,
or lockout. All of the U.S.-based employees of the Acquired Corporations are
"at will" employees. The Company has Made Available to Parent or its advisors
accurate and complete copies of all employee manuals and handbooks, disclosure
materials, policy statements and written agreements relating to the
employment of the employees of the Acquired Corporations.

(w) Each of the Acquired Corporations: (i) is in material compliance with all
applicable Legal Requirements and any order, ruling, decree, judgment or

employment, employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, wages,
hours or other labor related matters, including Legal Requirements, orders,
rulings, decrees, judgments and awards relating to discrimination, wages and
hours, labor relations, leave of absence requirements, and occupational
health and safety, wrongful discharge or violation of the personal rights of

date of this Agreement, none of the Acquired Corporations has effectuated: (A)
a "plant closing" or partial "plant closing" (as defined in the Worker

independent contractor: (i) has within the last four years provided services
to any of the Acquired Corporations for a period of six consecutive months or
longer; or (ii) is eligible to participate in any Company Employee Plan other
than a Company Option Plan. All temporary or leased employees of the Acquired
Corporations who were paid directly by the Acquired Corporations were
classified and paid correctly as mandated by the Fair Labor Standards Act and
other relevant Legal Requirements. To the knowledge of the Company, all
temporary or leased employees of the Acquired Corporations who were paid by an
employee leasing agency were classified and paid correctly by that agency as
mandated by the Fair Labor Standards Act and other relevant Legal
Requirements.

of any of the Acquired Corporations, including charges of unfair labor
practices or harassment complaints. To the Companys knowledge, none of the
Acquired Corporations has engaged in any unfair labor practices within the
meaning of the National Labor Relations Act. Each of the Acquired Corporations
has good labor relations with any labor union or other worker representation
entity representing its employees, and to the Companys knowledge neither the

any of its Affiliates with current or future directors, officers or employees
of the Company and its Affiliates as an "employment compensation, severance or
other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2)
under the Exchange Act; and (ii) has taken all other actions and made all
other determinations necessary or advisable to ensure that any such
arrangements fall within the safe harbor provisions of Rule 14d?10(d).

Employee Plan and Company Employee Agreement between any Acquired Corporation
and any Company Associate that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
subject to Section 409A of the Code (or any state law equivalent) and the
regulations and guidance thereunder (" _Section 409A_ "). Each such
nonqualified deferred compensation plan, if any, that is subject to Section

includable in the gross income of any Company Associate under Section 409A of
the Code with respect to any Company Employee Plans or Company Employee
Agreements in effect prior to the Effective Time. There is no agreement, plan
or arrangement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
which, individually or collectively, would reasonably be expected to give rise
to a Tax under Section 409A or that would reasonably be expected to give rise
to a Company or any Company Subsidiary reporting obligation under Section
409A.

EDGAR (the " _Parent SEC Documents_ ") (excluding any disclosures set forth in
any section of any Parent SEC Document entitled "Risk Factors" or "Forward-
Looking Statements" or any other disclosures included in such document that
are general cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature but, for the
purpose of clarification, including and giving effect to any factual or
historical statements included in any such statements), Parent and Acquisition
Sub represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

4.1 Due Organization, Etc. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware and has all necessary corporate power and authority to: (i)
conduct its business in the manner in which its business is currently being
conducted; (ii) own and use its assets in the manner in which its assets are
currently owned and used; and (iii) perform its obligations under all
Contracts by which it is bound.

4.2 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. Parent has made available to the
Company accurate and complete copies of the currently effective certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, including all amendments thereto. Parent is not in

41 4.3 Capitalization, Etc.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of: (i) 600,000,000 shares
of Parent Common Stock of which 153,893,507 shares are issued and outstanding
as of the date of this Agreement; and (ii) 30,000,000 shares of preferred
stock of which no shares are issued or outstanding. As of the date hereof,
Parent does not hold any shares of its capital stock in its treasury, and

The rights and privileges of the Parent Common Stock are as set forth in
Parents restated certificate of incorporation. The shares of Parent Common

issuance, be duly authorized and validly issued and, at the Acceptance Time
and the Effective Time, as applicable, all such shares will be fully paid and
non-assessable, free and clear of any Encumbrances imposed by Parent and free

has reserved from its duly authorized capital stock the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement as of the Closing
Date.

all necessary corporate right, power and authority to perform their
obligations under this Agreement, and the execution, delivery and performance
by Parent and Acquisition Sub of this Agreement have been duly authorized by

in the case of the Merger, obtaining the vote or consent of Parent as sole
stockholder of Acquisition Sub) and their respective boards of directors.
Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Company, this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of Parent and Acquisition Sub, enforceable against them in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

 

4.5 Non-Contravention. (a) Except for any action that may be required by, and
for compliance with, the Exchange Act, the Securities Act, state securities
or "blue sky" laws, the DGCL, the HSR Act, any foreign antitrust or

by Parent and Acquisition Sub does not, and the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions (including the Offer and the Merger), will not (with

(i) contravene, conflict with or result in a violation of any of the
provisions of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other charter or
organizational documents of Parent and Acquisition Sub;

to any Person.

 

(b) Except as may be required by the Exchange Act, the Securities Act, state
securities or "blue sky" laws, the DGCL, the HSR Act, any foreign antitrust
or competition-related Legal Requirement and the rules and regulations of the
Nasdaq Stock Market, neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub will be required to
make any filing with or give any notice to, or to obtain any Consent from,
any Governmental Body in connection with: (i) the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement by Parent and Acquisition Sub; or (ii) the
consummation of the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions.

 

4.6 Financial Advisor. Except for Goldman, Sachs and Co., no broker, finder or
investment banker is entitled to any brokerage fee or commission or expense
reimbursement for acting as financial advisor to Parent or Acquisition Sub in
connection with the Offer, the Merger and any other Contemplated Transaction
based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or the Acquisition Sub
(it being understood that this _Section 4.6_ shall not apply to any Person
(other than Goldman, Sachs and Co.) providing services in connection with any
financing being obtained in connection with the Contemplated Transactions).

Exchange Act (as the case may be); and (ii) none of the Parent SEC Documents
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the

only in accordance with the authorizations of management and directors; and

effect on the financial statements. Parent maintains a system of "disclosure
controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Parents management,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure,

in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the
SECs rules. 

(c) The financial statements (including any related notes) contained in the
Parent SEC Documents: (i) complied as to form in all material respects with
the published rules and regulations of the SEC applicable thereto; (ii) were
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied
on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered (except as may be
indicated in the notes to such financial statements or, in the case of
unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC, and except that
the unaudited financial statements may not contain footnotes and are subject
to normal and recurring year-end adjustments that will not, individually or
in the aggregate, be material in amount); and (iii) fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results
of operations and cash flows of Parent and its Subsidiaries for the periods
covered thereby.

(d) Since June 4, 2010, neither Parent, Parents independent accountants, the
board of directors of Parent, the audit committee of the board of directors of
Parent, nor any officer of Parent, has received any oral or written
notification of any: (i) "significant deficiency" or "material weakness" in
the design or operation of the internal controls over financial reporting of
Parent that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect in any material
respect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information or any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
other employees of Parent who have a significant role in the internal
controls over financial reporting of Parent; or (ii) any material complaint,
allegation or assertion regarding any of the foregoing.

(e) Since June 4, 2010, no attorney representing Parent, whether or not
employed thereby, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
laws by Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents or

materially delaying or making illegal, the Offer, the Merger or any of the
other Contemplated Transactions.

 

(b) There is no order, writ, injunction, judgment or decree of any
Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction to which Parent is subject that
would have the effect of preventing, or materially delaying or interfering
with, or making illegal, the Offer, the Merger or any of the Contemplated
Transactions.

4.11 Ownership of Shares. As of the date of this Agreement, none of Parent,
Acquisition Sub or any of Parents Subsidiaries owns (directly or indirectly,

delivered to the Company accurate and complete copies of: (i) a fully executed
debt commitment letter (together with all annexes, schedules and exhibits
thereto) from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and Goldman Sachs Bank USA
(the " _Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to the terms, but subject to the
conditions expressly set forth therein, of which the counterparties thereto
have committed to provide Parent and Acquisition Sub with debt financing in
the amounts set forth therein for purposes of financing the Offer (such debt
financing, the " _Debt Financing_ ").

 

(b) The Commitment Letter is and each definitive agreement with respect to the
Debt Financing (which definitive agreements are referred to collectively in
this Agreement as the " _Definitive Financing Agreements_ ") entered into
after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Acceptance Time (if any),
will be, in each case, a legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of
Parent and Acquisition Sub and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties
thereto in accordance with their respective terms and subject to: (i) the
respective conditions expressly set forth therein; (ii) laws of
general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of
debtors; and (iii) rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive
relief and other equitable remedies. As of the date of this Agreement, the
Commitment Letter has not been withdrawn, modified, terminated or rescinded
in any respect, amended, restated or otherwise modified or waived. There are
no conditions precedent or contingencies related to

 



45  the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Debt
Financing, other than as expressly set forth in or expressly contemplated by
the Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side
letters or other contracts or arrangements related to the Debt Financing
(except for: (x) customary fee letters, a complete copy of each of which has

Debt Financing) redacted, relating to the Debt Financing between Parent and
Acquisition Sub, on the one hand, and the providers of the Debt Financing, on
the other hand; and (y) customary engagement letters) other than the
Commitment Letter.

(c) As of the date of this Agreement: (i) no event has occurred which would
constitute a breach or default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time
or both would constitute a default), in each case, on the part of Parent or
Acquisition Sub nor, to Parents knowledge, any other counterparty thereto,
under the Commitment Letter; and (ii) neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub has
any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing will
not be satisfied or that the Debt Financing or any other funds necessary for
the satisfaction of all of Parents and Acquisitions Subs obligations under
this Agreement will not be available to Parent at the Acceptance Time and the
Effective Time, as applicable. As of the date of this Agreement, neither
Parent nor Acquisition Sub is aware of any actual or potential failure to
satisfy any condition precedent or other contingency expressly set forth in
the Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent and
Acquisition Sub have no reason to believe that they will be unable to satisfy
the conditions to funding contained in the Commitment Letter. As of the date
of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub is aware of any fact or
occurrence that makes any of the representations or warranties of Parent or
Acquisition Sub relating to Parent and Acquisition Sub in the Commitment
Letter inaccurate in any material respect. To the extent required, Parent has
fully paid all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid prior to the
date of this Agreement pursuant to the Commitment Letter.

(ii) Parent shall promptly, after it becomes aware of any of the following,
notify the Company, orally and in writing of: (A) the occurrence or non-

(e) The Company shall timely exercise in full any right or option it may have
to repurchase shares of its capital stock which is or becomes exercisable
during the Pre-Closing Period from any current or former employee, consultant,
officer, member of the board of directors or other Person upon termination of
such Persons service to any of the Acquired Corporations where

however_ , that the Company shall use reasonable efforts to notify Parent in
writing at least five days in advance of any such repurchase and,
notwithstanding the above, shall only exercise any such repurchase right to
the extent directed by Parent in writing.

5.3 No Solicitation.

 

(a) The Company shall not directly or indirectly, shall ensure that each other
Acquired Corporation and all Representatives of the Acquired Corporations do
not, directly or indirectly, and shall not authorize or permit its employees
or the other Acquired Corporations employees who are not officers or
directors to, directly or indirectly (other than with respect to Parent and
Acquisition Sub): (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, assist or
facilitate the making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal
or Acquisition Inquiry (including by approving any transaction, or approving
any Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates) becoming an "interested
stockholder," for purposes of

 



51  Section 203 of the DGCL); (ii) furnish or otherwise provide access to any
non-public information regarding any of the Acquired Corporations to any
Person in connection with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry; or (iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any
Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry (except
to disclose the existence of this  _Section 5.3_ and this Agreement).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in  _Section 5.3(a)_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company may
furnish non-public information regarding the Acquired Corporations to, and
enter into discussions or negotiations with, any Person in response to (and
in connection with) an unsolicited, bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry that is submitted to the Company by such Person (and not
withdrawn) and could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Offer
if: (i) no Acquired Corporation shall have breached the provisions of this
_Section 5.3_ and no Representative of any Acquired Corporation shall have
taken any action that would constitute a breach of the provisions of this 
_Section 5.3_ if such action had been taken by an Acquired Corporation; (ii)
the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after having
taken into account the advice of the Companys independent financial advisor
and the Companys outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Offer; and (iii) concurrently or prior to furnishing any such non-
public information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such
Person, the Company: (A) gives Parent written notice of the identity of such
Person and of the Companys intention to furnish non-public information to,
or enter into discussions or negotiations with, such Person; and (B) receives
from such Person, and delivers to Parent a copy of, an executed
confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on the use and
disclosure of all non-public written and oral information furnished to such
Person by or on behalf of the Acquired Corporations and customary "standstill"
provisions and containing other provisions no less favorable to the Company
than the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement and prior to or
concurrently with furnishing any such non-public information to such Person,
the Company furnishes such non-public information to Parent (to the extent
such non-public information has not been previously furnished by the Company
to Parent.

(c) If the Company or any other Acquired Corporation or any of their
respective Representatives receives an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Inquiry at any time during the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall promptly
(and in no event later than: (A) 24 hours after receipt of such Acquisition
Proposal or written Acquisition Inquiry; or (B) 48 hours after receipt of
such Acquisition Inquiry that is not in writing) advise Parent orally and in
writing of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry (including the
identity of the Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry, the material terms and conditions thereof, and, if
available, any written documentation received by such Acquired Corporation
setting forth such terms and conditions). Notwithstanding the foregoing, an
Acquired Corporation shall not be obligated to advise Parent of such
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry in the manner contemplated by the
previous sentence if doing so would violate any written agreement between the
Company and a third party that was entered into prior to September 18, 2012;
_provided, however,_ that unless and until Parent is advised of such
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry in the manner contemplated by the
previous sentence (including by providing Parent with the identity of the
Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry),
the Acquired Corporations and their Representatives shall be prohibited from
engaging in any discussions or negotiations with such third party (other than
to inform such third party that no discussions or negotiations may take place
unless such third party consents to such disclosure) and from providing non-
public information to such third party. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed with respect to the status of any such Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry and any modification or proposed modification
thereto.

 



52 (d) The Company shall, and shall ensure that each other Acquired Corporation
and all Representatives and employees of the Acquired Corporations,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing solicitation,
encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any Person that relate to any
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry.

(e) The Company: (i) agrees that it will not, and shall ensure that each other
Acquired Corporation will not, release or permit the release of any Person
from, or amend or waive or permit the amendment or waiver of any provision of,
any confidentiality, non-solicitation, no-hire, "standstill" or similar
agreement or provision to which any of the Acquired Corporations is or
becomes a party or under which any of the Acquired Corporations has or
acquires any rights (including the "standstill" provision contained in any
confidentiality agreement entered into by the Company pursuant to  _Section
5.3(b)(iv)(B)_); and (ii) will use its best efforts to enforce or cause to be
enforced each such agreement at the request of Parent. The Company also shall
promptly: (A) request each Person that has executed a confidentiality
agreement or similar agreement in connection with its consideration of a
possible Acquisition Proposal or investment in any Acquired Corporation to
return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such
Person by or on behalf of any of the Acquired Corporations; and (B) prohibit
any third party from having access to any physical or electronic data rooms
relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal.

 

(f) Except as permitted by _Section 5.3(g)_ or _Section 5.3(h)_, neither the
board of directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall: (i)
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub, permit
the withdrawal or modification in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition
Sub, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent
or Acquisition Sub, the Company Board Recommendation (it being understood that
the Company Board Recommendation shall be deemed to have been modified in a
manner adverse to Parent if it shall no longer be unanimous) or
resolve, agree or propose to take any of the actions contemplated by this
clause "(i)" (any action described in this clause "(i)" being referred to as
an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "); or (ii) approve, endorse, accept or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse, accept or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal, or cause or permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other similar document or Contract constituting or relating to, or that is
intended to, contemplates or is reasonably likely to result in, an
Acquisition Transaction, other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
_Section 5.3(b)(iii)(B)_, or resolve, agree or propose to take any of the
actions contemplated by this clause "(ii)."

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(f)_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement, the board of directors of the Company may, at
any time prior to the Acceptance Time, make an Adverse Recommendation Change
and thereafter may cause the Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with _Section 8.1(f)_ and, concurrently with such termination, cause the
Company to enter into a Specified Definitive Acquisition Agreement in
accordance and subject to compliance with the provisions of _Section 8.1(f)_
if: (i) an unsolicited, bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal that did not
otherwise result from a breach of the provisions of this _Section 5.3_ is
made to the Company and is not withdrawn; (ii) the Companys board of
directors determines in good faith, after having taken into account the
advice of the Companys independent financial advisor and the advice of the
Companys outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Offer; (iii) the Companys board of directors determines in good
faith, after having taken into account the advice of the Companys outside
legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Offer, failure to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change or failure to take action pursuant to  _Section
8.1(f) _would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Companys board
of directors under applicable Delaware law; (iv) prior to effecting such
Adverse Recommendation Change or taking action pursuant to  _Section
8.1(f)_, the

 



53  Companys board of directors shall have given Parent at least five business
days prior written notice: (A) that it has received a Superior Offer that did
not result from a breach of any of the provisions of this _Section 5.3_ or
any "standstill" or similar agreement or provision under which any Acquired
Corporation has any rights; (B) that it intends to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or take action pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_ as a
result of such Superior Offer; and (C) specifying the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Offer, including the identity of the Person making
such offer (and attaching the most current and complete version of any
written agreement or other document relating thereto) (it being understood and
agreed that any change to the consideration payable in connection with such
Superior Offer or any other material modification thereto shall require a new
five business days advance written notice by the Company (except that the
five business day period referred to above shall be reduced to three business
days)); (v) during any such notice period(s), the Company engages (to the
extent requested by Parent) in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend
this Agreement in such a manner that such Superior Offer would no longer
constitute a Superior Offer; and (vi) at the time of any Adverse
Recommendation Change and the taking of action pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_,
the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after taking
into account the advice of the Companys independent financial advisor and the
advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change and the failure to take action pursuant to
_Section 8.1(f)_ would still be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Companys board of directors under applicable Delaware law in light of such
Superior Offer (taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent as a result of the negotiations required by clause "(v)" or
otherwise). 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(f)_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement, the board of directors of the Company may, at
any time prior to the Acceptance Time, make an Adverse Recommendation Change,
if: (i) there shall occur or arise after the date of this Agreement a material
event, material development or material change in circumstances that does not
relate to any Acquisition Proposal that was not known by the Companys board
of directors on the date of this Agreement (or if known, the consequences of
which are not known to or reasonably foreseeable by the Companys board of
directors as of the date hereof), which event, development or change in
circumstance, or any material consequences thereof, becomes known to the
Companys board of directors prior to the Acceptance Time (any such material
event, material development or material change in circumstances unrelated to
an Acquisition Proposal being referred to as an " _Intervening Event_ "); (ii)
no director had knowledge, as of the date of this Agreement, that such
Intervening Event was reasonably likely to occur or arise after the date of
this Agreement; (iii) the Company provides Parent, at least two days prior to
any meeting of the Companys board of directors at which such board of
directors will consider and determine whether such Intervening Event may
require the Company to make an Adverse Recommendation Change, with a written
notice specifying the date and time of such meeting, the reasons for holding
such meeting and a reasonably detailed description of such Intervening Event;
(iv) the Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after having
taken into account the advice of the Companys independent financial advisor
and the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, that, in light of such
Intervening Event, failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Companys board of directors
under applicable Delaware law; (v) no Adverse Recommendation Change has been
made for five business days after receipt by Parent of a written notice from
the Company confirming that the Companys board of directors has determined
that the failure to make such an Adverse Recommendation Change in light of
such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Delaware law; (vi) during such five business day notice period, the
Company engages (to the extent requested by Parent) in good faith
negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that failure
to make an Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of such Intervening Event
would no longer be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Companys board of directors; and (vii) at the time of any Adverse
Recommendation Change, the board of directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after taking into account the advice of the Companys independent
financial advisor and the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, that
the

 



54  failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would still be inconsistent
with the fiduciary duties of the Companys board of directors under applicable
Delaware law in light of such Intervening Event (taking into account any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent as a result of the
negotiations required by clause "(vi)" or otherwise)

 

(i) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from: (i) taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act; or (ii) making any disclosure to its
stockholders if the board of directors of the Company determines in good
faith, after having taken into account the advice of the Companys outside
legal counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Delaware law; _provided, however_ , that this _Section
5.3(i)_ shall not be deemed to permit the board of directors of the Company
to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or take any of the actions referred
to in clause "(ii)" of _Section 5.3(f)_ except, in each case, to the
extent permitted by _Section 5.3(g)_ and _Section 5.3(h)_.

5.4 Company Equity Awards and ESPP. 

(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested,
shall be converted into and become an option to purchase shares of Parent
Common Stock, with such conversion effected through Parent: (i) assuming such
Company Option; or (ii) replacing such Company Option by issuing a reasonably
equivalent replacement stock option to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock
in substitution therefor, in either case in accordance with the terms (as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement) of the applicable Company Option
Plan and the terms of the stock option agreement by which such Company Option
is evidenced. All rights with respect to shares of Company Common Stock under
Company Options assumed or replaced by Parent shall thereupon be converted
into options with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock. Accordingly, from
and after the Effective Time: (A) each Company Option assumed or replaced by
Parent may be exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock; (B) the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Company Option
assumed or replaced by Parent shall be determined by multiplying the number of
shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Conversion Ratio, and rounding
the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent
Common Stock; (C) the per share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of each Company Option assumed or replaced by Parent
shall be determined by dividing the per share exercise price of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Option, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, by the Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise
price up to the nearest whole cent; and (D) subject to the terms of the stock
option agreement by which such Company Option is evidenced, any restriction on
the exercise of any Company Option assumed or replaced by Parent
shall continue in full force and effect and the term, exercisability, vesting
schedule and other provisions of such Company Option shall otherwise remain
unchanged as a result of the assumption or replacement of such Company Option;
_provided, however,_ that Parents board of directors or a committee thereof
shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Companys board of
directors or any committee thereof with respect to each Company Option assumed
or replaced by Parent. The " _Conversion Ratio_ " shall be equal to the
fraction having a numerator equal to: (1) the Cash Consideration; _plus_ (2)
the dollar amount determined by multiplying the Stock Consideration by the
average of the closing sale prices of a share of Parent Common Stock as
reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market for each of the 10 consecutive
trading days immediately prior to the Closing Date and having a denominator
equal to the average of the closing sale prices of a share of Parent Common
Stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market for each of the 10
consecutive trading days immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided,
however_ , that if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock
are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any

 



55  stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse
stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or
other similar transaction, then the Conversion Ratio shall be adjusted to the
extent appropriate.

(b) At the Effective Time, each award of Company Restricted Stock that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (and does not vest as
a result of the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions) shall be
assumed by Parent and converted into the right to receive the Merger Price for
each such share of Company Restricted Stock. From and after the Effective
Time, each assumed share of Company Restricted Stock shall be: (i) settled
solely in the Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration at the time such
repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition lapses or otherwise
terminates; and (ii) subject to substantially the same terms, including the
same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition as applied to
the shares of Company Restricted Stock immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

(c) At the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Unit that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (and does not vest as a
result of the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions) shall be assumed
by Parent and converted into the right to receive the Merger Price for each
share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit.
From and after the Effective Time, each assumed Company Restricted Stock Unit
shall be: (i) settled solely in the Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration
at the time such repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition
lapses or otherwise terminates; and (ii) subject to substantially the same
terms, including the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other
condition as applied to the Company Restricted Stock Units immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

(d) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the Company 2010 Stock
Incentive Plan or merge such Company Option Plan into any equity incentive
plan of Parent. Parent shall be entitled to grant stock awards, to the extent
permissible under applicable Legal Requirements, using the share reserves of
such Company Option Plan as of the Effective Time, except that: (i) stock
covered by such awards shall be shares of Parent Common Stock; (ii) all
references in such Company Option Plan to a number of shares of Company Common
Stock shall be deemed amended to refer instead to a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of referenced shares
of Company Common Stock by the Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting
number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock;
and (iii) Parents board of directors or a committee thereof shall succeed to
the authority and responsibility of the Companys board of directors or any
committee thereof with respect to the administration of such Company Option
Plan. 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action that may be
necessary (under the Company Option Plans and otherwise) to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 5.4_ and to ensure that, from and after the
Effective Time, holders of Company Options, Company Restricted Stock and
Company Restricted Stock Units, have no rights with respect thereto other
than those specifically provided in this _Section 5.4_.

(f) Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to file with the SEC, no later
than 10 business days after the Effective Time, a registration statement on
Form S-8 (or any successor form), if available for use by Parent, relating to
the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to the Company
Options, Company Restricted Stock and Company Restricted Stock Units assumed
or replaced by Parent in accordance with _Section 5.4(a)_.

(g) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all action that may
be necessary to: (i) cause the offering period under the ESPP that is
outstanding as of the date of this Agreement to be terminated as of the last
business day prior to the Acceptance Time or the date such

 



56  offering period terminates by its terms, if earlier (such date, the " _Final
Purchase Date_ "); (ii) make any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to
reflect the shortened offering period, but otherwise treat such shortened
offering period as a fully effective and completed offering period for all
purposes under the ESPP; (iii) cause the exercise (as of the Final Purchase
Date) of each outstanding purchase right under the ESPP; (iv) provide that no
further offering period or purchase period shall commence under the ESPP after
the date hereof subject to the occurrence of the Acceptance Time; and (v)
ensure that no individual shall be permitted to make a new election to
purchase shares in any current offering period or increase his or her election
to purchase shares in any current offering period; _provided, however_ , that
the actions described in clauses "(i)" through "(iv)" of this sentence shall
be conditioned upon the consummation of Offer. On such new exercise date, the
Company shall apply the funds credited as of such date under the ESPP within
each participants payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP.
Immediately prior to and effective as of the Acceptance Time (and subject to
the consummation of the Offer), the Company shall terminate the ESPP.

(b) Subject to the confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, Parent and the Company each shall promptly supply the other with
any information which may be required in order to effectuate any filings
(including applications) pursuant to (and to otherwise comply with its
obligations set forth in) _Section 6.2(a)_. Except where prohibited by
applicable Legal Requirements or any Governmental Body, and subject to the
confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, each of Parent
and the Company shall: (i) consult with the other prior to taking a position
with respect to any such filing; (ii) permit the other to review and discuss
in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection
with, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, white
papers, arguments, opinions and proposals before making or submitting any of
the foregoing to any Governmental Body by or on behalf of any party hereto in
connection with any Legal Proceeding related solely to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (including any such Legal Proceeding
relating to any antitrust, competition or fair trade Legal Requirement); (iii)
coordinate with the other in preparing and exchanging such information; and
(iv) promptly provide the other (and its counsel) with copies of all filings,
notices, analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, white papers, opinions,

or submitted by such party with or to any Governmental Body related solely to
this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions.

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall notify the other promptly upon
the receipt of: (i) any communication from any official of any Governmental
Body in connection with any filing made pursuant to this Agreement; (ii)
knowledge of the commencement or threat of commencement of any Legal
Proceeding by or before any Governmental Body with respect to the
Contemplated Transactions (and shall keep the other party informed as to the
status of any such Legal Proceeding or threat); and (iii) any request by any
official of any Governmental Body for any amendment or supplement to any
filing made pursuant to this Agreement or any information required to comply
with any Legal Requirements applicable to the Contemplated Transactions.
Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to any filing made pursuant to _Section 6.2(a)_, Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, shall (promptly upon learning of the occurrence
of such event) inform the other of the occurrence of such event and cooperate
in filing with the applicable Governmental Body such amendment or supplement.

(d) Subject to _Section 6.2(e)_ , Parent and the Company shall use reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to consummate the
Offer and the Merger and make effective the other Contemplated Transactions.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to _Section
6.2(e)_ , each party to this Agreement: (i) shall make all filings (if any)
and give all notices (if any) required to be made and given by such party in
connection with the Offer, the Merger and the other Contemplated
Transactions; (ii) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain each
Consent (if any) required to be obtained (pursuant to any applicable Legal
Requirement or Contract, or otherwise) by such party in connection with
the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions; and
(iii) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to lift any restraint,
injunction or other legal bar to the Offer or the Merger.

 



58 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 6.2_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall have
any obligation under this Agreement: (i) to divest or agree to divest (or
cause any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Acquired Corporations to divest or
agree to divest) any of its respective businesses, product lines or assets,
or to take or agree to take (or cause any of its Subsidiaries or any of the
Acquired Corporations to take or agree to take) any other action or agree (or
cause any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Acquired Corporations to agree)
to any limitation or restriction on any of its respective businesses, product
lines or assets; or (ii) to contest any Legal Proceeding relating to the Offer
or the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions.

6.3 Employee Benefits.

(a) Except as set forth herein, the Company shall not take (or cause or permit
to be taken) any action to terminate any Company Employee Plan, including any
such plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify
under Section 401(k) of the Code (a " _401(k) Plan_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, that if directed in writing by Parent not less than five business days prior
to the Effective Time and, with respect to each 401(k) Plan, within five
business days prior to the date on which the Acceptance Time occurs, the
Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions reasonably determined by
Parent to be necessary or appropriate to terminate any such Company Employee
Plan, with such termination effective as of the day immediately prior to the
Closing Date. Unless Parent provides such written notice to the Company, the
Company shall provide Parent with evidence that all 401(k) Plan(s) have been
terminated (effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the
date on which the Acceptance Time occurs) pursuant to resolutions of the board
of directors of the Company or applicable Acquired Corporation, as the case
may be. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the
prior review and approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of
terminating such 401(k) Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably request.

(b) The Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions reasonably
determined by Parent to be necessary or appropriate to terminate the FY 2013
Annual Incentive Bonus Program, with such termination effective as of the
Acceptance Time.

(c) Parent agrees that, subject to any necessary transition period and subject
to any applicable plan provisions, contractual requirements or Legal
Requirements: (i) all employees of the Acquired Corporations who are citizens
of the United States of America or are otherwise legally employed in the
United States of America and who continue their employment with Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation after
the Effective Time (" _Continuing Employees_ ") shall be eligible to
participate in Parents employee benefit plans, including but not limited to
its bonus, severance, health, welfare, vacation and retirement plans (the "
_Parent Employee Plans_ "), to substantially the same extent as similarly
situated employees of Parent; (ii) for purposes of determining a Continuing
Employees eligibility to participate in Parent Employee Plans,
such Continuing Employee shall receive credit under such plans for his or her
years of continuous service with the Acquired Corporations prior to the
Effective Time to the same extent as such service was recognized under any
analogous Company Employee Plan in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time; (iii) for purposes of each Parent Employee Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical, life insurance and/or vision benefits to any
Continuing Employee, Parent shall, or shall cause, the Surviving Corporation
to cause, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such Parent Employee Plan to be waived for such employee and
his or her covered dependents; and (iv) to the extent the Closing occurs on
or prior to December 31, 2012, in lieu of its obligations set forth in clause
"(iii)" of this sentence, Parent shall be entitled to cause any Company
Employee Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, life insurance
and/or vision benefits to remain in effect through December 31, 2012.

 



59 (d) To the extent any employee notification or employee consultation
requirements are imposed by applicable Legal Requirements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall
cooperate to ensure that such notification or consultation requirements are
complied with prior to the Acceptance Time or Effective Time, as applicable.
Prior to the Effective Time, no Acquired Corporation shall communicate with
Continuing Employees regarding post-Closing employment matters, including
post-Closing employee benefits and compensation, without the prior written
approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(e) Nothing in this  _Section 6.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be
deemed to make any employee of the parties or their respective Subsidiaries a
third party beneficiary of this _Section 6.3_ or provide any such employee
any rights relating hereto.

6.4 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

 

(a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill in
all respects the obligations of the Company and each Company Subsidiary in
favor of those Persons who are former or current directors and officers of the
Company or a Company Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement and any
Person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or a Company
Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") for
their acts and omissions as directors and officers occurring prior to the
Effective Time, as provided in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
the Company or of a Company Subsidiary (as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement or, with respect to any Person who becomes a director or officer of
the Company or a Company Subsidiary, as of the Effective Time, to the extent
such agreement is substantially the same as the indemnification agreements in
effect as of the date of this Agreement) and as provided in any
indemnification agreements between the Company or a Company Subsidiary and
said Indemnified Persons (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) Made
Available to Parent, which obligations shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from the
Effective Time and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any Indemnified Person to whom this _Section 6.4_ applies
without the consent of such affected Indemnified Person. It is expressly
agreed that the Indemnified Persons to whom this _Section 6.4_ applies shall
be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.4_, each of whom may enforce
the provisions of this _Section 6.4_.

 

(b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain in effect, for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons
with respect to their acts and omissions as directors and officers occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, the existing policy of directors
and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company as of the date of
this Agreement in the form disclosed by the Company to Parent prior to the
date of this Agreement (the " _Existing D andO Policy_"), covering each
Person covered by the Existing DandO Policy, on terms with respect to the
coverage and amounts that are equivalent to those of the Existing DandO Policy;
_provided, however,_ that: (i) the Surviving Corporation may substitute for
the Existing DandO Policy a policy or policies of comparable coverage; and (ii)
the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay annual premiums for the
Existing DandO Policy in excess of the dollar amount set forth in _Part 6.4(b)_
of the Disclosure Schedule (the " _Maximum Premium_ "). In the event any
future annual premiums for the Existing DandO Policy exceed the Maximum Premium,
the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to, and Parent shall be obligated
to cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Premium. Prior to the
Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, the Company may purchase a pre-paid, non-cancellable "tail" policy
on the Existing DandO Policy for a claims reporting or discovery period of six
years from the Effective Time and otherwise on terms and conditions that are
no less favorable than the terms and conditions of the Existing DandO Policy;

 



60   _provided, however,_ that the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, expend an amount for such tail policy in excess of the
Maximum Premium. If such "tail" policy is purchased, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor
their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of
the Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of this _Section 6.4(b)_
for so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force and
effect.

 

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns:
(i) consolidates or merges with any other Person that shall not be the
continuing or the surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger; or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.4_.

 

6.5 Public Announcement. Parent and the Company agree that the press release
announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint
release of Parent and the Company. Thereafter, Parent and the Company shall
consult with each other and provide each other the reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon any press release or other public statement with
respect to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions
or the Stockholder Agreements before issuing any such press release or public
statement; _provided, however,_ that the foregoing shall not apply to: (a)
any press release or public statement made with respect to the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions or the Stockholder
Agreements that is not inconsistent with, or more expansive in any material
respect than, any prior press release or public statement validly made in
accordance with this _Section 6.5_; (b) any press release or other public
statement as may be required by any applicable Legal Requirement; or (c) any
Adverse Recommendation Change.

6.6 Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate in the defense and settlement of any stockholder litigation
against the Company and/or its officers or directors relating to any of the
Contemplated Transactions, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without
Parents prior written consent in accordance with clause "(xvii)" of _Section
5.2_.

6.7 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
such reasonable steps as are required to cause the disposition of Company
Common Stock and Company Options in connection with the Merger by each officer
or director of the Company who is subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt
from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act.

6.8 Resignation of Officers and Directors. Subject to the provisions of
_Section 1.3_, the Company shall use reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver
to Parent at the Closing (effective as of the Effective Time) the resignation
of each officer and director of each of the Acquired Corporations.

6.9 Rule 14d10 Matters. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company (acting
through the board of directors of the Company or its compensation committee)
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under
Rule 14d10(d) promulgated under the Exchange Act any employment
compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement entered into on
or after the date hereof by the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates with current or future directors, officers or employees of the
Company and its Affiliates and to ensure that any such arrangements fall
within the safe harbor provisions of such rule.

6.10 Delisting. From the Acceptance Time to the Closing Date, the Company
shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to enable the de-
listing by the Surviving 

 



61  Corporation of the Company Common Stock from the Nasdaq Stock Market and the
deregistration of the Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly
as practicable after the Effective Time. 

6.11 Listing. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Offer and the Merger
pursuant to this Agreement to be approved for listing (subject to official
notice of issuance) on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

6.12 Financing.

(a) Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
and obtain the Debt Financing, including using reasonable best efforts to: (i)
maintain in effect the Commitment Letter and negotiate and enter into the
Definitive Financing Agreements on the terms and conditions contained in the
Commitment Letter and deliver to the Company a copy of any Definitive
Financing Agreements to the extent executed prior to the Effective Time
promptly after execution thereof; (ii) satisfy on a timely basis (or obtain
waiver of) all conditions under the Commitment Letter and, if applicable, the
Definitive Financing Agreements applicable to Parent and Acquisition Sub; and
(iii) as soon as reasonably practicable, consummate, or cause the
consummation of, the Debt Financing, including, in the event of a breach by
the other parties thereto that impedes or delays or would reasonably be
expected to impede or delay the Acceptance Time or the Effective Time, by
making written demands and reasonable requests of such parties to cure such
breach or otherwise provide reasonable assurances with respect to such partys
obligations thereunder. If all conditions to the lenders obligations under
the Commitment Letter or Definitive Financing Agreements, as applicable, have
been satisfied, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause the lenders providing such Debt Financing to fund, at
the Acceptance Time, the Financing required to satisfy all of Parents and
Acquisition Subs obligations at the Acceptance Time ( _provided_ , _however_
, that nothing herein shall require Parent or Acquisition Sub to take
any enforcement action, including through litigation, to cause such lenders
to fund such Debt Financing). Parent and Acquisition Sub shall have the right
from time to time to amend (including, by adding or replacing lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities), replace,
supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights under, the
Commitment Letter and/or substitute other debt or equity financing for all or
any portion of the Debt Financing from the same and/or alternative financing
sources; _provided_ , that any such amendment, replacement, supplement or
other modification to or waiver of any provision of the Commitment Letter that
amends the Debt Financing and/or substitution of all or any portion of the
Debt Financing shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned): (A)
reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing; (B) impose new
or additional conditions precedent or contingencies to the Debt Financing as
set forth in the Commitment Letter (unless such conditions precedent or
contingencies to the financing would not be: (1) materially adverse to Parent
and Acquisition Sub or the Company; and (2) reasonably expected to prevent or
impede or delay the Acceptance Time or the Effective Time); or (C) prevent or
impede or delay the Acceptance Time or the Effective Time. Parent shall keep
the Company reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Debt Financing; _provided_ , that Parent shall be under no obligation to
disclose any information that is subject to an attorney-client or similar
privilege or protection;  _provided, however,_ that Parent shall give notice
to the Company of the fact that it is withholding such information or
documents and thereafter Parent and the Company shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such information to be provided in a
manner that would not reasonably be expected to waive the applicable privilege
or protection. In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable or Parent or Acquisition Sub becomes aware of any event or
circumstance that would reasonably be expected to make any portion of the Debt
Financing unavailable, in each case, on the terms and conditions contemplated
in the Commitment Letter, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall promptly notify the
Company and shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain
from the same and/or alternative financing sources

 



62  alternative financing upon terms and conditions not materially less
favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent, Acquisition Sub and, with respect to
conditions or contingencies to such alternative financing, the Company than
those set forth in the Commitment Letter, in an amount sufficient, together
with any available cash resources, to consummate the Merger, the Offer and the
other Contemplated Transactions as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall deliver to the
Company true and complete copies of all agreements pursuant to any such source
of alternative financing shall have committed to provide Parent and
Acquisition Sub with any portion of the Debt Financing promptly after
execution thereof. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall give the Company prompt
notice: (x) of any breach or potential breach threatened in writing by any
party to the Commitment Letter or of any condition which may not be
satisfied, in each case, of which Parent or Acquisition Sub becomes aware or
any termination of the Commitment Letter or the Definitive Financing Agreement
that occurs prior to the funding thereunder; (y) the receipt of any written
notice or other written communication from any other party thereto with
respect to any breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any
of the Commitment Letter or Definitive Financing Agreement related to
the Financing of any provisions of the Commitment Letters or the Definitive
Financing Agreement, if applicable, related to the Debt Financing that occurs
prior to the funding thereunder; and (z) if at any time for any reason Parent
or Acquisition Sub believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain
all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions
contemplated by the Commitment Letter or the Definitive Financing Agreements,
if applicable. As soon as reasonably practicable, following written request
by the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall provide any information
reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to
in clause "(x)," "(y)" or "(z)" of the immediately preceding sentence;
_provided_ that they need not provide any information that is subject to
contractual confidentiality restrictions, privileged or that is requested for
purposes of litigation; _provided, however,_ that, Parent shall: (I) give
reasonable notice to the Company of the fact that either it or Acquisition Sub
is not providing such information pursuant to this _Section 6.12(a)_; (II)
inform the Company with sufficient detail of the reason for not providing
such information; and (III) with respect to reasons relating to contractual
confidentiality restrictions and privilege, use, and cause Acquisition Sub to
use, commercially reasonable efforts to cause the information that is subject
to such restriction or privilege to be provided in a manner that would not
reasonably be expected to violate such restriction or privilege. On the sixth
business day (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange
Act) immediately prior to the scheduled Expiration Date, Parent shall make a
determination as to whether the Funding Condition is reasonably expected to be
satisfied on the scheduled Expiration Date and, if Parent, acting reasonably
and in good faith, determines that the Funding Condition is reasonably
expected to be satisfied on the scheduled Expiration Date, Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall waive such condition prior to 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time,
on such sixth business day. 

(b) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries and the Representatives of the Acquired Corporations to
provide, at Parents sole expense, cooperation in connection with the
arrangement of any Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent or
Acquisition Sub which shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 

(i) causing the Companys senior management and finance department, and using
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its other Representatives to
participate in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations (including
marketing (or similar presentations) and lender and other investor
presentations), road shows, sessions with rating agencies and due diligence
sessions (including accounting due diligence) in connection with any
Financing;

(ii) assisting in the preparation of customary bank information memoranda and
bank syndication materials, rating agency presentations, offering documents,
private placement memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents as may be
requested or required in 

 



63  connection with any Financing, including the syndication thereof, but in
each case, solely with respect to the information relating to the Company and
its Subsidiaries;

 

(iii) providing Parent reasonable access at reasonable times all other
documentation and information, including all customary financial and other
information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries, and other items, in
each case, contemplated by the Commitment Letter and the Definitive Financing
Agreements or as otherwise reasonably requested by Parent in connection with
any Financing;

(iv) providing reasonable access at reasonable times to properties, books
and records of the Acquired Corporations as reasonably requested by Parent or
the sources of any Financing, including permitting such persons to perform
customary "due diligence" in connection with any Financing;

 

(v) using commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Companys independent
public accountants to cooperate with Parents commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain any Financing, including by participating in drafting sessions and
accounting due diligence sessions and by promptly providing, upon request: (A)
consent to the incorporation of such auditors reports in SEC filings and
offering memoranda which include any of the Acquired Corporations financial
information; and (B) customary comfort letters (including "negative assurance"
comfort) upon completion of customary procedures;

(vi) furnishing such information and arranging for delivery of any collateral
to be physically pledged, in each case, to the extent reasonably necessary to
facilitate the pledging of collateral and perfection of liens and the
providing of guarantees, in each case, at the Effective Time; and

 

(vii) furnishing all documentation and other information required by any
Governmental Body in connection with any Financing under applicable "know
your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the
PATRIOT ACT;

_provided,_ that: (1) such requested assistance and cooperation does not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Acquired
Corporations; (2) none of the Acquired Corporations shall be required to pay
any fees (including commitment or other similar fees) or incur any other
liability or expense in connection with the Financing (or any replacement
thereof) prior to the Effective Time; (3) no incurrence of Indebtedness or
other obligation of any Acquired Corporation under any Financing shall be
effective until the Effective Time; (4) no Acquired Corporation shall be
required to provide access to or disclose information where the
Company reasonably determines that such access or disclosure would jeopardize
the attorney-client privilege of an Acquired Corporation or contravene any
Legal Requirement or any contract to which an Acquired Corporation is a party;
_provided_ that, the Company shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it
is withholding such information or documents and thereafter the Company and
Parent shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause
such information to be provided in a manner that would not reasonably be
expected to waive the applicable privilege or protection; (5) no Acquired
Corporation shall be required to: (A) take any action that will conflict with
or violate such Acquired Corporations organizational documents or any Legal
Requirement or result in the contravention of, or that would reasonably be
expected to result in a violation or breach of, or default under, any material
Contract to which an Acquired Corporation is a party; or (B) issue any bank
information memoranda, high-yield offering prospectuses or memoranda required
in relation to any Financing (and any such bank information memoranda, high-
yield offering prospectuses or memoranda shall reflect the
Surviving Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries as the obligors on such
Financing); and (6) no Acquired Corporation shall be required to enter into or
approve any financing or purchase agreement

 



64  for any Financing prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, reasonably
promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all out of
pocket costs and expenses incurred by any Acquired Corporation in connection
with such cooperation and assistance. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Acquired Corporations and their respective Representatives from and
against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them prior
to the Effective Time in connection with any Financing or the arrangement of
any Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith (other
than historical information relating to the Acquired Corporations); except in
the event such termination is determined to have arisen out of or resulted
from the fraud, willful misconduct, gross negligence or intentional
misrepresentation of the Acquired Corporations or their respective
Representatives, as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, the Financing is and will remain the sole responsibility
of Parent and Acquisition Sub and none of Acquired Corporations or any of
their respective Representatives: (x) shall be required to waive or amend any
terms of this Agreement or agree to pay any commitment or other fees
or reimburse any expenses prior to the Effective Time, or give any
indemnities that are not contingent on the Effective Time; or (y) shall have
any liability or incur any losses, damages or penalties with respect thereto.

 

(c) If a Commitment Letter is amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise
modified, including as a result of obtaining alternative financing in
accordance with _Section 6.12(a)_, or if Parent substitutes other debt or
equity financing for all or a portion of the Debt Financing, each of Parent
and the Company shall comply with its covenants in  _Section 6.12(a)_ and
_Section 6.12(b)_ with respect to the Commitment Letter as so amended,
replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified and with respect to such other
financing to the same extent that Parent and the Company would have been
obligated to comply with respect to the Debt Financing.

(d) The Company hereby consents to the use of the trademarks, service marks
and logos of the Acquired Corporations in connection with any Financing.

(e) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the
Company obtained by Parent or its Representatives or any other Person pursuant
to this _Section 6.12_ shall be governed by the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , that notwithstanding the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, upon notice to the Company, Parent may provide such
information to potential sources of capital and to rating agencies and
prospective lenders and investors during syndication or placement of any
Financing (including any alternative financing to be entered into pursuant to
_Section 6.12(a)_) subject to customary confidentiality arrangements with
such Persons regarding such information (it being acknowledged by the Company
that the confidentiality provisions set forth in the Commitment Letter are
customary and acceptable) or as otherwise permitted by the Confidentiality
Agreement.

injunction or other order preventing the consummation of the Merger shall have
been issued by any court or other Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction
and remain in effect, and there shall not be any

 



65  Legal Requirement enacted or deemed applicable to the Merger that makes
consummation of the Merger illegal; _provided, however_ , that prior to

of such party under this Agreement to have any such injunction, order or Legal
Requirement or other prohibition lifted.

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company at any time prior to
the Effective Time (notwithstanding receipt of the Required Company
Stockholder Vote);

(e) by Parent within 15 business days after (but in any event prior to the
Acceptance Time) a Triggering Event shall have occurred;

(f) subject to the Companys compliance with _Section 5.3(g)_, by
the Company at any time prior to the Acceptance Time in order to accept a
Superior Offer and enter into a binding, written, definitive agreement
providing for the consummation of the transaction contemplated by such
Superior Offer (the " _Specified Definitive Acquisition Agreement_ "), if:

complying with the terms of this Agreement, to enter into a Specified
Definitive Acquisition Agreement; (ii) immediately prior to or substantially
concurrently with the termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into
the Specified Definitive Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Offer; and (iii) the Company immediately prior to or concurrently with such
termination, pays to Parent the payment required to be made to Parent pursuant
to _Section 8.3(c)_;

 



66 (g) by Parent at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if: (i) any of
the Companys representations or warranties contained in this Agreement shall
have become inaccurate as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement
(as if made on such subsequent date), such that the condition set forth in
clause "(a)" of _Exhibit B_ would not be satisfied (it being understood that,
for purposes of determining the accuracy of such representations and
warranties: (A) all materiality qualifications limiting the scope of such
representations and warranties shall be disregarded; and (B) any update of or
modification to the Disclosure Schedule made or purported to have been made on
or after the date of this Agreement shall be disregarded); or (ii) the Company
shall have failed to comply with or perform its covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement, such that the condition set forth in clause "(b)"
of _Exhibit B_ would not be satisfied; _provided, however_ , that if: (A) any
inaccuracy in any of the Companys representations or warranties or failure
to comply with or perform the Companys covenants or agreements is curable by
the Company prior to the earlier of the Outside Date or 30 days after the date
on which the Company is notified by Parent in writing of such inaccuracy or
failure to comply with or perform; and (B) the Company is continuing to
exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such inaccuracy or failure to
comply with or perform, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement under
this _Section 8.1(g)_ on account of such inaccuracy or failure to perform:
(1) during such 30-day (or shorter) period; or (2) after such 30-day period,
if such inaccuracy or failure to comply with or perform shall have been fully
cured; _provided, further, however,_ that Parent shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(g)_ if Parent or
Acquisition Sub is then in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder; or

(h) by the Company at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if: (i) any of
Parents representations or warranties contained in this Agreement shall have
become inaccurate as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement (as if
made on such subsequent date) (it being understood that, for purposes of
determining the accuracy of such representations and warranties, all
materiality qualifications limiting the scope of such representations and
warranties shall be disregarded) and such inaccuracy materially impairs or
delays Parents or Acquisition Subs ability to purchase and pay for shares of
Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the
Offer; or (ii) Parent shall have failed to comply with or perform
its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement and such failure
materially impairs or delays Parents or Acquisition Subs ability to purchase
and pay for the shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not
withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer; _provided, however_ , that if: (A) any
inaccuracy of any of Parents representations or warranties or failure to
comply with or perform Parents covenants or agreements is curable by Parent
prior to the earlier of the Outside Date or 30 days after the date on which
Parent is notified by the Company in writing of such breach or failure to
comply with or perform; and (B) Parent is continuing to exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to cure such inaccuracy or failure to comply with or
perform, then the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section
8.1(h)_ on account of such inaccuracy or failure to perform: (1) during such
30-day (or shorter) period; or (2) after such 30-day period, if such
inaccuracy or failure to comply with or perform shall have been fully cured;
_provided, further, however,_ that the Company shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 8.1(h)_ if the Company
is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements hereunder.

8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
as provided in _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall be of no further force or
effect; _provided, however,_  that: (i) _Section 6.6_, this _Section 8.2_,
_Section 8.3_ and _Section 9_ (and the Confidentiality Agreement, other than
Section 6 thereof) shall survive the termination of this Agreement and
shall remain in full force and effect (it being understood that Section 6 of
the Confidentiality Agreement has been superseded by this Agreement and has no
further force or effect and nothing contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
shall impact Parents rights or remedies with respect to fraud); (ii) the
termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any party from any liability
for any material, knowing and intentional breach of any 

 



67  representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or willful and
intentional breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement;
and (iii) no termination of this Agreement shall in any way affect any of the
parties rights or obligations with respect to any shares of Company Common
Stock accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer prior to such termination.

 

8.3 Expenses; Termination Fees.

(a) Except as set forth in this _Section 8.3_, all fees and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions shall be
paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Offer or the
Merger is consummated; _provided, however,_ that Parent and the Company shall
share equally all fees and expenses, other than attorneys fees, incurred in
connection with: (i) the filing, printing and mailing of the Offer Documents
and the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendments or supplements thereto; (ii) the
retention of any information agent, depositary or other service provider in
connection with the Offer; and (iii) the filing by Parent and the Company of
the premerger notification and report forms relating to the Contemplated

under any applicable foreign antitrust or competition-related Legal
Requirement.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)_ or  _Section 8.1(d)_ and: (i) at or prior to the time of
such termination an Acquisition Proposal shall have been disclosed, announced,
commenced, submitted or made; and (ii) within 12 months after the date of any
such termination, an Acquisition Transaction (whether or not relating to such
Acquisition Proposal) is consummated or a definitive agreement contemplating
an Acquisition Transaction (whether or not relating to such Acquisition
Proposal) is executed, then the Company shall pay to Parent, in cash at the
earlier of the time such Acquisition Transaction is consummated or the time
such definitive agreement is executed, a non-refundable fee in the amount of
$37,500,000; _provided, however_ , that for purposes of clause "(ii)" above,
all references to "15%" in the definition of Acquisition Transaction shall be
deemed to be references to "35%."

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by: (i) Parent pursuant to _Section
8.1(e)_; (ii) by Parent or the Company pursuant to any other provision of
_Section 8 _during the 15 business day period immediately following the
occurrence of a Triggering Event; or (iii) by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(f)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent, in cash, a non-refundable fee
in the amount of $37,500,000. In the case of termination of this Agreement in
the manner set forth in clauses "(i)" or "(ii)" of this _Section 8.3(c)_, the
fee referred to in the preceding sentence shall be paid by the Company within
two business days after such termination; and in the case of termination of
this Agreement in the manner set forth in clause "(iii)" of this _Section
8.3(c)_, the fee referred to in the preceding sentence shall be paid by the
Company immediately prior to or concurrently with such termination.

(d) If this Agreement is terminated by: (i) Parent pursuant to  _Section
8.1(d)_ and: (A) at the time of such termination, each of the Offer Conditions
has been satisfied or waived (other than: (1) the condition set forth in
clause "(j)" of _Exhibit B_ (the " _Funding Condition_ "); (2) the condition
set forth in clause "(l)" of _Exhibit B_ ; (3) the condition set forth in
clause "(k)" of _Exhibit B_ ; and (4) the Minimum Condition unless, between
the seventh and fifth business day immediately prior to the Outside Date,
Parent: (x) acting reasonably and in good faith, believes (and publicly
announces such belief) that it or Acquisition Sub will receive the Financing
by the Outside Date (which public announcement shall not have been
subsequently adversely modified or withdrawn); and (y) on or prior to such
date, shall have waived the Funding Condition, in which case the Minimum
Condition must also have been satisfied); (B) at the time of such
termination, Parent and Acquisition Sub have not received the Financing; and
(C) the failure of Parent and Acquisition Sub to receive the Financing is not
attributable to a breach of: (1) _Section 6.12(b)_; or (2) any covenant or
obligation of the Company contained in this Agreement or any

 



68  other action or failure to act of the Company, in each case, that has caused
any condition set forth in Exhibit B of the Commitment Letter not to be
satisfied; or (ii) the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ and: (A) at the
time of such termination, each of the Offer Conditions has been satisfied or
waived (other than: (1) the Funding Condition; (2) the condition set forth in
clause "(l)" of  _Exhibit B_ ; (3) the condition set forth in clause "(k)" of
_Exhibit B_ ; and (4) the Minimum Condition unless, between the seventh and
fifth business day immediately prior to the Outside Date, Parent: (x)
acting reasonably and in good faith, believes (and publicly announces such
belief) that it or Acquisition Sub will receive the Financing by the Outside
Date (which public announcement shall not have been subsequently adversely
modified or withdrawn); and (y) on or prior to such date, shall have waived
the Funding Condition, in which case the Minimum Condition must also have been
satisfied); (B) at the time of such termination, Parent and Acquisition Sub
have not received the Financing; (C) the failure of Parent and Acquisition
Sub to receive the Financing is not attributable to a breach of: (1) _Section
6.12(b)_; or (2) any covenant or obligation of the Company contained in this
Agreement or any other action or failure to act of the Company, in each case,
that has caused any condition set forth in Exhibit B of the Commitment Letter
not to be satisfied; and (D) the Company shall have given Parent written
notice at least two business days prior to termination stating the Companys
intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ (and the
basis for such termination), then Parent shall pay to the Company, a non-
refundable fee in the amount of $25,000,000 (the " _Reverse Termination Fee_
"). In the case of the termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant
to _Section 8.1(d)_ under the circumstances set forth in the first sentence
of this  _Section 8.3(d)_, the Reverse Termination Fee shall be paid by
Parent within two business days after such termination and, in the case of the
termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ under
the circumstances set forth in the first sentence of this _Section 8.3(d)_,
the Reverse Termination Fee shall be paid by Parent at or prior to the time of
such termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in 
_Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_, _Section 9.12_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement, except in the case of a Willful Breach, if this Agreement is
terminated under the circumstances set forth in the first sentence of this 
_Section 8.3(d)_, the Companys right to receive the Reverse Termination Fee
pursuant to this _Section 8.3(d)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Acquired Corporations and their respective stockholders and Affiliates
against Parent or any of its Related Persons for, and the Acquired
Corporations (on their own behalf and on behalf of their respective
stockholders and Affiliates) shall be deemed to have waived all other remedies
(including equitable remedies) with respect to: (1) any failure of the Offer
or the Merger to be consummated; (2) any breach by Parent or Acquisition Sub
of its obligation to consummate the Offer or the Merger or any other provision
set forth in this Agreement; (3) any inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty set forth in this Agreement, including any representation or warranty
set forth in _Section 4.13_ or relating to the Financing (regardless of
whether such representation or warranty refers specifically to such
Financing); and (4) any breach of any of the covenants or obligations set
forth in this Agreement, including any covenant or obligation set forth in
_Section 6.12(a)_ or relating to the Financing (regardless of whether such
covenant or obligation refers specifically to such Financing), unless such
inaccuracy or breach constitutes a Willful Breach. Upon payment by Parent of
the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to this  _Section 8.3(d)_, except in
the case of a Willful Breach, neither Parent nor any of its Related Persons
shall have any further liability or obligation (under this Agreement or
otherwise) relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the
Contemplated Transactions, and, except in the case of a Willful Breach, in no
event shall any Acquired Corporation (and the Company shall ensure that the
Acquired Corporations Affiliates do not) seek to recover any money damages
or losses, or seek to pursue any other recovery, judgment, damages or remedy
(including any equitable remedy) of any kind, in connection with this
Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions.

 

(e) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in this _Section 8.3_, are an integral part of the Contemplated
Transactions, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not have
entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if: (i) the Company fails to pay
when due any amount payable under this _Section 8.3_, then: (A) the Company
shall reimburse

 



69  Parent for all costs and expenses (including fees and disbursements of
counsel) incurred in connection with the collection of such overdue amount and
the enforcement by Parent of its rights under this _Section 8.3_; and (B)
the Company shall pay to Parent interest on such overdue amount (for the
period commencing as of the date such overdue amount was originally required
to be paid and ending on the date such overdue amount is actually paid to
Parent in full) at a rate per annum equal to 300 basis points over the "prime
rate" (as announced by Bank of America or any successor thereto) in effect on
the date such overdue amount was originally required to be paid; and (ii)
Parent fails to pay when due any amount payable under this _Section 8.3_,
then: (A) Parent shall reimburse the Company for all costs and expenses
(including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred in connection with the
collection of such overdue amount and the enforcement by the Company of its
rights under this _Section 8.3_; and (B) Parent shall pay to the Company
interest on such overdue amount (for the period commencing as of the date
such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date
such overdue amount is actually paid to the Company in full) at a rate per
annum equal to 300 basis points over the "prime rate" (as announced by Bank of
America or any successor thereto) in effect on the date such overdue amount
was originally required to be paid.

the approval of the respective boards of directors of the Company and Parent
at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the approval
of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders; _provided, however,_ that
after any such approval of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders, no
amendment shall be made which by applicable Legal Requirements requires
further approval of the stockholders of the Company without the further
approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

of the agreements or covenants of the other parties or any condition that
exists in favor of the waiving party contained herein. No failure on the part
of any party to exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, and no delay on the part of any party in exercising any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of
such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no single or partial exercise of
any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy. No party
shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of this Agreement, or any
power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of
such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a
written instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such party; and
any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the
specific instance in which it is given.

 

9.3 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. Subject to the following
sentence, none of the representations warranties, covenants and other

limit any covenant or agreement of the parties which by its
terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time.

9.4 Entire Agreement; Counterparts. This Agreement (including all Exhibits
and Schedules hereto) and the other agreements referred to in this Agreement
constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among or between any of

_provided, however_ , that the Confidentiality Agreement (other than Section
2, Section 6 and the second sentence of Section 8 thereof which shall be
superceded and shall cease to have any force or effect as of the date of this
Agreement) shall not be superseded and shall remain in full force and effect.
This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall
be deemed an original and all of which shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

9.5 Applicable Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced
in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof.

and for New Castle County, Delaware (unless the federal courts have exclusive
jurisdiction over the matter, in which case the United States District Court

defeat such jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from such court;
and (iii) agrees that it will not bring any such action in any court
other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and for New
Castle County, Delaware (unless the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction
over the matter, in which case the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware). Service of any process, summons, notice or document to
any partys address and in the manner set forth in _Section 9.9_ shall be
effective service of process for any such action.

 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES, AGREES AND
CERTIFIES THAT: (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO PREVENT OR DELAY ENFORCEMENT OF EITHER OF SUCH
WAIVERS; (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH
WAIVERS; (iii) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY; AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND

disclosure is intended to qualify another representation or warranty.

hereunder may be assigned by a party, in whole or in part, by operation
of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other parties
to this Agreement, and any attempted assignment of this Agreement or any of
such rights or interest hereunder and the delegation of obligations hereunder
by a party without such consent shall be void and of no effect. Nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever upon any Person (other than: (a)
the parties hereto; (b) the Indemnified Persons to the extent of their
respective rights pursuant to _Section 6.4_; and (c) the sources of the Debt

9.10 Cooperation. The Company and Parent agree to cooperate fully with each
other and to execute and deliver such further documents, certificates,
agreements and instruments and to take such other actions as may be reasonably
requested by the other to evidence or reflect the Contemplated Transactions
and to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement. 

9.11 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this Agreement
is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree to negotiate in an
effort to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
valid enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision.

9.12 Enforcement. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed by any of the parties in accordance with their specific
terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. Accordingly, in the event
of any breach or threatened breach by any of the parties of their respective
covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement, the other parties shall
be entitled to obtain, without proof of actual damages (and each party hereby
waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection
with such

 



73  remedy): (a) a decree or order of specific performance to enforce the
observance and performance of such covenant or obligation; and (b) an
injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach; this being in
addition to any other remedy to which each party is entitled at law or in
equity.

9.13 Obligation of Parent. Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to duly
perform, satisfy and discharge on a timely basis each of the covenants,
obligations and liabilities of Acquisition Sub under this Agreement.

 

9.14 Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
parties hereto acknowledge and irrevocably agree: (a) that in any Legal
Proceeding, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, in which any party and the sources of the Debt Financing are a
party arising out of, or relating to, the Contemplated Transactions, the Debt
Financing, the Commitment Letter, the Definitive Financing Agreements or the
performance of services thereunder or related thereto shall be subject to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the Borough of
Manhattan, New York, New York, and any appellate court thereof and each party
hereto submits for itself with respect to any such Legal Proceeding to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such court; (b) not to bring or authorize any of
their Affiliates to bring any such Legal Proceeding in any other court; (c)
that service of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail
addressed to them at their respective addresses provided in _Section 9.9_
shall be effective service of process against them for any such Legal
Proceeding brought in any such court; (d) to waive and hereby waive, to the
fullest extent permitted by Legal Requirements, any objection which any of
them may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of
an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such Legal Proceeding in any
such court; (e) to waive and hereby waive any right to trial by jury in
respect of any such Legal Proceeding; (f) that a final judgment in any such
Legal Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Legal
Requirements; (g) that, subject to the proviso below, any such Legal
Proceeding shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws
of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such
State that would result in the application of the laws of any other State; (h)
that the sources of the Debt Financing are express third party beneficiaries
of, and may enforce, the agreements set forth in this _Section 9.14_; (i)
none of the sources of the Debt Financing will have any liability to the
Company or its Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the
Financing or otherwise, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, and neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates will have
any rights or claims against any of the sources of the Debt Financing
hereunder or thereunder, and in no event shall the Company be entitled to seek
the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement against the sources of
the Debt Financing; and (j) that the sources of the Debt Financing
are beneficiaries of and may enforce any liability cap or limitation on
damages or remedies in this Agreement (including _Section 8.3(d)_);
_provided, however,_ that for purposes of any Legal Proceeding referred to in
this  _Section 9.14_, the interpretation of the definition of Company
Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Commitment Letter) shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

9.15 Construction.

 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine
gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender
shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall

74 (b) The parties hereto agree that any rule of construction to the effect that
ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be
applied in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.
