Date, resulting from the change in ownership shall be excluded from the
Closing Statements.

(d) During the thirty (30) day period following delivery of the Closing
Statement to Seller, Buyer will provide Seller and its representatives with
reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice to
the books and records and personnel of Buyer and the Group Companies to
enable Seller to evaluate the accuracy of the Closing Statement. If Seller
disagrees with the determination of any component of the Closing Statement
calculations, then Seller will notify Buyer in writing (an " _Objection
Notice_ ") of such disagreement within thirty (30) days after delivery of the
Closing Statement, which Objection Notice will describe the nature and extent
of any such disagreement in reasonable detail. If Seller does not deliver an
Objection Notice to Buyer within such thirty (30)-day period, then the Closing
Statement and the calculations of Net Working Capital, Closing Net Cash and
Purchase Price set forth therein will be conclusive and binding upon the
parties.

Capital, Closing Net Cash and the Purchase Price shall be binding upon the
parties. If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any disagreement reflected
in the Objection Notice within thirty (30)-days after Buyers receipt of the
Objection Notice, Buyer or Seller may refer the accounting matters remaining
in dispute for

 



21  final determination to Deloitte LLP (the " _Chosen Firm_ "); _provided that_
, if Deloitte LLP is not willing to serve as the Chosen Firm, such other
reputable, national independent accounting firm as Buyer and Seller may
designate by mutual agreement, or failing such agreement, the national
independent accounting firm determined pursuant to the dispute resolution
procedures set forth in _Section 10.13_. The Chosen Firm shall only have
authority to resolve those accounting matters specifically referred to it for
resolution; _provided_ that the Chosen Firm may not assign a value to any item
greater than the greatest value, or less than the smallest value, for such
item claimed by either Buyer or Seller. The Chosen Firm shall apply the
provisions of _Section 2.2_ and this _Section 2.4_ in resolving any dispute
pursuant hereto. The parties shall use their reasonable commercial efforts to
cause the Chosen Firm to resolve any such disputed accounting matters within
thirty (30) days after such referral and, in any case, as promptly as
practicable after such referral. The decision of the Chosen Firm as to
any accounting matters in dispute shall be in writing and shall be final and
binding upon all parties hereto for all purposes. Any disagreements among the
parties with respect to any matters of law or the interpretation of this
Agreement (not including any disagreement related to the appropriateness and
applicability of the Accounting Principles, which disagreement shall be
decided by the Chosen Firm) remain subject to the dispute resolution
provisions set forth in _Section 10.13_, and the Chosen Firm shall have no
authority to decide such matters unless specifically agreed by Buyer and
Seller at the time, and any dispute as to whether a matter is an accounting
matter or a matter of law or interpretation of this Agreement will, unless
otherwise agreed by Buyer and Seller at the time, be resolved pursuant to the
dispute resolution procedures set forth in _Section 10.13_. The fees and
disbursements of the Chosen Firm shall be shared equally by Buyer, on the
one hand, and Seller, on the other.

(f) If the sum of the Net Working Capital and Closing Net Cash _minus_ the
Financing Adjustment, as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.4_
exceeds the sum of the Estimated Net Working Capital and the Estimated Closing
Net Cash _minus_ the Estimated Financing Adjustment used to calculate the
Closing Payment, then Buyer shall pay the amount of such excess to Seller. If
the sum of the Net Working Capital and Closing Net Cash _minus_ the Financing
Adjustment, as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ is less than
the sum of the Estimated Net Working Capital and Estimated Closing Net Cash
_minus_ the Estimated Financing Adjustment used to calculate the Closing
Payment, then Seller shall refund to Buyer an aggregate amount equal to such
shortfall. Any interim amounts previously paid pursuant to _Section 2.4(g)_
below (other than any interest on such amounts under _Section 2.4(h)_) shall
be credited against any subsequent payment due under this Section.

 

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if, pursuant to _Section
2.4(e)_ there is a dispute as to the Net Working Capital, Closing Net Cash or
Financing Adjustment, Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other, shall
promptly pay to Buyer or Seller, as appropriate, such overall net amounts as
are not in dispute, pending final determination of any disputed
matters pursuant to _Section 2.4(e)_.

(h) Any amount payable pursuant to _Section 2.4(f)_ or _Section
2.4(g)_, shall be due and payable no later than five (5) Business Days after
the final determination of the corresponding amounts by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to such account(s) as may be directed by Buyer or
Seller, as the case may be, together with an amount calculated like interest
thereon from and after the Closing Date to and including the date of payment,
at a rate per annum equal to four and one-quarter percent (4.25%) per annum,
and calculated daily on the basis of a three hundred sixty (360)-day year and
the actual number of days elapsed, without compounding.

Section 3.11 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) _Schedule 3.11(a)_ sets forth all material Employee Benefit Plans by name,
including all amendments thereto, and identifies whether each Employee
Benefit Plan is a Company Benefit Plan, a Seller Benefit Plan, or a Collective
Bargaining Benefit Plan. No Company Benefit Plan is subject to the laws of a
country other than the United States. Seller has made available to
Buyer complete and correct copies of: (i) the most recent determination
letter or opinion letter, if any, received by a Group Company from the IRS
regarding each Qualified Plan, (ii) all pending applications for rulings,
determinations or opinions with respect to any Company Benefit Plan or
Qualified Plan, if any, filed with any Governmental Entity (including the
Department of Labor and the IRS), (iii) all material correspondence to or from
any Governmental Entity with respect to any Company Benefit Plan; (iv) the
financial statements (if any) for each Company Benefit Plan for the two (2)
most recent fiscal or Company Benefit Plan years for which such financial
statements are available (in audited form if required by ERISA) and, where
applicable, Annual Report/Returns (Forms 5500) with disclosure schedules, if
any, and attachments for each Company Benefit Plan for the two (2) most recent
fiscal or Company Benefit Plan years for which such Annual Report/Return
(Form 5500) is available, (v) the most recently prepared actuarial valuation
report for each Company Benefit Plan (including reports prepared for funding,
deduction and financial accounting purposes), if applicable, (vi)
all material Company Benefit Plan documents, trust agreements, insurance
contracts, service agreements and related material contracts and documents,
with respect to each Company Benefit Plan (and, with respect to any material
unwritten Company Benefit Plan, a written summary of the material terms and
conditions thereof), (vii) collective bargaining agreements (including

 



28  memorandums of understanding and other side letter agreements), if any,
relating to the establishment, maintenance, funding and operation of any
Company Benefit Plan, and (viii) summaries of each material Seller Benefit
Plan. No Company Benefit Plan provides benefits for any employee of Seller or
an Affiliate of Seller (other than a Group Company). No Seller Benefit Plan
provides benefits solely to employees of the Group Companies.

 

(b) All Qualified Plans and the trusts (if any) forming a part thereof, are so
tax-qualified and have received or are subject to a favorable determination
or opinion letter from the IRS as to their qualification under the Code and to
the effect that each such trust is exempt from taxation under Section 501(a)
of the Code. No Company Benefit Plan is a Qualified Plan. To the
extent required by Law, all Company Benefit Plans and Seller Benefit Plans
comply with the requirements of ERISA and the Code and all other applicable
Law in all material respects. No Company Benefit Plan is subject to ERISA. All
Company Benefit Plans and Seller Benefit Plans have been administered and
maintained at all times in all material respects in accordance with the
documents and instruments governing them. Except as set forth on _Schedule
3.11(b)_ , all reports (including Form 5500) and filings with Governmental
Entities (including the Department of Labor and the IRS) required in
connection with each Company Benefit Plan have been timely made and all
material disclosures required by applicable Law to be distributed to any
Company Benefit Plan participant have been timely made. No Group Company has
any material liability with respect to a Tax under Chapter 43 of the Code.

 

(c) All contributions, premium payments and other payments required to be in
connection with the Company Benefit Plans as of the date of this Agreement
have been made. All contributions, premium payments and other payments
required to be made by any Group Company in connection with the Seller Benefit
Plans and the Collective Bargaining Benefit Plans as of the date of this
Agreement have been made. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.11(c)_ , no
material unfunded liabilities exist with respect to any Company Benefit Plan
other than those accrued on the Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP
or arising since the Balance Sheet Date and required to be recorded as a
current liability in accordance with GAAP.

(d) No Action or claim is pending or to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened
with regard to any Company Benefit Plan other than routine claims for
benefits. No material Action or claim involving any current or former employee
of any Group Company is pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened
with regard to any Seller Benefit Plan, other than routine claims for
benefits. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or as set
forth on _Schedule 3.11(d)(i)_ , the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not cause any Company Benefit Plan to
increase benefits payable to any participant or beneficiary. Except as
otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or as set forth on _Schedule
3.11(d)(ii)_ , neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (whether or not some
other subsequent action or event would be required to cause the receipt of
such amount or benefit to occur): (i) entitle any current or former employee
of any Group Company to severance pay, unemployment compensation or to any
other payment, benefit or award under any Company Benefit Plan or Seller
Benefit Plan, (ii) accelerate or modify the time of payment or vesting, or
increase the amount of any benefit, award or compensation due any such
employee under any Company Benefit Plan or Seller Benefit Plan, or (iii)
result in any forgiveness of indebtedness, trigger any funding obligation
under any Company Benefit Plan or impose any restrictions or limitations on

 



29  any Group Companys rights to administer, amend or terminate any Company
Benefit Plan. No amount or benefit that could be received (whether in cash,
property or the vesting in cash or property) under any Company Benefit Plan,
Seller Benefit Plan or otherwise as a result of or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether or not some other
subsequent action or event would be required to cause the receipt of such
amount or benefit to occur) by any employee, officer or director of any Group
Company who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in Section
280G(c) of the Code) will, either individually or in combination with any
other amount or benefit, fail to be deductible for United States federal
income tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G of the Code. Except as set forth
on _Schedule 3.11(d)(iii)_ , each Company Benefit Plan, and, with respect to
current and former employees and service providers of any Group Company, each
Seller Benefit Plan, in either case that is subject to Section 409A of the
Code, has at all times while subject to Section 409A of the Code complied in
all material respects with Section 409A of the Code. No person is entitled to
receive any additional payment (including any tax gross-up or other payment)
from Seller or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the imposition of the
excise taxes required by Section 4999 of the Code or any taxes required by
Section 409A of the Code. To the Knowledge of Seller, no Company Benefit Plan
is currently under examination or audit by any Governmental Entity, including
the Department of Labor or the IRS.

(e) _Schedule 3.11(e)(i)_ lists each Multiemployer Plan to which a Group
Company contributes, is required to contribute, or within the last six (6)
years, has contributed or been required to contribute (each a " _Company
Multiemployer Plan_ "). No Group Company could reasonably be expected to have
any liability with respect to a Multiemployer Plan that is not a Company
Multiemployer Plan. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.11(e)(ii)_ , none of
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Group Companies) contributes
to or is required to contribute to any Company Multiemployer Plan. Except as
set forth on _Schedule 3.11(e)(iii)_ , within the last six (6) years, no Group
Company nor any of their ERISA Affiliates has maintained or established,
contributed or been required to contribute to, participated in or required to
participate in, or otherwise has been liable to any Employee Benefit Plan
(including any Multiemployer Plan) which is subject to Title IV or Section 302
of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. No employee of a Group Company is
currently accruing, or is entitled to accrue, a benefit under any Employee
Benefit Plan that is not a Collective Bargaining Benefit Plan and is subject
to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. No Company
Benefit Plan or Seller Benefit Plan is a multiple employer welfare arrangement
(as defined in Section 3(40)(A) of ERISA) or a multiple employer plan within
the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code.

 

(f) No Group Company or ERISA Affiliate has received notice that a Company
Multiemployer Plan is assessing a withdrawal liability with respect to a
Group Company. With respect to each Company Multiemployer Plan, the Company
(or another Group Company) will, within ten (10) Business Days following the
date hereof, request the most recent estimate of withdrawal liability
available and will promptly provide each such estimate to Buyer upon receipt.
All material communications during the preceding three (3) years between any
Group Company or any ERISA Affiliate and any Company Multiemployer Plan
pertaining to the Group Companies or matters that could reasonably be
expected to affect the Group Companies potential liability have been
delivered to Buyer. With respect to each Company Multiemployer Plan, no Group
Company has experienced a reduction in contribution base units in the three
(3) consecutive years prior to the date of this Agreement that would, if
continued,

 



30  reasonably be expected to result in a partial withdrawal assessment that
could result in any liability to any Group Company, whether such liability is
contingent or otherwise. _Schedule 3.11(f)_ identifies each Company
Multiemployer Plan that has notified the Company or any ERISA Affiliate of any
failure to satisfy minimum funding standards, or of its status as a critical
or endangered plan.

 

(g) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.11(g)_ , (i) no Group Company has any
outstanding liability (contingent or otherwise) with respect to the Allied
Local 470 Retirement Plan, the Allied Local 911 Retirement Plan or the Allied
Local 592 Retirement Plan (the " _Legacy Company Retirement Plans_ "), and
(ii) each of the Legacy Company Retirement Plans have been terminated and
liquidated in accordance with their terms and applicable Law, including ERISA
and the Code.

(h) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.11(h)(i)_ , no Group Company or
Company Benefit Plan provides or has any obligation to provide post-employment
life insurance, death, medical or other welfare benefits other than health
care continuation benefits described in Section 4980B of the Code or any
other similar Law. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.11(h)(ii)_ , no Seller
Benefit Plan provides or has any obligation to provide post-employment life
insurance, death, medical or other welfare benefits other than health care
continuation described in Section 4980B of the Code or any similar Law to any
employee or former employee of a Group Company.

 

(i) To Sellers knowledge, there are no Multiemployer Welfare Plans not
referenced in the applicable collective bargaining agreement. None of the
Multiemployer Welfare Plans require maintenance-of-benefit contributions in
excess of the contribution rates set forth in the applicable collective
bargaining agreement.

 

Section 3.12 _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) The Group Companies own all right, title and interest to, or have valid
licenses or other rights to use, free and clear of all Encumbrances, other
than Permitted Encumbrances, all of the Intellectual Property used in the
operation of the business as currently conducted. _Schedule 3.12_ lists all
registered and material unregistered trademarks, trade names, service marks,
logos, registered and material unregistered copyrights, material Software,
domain names, social media accounts, and patents, including pending
applications to register or renew any of the foregoing with any Governmental
Entity, that are owned or registered by any Group Company and which have not
expired or been abandoned, other than Intellectual Property where the failure
to register or maintain registration would not be material. To the Knowledge
of Seller, (i) no Group Company is infringing the Intellectual Property
rights of any other Person in any manner that is or would be material, and
(ii) no Person is infringing any Intellectual Property rights of any Group
Company. _Schedule 3.12_ lists all material written licenses to which any
Group Company is a party, pursuant to which (a) any Group Company permits any
Person to use any of its Intellectual Property or grants a covenant not to use
or (b) any Person permits any Group Company to use any Software or
Intellectual Property not owned by any Group Company, except for Off-the-Shelf
Software (collectively, " _Licenses_ "). Seller has made available to Buyer
complete and correct copies of the Licenses listed on _Schedule 3.12_. No
Group Company and, to the Knowledge of Seller, no other party thereto, is in
default, in any material respect, under any License, and each License is in
full force and effect.

 



31 (b) Within the past three (3) years, to Sellers Knowledge, (i) none of the
Group Companies has suffered a material Data Breach, (ii) no material breach
or violation of the Written Information Security Program has occurred and
(iii) except as set forth in _Schedule 3.12(b)_ , none of the Group Companies
has notified or been required to notify any Person of any material Data
Breach suffered by its service providers, Seller or any of its Affiliates
(including Group Companies). No representation or warranty is made in this
Agreement with respect to Data Breaches suffered by third parties other than
Seller or any of its Affiliates (including Group Companies).

Section 3.13 _Permits; Compliance with Law_. _Schedule 3.13_ lists all
licenses, permits and other governmental authorizations (other than individual
vehicle licenses or registrations or certificates of occupancy) issued by any
Governmental Entity exercising jurisdiction over any Group Company (the "
_Permits_ ") maintained by a Group Company in connection with the conduct of
its business as currently conducted, other than any Permit the absence of
which would not be material. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.13_ , no
Group Company has received during the past three (3) years any written notice
of any violation of any Permit or any applicable Law, or any written notice of
a proposal by any Governmental Entity to revoke, cancel, rescind, modify or
refuse to renew any such Permit and to the Knowledge of Seller, no Group
Company is under investigation by any Governmental Entity with respect to any
material violation of any applicable Law. Except as set forth on  _Schedule
3.13_ , each of the Group Companies is and has been in material compliance
with applicable Law and the Permits. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.13_ ,
the Group Companies have all Permits necessary for the conduct of
their business, other than any Permit the absence of which would not be
material.

Section 3.14 _Litigation_. Except as set forth on  _Schedule 3.14_ , there
are no Actions or unresolved material disputes with respect to which any Group
Company has been served or given written notice, pending, or to the Knowledge
of Seller threatened, against any Group Company or with respect to any of its
respective properties, with respect to requests for payment or other
performance, other than (a) Actions or unresolved disputes with respect to
requests for performance that do not seek injunctive or declarative relief
against any Group Company and for which the amount in controversy (as
reasonably determined by the Group Companies in their good faith business
judgment) does not exceed $250,000, and (b) Actions or unresolved disputes
with respect to requests for payment or other performance that are covered by
an Insurance Policy, whether or not subject to a reservation of rights. No
Group Company is a party to or subject to any settlement or similar agreement
with any Governmental Entity or any material judgment, order, injunction or
decree of any Governmental Entity under which any Group Company has any
ongoing obligation. Seller has provided Buyer with an extract of Sellers
Legal Department Database as of August 22, 2017 setting forth all disputes
involving a Group Company that are being handled by the Oldcastle Law Group
and for which the amount in controversy (as reasonably determined by the Group
Companies in their good faith business judgment) is in excess of $50,000.

Return not previously filed.

 

(f) There is no suit, audit, examination, or, to the Knowledge of Seller,
investigation or other Action pending, proposed or threatened in respect of
Taxes payable by any Group Company. No Tax deficiency has been asserted in

ordinary course of business the primary purpose of which is not the allocation
or sharing of Taxes), or has any liability for Taxes of any other person or
entity (other than another member of the Allied Consolidated Group) under

Law.

Section 4.9 _Financing_.

 

(a) A true, complete and correct copy of the debt commitment letter, dated
August 24, 2017 (as may be amended or replaced, in each case subject to the
terms of _Section 5.14(a)_, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ") as in effect on
the date hereof has been provided to Seller.

 

(b) A true, complete and correct copy of the investment agreement between
Buyer, CDandR Boulder Holdings, L.P. and Clayton, Dubilier and Rice Fund IX,

subject to the terms of _Section 5.14(a)_, the " _Equity Commitment Letter_
") as in effect on the date hereof has been provided to Seller.

(c) A true and complete copy of each fee letter related to the Commitment
Letters as in effect on the date hereof has been provided to Seller, except
for customary redactions solely in respect of the amounts, percentages and
basis points of compensation and other similar economics set forth therein,
the pricing and other terms of the "flex" provisions and the "securities
demand" provisions set forth therein (none of which would impact the
conditionality, enforceability or availability of the aggregate amount of the
Financing).

 



41 (d) Buyer has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by
the Commitment Letters to be paid on or before the date hereof. As of the
date hereof, each Commitment Letter is a legal, valid and binding obligation
of each of the Buyer Companies party thereto and, to the Knowledge of Buyer,
each other party thereto, and in full force and effect, except as such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting creditors rights
generally and by general principles of equity. As of the date hereof, (i)
neither Commitment Letter has been amended or modified in any respect and has
not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded (or the commitments therein
otherwise reduced) in any respect and, to the Knowledge of Buyer, no
withdrawal, termination or rescission or reduction is contemplated, and (ii)
no Buyer Company is in default under the terms and conditions of any
Commitment Letter and no event has occurred which (with or without notice,
lapse of time or both) would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach
thereunder on the part of a Buyer Company party or, to the Knowledge of Buyer,
any other party thereto and no Buyer Company has received any written notice
of such default or event. As of the date hereof, no amendment or modification
of any Commitment Letter is contemplated (other than joinder documentation or
an amendment and restatement of a Commitment Letter, in each case relating to
addition of additional equity investors in respect of the Equity Financing or
the appointment of additional agents, co-agents, arrangers, bookrunners,
managers or other roles in respect of the Debt Financing or modifications
thereto to implement the flex provisions set forth in any fee letter
related thereto, none of which would impact the conditionality,
enforceability or availability of the aggregate amount of the Financing).

(e) Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_
and _Section 6.2_, the aggregate proceeds contemplated to be provided by the
Commitment Letters, together with available cash of the Buyer Companies, will
be sufficient for Buyer to make all required payments in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, including payment of the Purchase Price, and
all other amounts to be paid pursuant to this Agreement and associated fees,
costs and expenses of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Financing, on the Closing Date.

(f) Except for the Commitment Letters and fee letters referred to in the
Commitment Letters (copies of which have been provided to Seller in accordance
with the foregoing), as of the date hereof, (i) there are no side letters or
other agreements relating to the conditions of the funding or investing, as
applicable, of the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters other than
any engagement letter and fee credit letters, and (ii) there are no conditions
precedent or other contingencies (including pursuant to any "market flex"
provisions in the related fee letters or otherwise) related to the funding of
the full amount of the Financing or any provisions that could reduce the
aggregate amount of the Financing set forth in the Commitment Letters or the
aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Commitment Letters. Assuming the
satisfaction of the conditions precedent in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_,
as of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of Buyer, there are no facts or
circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in any of the
conditions to the Financing not being satisfied on a timely basis or that
would cause the full amount of the Financing to not be available to the Buyer
Companies on the date on which the Closing should occur pursuant to _Section
2.3_.

 



42 Section 4.10 _Solvency_. Immediately after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Financing), and assuming (1)
the representations and warranties in _ARTICLE 3_ are true and correct, (2)
the satisfaction by the Seller of the conditions contained in this Agreement,
(3) the performance by Seller of the terms of this Agreement prior to, at and
immediately after the Closing, and (4) that the Required Information is true
and correct, (a) the "present fair saleable value" of the assets of the Buyer
and the Buyer Companies, including the Group Companies (determined on a going
concern basis), taken as a whole, will exceed the amount of all "liabilities
of the Buyer and the Buyer Companies, including the Group Companies, taken as
a whole, contingent or otherwise (at a fair valuation)" as such quoted terms
(after substituting "Buyer and the Buyer Companies, including the Group
Companies" with "Persons") are generally determined in accordance with federal
Laws governing the determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (b) and
Buyer does not believe that Buyer and the Buyer Companies, including the Group
Companies immediately following the Closing, taken as a whole, will incur
debts in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice that
will be beyond their ability to pay such debts. No transfer of property is
being made and no obligation is being incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby with the intent by Buyer to hinder, delay or
defraud either present or future creditors of Buyer, any Buyer Company or any
Group Company.

contained in the confidentiality agreements to which the Group Companies are
subject, Seller shall provide to Buyer and its authorized representatives and
the Financing Sources, during normal business hours reasonable access to the
books and records of the Group Companies (in a manner so as to not interfere
with the normal business operations of any Group Company); provided that
Seller may withhold any document (or portions thereof) or information (i) that
is subject to the terms of a non-disclosure agreement with a third party,
_provided_ that Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
consent of such third party to permit such disclosure, (ii) that may
constitute privileged attorney-client communications or attorney work product
and the transfer of which, or the provision of access to which, as
reasonably determined by outside counsel, constitutes a waiver of any such
privilege or (iii) if the provision of access to such document (or portion
thereof) or information, as reasonably determined by outside counsel, would
reasonably be expected to conflict with applicable Laws. In addition, from
and after the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing Date or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Seller shall
promptly provide Buyer and its authorized representatives and the Financing
Sources via email or shared data site with true and complete copies of all
financial statements, documents and other information reasonably requested by
Buyer and available to Seller to the extent relating to the Group Companies.
All of such information shall be treated as confidential information pursuant
to the terms of the applicable Confidentiality Agreement, the provisions of
which are by this reference hereby incorporated herein. To the extent
Seller has not made available to Buyer complete and correct copies of any
written Contracts (including any Leases) (as identified in the Schedules as of
the date hereof), Seller shall provide to Buyer complete and correct copies of
such written Contracts (including any Leases) within twenty (20) calendar
days of the date hereof. Nothing herein shall be construed to require Seller
to provide access to any underlying data communicated to Buyers consultant,
Bain and Company, Inc., pursuant to the Clean Team Confidentiality Agreement,
or any commercially sensitive information exchanged by the parties respective
legal counsel pursuant to that certain Joint Defense Agreement, dated July 19,
2017, or any personnel information made available to Buyers legal counsel
pursuant to that certain HR Clean Team Confidentiality Agreement, which
limitation of access obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement.
Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer as promptly as
practical following the date hereof (and in any event not more than three (3)
Business Days following the date hereof) five copies of one or more CDs, DVDs
or USB flash drives containing copies of all documents (in a readable format)
that were uploaded to the Merrill data site in connection with the purchase
and sale of the Shares as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the date immediately

 



47  preceding the date hereof. Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to
Buyer as promptly as practical following the Closing (and in any event not
more than three (3) Business Day following the Closing) five copies of one or
more CDs, DVDs or USB flash drives containing copies of all documents (in a
readable format) that were uploaded for review by Bain and Company, Inc. in
connection with the purchase and sale of the Shares as of the Closing.

Section 5.4 _Delivery of Title Documents_. At least five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing, Seller shall deliver to the Title Company the Title
Documents.

Section 5.5 _Transfer of Certain Assets, Books and Records_. 

(a) To the extent Seller or its Affiliates (other than a Group Company) owns
or has in its possession or control (as applicable) any assets (other than
books and records, which are the subject of the further provisions of this
_Section 5.5_) primarily used in the operation of the business conducted by
the Group Companies (other than inventory or supplies ordered and awaiting
delivery in the ordinary course), Seller shall, prior to the Closing Date,
transfer all such assets to the ownership of, as well as, the possession and
control of, the Group Companies.

 

(b) To the extent Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Group Companies)
has any books and records of and exclusively relating to the Group Companies
not in the possession or control of the Group Companies, Seller shall, as soon
as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, subject to the
provisions of _Section 10.15_, transfer or provide copies of all such books
and records to the possession or control of the Group Companies, including
all Contracts, leases, Title Documents, Tax records, litigation materials and
files (including litigation strategy, attorney work-product, litigation
correspondence, responses, summons, complaints or other pleadings which may
have been served and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other
document evidencing or asserting the same); _provided_ that this sentence
shall not apply to any information relating to the Group Companies maintained
by Seller or its Affiliates and that incorporates data or proprietary
information of or relating to Seller or its Affiliates other than the Group
Companies or that cannot readily be isolated from Sellers or its Affiliates
files or information systems (" _Nonextracted Information_ "). Subject to the
provisions of _Section 10.15_, following the Closing Date, Seller or its
Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and provide
Buyer with any Nonextracted Information specifically and reasonably requested
by Buyer for a proper purpose relating to the post-Closing ownership or
operation of Group Companies and that is maintained by Seller or its
Affiliates, subject in each case to appropriate redactions by Seller or its
Affiliates to protect information not related to the Group Companies;
_provided_ that Buyer and the Group Companies, and their respective
representatives shall also have the right to access such data and information
pursuant to _Section 5.5(e)_ and _Section 5.5(f)_ below. Notwithstanding any
provision hereof, Seller and its Affiliates shall be entitled to retain copies
of all books and records relating to the Group Companies to the extent
reasonably needed by the Seller or its Affiliates to perform their obligations
hereunder, under applicable Law, stock exchange regulations or financial
reporting requirements, including to prepare any necessary Tax Return or to
enable Seller or its Affiliates to respond, defend or prosecute any Action to
which Seller or any of its Affiliates are or hereafter may be a party.

 

(c) To the extent that any of the obligations set forth in Section 5.5(a) _or_
Section 5.5(b)are not complied with prior to Closing, the obligations shall
continue hereunder following the Closing and this provision shall survive the
Closing.

 



48 (d) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, to the extent
requested by Seller or its Affiliates, Seller and its Affiliates and their
representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the books and records
relating to the ownership or operations of the Group Companies prior to the
Closing Date (including the right to make copies or extracts therefrom at
Sellers expense) to the extent that such information may reasonably be
required by Seller or its Affiliates in order for Seller or its Affiliates to
comply with any legal obligation affected by the ownership or operations of
the Group Companies prior to the Closing Date. Such access shall be afforded
by Buyer upon receipt of reasonable advance notice and during normal business
hours; _provided_ that such request does not unreasonably interfere with the
Buyers and Group Companies operation of their business. If Buyer or any of
its Affiliates (including the Group Companies) shall desire to dispose of any
of such books and records prior to the expiration of such six-year period
other than in accordance with the Group Companies regular document retention
policies, Buyer shall, prior to such disposition, give Seller a reasonable
opportunity to obtain, at Sellers expense, copies or extracts of such books
and records as Seller may select, provided that any data or information
contained in any such books or records that relates primarily to Buyer or its
Affiliates (other than the Group Companies) can be excised therefrom without
undue cost or effort.

 

(e) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, subject to the
provisions of _Section 10.15_, Buyer and its representatives shall have
reasonable access to all of the books and records to the extent relating to
the Group Companies which Seller or any of its Affiliates may retain after the
Closing Date, including all Contracts, leases, Title Documents, Tax records,
litigation materials and files (including litigation strategy, attorney work-
product, litigation correspondence, responses, summons, complaints or other
pleadings which may have been served and any written claim, demand, invoice,
billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same) and emails, it
being agreed that such materials are provided or made available on an "AS IS"
basis and without any representation or warranty of any kind, express or
implied. Buyer and the Group Companies assume all risks with respect to the
disclosure of such information to Buyer, the Group Companies or their
respective representatives, including any risk that such disclosure
constitutes a waiver of any privilege otherwise attaching to such
information. Such access shall be afforded by Seller and its Affiliates upon
receipt of reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours;
_provided_ that such request does not unreasonably interfere with the Sellers
or its Affiliates operation of their business. If Seller or any of its
Affiliates shall desire to dispose of any of such books and records prior to
the expiration of such six-year period other than in accordance with Sellers
regular document retention policies, Seller shall, prior to such disposition,
give Buyer a reasonable opportunity to obtain, at Buyers expense, copies or
extracts of such books and records as Buyer may select, provided that any data
or information contained in any such books or records that relates primarily
to Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Group Companies) can be excised
therefrom without undue cost or effort.

 

(f) The parties shall, at the expense of the requesting party, cooperate with
each other with respect to the defense of any Action related to the operation
of the Group Companies on or prior to the Closing. Subject to the provisions
of _Section 10.15_, each party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, make
their respective then current officers or employees and consultants available
for interviews, consultations, discussions and/or testimony by or with the
other party and/or its representatives, for reasonable business and legal
purposes at all

 



49  reasonable times during business hours, while any Action related to the
operation of the Group Companies on or prior to the Closing remains open and
unresolved, provided that such cooperation does not unreasonably interfere
with such partys or its Affiliates operation of their business. Seller shall
furnish Buyer with such information as it may have with respect to any Action
related to the operation of the Group Companies on or prior to the Closing
(including litigation strategy, attorney work-product, litigation
correspondence (including emails), responses, summons, complaints or other
pleadings which may have been served and any written claim, demand, invoice,
billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same), it being agreed
that such materials are provided or made available on an "AS IS" basis and
without any representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied. Buyer
and the Group Companies assume all risks with respect to the disclosure of
such information to Buyer, the Group Companies or their respective
representatives, including any risk that such disclosure constitutes a waiver
of any privilege otherwise attaching to such information.

Section 5.6 _Efforts to Consummate._

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of Buyer and
Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all
actions necessary or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as
practicable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
satisfaction, but not waiver, of the Closing conditions set forth in
_ARTICLE 6_ ). Each of Buyer and Seller shall use best efforts to obtain
consents of all Governmental Entities necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each party hereto shall, or shall cause its
relevant ultimate parent entity to, make an appropriate filing, if necessary,
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement promptly (and in any event, within five (5) Business Days) after the
date of this Agreement and shall supply as promptly as practicable to the
appropriate Governmental Entities any additional information and documentary
material that may be reasonably requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Without
limiting the foregoing, Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates shall
not extend any waiting period or comparable period under the HSR Act or enter
into any agreement with any Governmental Entity not to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, except with the prior written consent of
the other parties hereto. All filing fees payable under the HSR Act shall be
borne by Buyer.

(b) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take all actions
necessary to resolve any objections that may be asserted by any Governmental
Entity to expeditiously consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall:

(i) at Buyers sole cost, comply with all restrictions and conditions, if any,
required by any Governmental Entity with respect to Antitrust Laws in
connection with granting any necessary clearance, terminating any applicable
waiting period or otherwise not opposing consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby including (1) agreeing to sell, divest, hold separate,
license, cause a third party to acquire, or otherwise dispose of, any
Subsidiary, operations, divisions, businesses, product lines, customers or
assets of Buyer, its Affiliates or any Group Company contemporaneously with or
after the Closing and regardless of whether a third party purchaser has been
identified or approved prior to the Closing (a " _Divestiture_ "), (2) taking
or committing to take such other actions that may limit Buyer, its 

 



50  Affiliates, or (after the Closing) any Group Companys freedom of action
with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its operations,
divisions, businesses, products lines, customers or assets, and (3) entering
into any order, consent decree or other agreement to effectuate any of the
foregoing;

(ii) amend, assign or terminate existing, or enter into any new, licenses,
contracts or other agreements or other business relationship insofar as
required to obtain any necessary clearance of any Governmental Entity, obtain
termination of any applicable waiting period under any Antitrust Laws or
otherwise cause any Governmental Entity not to oppose the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; and

 

(iii) use reasonable best efforts to oppose any request for or the entry of,
and to seek to have vacated or terminated, any order, judgment, decree,
injunction or ruling of any Governmental Entity that could restrain, prevent
or delay the Closing, including by defending through litigation, any action
asserted by any Person in any court or before any Governmental Entity and by
appealing properly any adverse decision or order by any Governmental Entity.

(c) In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer shall negotiate in good faith with
all Governmental Entities and, to the extent necessary, third parties in
connection with a Divestiture or any other matter referred to in _Section
5.6(b)_ in order to enter into all necessary definitive agreements with all
such Persons as promptly as practicable after receipt by Buyer or Seller of
any formal request for the submission of additional information or documentary
material by either the United States Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §
18a(e)(1)(A) or the commencement of a formal second phase investigation by any
other Governmental Entity, and in any event a sufficient time prior to the
Termination Date to permit the Closing to occur prior to such date.

(d) Each of Buyer and Seller will promptly notify the other parties hereto of
any written communication made to or received by either Buyer and/or Seller,
as the case may be, from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and, subject to applicable Law, if
practicable, permit the other parties hereto to review in advance any
proposed written communication to any such Governmental Entity and incorporate
the other parties reasonable comments, not agree to participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion with any such Governmental Entity in
respect of any filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby unless, to the extent reasonably
practicable, it consults with the other parties hereto in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other parties the
opportunity to attend, and furnish the other parties with copies of all
correspondence, filings and written communications between them and their
Affiliates and their respective representatives on one hand and any such
Governmental Entity or its respective staff on the other hand, with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, _provided_ that this
Agreement shall not obligate any party to disclose to any other party such
portions of any proposed or final correspondence, filing, or other written
communication with a Governmental Entity or its staff as the party to such
correspondence, filing, or communication may reasonably deem
confidential vis-a-vis the other party.

 



51 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but
subject to Buyers obligations set forth in this _Section 5.6_, Buyer shall
have the right to direct all matters with respect to any Governmental Entity
consistent with its obligations hereunder, shall have the principal
responsibility for devising and implementing the strategy for obtaining any
necessary antitrust or competition clearances, in all events a sufficient time
on or prior to August 31, 2018 to permit the Closing to occur prior to such
date, and shall take the lead in all meetings and communications with any
Governmental Entity in connection with obtaining any necessary antitrust or
competition clearances.

 

(f) Each party to this Agreement agrees to cooperate and use commercially
reasonably efforts in obtaining any other consents and approvals that may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(g) Each party to this Agreement acknowledges that the Group Companies
currently benefit from certain Contracts to which Parent and/or certain
Affiliates of Parent are parties and that relate to the operations or conduct
of the business of Parent and/or one or more of the Affiliates of Seller and
the Group Companies, but will remain with the Parent and/or one or more of the
Affiliates of Parent after the Closing. In the case of those Contracts set
forth on _Schedule 5.6(g)_ (the " _Shared Contracts_ "), the parties shall
cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to
(i) obtain the agreement of the third party that is the counterparty to each
Shared Contract to enter into a new contract effective as of the Closing
Date pursuant to which the Group Companies will receive substantially the
same goods and services provided by the Shared Contract to the Group Companies
prior to the Closing on terms and conditions substantially similar to those
contained in the Shared Contract as of the Closing Date (each, a "
_Replacement Contract_ ") and (ii) to the extent a Group Company is a party to
a Shared Contract, obtain the release from the counterparty of the Group
Companies obligations arising after the Closing Date under the Shared
Contract effective as of the Closing Date and a release of Parent, Seller and
their respective Affiliates from any obligations in respect of the Group
Companies in connection with such Shared Contract from and after the Closing
Date . Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent, Seller, nor any Group
Company shall have any obligation to (x) pay any consideration or give
anything of value to any Person for the purpose of obtaining any
Replacement Contract or (y) pay any costs and expenses of any Person
resulting from the process of obtaining or seeking any Replacement Contract.
Buyer acknowledges that receipt of any Replacement Contract shall in no event
be a condition to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
If one or more Replacement Contracts are not obtained prior to or on the
Closing Date, unless the parties otherwise agree in writing, during the
remainder of the current term of the applicable Shared Contract (but not
including any renewals or extensions), the parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to allow the Group Companies, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law and to the extent reasonably within the contractual or
other ability or control of Parent or Buyer, as the case may be, to continue
to benefit from the terms of the Shared Contract as applicable to Parent and
its other Affiliates from time to time. Nothing herein shall require Parent
or any of its Affiliates to obtain the consent of Buyer or the Group
Companies in connection with any amendment or waiver to be given under any
such Shared Contract in the ordinary course of business, _provided_ that
Parent shall give Buyer reasonable prior notice of any such amendment or
waiver that would reasonably be expected to have a material impact on the
benefits available to the Group Companies under such Shared Contract. To the
extent any Group Company continues to receive benefits under any

 



52  Shared Contract following the Closing pursuant to this _Section 5.6(e)_:
(1) Parent and Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer
Indemnitees from any Losses based upon, related to or arising out of the
Shared Contracts to the extent attributable to any obligations or liabilities
incurred by Parent, Seller or their respective Affiliates (other than any
Group Company) in connection with their receipt of benefits under any such
Shared Contract, and (2) Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Seller Indemnitees from any Losses based upon, related to or arising out of
the Shared Contracts to the extent attributable to any obligation or
liability of or incurred in connection with the Group Companies receipt of
benefits under any such Shared Contract. Any amounts payable under a Shared
Contract that are not directly attributable to either Parent, Seller and their
respective Affiliates (other than the Group Companies), on the one hand, or
the Group Companies, on the other, will be allocated among them on a fair and
equitable basis consistent with the applicable practices prior to the Closing.
This  _Section 5.6(g)_ does not apply to the Seller Group Insurance
Policies, which are addressed in _Section 5.18_.

 

Section 5.7 _Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) Buyer agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the current or
former directors or officers, as the case may be, of any of the Group
Companies as provided in their respective Governing Documents or in any
agreement shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full force and
effect. For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Buyer shall
maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement provisions
of any Group Companys Governing Documents as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such
provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former directors or
officers of any of the Group Companies;  _provided_ that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any claim pending or asserted or any claim made
within such period shall continue until the disposition of such claim or
resolution of such claim.

 

(b) In the event Buyer or any of its respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Buyer shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.7_.

(c) The officers and directors of the Group Companies serving at or prior to
the Effective Time shall remain covered for not less than six (6) years after
the Closing under the Seller Group Insurance Policies providing directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance with respect
to matters arising on or before the Effective Time, including without
limitation covering the transactions contemplated herein.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, without
duplication of any amount, Seller and Parent shall, jointly and severally,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer and the Group Companies from and
against all liability, loss, damages, claims, costs, expenses, awards,
judgments and penalties of any kind suffered or incurred by 

 



53  Buyer or the Group Companies from and after the Closing to the extent and in
such amount as Buyer and the Group Companies are required to pay to indemnify
any officers or directors of any Group Company that were serving at or prior
to the Effective Time to the extent in respect to matters arising on or before
the Effective Time, in each case in excess of the proceeds of any applicable
Seller Group Insurance Policies , _provided that_  such obligation shall not
apply to liability, loss, damages, claims, costs, expenses, awards, judgments
or penalties incurred in connection with any Action or proceeding by Buyer or
any of Buyers Affiliates (including any Group Company) against any such
officers and directors.

Section 5.8 _Exclusive Dealing_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement through the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Seller shall not, nor shall it
permit any of its Affiliates to, engage in any discussions or negotiations
with, provide any information to, or enter into any contract with, any Person
(other than Buyer and Buyers representatives) concerning any sale, transfer
or other disposition of the equity securities of any Group Company, any merger
involving any Group Company, any sale of a material portion of the business
or assets of any Group Company, any recapitalization of any Group Company or
other similar transaction involving any Group Company (other than sales of
inventory sold in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice).

Section 5.9 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) All employees of the Group Companies as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall continue as employees of the Group Companies as of the
Effective Time (each, a " _Company Employee_ "). Seller shall take all action
necessary to cause the Company Employees to cease participating as active
employees in each Seller Benefit Plan effective as of the Closing. Other
than with respect to Company Employees who provide services pursuant to a
collective bargaining agreement, for a period beginning on the Closing Date
and continuing thereafter for twelve (12) months, Buyer shall provide, or
shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide, Company Employees with (i) employee
benefits that in the aggregate are substantially comparable to the employee
benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates,
and (ii) base salary or wage rates and other compensation (including an
annual cash bonus opportunity, opportunities for commissions and other
incentive compensation) that in the aggregate are substantially comparable to
such compensation provided to each such Company Employee by the Group
Companies, Seller or an Affiliate of Seller immediately prior to the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of the foregoing, equity and
equity-based compensation provided by any Group Company to any Company
Employee shall not be taken into account and Buyer shall have no obligation to
provide equity or equity-based compensation to any Company Employee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement or any Ancillary Document shall be deemed to amend
any Company Benefit Plan or limit, in any respect, the right of Buyer or any
of its Subsidiaries (including the Group Companies) to (A) terminate the
employment of any Company Employee at any time for any or no reason, (B)
change or modify the terms or conditions of employment for any Company
Employee (including location of performance) or (C) change or modify any
Employee Benefit Plan or arrangement in accordance with its terms. Buyer
shall permit each Company Employee who was a participant in or eligible to
participate in a 401(k) Plan of Seller or an Affiliate of Seller prior to the
Closing to be eligible to participate in a defined contribution retirement
plan that is intended to be tax qualified and that is established or
designated by Buyer

 



54  (the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_ ") in accordance with the terms of the Buyer
401(k) Plan, and subject to the approval of the applicable plan fiduciaries
(which Buyer shall seek), Buyer shall take any and all actions as may be
required to permit each such employee to make rollover contributions of
"eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of
the Code, and including plan loans) to the Buyer 401(k) Plan in an amount
equal to the eligible rollover distribution portion of the account balance
distributed to such employee from the Company 401(k) Plan (including plan
loans).

 

(b) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements established or maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates in
which Company Employees may be eligible to participate after the Closing (the
" _New Benefit Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited with the
same amount of service as was credited by the Group Companies as of the
Closing under similar or comparable Employee Benefit Plans (including for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit accrual (other than
for purposes of defined benefit plans or retiree welfare arrangements) and
eligibility to receive benefits);  _provided_ that such crediting of service
shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any benefit. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) with
respect to any New Benefit Plans in which the Company Employees may be
eligible to participate following the Closing, each Company Employee will
immediately be eligible to participate in such New Benefit Plans, without any
waiting time, to the extent coverage under such New Benefit Plans replaces
coverage under a similar or comparable Employee Benefit Plan in which such
Company Employee was eligible to participate immediately before such
commencement of participation (such plans, collectively, the " _Old
Benefit Plans_ ") and (ii) for purposes of each New Benefit Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company
Employee, Buyer and its Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Benefit Plan to be waived for such Company Employee
and his or her covered dependents, to the extent any such exclusions or
requirements were waived or were inapplicable under any similar or comparable
Employee Benefit Plan. Buyer and its Subsidiaries shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan
year of the Old Benefit Plan ending on the date such Company Employees
participation in the corresponding New Benefit Plan begins to be taken into
account under such New Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Benefit Plan. Subject
to applicable Law, Seller agrees that it will, and will cause its Affiliates
and their respective service providers to, provide Buyer, its Affiliates and
their respective service providers with access, on a schedule to be mutually
agreed in good faith, to (i) all information reasonably requested by Buyer
and its service providers to allow Buyer to comply with the provisions of this
_Section 5.9_ and (ii) the employees of the Group Companies for purposes of
communicating with such employees regarding the New Benefit Plans and
facilitating enrollment therein.

(c) Other than with respect to Company Employees who provide services
pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, for a period of one year from
and after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Group Companies to comply with a
severance pay plan for Company Employees in the form attached hereto as
_Schedule 5.9(c)_ (the " _Severance Pay Plan_ "),

 



55  subject only to such amendments as may from time to time be required to
comply with applicable Law. Buyer shall cause the Group Companies to implement
and administer the Severance Pay Plan in compliance with its terms and
applicable Law. If any Company Employee is transferred to the employ of Buyer
or an Affiliate of Buyer (other than the Group Companies) during such one year
period, then Buyer shall, or shall cause its relevant Affiliate to, comply
with the Severance Pay Plan in the event of a termination of employment of any
such Company Employee during such one year period. For purposes of the
Severance Pay Plan, Company Employees shall be eligible for severance
pay based on the job title they held on the day preceding the Closing Date.

(d) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause the Company to pay all (i)
Loyalty Bonuses which become payable, and (ii) Retention Bonuses in accordance
with the Retention Bonus Agreements set forth on _Schedule 3.10_ , all of
which payments shall be subject to applicable withholdings.

 

(e) Following the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Group Companies to pay all
amounts due to any employees of the Group Companies pursuant to any
Incremental Retention Bonus Agreements entered into pursuant to _Section
5.1(b)(v)_, if, as and when due under such Incremental Retention Bonus
Agreements. Upon presentation of reasonable documentation of such post-Closing
payments, Seller agrees to reimburse Buyer or the applicable Group Company
for two-thirds of the amount of such bonuses (including any employer-side
employment Taxes), calculated on an after Tax basis.

 

(f) Buyer agrees to cause the Group Companies to pay the Accrued Bonuses to
the applicable Group Company employees, to the extent such Accrued Bonuses
have not been paid prior to the Closing and are taken into account in the
determination of the Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date. Such bonuses
will be paid on or before December 31, 2017. Buyers covenant under this 
_Section 5.9(f)_ is without prejudice to Buyers obligations under _Section
5.9(a)(ii)_ with respect to the period from and after the Effective Time.

 

(g) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Group
Companies to notify Seller within thirty (30) days after any of the Company
Employees listed on _Schedule 5.9(g)_ leaves the employ of Buyer or any Group
Company for any reason.

(h) This  _Section 5.9_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing in this _Section 5.9_,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights
or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section
5.9_. Without limiting the foregoing, no provision of this _Section 5.9_ will
create any third party beneficiary rights in any current or former employee,
director or consultant of any Group Company in respect of continued
employment (or resumed employment) or any other matter.

(i) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall cooperate with Buyer and take or
cause to be taken all actions necessary to provide notice to, and to offer to

Company Employees who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement

56  currently sponsored by a Group Company, Seller or an Affiliate of Seller
that will result from Closing. In addition, to the extent the terms of a
collective bargaining agreement will automatically renew unless written
notice of intent to terminate or modify the collective bargaining agreement is
provided to the applicable collective bargaining representative prior to the
date of Closing, Seller agrees to provide or not so provide such notice in a
timely manner as requested by Buyer and shall confer with Buyer with regard to
any negotiations with respect to such collective bargaining agreements.

 

(j) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall transfer the sponsorship of, and
all liabilities related to, the Keystone/Dolomite Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan to an Affiliate of Seller (other than a Group Company).
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent Seller from amending
or terminating such plan without the consent of Buyer.

 

Section 5.10 _Public Announcements_. No party hereto, and none of their
respective Affiliates, shall issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other announcement with respect to this Agreement, the Ancillary
Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby without the prior
consent of the other parties, unless such party determines in good faith,
after consultation with legal counsel, that it is required by applicable Law
to issue or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement
with respect to this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby, in which event such party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to provide a meaningful opportunity to the other party to review and
comment upon such press release or other announcement prior to making any such
press release or other announcement;  _provided_ that (a) each party hereto
and their respective Affiliates may make statements that are substantially
similar to (i) the joint press release issued by the parties hereto in
connection with the execution of this Agreement or (ii) previous press
releases, public disclosures or public statements made by any party hereto in
compliance with this _Section 5.10_ and (b) notwithstanding the foregoing,

marketing materials, in connection with the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letters.

person within the meaning of Section 897 of the Code.

 

Section 5.12 _Notification_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall promptly
notify Buyer in writing of any event, condition, fact or circumstance that
would make the timely satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in
_ARTICLE 6_ impossible or unlikely. No such notification shall be deemed to
supplement or amend the Schedules in any respect for the purpose of: (i)
determining the accuracy of any of the representations and warranties made by
Seller in this Agreement; or (ii) determining whether any of the conditions
set forth in _ARTICLE 6_ has been satisfied. Notwithstanding anything in this
_Section 5.12_ or elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
will Sellers requirements set forth in this _Section 5.12_ be used by Buyer
as a basis for a claim of breach by Seller or a failure to comply with a
Closing condition of Buyer unless Seller acts in bad faith and willfully fails
to comply in a material respect with its obligations pursuant to this _Section
5.12_, which failure has not been cured within ten (10) days from receipt of
a written notice from Buyer specifying in reasonable detail such failure.

 



57 Section 5.13 _Related Party Agreements_. On or before the Closing Date, Seller
shall, and shall cause each Group Company to take all actions necessary to
terminate all rights and obligations under the Related Party Agreements set
forth on _Schedule 5.13_ and, following the Closing, no party to such Related
Party Agreements, including the Group Companies and their Affiliates
(including Buyer and its Affiliates), shall have any liability or obligation
to the other with respect thereto, other than with respect to indemnification
obligations for losses during the period prior to the Closing.

Section 5.14 _Financing_.

 

(a) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and do, or cause to be done, as promptly as possible, all things
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing
on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letters, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer shall have the right to replace or amend the
Commitment Letters from time to time between the date hereof and Closing (A)
to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or any person
with similar roles or titles that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter
as of the date hereof or to add investors that have not executed the Equity
Commitment Letter or (B) in any other manner, in each case to the extent such
amendment, modification or waiver would not, taken as a whole, have the effect
of (i) reducing the aggregate amount of the Financing under any Debt Document
or Equity Document (except to the extent any other Financing contemplated by
the Commitment Letters is increased by a like amount), or (ii) imposing new
or additional conditions to the receipt of the Financing or otherwise
amending, modifying or expanding any of the conditions to the receipt of the
Financing, in each case in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (x)
materially delay or prevent the Closing or (y) materially or adversely impact
the ability of Buyer to satisfy the conditions to obtaining the Financing.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall use reasonable
best efforts to (w) maintain in full force and effect each Commitment Letter
and comply with its obligations thereunder, (x) satisfy, or cause to be
satisfied (or, if deemed advisable by Buyer taking into account the expected
timing of Closing, seek the waiver of), on a timely basis and in a manner
that will not impede the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby in advance of the Termination Date, all conditions to
Buyer obtaining the Financing that are required to be satisfied by Buyer and
its Subsidiaries and that are within the control of Buyer (including, after
commencement of the Marketing Period and the "marketing period" described in
the Debt Commitment Letter), (y) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to (1) the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including any related
flex provisions) and otherwise on terms that are acceptable to Buyer and the
Debt Financing Sources (such definitive agreements related to the Debt
Financing, collectively, with the Debt Commitment Letter, the " _Debt
Documents_ ") and (2) the Equity Financing on the terms and conditions
contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter and otherwise on terms that are
acceptable to Buyer and the Equity Financing Sources (such definitive
agreements related to the Equity Financing, collectively, with the Equity
Commitment Letter, the " _Equity Documents_ "), and (z) assuming that all
conditions contained in the Commitment Letters have been satisfied, consummate
the Financing at or prior to the Closing. Buyer shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Financing Sources and the other Persons providing or
committing to provide such Financing to comply with their obligations under
the Commitment Letters and the Debt Documents or the Equity Documents, as
applicable, and to fund no later than the Closing Date the Financing required
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
using reasonable best efforts to enforce its rights under the Commitment
Letters, the Debt Documents and the Equity Documents.

 



58 (b) Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably informed of the status of its efforts
to arrange the Financing and to satisfy the conditions thereof, and shall
give Seller prompt notice (i) of any material breach or material default by
any party to the Commitment Letters or other Debt Document or Equity Document,
as applicable, of which Buyer becomes aware, (ii) of the receipt by Buyer or
any of its Affiliates of any written notice or other written communication
from any Financing Source with respect to (x) any actual, threatened or
alleged breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the
Commitment Letters or other Debt Document or Equity Document (including any
event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would reasonably be expected to give rise to such breach,
default, termination or repudiation, and including any proposal by any lender
or other Person to withdraw from or terminate any Commitment Letter) or (y)
any material dispute or disagreement relating to the Financing between or
among any parties to any Commitment Letter or any Debt Document or Equity
Document, as applicable, entered into in connection with the Financing and
(iii) if for any reason Buyer believes in good faith that it will not be able
to obtain any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or from
the sources contemplated by the Commitment Letters, the Debt Documents or the
Equity Documents, as applicable.

 

(c) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in any Commitment Letter (after taking into account
flex terms), Buyer shall promptly notify Seller thereof and, if such portion
is necessary to consummate the Closing, use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange to obtain alternative debt or equity financing on terms and conditions
not less favorable, taken as a whole, to Buyer and its Subsidiaries than
those in the applicable Commitment Letter in an amount sufficient (taken as a
whole with other available Financing) for Buyer to make all required payments
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including payment of
the Purchase Price and all other amounts to be paid pursuant to this Agreement
and associated fees, costs and expenses of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Financing, on the Closing Date (" _Alternative
Financing_ ") as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event, and the provisions of this _Section 5.14_, _Section 5.15_, _Section
10.2_,  _Section 10.7_, _Section 10.12_, _Section 10.13(b)_ and _Section
10.16_ shall be applicable to the Alternative Financing, and, for the purposes
of this Agreement, all references to the Financing shall be deemed to include
such Alternative Financing, if with respect to the Debt Financing, all
references to Debt Documents shall include the applicable documents for the
Alternative Financing, if with respect to the Equity Financing, all references
to Equity Documents shall include the applicable documents for the
Alternative Financing, and all references to the Financing Sources shall
include the Persons providing or arranging the Alternative Financing. True,
complete and correct copies of each commitment letter and other agreement
relating to the Alternative Financing will be promptly provided to Seller.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing
contained in this _Section 5.14_ will require, and in no event will the
reasonable best efforts of Buyer be deemed or construed to require, Buyer to
enter into an Alternative Financing on terms or conditions less favorable,
taken as a whole, to Buyer and its Subsidiaries than those in the Commitment
Letters.

 



59 (d) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the Financing, or any
Alternative Financing, is not a condition to Closing.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations contained in this _Section
5.14_ shall terminate upon the occurrence of the Closing.

Section 5.15 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, shall cause its Subsidiaries, and
shall cause its and their respective directors, officers, employees, advisors
and other representatives to, at the sole expense of Buyer, use reasonable

Buyers common stock prior to the Closing which proceeds are to be used as a

(d) The Required Information (taken as a whole), when delivered by Seller to
Buyer, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact regarding the

Information, when taken as a whole, contains any untrue statement of a
material fact regarding the Group Companies or omits to state a material fact

such information is disclosed, not misleading, Seller will use reasonable best
efforts to update or supplement such information such that, after giving

Alternative Financing, is not a condition to the Closing.

indirectly relating to or arising out of any events, matters, causes, things,
acts, omissions or conduct occurring or existing at any time up to and
including the Closing Date; provided, however, that such Releasing Party is
not releasing (i) any rights available to it under this Agreement, any
Ancillary Document or any agreement entered into by such Releasing Party in
connection with the Closing, (ii) any rights available to it under any Related
Party Agreement to the extent such agreement is not terminated pursuant to
_Section 5.13_ or (iii) any rights available to it under any Contract between
a Seller Releasing Party (other than a Group Company) and a Buyer Releasing
Party (other than a Group Company) in each case entered into prior to or on
the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, (a) " _Releasees_ " means,

unsuspected or undisclosed claim; and (ii) any claim, right or cause of action
based upon any breach of any express, implied, oral or written contract or
agreement.

(b) To the extent any guarantees or similar assurances provided by Seller
or any Affiliate of Seller (other than a Group Company) in respect of
obligations or liabilities of any Group Company have not been discharged and
released at or before Closing, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Seller and its Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers,
employees, agents, representatives and professional advisors, from and against
any liability, loss, damages, claims, costs, expenses, awards, judgments and
penalties of any type suffered or incurred by them from and after Closing
pursuant to any such guarantee or assurances, _provided that_ Seller or such
Affiliate shall give Buyer prompt notice of any communication received from
the beneficiary of any such guarantee or similar assurance asserting any
claim thereunder, so as to enable the relevant Group Company to exercise any
defenses available in respect of the underlying obligation, and _further
provided_ that such indemnity shall not extend to any obligation or liability
of Seller or such Affiliate to the extent such obligation or liability
results from any waivers in the applicable guarantee or similar assurance that
effectively preclude assertion of defenses available to the Group Company in
respect of the underlying obligation.

 



64 Section 5.17 _Further Assurances_ . As and when required by any party hereto,
each party hereto shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, all such documents and instruments and will take, or cause to be
taken all such further or other actions, as such other party may reasonably
deem necessary or desirable to transfer and convey the Shares to Buyer, on
the terms herein contained, and to otherwise comply with the terms of this
Agreement (including _Section 5.5_) and consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.18 _Continuing Insurance Coverage_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, Parent and Seller agrees (i) to cause the
Group Companies to be afforded continuing coverage under, and subject to the
terms of, the Seller Group Insurance Policies, but solely for exposures,
claims, losses, occurrences, or other covered perils taking place or alleged
to have taken place prior to the Closing (whether reported prior to, on or
after the Closing but subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable
Seller Group Insurance Policy), and (ii) to provide reasonable assistance to
the Group Companies to notify the insurers under such Seller Group Insurance
Policies of any claims related to any occurrences prior to the Closing and to
use commercially reasonable efforts to assist, and to cause any third party
claims administrator retained by Seller from time to time to assist, the Group
Companies in administering such claims and obtaining (at the Group Companies
expense) the proceeds related to such claims.

(b) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Group
Companies and any counsel representing them or insurance administrator to,
keep Internal Counsel reasonably informed of the status of all claims asserted
or reasonably expected to be asserted against the Seller Group Insurance
Policies from time to time, and, subject to the execution of a customary joint
defense agreement, shall consult with Internal Counsel regarding the defense
or settlement of any such claim and allow Seller, through Internal Counsel, to
have the right to participate, at its own expense, in the defense thereof and
to be present at and participate in any meeting or Action with respect to any
such claim. It is understood and agreed that, at all times, Internal Counsel
will be representing solely Seller and its Affiliates, and no attorney-client
relationship shall be deemed to exist or be created between Buyer or any Group
Company, on the one hand, and Internal Counsel, on the other, as a result of
any participation of Internal Counsel in connection with any such insured
claim or Action as contemplated hereby.

of Seller to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are subject to
the satisfaction or, if permitted by applicable Law, waiver by Seller of the
following further conditions:

(a) the representations and warranties of Buyer set forth in (i) _Section
4.2_ shall be true and correct in all respects, except for _de minimis_
inaccuracies, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date, as
if made as of such time (except to the extent expressly made as of a
specified date, in which case as of such date), (ii) _Section 4.8_ shall be
true and correct in all respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of
the Closing Date, as if made as of such time (except to the extent expressly

_ARTICLE 4_ , other than those specified in the foregoing clauses (i) and
(ii), shall be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of
the Closing Date, as if made as of such time (except to the extent expressly
made as of a specified date, in which case as of such date), except where the
failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct
(without giving effect to any limitations as to "materiality" or "Buyer
Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein), does not constitute, individually
or in the aggregate, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect;

 



66 (b) Buyer shall have performed and complied in all material respects with all
covenants required to be performed or complied with by it under this
Agreement on or prior to the Closing Date; and

(c) Buyer shall have delivered to Seller a certificate, dated as of the

effect that the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this
_Section 6.3_ have been satisfied.

 

ARTICLE 7 __

 

 _TERMINATION_

 

Section 7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller;

 

(b) by Buyer or Seller by written notice to the other, if the Closing shall
not have occurred on or prior to February 28, 2018 (the " _Termination Date_
"); _provided_ that the right to terminate pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)_
shall not be available to any party whose breach of any provision of this
Agreement results in the failure of any of the conditions specified in
_ARTICLE 6_ from being satisfied, and _further provided_ that, if all of the
conditions specified in _ARTICLE 6_ have been satisfied or waived as of such
date (or, with respect to those conditions which, by their nature can only be
satisfied at the Closing, would reasonably be capable of satisfaction as of
such date), other than the conditions specified in _Section 6.1_ with respect
to the HSR Act or Antitrust Laws, then the Termination Date shall
automatically be extended to August 31, 2018;

(c) by Buyer by written notice to Seller, if a breach of any representation
or warranty or failure to perform any covenant or agreement on the part the
Seller set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred that would cause a
condition set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ or _Section 6.2(b)_ not to be
satisfied, Buyer has notified Seller of such breach and such breach is not
cured by the earlier of (1) the Termination Date and (2) the date that is
sixty (60) days from the date that Seller is notified in writing by Buyer of
such breach or failure to perform; _provided_ that Buyer shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(c)_ if Buyer
is then in material breach or violation of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement; and

(d) by Seller by written notice to Buyer, if a breach of any representation or
warranty or failure to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer
set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred that would cause a condition
set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_ or _Section 6.3(b)_ not to be satisfied,
Seller has notified Buyer of such breach and such breach is not cured by the
earlier of (1) the Termination Date and (2) the date that is sixty (60) days
from the date that Buyer is notified in writing by Seller of such breach or
failure to perform;  _provided_ that Seller shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(d)_ if Seller is then
in material breach or violation of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement.

 



67 Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. Any termination of this Agreement
pursuant to  _Section 7.1_ by written notice must specify in such written
notice whether such termination is pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_, _(c)_ , or
_(d)_. In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to 
_Section 7.1_, this entire Agreement shall forthwith become void and there
shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Buyer or Seller or their
respective officers, directors or equityholders with the exception of (a)
the obligations which by their express terms survive termination under the
last sentence of _Section 5.3_, under _Section 5.15(c)_ with respect to
Buyers reimbursement and indemnity obligations, this _Section 7.2_ and 
_Section 7.3_, as well as the provisions of _ARTICLE 1_ and _ARTICLE 10_
solely as they relate to such surviving obligations and (b) any liability of
any party hereto for actual fraud or any willful breach of this
Agreement prior to such termination (which willful breach, for the avoidance
of doubt, shall be deemed to include any failure by Buyer to consummate the
Closing if it is obligated to do so hereunder). In the event of any
termination of this Agreement for such a willful breach by Buyer, Sellers
sole remedy is set forth in _Section 7.3_. For the sake of clarity, in the
event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)_ or _(b)_ ,
then no Termination Fee shall be due and no party shall be deemed to have
committed actual fraud or willful breach.

Section 7.3 _Termination Fee_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding _Section 7.2_, in the event that the conditions set forth
in _Section 6.1_ were not satisfied and Seller terminated this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ as a result of a breach by Buyer of _Section
5.6_ that resulted in the failure to satisfy the conditions specified in
_Section 6.1_ with respect to the HSR Act or Antitrust Laws, then Buyer
shall pay, or cause to be paid, a termination fee of $85,000,000.00 (the "
_Termination Fee_ ") to Seller within five (5) Business Days following such
termination, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
specified by Seller in writing to Buyer.

(b) In the event (i) the conditions set forth in _Sections 6.1_ and _6.2_
were satisfied or waived in accordance therewith, except for such conditions
which by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, (ii) the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.3_ were not satisfied or waived in
accordance therewith, except for such conditions which by their nature can
only be satisfied at the Closing, (iii) Seller delivered to Buyer prior to
termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ an irrevocable written
notice certifying (A) the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 6.1_
and _Section 6.2_ are satisfied or waived, except for such conditions which
by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, (B) Seller is
ready, willing and able to Close and (C) Seller will waive, effective upon
consummation of the Closing within five (5) Business Days of receipt of such
written notice, such conditions in _Section 6.3_ which have not been
satisfied, (iv) Buyer failed to consummate the Closing within five (5)
Business Days following receipt of such written notice and (v) Seller
terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ as a result of a
willful breach by Buyer (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be deemed
to include any failure by Buyer to consummate the Closing if it is obligated
to do so hereunder), then after such termination Buyer shall pay, or cause to
be paid, the Termination Fee to Seller within five (5) Business Days
following such termination, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account specified by Seller in writing to Buyer.

 



68 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) in no event
shall Buyer be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion,
whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable under more than one
provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times or upon the
occurrence of different events; (ii) while Seller may pursue specific
performance to the extent permitted in accordance with _Section 10.14_, under
no circumstances shall the Seller be permitted or entitled to receive both
specific performance of the type contemplated by _Section 10.14_ and the
Termination Fee; and (iii) in the event Seller terminates this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ and the Termination Fee is payable pursuant to
_Section 7.3(a)_ or  _(b)_ , the remedies under _Section 7.3(a)_, _(b)_ or
_(c)_ , as applicable, shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of Seller.
Solely for purposes of establishing the basis for the amount of the
Termination Fee, and without in any way increasing the amount of the
Termination Fee or expanding the circumstances in which the Termination Fee is
to be paid, each party confirms that (i) each event or circumstance giving
rise to the obligation to pay the Termination Fee would cause significant
damage to Seller and its Affiliates, (ii) the Termination Fee provided for
hereunder is intended to provide fair compensation in response to that damage,
is not intended to be punitive, and is reasonable in amount in relation to
the circumstances under which it would become payable, and (iii) the
Termination Fee is a liquidated damage, and not a penalty.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to the
occurrence of the Closing, the Sellers right to (i) specific performance
pursuant to _Section 10.14_, (ii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1_ and (iii) if applicable, receive payment from Buyer of the
Termination Fee and if applicable, any additional amount, pursuant to
_Section 7.3(e)_ in respect thereof shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Seller, the Group Companies and each of their respective Affiliates or any
other Person against Buyer and any of its former, current or future direct or
indirect equityholders, stockholders, controlling persons, managers, members,
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, subsidiaries, attorneys and other
representatives of any of the foregoing, and their successors, assignees and
agents (collectively, the " _Buyer Related Parties_ ") for any losses, damages
or other injury suffered or alleged to be suffered as a result of the failure
of the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated or for a breach or
failure to perform hereunder, under any other agreement contemplated herein or
the transactions contemplated herein or otherwise, and upon payment of the
Termination Fee (and if applicable, any additional amount required under
this  _Section 7.3(e)_) none of Buyer Related Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the
other agreements contemplated herein or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby. Prior to the Closing, under no circumstances will Seller, the
Group Companies and each of their respective Affiliates or any other Person be
entitled in the aggregate to monetary damages in excess of the Termination Fee
(and if applicable, any additional amount required under _Section 7.3(e)_)
or to seek or obtain any other damages of any kind against Buyer or any of the
other Buyer Related Parties, including consequential, special, indirect or
punitive damages, for, or with respect to, this Agreement or the related
transactions.

(e) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby and that,
without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement.
Without limiting any other rights of Seller hereunder, if Buyer fails to pay
the Termination Fee when due, and, in order to obtain such payment, Seller
commences any legal action or proceeding that results in a final, binding and
non-appealable judgment against Buyer for the Termination Fee, Buyer shall pay
to Seller, together with the Termination Fee, interest on the Termination Fee
from the date of termination of this Agreement at a rate per annum equal to
eight percent (8.0%).

 



69 ARTICLE 8

 

 _TAX MATTERS_

 

Section 8.1 _Liability and Indemnification for Taxes_. From and after the
Closing, Seller and Parent shall, jointly and severally, indemnify the Buyer
Indemnitees against and hold the Buyer Indemnitees harmless from any Losses
based upon, related to, arising out of, or in connection with (i) Taxes
imposed on a Group Company, or for which a Group Company may otherwise
be liable, for any Pre-Closing Period (including any Taxes attributable to
any Section 338(h)(10) Elections, subject to Buyers obligation to pay the
Section 338(h)(10) Gross-Up Amount), and, with respect to any Straddle Period,
the portion of such Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date,
and (ii) Taxes imposed on a Group Company, or for which for which a Group
Company may otherwise be liable, as a result of having been a member of a
Consolidated Group (including Taxes for which the Group Company may be liable
pursuant to Treasury Regulation 1.1502-6 or similar provisions of state, local
or foreign Law as a result of having been a member of a Consolidated Group and
any Taxes resulting from the Group Company ceasing to be a member of any
Consolidated Group), _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller and Parent shall not
be liable for any Tax liability to the extent such Tax liability is reflected
as a liability in the computation of the Net Working Capital at Closing
pursuant to the other terms of this Agreement.

Section 8.2 _Tax Returns of the Group Companies_. 

(a) Seller, at its sole cost and expense, will prepare and timely file, or
cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Group Companies
due prior to or on the Closing Date and all income Tax Returns of, or with
respect to, any Group Company for any Pre-Closing Period (whether due on,
before, or after the Closing Date) (collectively, " _Seller Prepared Returns_
"). All Seller Prepared Returns will be prepared on a basis consistent with
current practices, procedures, and accounting methods of Seller and the Group
Companies. To the extent a Group Company is required to file any
Seller Prepared Returns after the Closing Date, Seller will submit such Tax
Return to Buyer as early as practicable prior to the due date (after
applicable extensions) of such Tax Return for Buyers review and comment, and,
to the extent that Buyer makes any timely comments, Seller will make
appropriate changes to the Seller Prepared Return to reflect Buyers
reasonable requests. Buyer will cause the applicable Group Company to file
such Seller prepared Tax Return as amended without further change or
modification. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be required to
submit any information to Buyer with respect to Seller or any of Sellers
Affiliates that is not also a Group Company including but not limited, to any
consolidated, combined or unitary returns that include companies other than
the Group Companies.

(b) Buyer, at its sole cost and expense, will prepare and timely file, or
cause to be prepared and timely filed, all income Tax Returns of, or with
respect to, any Group Company for any Straddle Period (collectively, "
_Straddle Returns_ "). All Straddle Returns will be prepared on a basis
consistent with current practices, procedures, and accounting methods of
Seller and

 



70  the Group Companies, except to the extent required by applicable Law. Buyer
will submit each Straddle Return to Seller as early as practicable prior to
the due date (after applicable extensions) of such Straddle Return for
Sellers review and comment, and, to the extent that Seller makes any timely
comments, Buyer will make appropriate changes to the Straddle Return to
reflect Sellers reasonable requests. Buyer will cause the applicable Group
Company to file such Straddle Return as amended without further change or
modification. Seller shall pay to Buyer, Sellers share of any Taxes payable
in respect of any Straddle Period within five (5) Business Days of the filing
of such Straddle Return.

(c) For purposes of allocating any Taxes in respect of any Straddle Period
between Seller and Buyer pursuant to this Section, (x) in the case of income
Taxes or Taxes based upon or related to employment, sales and use, value added
and other non-periodic Taxes, the Taxes payable by Seller in respect of the
pre-Closing portion thereof shall be deemed equal to the amount which would
be payable if the relevant Straddle Period ended with the Closing Date, and
any exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual
basis (including, but not limited to, depreciation, first year bonus
depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the
period ending on the Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date in
proportion to the number of days in each such period, and (y) in the case of
any Taxes imposed on a periodic basis and Taxes other than Taxes described in
clause (x) above, the Taxes payable by Seller in respect of the pre-Closing
portion thereof shall be deemed equal to the amount of such Tax for the entire
Straddle Period  _multiplied_ by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in the Straddle Period up to and including the Closing Date,
and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle
Period. All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing
allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with reasonable prior
practice of Seller and the Group Companies. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, if a Section 338(h)(10) Election is made, all Section 338 Taxes
shall be allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and
including the Closing Date.

 

Section 8.3 _Tax Proceedings_.

 

(a) Buyer shall notify Seller of the commencement of any Tax proceeding for
which Seller could have an indemnification liability pursuant to  _Section
8.1_; _provided_ , that failure to comply with this provision shall not affect
Buyers right to indemnification under this Agreement except to the extent
such failure materially impairs Sellers ability to contest any such Tax
liabilities.

(b) Seller shall have the sole right to represent each Group Companys
interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to
a Tax liability for which Seller would be required to indemnify Buyer
Indemnitees pursuant to _Section 8.1_ and that relates solely to a Pre-
Closing Period, and to employ counsel of Sellers choice at Sellers expense;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall have no right to represent a Group
Companys interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding
unless (i) Seller shall have first notified Buyer in writing of Sellers
intention to do so and of the identity of counsel, if any, chosen by Seller in
connection therewith, and (ii) Seller shall have agreed with Buyer that, as
between Buyer and Seller, Seller shall be liable for any Losses relating to
Taxes that result from such audit or proceeding; _provided_ , _further_ , that
Buyer and its representatives shall be permitted, at Buyers expense, to be
present at, and participate in, any such audit or proceeding.

 



71  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be entitled to settle,
either administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any claim for
Taxes which could adversely affect the liability for Taxes of any Buyer
Indemnitee or any Group Company for any period after the Closing Date to any
extent unless Seller has indemnified each Buyer Indemnitee against the effects
of any such settlement (including the imposition of income Tax deficiencies,
the reduction of asset basis or cost adjustments, the lengthening of any
amortization or depreciation periods, the denial of amortization or
depreciation deductions, or the reduction of loss or credit carryforwards)
without the prior written consent of Buyer.

(c) Buyer shall have the sole right to represent each Group Companys
interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to
Tax liabilities other than those for which Seller has exercised such right
pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ and to employ counsel of Buyers choice at
Buyers expense, provided that Seller and its representatives shall be
permitted, at Sellers expense, to be present at, and participate in, any such
audit or proceeding that relates to a Straddle Period. Buyer shall have the
sole right to defend each Group Company with respect to any issue, and settle
or compromise any issue, arising in connection with any Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding to the extent Buyer shall have agreed in
writing to forego any indemnification under this Agreement with respect to
such issue.

(d) Nothing herein shall be construed to impose on Buyer any obligation to
defend a Group Company in any Tax audit or administrative or court
proceeding. Any proceeding with respect to which Seller does not assume
control in accordance with this _Section 8.3_ may be settled or compromised
in the discretion of Buyer, and any such settlement or compromise shall not
affect any Buyer Indemnitees right to indemnification under this Agreement.

Section 8.4 _Activities After the Closing_. Following the Closing, Buyer will
not, and will not allow any of its Affiliates (including any Group Company) to
take any of the following actions without the prior written consent of Seller
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) except as required
by applicable Law: (a) file an amended Tax Return for any Group Company with
respect to a Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period; (b) file for, or otherwise
request from any Governmental Entity, any administrative ruling (including a
private letter ruling or change of method of accounting) regarding the Taxes
or Tax Returns of any Group Company with respect to a Pre-Closing Period or
Straddle Period; (c) make, revoke, or change any material Tax election of any
Group Company with respect to a Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period; or (d)
agree to extend, waive, or toll any statute of limitations with respect to the
assessment or collection of any Tax of any Group Company in a Pre-Closing
Period or Straddle Period (other than customary automatic extensions to file
Tax Returns obtained in the ordinary course).

 

Section 8.5 _Cooperation_. The parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by another party, in connection with the
preparation and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this _ARTICLE 8_ and any
audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation
shall include signing any Tax Returns, amended Tax Returns, claims or other
documents necessary to settle any Tax controversy, the retention and (upon the
other partys request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other Action and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereby.

 



72 Section 8.6 _Election Under Section 338(h)(10)_.

 

(a) At the request of Buyer, Seller and Buyer shall make a joint election for
one or more of the Group Companies (as designated by Buyer) under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code and under similar provisions of state or local law with
respect to the purchase of the Shares (collectively, the " _Section 338(h)(10)
Elections_ "). Buyer shall make any such request (the " _Section 338(h)(10)
Request_ ") by formal written notice to Seller at least fifteen (15) days
prior to the date that the related IRS Form 8023 is required to be filed with
the IRS. Seller shall deliver a completed and executed copy of IRS Form 8023,
required schedules thereto, and any similar state and foreign forms within
five (5) days of receipt of the Section 338(h)(10) Request from Buyer. Buyer
shall pay to Seller the Preliminary Section 338(h)(10) Gross-Up Amount (as
determined below) immediately upon receipt of the applicable executed IRS
Forms 8023 from Seller; provided that if the Preliminary Section 338(h)(10)
Gross-Up Schedule is not final and binding at such time, Buyer shall pay to
Seller the Preliminary Section 338(h)(10) Gross-Up Amount (as determined
pursuant to the calculation delivered by Buyer) immediately upon receipt of
the applicable executed IRS Forms 8023 from Seller.

 

(b) Prior to making any Section 338(h)(10) Request but no later than thirty
(30) days prior to the date that the related IRS Form 8023 is required to be
filed with the IRS, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a calculation of the
Preliminary Section 338(h)(10) Gross-Up Amount, which shall be prepared in
accordance with _Schedule 8.6_ (the " _Preliminary Section 338(h)(10) Gross-
Up Schedule_"). The Preliminary Gross-Up Schedule shall include an allocation
of the aggregate deemed sale price (as such term is defined in Treasury
Regulation § 1.338-4, without regard to any selling costs incurred by Seller)
among the assets of the applicable Group Companies and shall be based on
reasonable estimates of Sellers anticipated Tax for the taxable year that
includes the Closing. If, within ten (10) days following delivery of the
Preliminary Gross-Up Schedule, Seller does not notify Buyer in writing of its
disagreement, the Preliminary Section 338(h)(10) Gross-Up Schedule (including
the purchase price allocation contained therein) shall be final and
binding (subject to the other adjustments permitted by this _Section 8.6_).
If within such 10-day period Seller notifies Buyer of its disagreement, Seller
and Buyer shall endeavor to resolve such disagreement, and if they are able to
do so, shall make such revisions to the Preliminary Gross-Up Schedule to
reflect such resolution, which shall be final and binding (subject to _Section
8.6(c)_). If, within thirty (30) days following delivery of the
Preliminary Section 338(h)(10) Gross-Up Schedule to Seller, the parties are
unable to resolve such disagreement, Buyer and Seller may refer the items
remaining in dispute for resolution to the Chosen Firm using principles
similar to those described in  _Section 2.4(e)_, which resolution shall be
final and binding (subject to _Section 8.6(c)_). Within five (5) days
following finalization of the Preliminary Section 338(h)(10) Gross-Up
Schedule, Buyer shall pay to Seller (or Seller shall pay to Buyer) an amount
that when added to (or netted against) the Preliminary Section 338(h)(10)
Gross-Up Amount results in Seller receiving an aggregate (or net) amount equal
to the final and binding Preliminary Section 338(h)(10) Gross-Up Amount.

 



73 (c) Promptly following the filing of the consolidated federal income Tax
Return of Sellers consolidated group for the taxable year that includes the
Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a calculation of the Revised Section
338(h)(10) Gross-Up Schedule, which shall be prepared in accordance with
_Schedule 8.6_ (the " _Revised Section 338(h)(10) Gross-Up Schedule_"). The
Revised Section 338(h)(10) Gross-Up Schedule shall reflect (i) Sellers actual
tax liability for such year, (ii) a revised calculation of what Sellers tax
liability would have been for such year in the absence of the Section
338(h)(10) Elections (based on the final amounts included in Sellers
applicable Tax Returns) and (iii) any adjustments to the Purchase Price
that have occurred since the finalization of the Preliminary Section
338(h)(10) Gross-Up Schedule, but shall otherwise be prepared in all respects
(including purchase price allocation) in accordance with the Preliminary
Section 338(h)(10) Gross-Up Schedule. If, within ten (10) days following
delivery of the Revised Section 338(h)(10) Gross-Up Schedule, Buyer does not
notify Seller in writing of its disagreement, the Revised Section 338(h)(10)
Gross-Up Schedule shall be final and binding (subject to the other
adjustments permitted by _Section 8.6(d)_). If within such 10-day period
Buyer notifies Seller of its disagreement, Seller and Buyer shall endeavor to
resolve such disagreement, and if they are able to do so, shall make such
revisions to the Revised Section 338(h)(10) Gross-Up Schedule to reflect such
resolution, which shall be final and binding (subject to the other adjustments
permitted by _Section 8.6(d)_). If, within thirty (30) days following
delivery of the Revised Section 338(h)(10) Gross-Up Schedule to Buyer, the
parties are unable to resolve such disagreement, Buyer and Seller may refer
the items remaining in dispute for resolution to the Chosen Firm using
principles similar to those described in _Section 2.4(e)_, which resolution
shall be final and binding (subject to the other adjustments permitted by
_Section 8.6(d)_). Within five (5) days following finalization of the
Revised Section 338(h)(10) Gross-Up Schedule, Buyer shall pay to Seller (or
Seller shall pay to Buyer) an amount that when added to (or netted against)
the Preliminary Section 338(h)(10) Gross-Up Amount results in Seller receiving
an aggregate (or net) amount equal to the Revised Section 338(h)(10) Gross-Up
Amount.

(d) The Revised Section 338(h)(10) Gross-Up Schedule may be revised by Buyer
or Seller using principles similar to those set forth in _Section 8.6(c)_ to
reflect adjustments to the Section 338(h)(10) Gross-Up Amount attributable to
audits or indemnity payments. If Seller receives notification of an audit or
proceeding that would be defined as a Section 338 Audit, Seller shall keep
Buyer apprised of the status of the claim, liability, or expenses and any
resulting suit, proceeding or enforcement action, shall furnish Buyer with
all documents and information that Buyer shall reasonably request and shall
consult with Buyer regarding negotiation and settlement of the matter. Buyer
shall have the option to observe and/or participate in the Section 338 Audit,
at its own expense, and Seller shall cooperate fully with Buyer if Buyer
chooses such option. Seller shall not be entitled to settle, either
administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any claim for Taxes
in connection with a Section 338 Audit without the consent of Buyer, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(e) If Buyer makes the Section 338(h)(10) Request, each of Buyer and Seller
agrees that neither it nor any of its Affiliates shall (i) file any federal,
state, local and foreign Tax Returns in a manner that is inconsistent with the
Preliminary Section 338(h)(10) Gross-Up Schedule (except as modified by the
Revised Section 338(h)(10) Gross-Up Schedule), or (ii) take, or fail to take,
any action to the extent such action or failure to act, as the case may be, is
inconsistent with or would otherwise prejudice any Section 338(h)(10)
Elections. If, however, Seller does not receive the Section 338(h)(10) Request
within the time-frame required by _Section_ _8.6(a)_ , the parties shall
terminate all discussions under this _Section 8.6_ and shall not file IRS
Form 8023 in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



74 Section 8.7 _Survival of Obligations_. For the sake of absolute clarity,
the obligations of the parties set forth in this _ARTICLE 8_ shall survive
until sixty (60) days after the expiration of all applicable statutes of
limitation (taking into account extensions thereof).

 

ARTICLE 9 __

 

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

 

Section 9.1 _Indemnification of Buyer Indemnitees_. From and after the
Closing, Seller and Parent shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and defend
Buyer, the Group Companies, and their successors and assigns and each of the
foregoings respective shareholders, members, officers, directors, employees
and agents (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnitees_ ") against, and hold the
Buyer Indemnitees harmless from, any Losses based upon, related to, arising
out of, or caused by (i) any inaccuracy in, or breach of, any representation
or warranty made by Seller in _Section 3.2_ (Authority),  _Section 3.3_
(Enforceability), _Section 3.5_ (Capitalization) or _Section 3.23_ (Brokers)
(collectively, the " _Fundamental Representations_ "), (ii) any breach of, or
failure to comply with, any covenant or agreement made by Seller in this
Agreement, which contemplates performance after the Closing or otherwise
expressly by its terms survives the Closing, (iii) any Seller Benefit Plan
(including any Losses related to a Seller Benefit Plan prior to such
arrangement being transferred to Seller or an Affiliate and becoming a Seller
Benefit Plan) or any other employee benefit plan, program, policy, practice or
Contract that would be a Seller Benefit Plan if employees, officers
or directors of a Group Company participated, and any Multiemployer Plan to
the extent such Loss is directly attributable to the participation in such
plan by, and the contribution history of, Seller or Affiliates of Seller
(other than the Group Companies) (it being understood, a Loss will be deemed
directly attributable to the participation by, and the contribution history
of, Seller and its Affiliates if a Multiemployer Plan, in its assessment of
withdrawal liability, allocates to the Group Companies any of the
contribution history of Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Group
Companies)), (iv) the matters set forth in _Schedule 9.1(iv)_ , subject to any
limitations set forth therein and (v) any amounts required to pay any
Indebtedness of the Group Companies as of the Closing Date that were not
reflected on the Closing Statement.

Section 9.2  _Indemnification of Seller Indemnitees_. From and after the
Closing, Buyer shall indemnify and defend Parent, Seller, their respective
Affiliates, and their successors and assigns and each of the foregoings
respective shareholders, members, officers, directors, employees and agents
(collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ "; and together with the Buyer
Indemnitees, the " _Indemnitees_ ") against, and hold the Seller Indemnitees
harmless from, any Losses based upon, related to, arising out of, or caused
by (i) any inaccuracy in, or breach of, any representation or warranty made by
Buyer in _Section 4.2_ (Authority), _Section 4.3_ (Enforceability), 
_Section 4.8_ (Brokers) and _Section 4.10_ (Solvency) (collectively, the "
_Buyer Fundamental Representations_ ") and (ii) any breach of, or failure to
comply with, any covenant or agreement made by Buyer in this Agreement, which
contemplates performance after the Closing or otherwise expressly by its terms
survives the Closing.

 



75 Section 9.3 _Indemnification Adjustments to Purchase Price_. Buyer and Seller
agree to report each indemnification payment made in respect of a Loss as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal income Tax purposes.

 

Section 9.4 _Cooperation_. Seller shall assume and control the defense of a
Third Party Claim pursuant to its obligations under clause (iv) of _Section
9.1_ and Buyer shall cause the Group Companies to reasonably cooperate with
Seller in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include,
at Sellers reasonable request, the provision to Seller at Sellers expense
of records and information in the possession, custody or control of the Group
Companies that are relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees of
the Group Companies available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any records and material provided
hereunder. From and after the Closing Date, Seller shall keep Buyer and the
Group Companies reasonably informed on the status of all such Third Party
Claims and Seller shall, at Buyers reasonable request and expense, make
available to Buyer and/or the Group Companies for review and copying all
relevant information in Sellers possession, custody or control respecting any
such Third Party Claim. Buyer shall have the right to participate or
associate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by Seller. Buyer and its representatives
shall be permitted, at Buyers expense, to be present at, and participate in,
any Action or meeting with respect to such defense. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller shall not settle such Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) unless such settlement (i) does not involve any
finding or admission of any violation of Law or any violation of the rights of
Buyer Indemnitees and would not have any adverse effect on any other claims
that may be made against Buyer Indemnitees, (ii) does not involve any relief
other than monetary damages that are paid in full by Seller and (iii)
completely, finally and unconditionally releases Buyer Indemnitees in
connection with such Third Party Claim and would not otherwise adversely
affect Buyer Indemnitees. If Seller proposes to accept any settlement of such
Action which is not approved by Buyer, then Seller shall not be liable for any
Losses in respect of such Action in excess of the proposed settlement amount.

Section 9.5 _Limitations on Indemnification; Exclusive Remedies_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither Seller nor Parent
will have any indemnification obligation under this Agreement in respect of
any amounts taken into account in the determination of Net Working Capital,
Closing Net Cash or Financing Adjustment as of the Effective Time.

 

(b) Neither Seller nor Parent will have any indemnification obligation under
this Agreement in respect of any Losses to the extent they arise or are
incurred as a result of the passing of, or a change in, any Law after the
Closing. Neither Seller, Parent nor Buyer will have any indemnification
obligation under this Agreement in respect of any Losses if they would not
have arisen but for any act, omission, transaction or arrangement carried out
at the written request of an Indemnitee.

 



76 (c) Losses shall be computed net of any insurance proceeds or other amounts
which any Indemnitee recovers from Persons other than the indemnifying party
with respect thereto. All Indemnitees shall use reasonable commercial efforts
to mitigate any Losses potentially subject to indemnification hereunder, and
Buyer and Seller shall cause their respective Indemnitees to comply with such
requirement. If an indemnifying party provides indemnification hereunder in
respect of any Losses, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated, to the
extent of such payments, to all rights and remedies of the relevant
Indemnitee(s) to any insurance benefits or other claims of the Indemnitee(s)
with respect to such matter.

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, except as provided in
_Section 2.4_, _Section 8.1_ or as expressly provided in any Ancillary
Document, and except in the case of actual fraud, their sole and exclusive
remedy after the Closing with respect to any and all monetary claims relating
to the subject matter of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby,
or any instruments executed or delivered in connection herewith shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this _ARTICLE 9_.
From and after the Closing, no party shall or shall permit any of its
respective Indemnitees to bring any action, claim or proceeding, at law,
equity or otherwise, against any other party or its respective Releasees for
monetary damages, in respect of any actual or alleged inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty, or any actual or alleged breach of any covenant,
agreement or other provision of this Agreement, or otherwise in respect of
the transactions contemplated hereby, except pursuant to the express
provisions of this _ARTICLE 9_ or in the case of actual fraud.

 

ARTICLE 10

 

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

 

Section 10.1 _Nonsurvival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. Other
than in the case of Fundamental Representations or Buyer Fundamental
Representations, or actual fraud by Seller or Buyer, none of the
representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements, in each case, of
Seller or Buyer contained in this Agreement, or in any instrument or
certificate delivered by it at Closing, will survive the Closing or
termination of this Agreement, and neither Seller, Parent nor Buyer shall have
any liability after the Closing in respect thereof, except for those covenants
and agreements which contemplate performance after the Closing or termination
of this Agreement or otherwise expressly by their terms survive the Closing or
termination of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Fundamental
Representations and Buyer Fundamental Representations shall survive the
Closing and the covenants and agreements set forth in _ARTICLES 8_ and _9_
shall survive, and contemplate performance after, the Closing.

 

Section 10.2 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, the Exhibits,
annexes and Schedules, and the Confidentiality Agreements constitute the
entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both

matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any party hereto
(whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of Buyer and Seller, _provided_ that Buyer may assign (i) all or any portion
of its rights and interests herein for collateral security purposes to any
Financing Sources, any lenders and any other securityholders (including agents
or trustees therefor) of Buyer or any Subsidiary thereof and (ii) all or any
portion of its rights and interests herein (including the right to purchase
the Shares from Seller) to Beacon Sales Acquisition, Inc., it being understood
and agreed that no such assignment shall release any liability or obligation
of Buyer hereunder, including liabilities or obligations first arising after
the date of any such assignment. Any attempted assignment of this Agreement
not in accordance with the terms of this _Section 10.2_ shall be void.

Section 10.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to any choice of Law or conflict of Law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the Law of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware. 

Section 10.5 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the fees and
disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and accountants, shall be paid

this _Section 10.5_ shall survive the Closing and termination of this
Agreement.

 

Section 10.6 _Exhibits and Schedules_. All Exhibits and Schedules or other
documents expressly incorporated into this Agreement, are hereby incorporated
into this Agreement and are hereby made a part hereof as if set out in full in
this Agreement. The specification of any dollar amount in the representations
or warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific
item in any Schedule is not intended to imply that such amounts, or higher or
lower amounts or the items so included or other items, are or are not
material, and no party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or
the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy as to whether
any obligation, items or matter not described herein or included in a Schedule
is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.7 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party and its successors and permitted
assigns and, except (a) as provided in _Section 5.7_, and _Section 5.16_ and
(b) the proviso to the second sentence of _Section 10.2_, this _Section
10.7_, the proviso to the first sentence of _Section 10.9_, _Section
10.12_, _Section 10.13(b)_,

 



79   _Section 10.16_ and the definition of "Financing Sources" and the
constituent definitions thereof (with respect to which the Financing Sources
are express third party beneficiaries and shall be enforceable by each
Financing Source, it being understood that the provisions and definitions
identified in this clause (b) may not be amended in a manner adverse to any
Financing Source in any respect without the prior written consent of such
Financing Source), nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to or shall confer upon any other person any rights, benefits or remedies of
any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.8 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, all other provisions of this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party.

 

Section 10.9 _Amendment_. Prior to the Effective Time, subject to applicable
Law and _Section 10.10_, this Agreement may be amended or modified only by a
written agreement executed and delivered by duly authorized officers of Buyer
and Seller; provided, however, that the proviso to the second sentence of
_Section 10.2_, _Section 10.7_, this proviso of _Section 10.9_, _Section
10.12_, _Section 10.13(b)_, _Section 10.16 _and the definition of "Financing
Sources" and the constituent definitions thereof may not be amended in a
manner adverse to any Financing Source in any respect without the prior
written consent of such Financing Source. This Agreement may not be modified
or amended except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence and
subject to _Section 10.7_, and any purported amendment by any party or
parties hereto effected in a manner which does not comply with this _Section
10.9_ shall be void.

 

Section 10.10 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, Seller
may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of Buyer contained herein, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of Buyer contained herein or in any document,
certificate or writing delivered by Buyer pursuant hereto or (c) waive

contained herein, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of Seller contained herein or in any document, certificate or
writing delivered by Seller pursuant hereto or (iii) waive compliance by
Seller with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of any party hereto to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of
such party. The failure of any party hereto to assert any of its rights
hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

Section 10.11 _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by

80 Section 10.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH

AGREEMENT OR (II) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE
DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO (INCLUDING ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, CLAIM OR
COUNTERCLAIM INVOLVING THE FINANCING SOURCES (AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES
AND REPRESENTATIVES)), IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER
ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES TO
THIS AGREEMENT EACH HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND,
ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND
THAT THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY
OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE
PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 

Section 10.13 _Jurisdiction and Venue_.

 

(a) Any state or federal court sitting in Delaware shall be the exclusive
jurisdiction of in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement and all claims in respect of the action or proceeding may be
heard and determined in any such court and no Person shall bring any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other court.
Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety
or other security that might be required of any other party with respect
thereto. Each party hereto agrees that service of summons and complaint or
any other process that might be served in any action or proceeding may be made
on such party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the party to
be served at the address of the party and in the manner provided for the
giving of notices in _Section 10.3_. Nothing in this _Section 10.13_,
however, shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any
other manner permitted by Law. Each party hereto agrees that a final, non-
appealable judgment in any action or proceeding so brought shall be conclusive
and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
Law.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement and
without limiting _Section 10.16_, each of the parties hereto, on behalf of
itself and their respective Affiliates: (i) agrees that it shall not (and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to not) bring or support any Person in
any Action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim, third-party claim, suit or
proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the Debt Financing Sources or
the Pre-Closing Equity Financing Sources and their respective current, former
or future directors, officers, general or limited partners, stockholders,
members, managers, controlling persons, Affiliates, employees or
representatives (in each case, in such capacity) in any way relating to this
Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter or any of the Debt Documents, including
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of
New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof); (ii)
agrees that, except as specifically set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter,
all claims, cross-claims, third party-claims or causes of action (whether at
law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the

 



81  Debt Financing Sources or the Pre-Closing Equity Financing Sources and their
respective current, former or future directors, officers, general or limited
partners, stockholders, members, managers, controlling persons, Affiliates,
employees or representatives (in each case, in such capacity) in any way
relating to this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter or any of the Debt
Documents, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Financing or the performance thereof, shall be exclusively governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the internal Laws of the State of New York,
without giving effect to principles or rules of choice or conflict of Laws to
the extent such principles or rules would require or permit the application
of Laws of another jurisdiction; and (iii) hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and shall cause its Affiliates to waive any right such
party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation (whether in
Law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) directly or
indirectly arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement, the Debt
Commitment Letter or any of the Debt Documents, including any dispute arising
out of or relating in any way to the Financing or the performance thereof.

Section 10.14  _Remedies_. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that the
other parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any provision of this
Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or otherwise
breached, so that, in addition to any other remedy that a party may have
under law or equity, a party shall be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent
breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this
Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof. Each party hereto acknowledges
and agrees that monetary damages would be inadequate in the event of any such
failure to perform or breach, and waives any equitable defense to the granting
of specific performance or other injunctive relief available to such party.
In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction fails to grant specific
performance or other injunctive relief to a party as a remedy for such failure
to perform or breach, the parties hereby acknowledge and agree that such
party shall be entitled to receive benefit of the bargain and lost profits
damages as redress for such failure to perform or breach. Each party further
agrees that no other party hereto or any other Person shall be required to
obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or
as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 10.14_,
and each party hereto irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the
obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Sellers
right to seek specific performance or other injunction relief shall cease if
Buyer pays, or causes to be paid to Seller, an amount equal to the
Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds, and upon such
payment, this Agreement shall automatically and without any further action be
terminated and thereby become void and there shall be no liability or
obligation on the part of Buyer or Seller or their respective officers,
directors or equityholders with the exception of the obligations which by
their express terms survive termination under the last sentence of  _Section
5.3_, under _Section 5.15(c)_ with respect to Buyers reimbursement and
indemnity obligations, _Section 7.2_ and _Section 7.3_, as well as the
provisions of _ARTICLE 1_ and _ARTICLE 10_  solely as they relate to such
surviving obligations. For the sake of clarity, in the event an amount equal
to the Termination Fee is paid to Seller in accordance with this _Section
10.14_, Seller shall have no right to the Termination Fee or other rights
under _Section 7.3_ or any claim for fraud of willful breach.

 



82 Section 10.15 _Conflicts; Privilege_. Recognizing that Kilpatrick Townsend
and Stockton LLP and internal counsel belonging from time to time to the
Oldcastle Law Group (" _Internal_ _Counsel_ ") have acted as legal counsel to
the Group Companies and certain of their respective Affiliates prior to the
date hereof, and that Kilpatrick Townsend and Stockton LLP and Internal Counsel
intend to act as legal counsel to Seller and its Affiliates after the Closing
(which will no longer include the Group Companies), Buyer hereby waives, on
its own behalf and agrees to cause its Affiliates and the Group Companies to
waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with Kilpatrick Townsend and
Stockton LLP or Internal Counsel representing Seller or its Affiliates after
the Closing as such representation may relate to Buyer, the Group Companies
or the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition, all communications
involving attorney-client confidences between the Group Companies and their
respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and Kilpatrick Townsend and Stockton
LLP or Internal Counsel or Seller or its Affiliates, on the other hand, in the
course of the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that
belong solely to Seller and its Affiliates (and not the Group Companies).
Accordingly, the Group Companies shall not have access to any such
communications or to the files of Kilpatrick Townsend and Stockton LLP or such
Internal Counsel relating to such engagement from and after the Closing.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the Closing,
(a) Seller and its Affiliates (and not the Group Companies) shall be the
sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to such
engagement, and none of the Group Companies shall be a holder thereof, (b) to
the extent that files of Kilpatrick Townsend and Stockton LLP or such Internal
Counsel in respect of such engagement constitute property of the client, only
Seller and its Affiliates (and not the Group Companies) shall hold such
property rights and (c) Kilpatrick Townsend and Stockton LLP or such Internal
Counsel shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such
attorney-client communications or files to the Group Companies by reason of
any attorney-client relationship between Kilpatrick Townsend and Stockton LLP or
such Internal Counsel and the Group Companies or otherwise. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Buyer or a Group
Company and a third party other than a party to this Agreement after the
Closing, Buyer may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure
of confidential communications by Kilpatrick Townsend and Stockton LLP or
Internal Counsel to such third party; provided, however, that Buyer may not
waive such privilege without the prior written consent of Seller. This 
_Section 10.15_ will be irrevocable, and no term of this _Section 10.15_ may
be amended, waived or modified, without the prior written consent of
Kilpatrick Townsend and Stockton LLP and Internal Counsel.

 

Section 10.16 _Waiver of Claims against Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, each of Seller and Parent (and each of their
respective directors, officers, general or limited partners, stockholders,
members, managers, controlling persons, Affiliates, employees or
representatives (in each case, in such capacity)) hereby waives any rights
or claims against any of the Financing Sources and their respective current,
former or future directors, officers, general or limited partners,
stockholders, members, managers, controlling persons, Affiliates, employees or
representatives (in each case, in such capacity), in any way relating to this
Agreement, the Commitment Letters, any of the Debt Documents or Equity
Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing or the
performance thereof, whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 10.16_
shall in any way limit or modify the rights of Buyer under this Agreement or
any Financing Sources obligations to Buyer under the Commitment Letters.

In consideration of the above recitals and the representations, warranties,

adequacy of which is hereby acknowledged, Parent and Seller each covenants
with Buyer, for the benefit of Buyer as follows:



     | 1. | For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms have the
respective meanings set forth below: 
---|---|--- 



     | a. | " _Restricted Business_ " means the business of distributing
Restricted Products manufactured by third parties. 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | " _Restricted Products_ " means any of the following
products: gypsum wallboard, acoustical ceiling tiles, insulation (not
including, for the avoidance of doubt, insulated glass, insulated concrete
masonry units or insulation sold as a component of a product or system that
is not a Restricted Product), vinyl siding and cement board siding,

sealers) and residential and commercial roofing. 
---|---|--- 



     | c. | " _Territory_ " means the United States of America and
Canada. 
---|---|--- 

Any capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the
respective meanings ascribed thereto in the Stock Purchase Agreement.



     | 2. | For a period of four (4) years commencing on the Effective
Date, each of Parent and Seller agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, without Buyers prior written consent, directly
or indirectly, engage in the Restricted Business in the Territory, or own,
manage, operate, control, or participate in the ownership, management,
operation, or control of, any Person engaged in the Restricted Business in the
Territory.  
---|---|--- 
 



8 3\. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it will not be a
violation of paragraph 2 hereof for Parent, Seller or their Affiliates:



     | a. | to own as a passive investor (in the aggregate) less than 5%
of the outstanding shares of any class of securities of any Person, if such
securities are listed on any national or regional securities exchange;  
---|---|--- 



     | b. | to manufacture any product (including a Restricted Product)
and to engage in the sale of any product manufactured by Parent, Seller or any
of their Affiliates from time to time; _provided_ , however, except
as provided in paragraph 3c below, that Parent, Seller and their Affiliates
shall not engage in a distribution business involving such manufactured
Restricted Products (it being understood and agreed that the sale of any such
products to a third-party distributor or retail outlets for resale shall not
constitute engaging in a distribution business); 
---|---|--- 



     | c. | to engage in the distribution of Restricted Products
incidental to the conduct of any building products business operated as of the
date hereof by any Affiliate of Parent or Seller (other than a Group Company),
which Affiliate is not primarily engaged in the Restricted Business,
consistent with past practices in such business (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, may include future changes in or additions to (i) the locations from
which such businesses are conducted or (ii) the specific third party
Restricted Products distributed); or 
---|---|--- 



     | d. | to re-sell any Restricted Products purchased from Buyer or
any of its Affiliates, including the Group Companies. 
---|---|--- 
 

Furthermore, paragraph 2 shall not restrict the activities of any Person that
becomes an Affiliate of Parent or Seller after the Effective Date as a result
of any acquisition by such Person (whether by merger, amalgamation or stock
purchase) of CRH plc. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer acknowledges and
agrees that nothing in paragraph 2 shall be construed to restrict or prohibit
Parent, Seller or their respective Affiliates (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, C.R. Laurence Co., Inc., and its subsidiaries) from engaging in any
business conducted by any of them (other than the Group Companies) as of the
date hereof, consistent with past practices.

4\. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it will not be a
violation of paragraph 2 hereof for Parent, Seller or their Affiliates to
acquire and operate any previously non-Affiliated business (regardless of the
legal form of the acquisition) that is engaged in part the Restricted Business
in the Territory (an " _Acquired Business_ "), _provided, however_ , that
less than 40% of the aggregate gross revenues of the Acquired Business is from
engaging in the Restricted Business in the Territory and _further provided_
that Parent, Seller or the applicable Affiliate (the " _Acquiring Party_ ")
shall sell or otherwise transfer all right, title and interests in and to the
portions of such Acquired Business that would otherwise violate paragraph 2
(such portions, collectively, the 

 



9  " _Competing Business_ ") to Buyer, an Affiliate of Buyer or a third-party
(i.e., a Person in which the Acquiring Party does not have direct or indirect
ownership interest) (such transfer being to " _Divest_ ") in accordance with
the further provisions of this paragraph 4:



     | a. | Within ten (10) Business Days following the closing of the
Acquiring Partys acquisition of such Competing Business, Parent shall deliver
a written notice (the " _Exclusivity Offer Notice_ ") to Buyer (i) informing
Buyer of such acquisition, and (ii) offering Buyer the option to elect to
enter into exclusive negotiations with the Acquiring Party concerning the sale
of the Competing Business to Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer on such terms as
the parties may in good faith agree. 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | Buyer may, by delivering written notice (the " _Exercise
Notice_ ") to Parent within ten (10) Business Days following Buyers receipt
of the Exclusivity Offer Notice (the " _Exercise Period_ "), elect to accept
such offer to enter into such exclusive negotiations. If Parent delivers the
Exclusivity Offer Notice to Buyer and Buyer does not elect to accept such
offer to so enter into such exclusive negotiations or fails to deliver the
Exercise Notice to Parent within the Exercise Period (in either case, a "
_Non-Exercise_ "), then the Acquiring Party shall fully Divest the Competing
Business in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 4d.  
---|---|--- 



     | c. |

If Buyer timely provides the Exercise Notice to Parent electing to accept such
offer to enter into such exclusive negotiations, then during the Exclusivity
Period (as defined below) (i) Buyer and the Acquiring Party shall enter into a
confidentiality agreement containing provisions at least as protective of
Parent and its Affiliates as the Confidentiality Agreements, (ii) negotiate
in good faith regarding the terms of the sale of the Competing Business to
Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer, including, if applicable, lease agreements and
such other transitional arrangements as may be reasonably necessary to permit
the separation of the Competing Business from the Acquired Business while
minimizing any disruption to either business and (iii) subject to the
execution of the aforementioned confidentiality agreement, the Acquiring
Party shall promptly provide Buyer and its representatives true and complete
copies of all financial information, documents and other diligence materials
reasonably requested by Buyer or its authorized representatives that are
available to the Acquiring Party to the extent relating to the Competing
Business. If the parties fail to enter into definitive purchase documents
relating to the Competing Business during the Exclusivity Period or if Buyer
terminates the Exclusivity Period (collectively, a " _Non-Agreement_ "), then
the Acquiring Party shall fully Divest the Competing Business in accordance
with the requirements of paragraph 4d. The " _Exclusivity Period_ " means the
period from the date of Buyers timely delivery of 

---|---|--- 
 



10 to enter into such exclusive negotiations until the earlier of (i) the date
that is six (6) months from the date of such delivery of such Exercise Notice
or (ii) the date Buyer delivers a written notice to Parent electing to
terminate the Exclusivity Period. 
---|--- 



     | d. | In the event of a Buyer Non-Exercise or Non-Agreement, the
Acquiring Party shall fully Divest the Competing Business (whether in single
transaction or a series of transactions) within twelve (12) months after
the expiration, as applicable, of (i) the Exercise Period or (ii) the
Exclusivity Period. 
---|---|--- 



     | e. | For the sake of clarity, in no event shall the Acquiring
Party, directly or indirectly enter into an agreement with a Person other than
Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer to fully or partially Divest the Competing
Business or engage in any negotiations, discussions or other communications
with respect to such a divestiture or provide any information with respect to
the Competing Business held by the Acquiring Party prior to, as applicable,
(i) a Buyer Non-Exercise or (ii) a Non-Agreement. 
---|---|--- 

5\. For a period of five (5) years commencing on the Effective Date, each of
Parent and Seller agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not
to, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment any Company Employee,
_provided_ , _however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing
restriction does not apply to solicitation of any Company Employee who is no
longer employed by Buyer or any Group Company or any of their Affiliates as of
the first date of any such solicitation, and _further provided_ that
general advertisements and other solicitations not specifically targeting
Company Employees shall not constitute solicitation for employment within the
meaning of this paragraph 5. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit
Parent or Seller or any of their Affiliates from soliciting for employment at
any time any of the following individuals: Robert Feury Jr., Ikechukwu Ofodile
and Jacob Walker.

 

6\. Each of Parent and Seller acknowledges that the restrictions imposed by
this Agreement are fully understood by Parent and Seller and are fair and
reasonable in light of the nature of the transactions under the Stock Purchase
Agreement and the direct and indirect benefit to Parent and Seller from such
transactions.

 

7\. Each of Parent and Seller agrees that Buyers remedy at law for any breach
of this Agreement will be inadequate and that Buyer shall not be limited to a
remedy at law but also be entitled to equitable relief (including specific
performance or other injunctive relief) against any such breach or any
threatened breach. Each of Parent and Seller waives for itself and its
Affiliates to the fullest extent allowed by Law any requirement for the
posting

 



11  of any bond or security by Buyer (if any) in connection with any action to
enforce this Agreement. Each of Parent and Seller shall be jointly and
severally liable for a breach of this Agreement by the other and if an
Acquiring Party is not Parent or Seller, Parent and Seller shall cause the
Acquiring Party to comply with its obligations under this Agreement and such
failure to comply shall constitute a breach of this Agreement by both Parent
and Seller.

8\. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of Law or
conflict of Law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Law of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. Any state or federal court
sitting in Delaware shall be the exclusive jurisdiction of any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and all claims in
respect of the action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any
such court and no Person shall bring any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement in any other court. Each of the parties hereto
waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or
proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that
might be required of any other party with respect thereto. Each party hereto
agrees that service of summons and complaint or any other process that might
be served in any action or proceeding may be made on such party by sending or
delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the address of
the party and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in _Section
10.3_ of the Stock Purchase Agreement. Nothing in this paragraph 8, however,
shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by Law.

9. If any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, all other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect, and the parties authorize any such court to reform this
Agreement to render it valid and enforceable to the maximum extent. No
modification of this Agreement will be effective unless in a writing signed by
both parties, and no waiver of any provision hereof will be binding unless in
a writing signed by the waiving party. No failure or delay in exercising any
rights hereunder shall constitute a waiver.

10\. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each party and its respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement
shall not be assigned by any party hereto (whether by operation of Law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of Buyer, Parent and Seller. Any
attempted assignment of this Agreement not in accordance with the terms of
this paragraph 10 shall be void.

 



12 11\. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute
one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature
page to this Agreement by facsimile or scanned pages shall be effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart to this Agreement.

 



13 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed by the parties
hereto as of the day and year first above written.
