Terms of the Transaction

Section 2.1. _Agreement to Purchase and Sell Interests_. For the consideration
hereinafter set forth, and subject to the terms and provisions herein
contained, Seller agrees to sell, and Buyer agrees to purchase, the
Interests.

Section 2.2. _Aggregate Consideration_. The consideration for the Interests
shall be One Billion Dollars $1,000,000,000 (subject to adjustment as set
forth below), of which (a) $200,000,000 (such amount, unadjusted by any
adjustments provided for in this Agreement or agreed to by the parties, being
herein called the "Base Equity Consideration") shall be paid in LP Interests,
valued at a price per LP Interest equal to the Equity Price, and (b) the
balance shall be paid in Dollars (such amount, unadjusted by any
adjustments provided for in this Agreement or agreed to by the parties, being
herein called the "Base Cash Price"). The Base Equity Consideration, together
with the Base Cash Price, shall be referred to as the "Base Purchase Price."

Section 2.3. _Potential Adjustments to the Purchase Price_. The Base Purchase
Price shall be subject to adjustments as provided in Article VIII, Article
XII and Article XIV hereof. Unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement,
any adjustment to the Base Purchase Price shall be made pro rata to the Base
Equity Consideration and the Base Cash Price. The Base Cash Price, as
adjusted pursuant to this Section 2.3, and as the same may otherwise be
adjusted by mutual agreement of the parties, being herein called the "Cash
Price." The Base Equity Consideration, as adjusted pursuant to this Section
2.3, and as the same may otherwise be adjusted by mutual agreement of the
parties, shall be referred to as the "Equity Consideration." The
Equity Consideration, together with the Cash Price, shall be referred to as
the "Purchase Price."

 

Section 2.4. _Payment of the Purchase Price_. The Purchase Price shall be
payable as follows:

 

(a) Contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer shall pay
into an interest bearing joint control account (the "Deposit Account") to be
established by Buyer and Seller at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the "Bank") and
requiring the written authorization of a representative of each party for the
disbursal of funds therefrom, the amount of Fifty Million Dollars
($50,000,000) (such amount being herein called the "Deposit"). The Deposit
shall bear interest at the rate established by Bank. In the event the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated in accordance with the terms
hereof, the Deposit plus the earned interest shall be applied to the Cash
Price to be paid by Buyer at the Closing. If the Deposit is paid to Buyer, or
if Buyer receives credit for same against the Purchase Price paid at Closing,
such payment, or credit, shall be in the amount of the Deposit plus the amount
of earned interest. All interest earned on the Deposit Account shall be
treated as income of Buyer for all tax purposes. If (i) all conditions
precedent to the obligations of Buyer set forth in Section 9.1 have been met,
and (ii) the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated on or before
the

 



11  Closing Date because of the failure of Buyer to satisfy the conditions
precedent in Section 9.2(a), Section 9.2(b) or Section 9.2(g) then, in such
event, Seller shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, and retain
the Deposit as liquidated damages in accordance with Section 17.11. THE
PARTIES HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE EXTENT OF DAMAGES TO SELLER OCCASIONED BY
THE FAILURE OF THIS TRANSACTION TO BE CONSUMMATED WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE OR
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN AND THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE DEPOSIT IS A FAIR
AND REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF SUCH DAMAGES UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND DOES NOT
CONSTITUTE A PENALTY. If this Agreement is terminated by the mutual written
agreement of Buyer and Seller, or if the Closing does not occur for any reason
other than as set forth in the preceding sentences of this Section 2.4(a),
then Buyer shall be entitled to the return of the Deposit plus any interest
earned thereon within 10 days, free of any claims by Seller with respect
thereto. Buyer and Seller shall thereupon have the rights and obligations set
forth in Article XI and Section 17.11. 

(b) At the Closing and subject to Section 2.2, Issuer shall deliver to Seller
the Equity Consideration, in the form of a number of LP Interests determined
by dividing the Equity Consideration by the Equity Price. The Equity
Consideration shall consist of two separate blocks of LP Interests: (i) the
"Block A LP Interests," which shall be issued in exchange for the Series A
Units of the Company, and (ii) the "Block B LP Interests," which shall be
issued in exchange for the Series B Units of the Company.

 

(c) At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in Dollars to an account designated in writing by
Seller to Buyer, an amount equal to the Cash Price less the Deposit (including
the amount of earned interest thereon).

of this Agreement and each other agreement, instrument or document executed or
to be executed by Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated

executed or to be executed by Seller in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby to which Seller is a party or the consummation by Seller
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, except where such failure
to make or obtain such required filing, consent, approval authorization or
notice would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect on Seller.

Section 3.6. _Pending Litigation_. There are no Proceedings pending or, to
Sellers Knowledge, threatened, in which Seller is or may be a party adversely
affecting the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby by Seller.

advisor or other Person is entitled to any brokerage, finders, financial

Section 3.8. _Investment Representation_.

 

(a) Seller is an accredited investor as defined in Regulation D under the
Securities Act. Seller is acquiring the LP Interests for its own account for

state securities laws;

be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise
disposed of unless such transfer, sale, assignment, pledge, hypothecation or

necessary or appropriate for deciding whether to invest in the LP Interests

prospects and financial condition of Buyer; and

(d) Seller confirms that it has such knowledge and experience in financial
and business matters that Seller is capable of evaluating the merits and risks
of an investment in the LP Interests to be issued hereunder and of making an
informed investment decision and understands that, without limiting Sellers
ability to rely on Buyers representations and warranties under this
Agreement, (i) this investment is suitable only for an investor which is able
to bear the economic consequences of losing its entire investment, (ii) the
exchange of Interests with the LP Interests to be issued hereunder is a
speculative investment which involves a high degree of risk of loss of the
entire investment, and (iii) there are substantial restrictions on the
transferability of the LP Interests to be issued hereunder, and accordingly,
it may not be possible for Seller to liquidate its investment in case of
emergency.

Interest will contain a legend substantially to the effect set forth in
Exhibit 3.8(e). Seller acknowledges and agrees that the transfer agent for

Interests, except upon presentation of reasonable evidence to Issuer that the
restrictions set forth in such legend have been complied with.

however, that to the extent that such Damages or such Liens arise out of or
relate to conditions, Releases or the presence of Hazardous Materials that

required by Applicable Law; _provided, further_ , that nothing shall prohibit
Seller or its Affiliates from using their knowledge or mental impressions of

substance attached hereto as Exhibit 7.8 such releases to be effective
(including the expiration of any revocation period) immediately upon the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 7.9.  _Indemnification of Officers and Directors_.

Buyer and the Company shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify
the Governing Documents of the Company or manage the Company in any manner
that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who at and

Section 7.10. _Employee Matters_. Buyer shall have the right, but not the

Upon request of Buyer, the Company will provide Buyer and its Affiliates with
reasonable access to the Employees for the purpose of conducting employment
interviews before the Closing Date. At least ten (10) days before the Closing

provide for terms and conditions of employment (including without limitation
position, title, duties, responsibilities, base compensation, insurance and
other employee benefits, bonus opportunity, vacation, sick, or other

 



32  paid leave) that are materially consistent with those provided to employees
seconded to Buyer or its Affiliates in Lycoming and Wyoming Counties,
Pennsylvania. Seller and its Affiliates shall not interfere with any such
offers or negotiations by Buyer or any of its Affiliates to employ any
Employee or discourage any Employee from accepting employment with Buyer or
any of its Affiliates and, without limiting the foregoing, shall not,
and shall not offer to, increase the salary, benefits or other compensation
of any Employee other than as part of a company-wide increase in salary,
benefits or other compensation. Buyer shall notify Seller in writing and Buyer
and Seller shall confer at least two (2) days before the Closing Date as to
the identities of such Employees who have accepted Buyers or one of its
Affiliates offers of employment (the "Hired Employees"). Seller or the
Affiliate of Seller that employs the Employees will accept the resignation of
the Hired Employees effective as of the time immediately before the Closing
Date (or such later time with respect to an Employee on a leave of absence
other than vacation as of the Closing Date) and shall waive and release, as
it pertains to employment by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, any
noncompetition, non-disclosure and similar agreements between Seller or such
Affiliate and any of the Hired Employees (except for any nondisclosure
obligations relating to proprietary or confidential non-public information
that is not related to the Properties). Buyer shall be responsible, and shall
indemnify Seller and its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents
and assigns, for any costs, losses or liabilities incurred by Seller or any
of the Companys Affiliate(s) to the extent arising out of the actions or
omissions of Buyer or its Affiliates on or following the Closing with respect
to the Hired Employees, including without limitation the terms and conditions
of employment of the Hired Employees with Buyer or its Affiliate and Buyers
failure to comply with its obligations under this Section 7.10. The provisions
of this Section 7.10 are intended to benefit the parties to this Agreement
and the Companys Affiliate(s) referenced in this Section 7.10 and nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended or shall be construed to (a)
confer upon or give to any other Person (including for the avoidance of doubt
any Employees) other than the parties to this Agreement, the Companys
Affiliate(s) referenced in this Section 7.10, and their respective permitted
successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies
under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement or (b) amend any
employee benefit plan of Seller, Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates. 

Section 7.11. _Taxes_.

 

(a) Buyer, Issuer and Seller agree to treat the acquisition and disposition of
the Interests pursuant to this Agreement for federal income Tax purposes as a
transfer of the Properties to Issuer in part as a contribution of such
Properties to Issuer and in part as a purchase and sale of such Properties. In
accordance with such treatment, Buyer, Issuer and Seller agree:

(i) the receipt of the Cash Consideration shall be treated to the greatest
extent possible as part of a purchase and sale of the Properties; and

(ii) the receipt of the Equity Consideration shall be treated as part of a
contribution of the Properties to Issuer in exchange for an interest in Issuer
to which Section 721 of the Code applies.

Buyer, Issuer and Seller further agree that Sellers initial capital account
in Issuer (after taking into account the transactions described in clauses (i)
and (ii) above) shall be equal 

 



33  to the value determined for the Equity Consideration pursuant to Sections
2.2 and 2.3. Sellers initial per unit capital account shall equal (i) the per
unit capital account of a Common Unit, minus (ii) the VWAP Discount
determined in accordance with the principles, methodologies and line items set
forth on Exhibit J.

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall engage, on behalf of the Company,
Ernst and Young, or such other firm that is mutually acceptable to the Parties,
to conduct an appraisal and determine the fair market value of the
Properties. The cost of such appraisal shall be treated as an operating cost
of the Company incurred after the Effective Date for purposes of Section
12.1(a). Promptly following the completion of the appraisal, Seller, Issuer
and Buyer shall use Reasonable Efforts to agree upon an allocation of the Base
Purchase Price among the Properties pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code (the
"Purchase Price Allocation") based upon the values of the Properties as so
appraised. If an adjustment to the Base Purchase Price is made under this
Agreement, the Parties shall adjust the Purchase Price Allocation to be
consistent with the Purchase Price. If Seller, Issuer and Buyer agree upon a
Purchase Price Allocation, they shall report the transactions contemplated
hereby on all Tax Returns (including Form 8594 and all other information
returns and supplements thereto required to be filed by the Parties under
Section 1060 of the Code) in a manner consistent with such Purchase Price
Allocation and neither Seller, Issuer nor Buyer shall take, or shall permit
any of their respective Affiliates to take, any position inconsistent with
such allocation on any Tax Return or otherwise, unless required to do so by
applicable law or a "determination," within the meaning of Section 1313(a)(1)
of the Code. If Seller, Issuer and Buyer do not agree upon a Purchase Price
Allocation, each Party (and their respective Affiliates) may report the
transactions contemplated hereby on any such Tax Returns in any manner such
Party chooses at its discretion, and the Parties shall note the disagreement
of the other Party or Parties on their respective filings as required by
Applicable Law.

(c) For federal income tax purposes, except as otherwise required by
applicable law, the Parties agree to determine the portion of the Purchase
Price (and the proportion of the Cash Price and the number of Block A LP
Interests and the number of Block B LP Interests) payable in exchange for each
of the Series A Units of the Company and the Series B Units of the Company,
respectively, in a manner consistent with the appraisal performed in
accordance with _Section 7.11(b)_. To the extent permissible for federal
income tax purposes, the Block A LP Interests shall be treated as having
federal income tax attributes and characteristics that reflect the federal
income tax attributes and characteristics of the Series A Units of the
Company, and the Block B LP Interests shall be treated as having
federal income tax attributes and characteristics that reflect the federal
income tax attributes and characteristics of the Series B Units of the
Company.

(d) Each Party shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, provide
to the other Party such cooperation, documentation and information as any of
them reasonably may request in filing any Tax Return, determining a liability
for Taxes or conducting any audit, litigation, or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes imposed on or with respect to the assets, operations or
activities of the Company prior to Closing.

 



34 Section 7.12. _Press Releases_. Unless consultation is prohibited
by Applicable Law, Buyer and Seller shall consult with each other before
issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to
such consultation (but no approval thereof shall be required).

 

Section 7.13. _Payment of Bank Debt and Release of Liens_. The Company will
reach mutually satisfactory arrangements with the lender(s) under the Credit
Facilities (i) for the payment by Buyer at the Closing of all outstanding
Indebtedness attributable to the Company existing under the Credit Facilities
as of the Closing Date and (ii) for the delivery at Closing of either
executed (A) payoff letters or (B) releases or terminations by the lender(s)
(in a form satisfactory to the lender(s) and reasonably satisfactory to Buyer)
of all obligations of the Company under the Credit Facilities and all
mortgages or other Liens existing on collateral pledged or guaranties by the
Company as security under the Credit Facilities. The Company will reach
mutually satisfactory arrangements with each of the counterparties to all
other outstanding Indebtedness (other than performance bonds in the name of
the Company) attributable to the Company as of the Closing Date (i) for the
payment by Buyer at the Closing of all such Indebtedness and (ii) for the
delivery at Closing of either executed (A) payoff letters or (B) releases or
terminations by such counterparty (in a form satisfactory to the counterparty
and reasonably satisfactory to Buyer) of all such Indebtedness and all
mortgages or other Liens existing on collateral pledged or guaranties by the
Company as security for such Indebtedness.

Section 7.14. _Books and Records_. At or promptly after Closing, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer all records of the Company that are in Sellers control,
including original minute books and other corporate books and records and
accounts. Seller will deliver to Buyer all of the Companys rights of way
easements, rights of way option agreements, files, assignments, operating
records and agreements, engineering records, financial and accounting records
(but not including general financial accounting or tax accounting records),
and other similar files and records which directly relate to the Properties,
other than those which Seller considers to be proprietary or confidential, or
which Seller cannot provide to Buyer without, in its opinion, breaching, or
risking a breach of, agreements with other parties. Buyer agrees that Seller
may retain copies of all files transferred to Buyer pursuant to this Section
7.14.

Section 7.15. _Rights to "Chief" Name, Derivations of Name and Logo_. Buyer
agrees that Seller shall retain all rights to the "Chief" name, logo, and all
derivatives thereof, and that Buyer may not use such names, logos, or
derivations in any manner without the prior written consent of Seller.

Section 7.16. _Amendment to the Company s Certificate of Formation_.

36 Section 7.20. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller will use their reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all

under applicable laws and regulations to expeditiously consummate the

Subsidiaries, on the other hand, to be settled, terminated and retired
prior to the Closing Date without the transfer, payment or delivery of cash

Company. Section 7.21 of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth the contracts that

during such period.

Section 7.23. _Registration Rights Agreement_. At the Closing, Seller and

Rights Agreement") pursuant to which Issuer shall provide Seller with certain
registration rights with respect to the Common Units underlying the LP
Interests.

Section 7.24.  _Removal of Legend_. After Seller or its permitted assigns
have held the LP Interests for nine (9) months (or the Common Units for such
holding period after giving effect to Rule 144(d)(3)(ii) under the Securities
Act), if the certificate(s) representing or the book-entry account(s) of such
LP Interests (or Common Units) still bears the notation of the restrictive
legend set forth in Exhibit 3.8(e), Issuer agrees, upon request of Seller or
its permitted assignee, to use Reasonable Efforts to promptly remove such
legend from the LP Interests (or the Common Units), regardless of whether the

its permitted assign provides to Issuer any information Issuer deems
necessary to determine that the legend is no longer required under the
Securities Act or applicable state laws, including a certification that the
holder is not an Affiliate of Issuer (and a covenant to inform Issuer if

appropriate restriction) and regarding the length of time the LP Interests (or
the Common Units after giving effect to Rule 144(d)(3)(ii) under the
Securities Act) have been held, and an opinion of counsel regarding the lapse
of restrictions under Rule 144 under the Securities Act.

_Article VIII._

Buyers Due Diligence Examination

 

Section 8.1. _Due Diligence Examination_. From the Execution Date until 5:00
p.m. (local time in Dallas, Texas) on the twentieth (20th) day after the
execution and delivery of this

 



37  Agreement by all parties (the "Examination Period"), the Company shall
afford Buyer and its authorized representatives reasonable access during
normal business hours to the records of the Company at the offices of Seller
for the purposes of determining whether Environmental Defects (as defined
below) exist ("Buyers Environmental Review"); _provided, however_ , that such
investigation shall be upon reasonable notice and shall not unreasonably
disrupt the personnel and operations of Seller or the Company or impede the
efforts of Seller or the Company to comply with their other obligations under
this Agreement. Such books and records shall include files, assignments,
operating records and agreements, financial and accounting records,
engineering records, in each case insofar as same may now be in existence and
in the possession of the Company, excluding, however, any information
that the Company is prohibited from disclosing by bona fide, third party
confidentiality restrictions; _provided_ , that: (i) any information withheld
on such basis shall be identified with as much specificity and detail as
reasonably possible without breaching such obligation, and (ii) if requested
by Buyer, the Company shall use its Reasonable Efforts to obtain a waiver of
any such restrictions in favor of Buyer. The cost and expense of Buyers
Environmental Review, if any, shall be borne solely by Buyer. Buyer shall not
contact any of the customers or suppliers of Seller in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether in person or by telephone, mail or
other means of communication, without the specific prior authorization of
Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Section 8.2.  _Assertion of Environmental Defects_. If Buyer discovers any
Environmental Defects prior to the expiration of the Examination Period, Buyer
shall notify the Company as soon as possible and no later than the expiration
of the Examination Period of such alleged Environmental Defect. To be
effective, such notice ("Defect Notice") must (i) be in writing, (ii) be
received by the Company prior to the expiration of the Examination Period,
(iii) describe the Environmental Defect in reasonable detail including the
basis therefor (including any supporting documents), (iv) identify the
specific Properties to which such Environmental Defect relates, and (v)
include the Environmental Defect Amount as determined by Buyer in good faith.
Any matters that may otherwise constitute Environmental Defects, but of which
the Company has not been specifically notified by Buyer in accordance with the
foregoing, shall be deemed to have been waived by Buyer for all purposes.
Except to the extent of its remedies with respect to a breach of
representations and warranties, Buyers sole and exclusive rights and remedies
with respect to any matter that constitutes an Environmental Defect shall
be those set forth in this Article VIII and Section 11.1(d), and Buyer shall
not be entitled to refuse to close (other than pursuant to Section 9.1(d)), to
indemnification or any other right or remedy with respect to
any Environmental Defect. Upon the receipt of such effective Defect Notice
from Buyer, the Company shall have the option, in addition to the rights set
forth in this Article VIII, but not the obligation, to attempt to cure such
Environmental Defect at any time prior to the Closing.

Section 8.3. _Environmental Defects_. The term "Environmental Defect" means a
condition existing on the Effective Date with respect to any of the Companys
operations on the Properties that (i) is identified by the Site Assessment
conducted by or on behalf of Buyer and (ii) causes such Property (or the
Company with respect to such Property) to not be in material compliance with
or suffer a material liability under Applicable Environmental Laws. With
respect to each Environmental Defect that is not cured on or before the
Closing, the Base Purchase Price shall be reduced, subject to this Article
VIII, by the Environmental Defect

 



38  Amount to the extent that such Environmental Defect Amount exceeds One
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), it being expressly understood that if any
single Environmental Defect Amount exceeds One Hundred Thousand Dollars
($100,000), the entire amount of such Environmental Defect Amount shall be
included in the calculation of any applicable adjustment to the Base Purchase
Price pursuant to Section 8.4(b). The "Environmental Defect Amount" shall
mean the reasonable cost to investigate and remediate the Property (or
applicable portion thereof) by the most efficient and least costly method.

 

Section 8.4. _Base Purchase Price Adjustments for Environmental Defects_.

 

(a) If the Company and Buyer are unable to reach an agreement as to whether an
Environmental Defect exists or the Environmental Defect Amount attributable
to such Environmental Defect, the provisions of Article XVI shall be
applicable.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
the Base Purchase Price adjustment, as applied to all Environmental Defects
for which an adjustment is to be made, does not exceed two percent (2%) of
the Base Purchase Price, then no adjustment of the Base Purchase Price shall
occur. If the Base Purchase Price adjustment which would result from the above
provided for procedure as applied to all Environmental Defects for which an
adjustment is to be made exceeds two percent (2%) of the Base Purchase Price,
the Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted by the entire amount of such
adjustment.

the Termination Date) after receipt by Seller of notice in writing from Buyer,
then, provided that Buyer is not in material breach of its obligations
hereunder, this Agreement may, at the option of Buyer, be terminated. If Buyer
proceeds to Closing with Knowledge of any such condition precedent above not
being met by Seller, such condition precedent will be deemed waived by Buyer
as a condition to Closing and Buyer hereby waives any claims for a breach of
representation, warranty or covenant related thereto. In the event of such a

_Article XII._

 

 __Accounting Adjustments

Section 12.1. _Adjustments for Revenues and Expenses_. Appropriate adjustments
to the Base Purchase Price shall be made between Buyer and Seller in
accordance with the principles, methodologies and line items set forth on
Exhibit 12.3, so that:

(a) Buyer will bear all expenses, other than the amounts described in Section
12.1(c), which are incurred by the Company in the operation and development of
the Properties on or after the Effective Date (all such expenses, including
capital costs and expenditures, incurred on or after the Effective Date but
prior to the Closing Date, shall be added to the Base Purchase Price) and
Buyer will receive all proceeds (net of applicable Taxes) which are
attributable to the Properties and which are accrued on or after the
Effective Date.

(b) Except as provided in Section 12.4 below, Seller will bear all expenses
which are incurred in the operation and development of the Properties before
the Effective Date, and Seller will receive all proceeds (net of applicable
Taxes) which are attributable to the Properties and which are accrued before
the Effective Date.

(c) In addition and without limiting Section 12.1(b), Seller will bear (i)
all Company Transaction Expenses that are unpaid as of the Closing, (ii) other
than ordinary wear and tear on equipment, pipe and machinery, all amounts
required to repair or replace damaged property on or prior to the Closing Date
in accordance with Article XIV, (iii) all amounts incurred by the Company for
the preparation of the Financial Statements delivered pursuant to Section
7.18(a) (but excluding Seller costs and expenses reimbursable by Buyer
under Section 7.18(c)), (iv) all amounts incurred to cure an Environmental
Defect on or prior to the Closing Date for which an adjustment to the Base
Purchase Price is required to be made pursuant to Section 8.4(b) but only to
the extent not taken into account in the Base Purchase Price reduction
pursuant to Section 8.4(b) and (v) all outstanding Indebtedness attributable
to the Company existing immediately prior to the Closing (other than
the deferred purchase price of any property or services that is deemed to be
a capital expenditure) and paid off at Closing in accordance with Section
7.13. The Base Purchase Price shall be reduced dollar for dollar, without
duplication, by the amounts set forth in clauses (i), (ii). (iii) and (iv) of
this Section 12.1(c); provided, that the outstanding Indebtedness paid off at
Closing in accordance with Section 7.13 shall reduce only the Base Cash
Consideration.

(d) It is agreed that, in making such adjustments:

 

(i) ad valorem and similar Taxes assessed for periods prior to the 

 



45  Effective Date shall be borne by Seller and the ad valorem Taxes assessed
for periods on or after the Effective Date shall be borne by Buyer; and

 

(ii) ad valorem and similar Taxes assessed with respect to a period which the
Effective Date splits shall be prorated based on the number of days in such
period which fall on each side of the Effective Date (with the day on which
the Effective Date falls being counted in the period after the Effective
Date).

 

Section 12.2. _Initial Adjustment at Closing_. At least five (5) days before
the Closing Date, Seller shall provide to Buyer a statement (the "Initial
Settlement Statement") in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 12.3 showing
Sellers computations of the amount of the adjustments provided for (a) in
Section 12.1 and (b) in Article VIII and Article XIV, if any. Buyer and
Seller shall attempt to agree upon such adjustments prior to Closing, provided
that if agreement is not reached, Sellers computation shall be used at
Closing, subject to further adjustment under Section 12.3 below. Without
duplication of the Base Purchase Price adjustments contemplated by Section
12.1, if the amount of adjustments so determined which would result in a
credit to Buyer exceed the amount of adjustments so determined which would
result in a credit to Seller, Buyer shall receive a credit at Closing for the
amount of such excess, and if the converse is true, then the amount to be paid
by Buyer to Seller at Closing shall be increased by the amount of such
excess.

Section 12.3. _Adjustment Post Closing_. On or before ninety (90) days after
Closing, Seller shall prepare a "Final Settlement Statement" and deliver same
to Buyer setting forth any additional adjustments to the Base Purchase Price
determined in accordance with the principles, methodologies and line items
set forth on Exhibit 12.3 not reflected in the Initial Settlement Statement
(whether the same be made to account for expenses or revenues not considered
in making the adjustments made at Closing, or to correct errors made in the
adjustments made at Closing). Buyer will assist Seller in the preparation of
the Final Settlement Statement by providing Seller with any available data or
information reasonably requested by Seller. The Final Settlement
Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties on the thirtieth
(30th) day following receipt thereof by Buyer, unless Buyer gives written
notice of its disagreement to Seller prior to such date. In order to be valid,
any such notice shall specify in reasonable detail the dollar amount, nature
and basis of any disagreement so asserted. If the amount of the Purchase Price
as set forth on the Final Settlement Statement exceeds the amount of the
Purchase Price paid at the Closing, then Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount
by which the Purchase Price as set forth on the Final Settlement Statement
exceeds the amount of the Purchase Price paid at the Closing within five (5)
Business Days after the Final Settlement Statement is agreed to or otherwise
becomes final in accordance with this Section 12.3. If the amount of the
Purchase Price as set forth on the Final Settlement Statement is less than the
amount of the Purchase Price paid at the Closing, then Seller shall pay to
Buyer the amount by which the Purchase Price as set forth on the Final
Settlement Statement is less than the amount of the Purchase Price paid at the
Closing within five (5) Business Days after the Final Settlement Statement
is agreed to or otherwise becomes final in accordance with this Section 12.3.

Section 12.4. _No Further Adjustments_. Following the adjustments under
Section 12.3, no further adjustments shall be made under this Article XII.
Should any expenses with regard to the Properties be charged to (or received
by) Seller or Buyer after the earlier of (i) the conclusion

 



46  of such adjustments under Section 12.3 or (ii) ninety (90) days after
Closing, the same shall be borne by Buyer, regardless of the periods to which
the same relate, and any bills received by Seller will be forwarded to Buyer;
provided that expenses taken into account (and subject to limitation) under
this Section 12.4 shall not include any Company Transaction Expenses and shall
not include any Taxes. 

_Article XIII._

Assumption and Indemnification

Section 13.1. _Assumption and Indemnification by Buyer_. From and after the
Closing, Buyer shall assume, indemnify, defend and hold Seller (and its
Affiliates, their respective successors and assigns and their respective
owners, directors, officers, managers and employees) harmless from and
against any and all Damages (individually a "Sellers Indemnified Claim" and
collectively "Sellers Indemnified Claims") to the extent arising from or
related to:

 

(a) any misrepresentation or breach of any warranty, covenant or agreement of
Buyer or Issuer contained in this Agreement that survives Closing;

(b) the operation of the Properties prior to and after the Effective Date,
except for Buyers Indemnified Claims pursuant to Section 13.2; or

regardless of whether such condition or the events giving rise to such
condition arose or occurred before, on or after the Effective Date, except for
Buyers Indemnified Claims pursuant to Section 13.2.

THE FOREGOING ASSUMPTIONS AND INDEMNIFICATIONS OF BUYER SHALL APPLY WHETHER OR
NOT SUCH DUTIES, OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILITIES, OR SUCH CLAIMS, ACTIONS, CAUSES
OF ACTION, LIABILITIES, DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS OR EXPENSES ARISE OUT OF (i)
NEGLIGENCE (INCLUDING SOLE NEGLIGENCE, SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE, CONCURRENT
NEGLIGENCE, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE NEGLIGENCE, BUT EXPRESSLY NOT INCLUDING GROSS
NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT) OF ANY INDEMNITEE, (ii) STRICT LIABILITY, OR
(iii) ANY VIOLATION OF ANY LAW, RULE, REGULATION OR ORDER RELATED TO THE
OWNERSHIP OR OPERATION OF THE PROPERTIES, INCLUDING APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL
LAWS.

Section 13.2. _Indemnification By Seller_.

 

(a) From and after Closing, Seller shall defend, indemnify and hold Buyer (and
its Affiliates, their respective successors and assigns and their respective
owners, directors, officers, managers and employees) harmless from and against
any and all Damages (individually a "Buyers Indemnified Claim" and
collectively "Buyers Indemnified Claims") (i) to the extent arising out of
any misrepresentation or breach of any warranty, covenant or agreement of
Seller or the Company contained in this Agreement or (ii) to the extent of any
Excluded Liabilities.

 



47 THE FOREGOING ASSUMPTIONS AND INDEMNIFICATIONS OF SELLER SHALL APPLY WHETHER
OR NOT SUCH DUTIES, OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILITIES, OR SUCH CLAIMS, ACTIONS,
CAUSES OF ACTION, LIABILITIES, DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS OR EXPENSES ARISE OUT OF
(i) NEGLIGENCE (INCLUDING SOLE NEGLIGENCE, SIMPLE NEGLIGENCE, CONCURRENT

NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT) OF ANY INDEMNITEE, (ii) STRICT LIABILITY, OR
(iii) ANY VIOLATION OF ANY LAW, RULE, REGULATION OR ORDER RELATED TO THE
OWNERSHIP OR OPERATION OF THE PROPERTIES, INCLUDING APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL
LAWS.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, it is expressly understood that
Seller shall not have any obligation to defend, indemnify and hold harmless
Buyer (or its owners, directors, officers, and employees) with respect to any
Buyers Indemnified Claims under Section 13.2(a)(i) (other than to the extent
arising out of any misrepresentation or breach of Section 3.1 (Title to
Interests) or Section 3.3 (Authority)) except to the extent that the aggregate
of such Buyers Indemnified Claims exceeds Twenty-Five Million Dollars
($25,000,000), it being expressly understood that Seller shall not have any
such indemnity and hold harmless obligation for the first Twenty-Five Million
Dollars ($25,000,000) of the aggregate Buyers Indemnified Claims and that
the Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000) is a deductible. In no event
shall Seller have liability pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement
for Damages (other than pursuant to Section 13.2(a)(i) to the extent arising
out of any misrepresentation or breach of Section 3.1 (Title to Interests) or
Section 3.3 (Authority) or pursuant to Section 13.2(a)(ii)) in excess of One
Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, for purposes of this Section 13.2, any misrepresentation in or
breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller or the Company to
Buyer in this Agreement shall be determined (both for purposes of determining
whether a misrepresentation or breach has occurred and the amount of Damages
attributable thereto) without regard to any materiality or Material Adverse
Effect qualification contained in or otherwise applicable to any
such representation or warranty, other than the first sentence of Section
4.12, the second sentence of Section 4.10(a), the last sentence of Section
4.23(a) and Section 4.23(b).

 

(c) Except for the provisions of Section 13.3, nothing in this Article XIII
shall apply to Damages with respect to any and all Environmental Defects, the
Damages with respect to which shall be as set forth in Article VIII.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer (and its
Affiliates, their respective successors and assigns and their respective
owners, directors, officers, and employees) shall be deemed not to have
suffered any Damages under this Section 13.2 arising from claims based on
specific types of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses to the extent the
basis for such claim was included in the calculation of the Purchase Price or
in the preparation of the Final Settlement Statement. It is the intent of the
Parties that (i) the procedures set forth in Article XII and the dispute
resolution procedures referenced in Article XVI shall provide the sole and
exclusive

 



48  remedies for claims relating to the preparation of the Final Settlement
Statement and the determination of the Purchase Price and (ii) Buyer shall not
have double recovery pursuant to Section 13.2 for breaches of representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement to the extent that the facts
constituting any such breaches are taken into account in preparing the Final
Settlement Statement pursuant to Section 12.3 or in determining the Purchase
Price.

Section 13.3. _Survival of Provisions_. The representations and warranties
shall survive the Closing for a period of six (6) months, except as follows:
(a) the representations and warranties contained in Article IV shall not
survive the Closing, other than the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in Section 4.1 (Organization), Section 4.3 (Capital
Structure), Section 4.4 (Power and Authority), Section 4.6 (Non-
Contravention), Section 4.9 (Pending Proceedings), Section 4.10 (Compliance
with Laws), Section 4.11 (Taxes), Section 4.12 (Contracts), Section 4.15 (Gas
Imbalances), Section 4.23 (Financial Statements; No Undisclosed Liabilities),
Section 4.24 (Sufficiency of the Assets) and Section 4.27 (Environmental
Documents), and the representations and warranties of Buyer and Issuer
contained in Section 6.14 (Partnership Interests), Section 6.15 (Issuer SEC
Documents), Section 6.16 (No Material Adverse Change) and Section 6.17
(Internal Accounting Controls), which shall survive the Closing for a period
of twelve (12) months from the Closing Date; and (b) the representations of
Seller contained in Section 3.1 (Title to Interests), Section 3.2
(Organization and Standing), Section 3.3 (Authority) and Section 3.4 (Non-
Contravention) and the representations of Buyer and Issuer contained in
Section 6.1 (Organization), Section 6.2 (Power and Authority), Section 6.3
(Valid and Binding Agreement), Section 6.4 (Non-Contravention), and Section
6.19 (Tax Status of Buyer) shall survive the Closing without limitation. All
covenants of Seller, the Company, Buyer or Issuer contained in Article VII and
this Article XIII shall survive Closing except for (x) any covenant which by
its terms terminates as of a specific date, or is only made for a specified
period, and (y) the covenants set forth in Section 13.2, which shall only
survive for a period of six (6) months from the Closing, provided that, to
the extent any representation and warranty or covenant survives for a longer
period of time the covenants set forth in Section 13.2 shall survive for such
longer period of time solely with respect to such representation and warranty
or covenant, and provided further that the covenants set forth in Section 13.2
shall survive indefinitely with respect to any Excluded Liability (the
"Survival Period"). Written notice of any claim by Buyer for indemnification
from Seller under Section 13.2 arising during the Survival Period must be
given by Buyer to Seller no later than the end of the Survival Period.

 

Section 13.4. _Notice of Claim_. If indemnification pursuant to Section 13.1
or Section 13.2 is sought, the party seeking indemnification (the
"Indemnitee") shall give written notice to the indemnifying party of an event
giving rise to the obligation to indemnify, describing in reasonable detail
the factual basis for such claim, and shall allow the indemnifying party to
assume and conduct the defense of the claim or action with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnitee, and cooperate with the indemnifying party in
the defense thereof; _provided, however_ , that the omission to give such
notice to the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from
any liability which it may have to the Indemnitee, except to the extent that
the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by the failure to give such
notice and as otherwise provided in Section 13.3; _provided further_ that if,
within the thirty (30) days following receipt of Indemnitees notice, the
indemnifying party has not notified the Indemnitee in writing

 



49  of the indemnifying partys election to assume and conduct the defense, the
indemnifying party shall be deemed to have elected not to defend such claim
and the Indemnitee may conduct the defense at the sole cost and expense of
the indemnifying party. The Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate
counsel to represent the Indemnitee if the Indemnitee is advised by counsel
that an actual conflict of interest makes it advisable for the Indemnitee to
be represented by separate counsel and the reasonable expenses and fees of
such separate counsel shall be paid by the indemnifying party. The
indemnifying party shall not be entitled to settle any claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnitee, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

Section 13.5.  _No Commissions Owed_. Seller agrees to indemnify, defend and
hold Buyer (and its partners and its and their Affiliates, and the respective
owners, officers, directors, employees, attorneys, contractors and agents of
such parties) harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, causes
of action, liabilities, damages, losses, costs or expenses (including, without
limitation, court costs and attorneys fees) of any kind or character arising
out of or resulting from any agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged
to have been made by, or on behalf of, Seller or the Company with any broker
or finder in connection with this Agreement or the transaction contemplated
hereby. Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Seller (and its partners
and its and their Affiliates and the respective owners, officers, directors,
employees, attorneys, contractors and agents of such parties) harmless from
and against any and all claims, actions, causes of action,
liabilities, damages, losses, costs or expenses (including, without
limitation, court costs and attorneys fees) of any kind or character arising
out of or resulting from any agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged
to have been made by, or on behalf of, Buyer with any broker or finder in
connection with this Agreement or the transaction contemplated hereby.

 

Section 13.6. _Net Amounts_. Any amounts recoverable by any party pursuant to
this Article XIII with respect to any Buyers Indemnified Claims or Sellers
Indemnified Claims, as the case may be, shall be decreased by any insurance
proceeds or other amounts actually received (net of recovery costs and premium
adjustments) relating to such Buyers Indemnified Claims or Sellers
Indemnified Claims, as the case may be, paid to such Indemnitee by any Person
(other than any Affiliate of such Indemnitee) not a party to this Agreement.

 

 _Article XIV._

Casualty Losses

In the event of damage by fire or other casualty to the Properties after the
date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing, then: to the extent possible,
Seller shall repair or replace at its cost and expense such damaged property
to a condition substantially similar to the condition of the
affected Property immediately prior to the fire or other casualty in
accordance with prudent industry standards applicable to properties in the
nature of the affected Property; provided, however, that if such damage is
reasonably estimated to be in excess of 10% of the Base Purchase Price and
Seller has not repaired or replaced such damage at its cost and expense prior
to the Closing, Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement. In the
event that the Closing occurs, with respect to any damaged property that is
not repaired or replaced prior to the Closing, the Base Purchase Price shall
be reduced for such reasonable repair or replacement costs incurred or
reasonably necessary to be incurred by Buyer in accordance with prudent 

 



50  industry standards applicable to properties in the nature of the affected
Property. The party who pays to repair or replace damaged Property pursuant to
this Article XIV shall be entitled to any insurance proceeds (or pro rata
portion thereof) actually paid as reimbursement for such replacement and/or
repair.

 

 _Article XV._

Dispute Resolution

Section 16.1. _Dispute Resolution_.

(a) Any and all claims, disputes, controversies or other matters in question
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or to the computation of the
Purchase Price adjusted pursuant to Section 12.3 (all of which are referred to
herein as "Disputes") shall be resolved solely in accordance with this
Section 16.1, even though some or all of such Disputes are allegedly extra
contractual in nature, whether such Disputes sound in contract, tort, or
otherwise, at law or in equity, under state or federal law, whether provided
by statute or the common law, for damages or any other relief.

(b) If a Dispute occurs that the senior representatives of the parties
responsible for the transaction contemplated by this Agreement have been
unable, in good faith, to settle or agree upon within a period of fifteen
(15) days after written notice is given of such Dispute, Seller shall nominate
and commit one of its senior officers, and Buyer and/or Issuer (individually
and/or to the extent both Buyer and Issuer are involved in such Dispute,
collectively, the "Buyer Party") shall nominate and commit one of its senior
officers, to meet at a mutually agreed time and place not later than thirty
(30) days after written notice of the Dispute to attempt to resolve same. If
such senior management have been unable to resolve such Dispute within a
period of fifteen (15) days after such meeting, or if such meeting has not
occurred within forty-five (45) days following such written notice of
such Dispute, then any party shall have the right, by written notice to the
other, to resolve the Dispute as follows: (i) Disputes related to
Environmental Defects or the Environmental Defect Amount shall be resolved
pursuant to either Section 16.1(c) or Section 16.1(d) and (ii) all other
Disputes shall be resolved pursuant to Section 16.1(d).

 



52 (c) Each party shall have the right to submit Disputes related to
the existence of Environmental Defects or the Environmental Defect Amounts
attributable thereto to an independent expert appointed in accordance with
this Section 16.1(c) (each, an "Independent Expert"), who shall serve as sole
arbitrator. The Independent Expert shall be appointed by mutual agreement of
Seller and the Buyer Party from among candidates with experience and expertise
in the area that is the subject of such Dispute, and failing such agreement,
such Independent Expert for such Dispute shall be selected in accordance with
rule R-11 of the Rules (as hereinafter defined). Disputes to be resolved by an
Independent Expert shall be resolved in accordance with mutually agreed
procedures and rules and failing such agreement, in accordance with the rules
and procedures (including timing) for arbitration provided in Section 16.1(d).
The Independent Expert shall be instructed by the parties to resolve such
Dispute as soon as reasonably practicable in light of the circumstances. The
decision and award of the Independent Expert shall be binding upon the parties
as an award under the Federal Arbitration Act and final and nonappealable to
the maximum extent permitted by law, and judgment thereon may be entered in a
court of competent jurisdiction and enforced by any party as a final judgment
of such court. If the parties have any Dispute as to the selection of an
Independent Expert or an Independent Expert is not selected within ten (10)
days of the notice set forth in Section 16.1(b), any party may elect to
proceed with arbitration in accordance with Section 16.1(d).

 

(d) Any Dispute that is not resolved pursuant to the foregoing provisions of
this Section 16.1 shall be settled exclusively and finally by arbitration in
accordance with this Section 16.1(d).

(i) Such arbitration shall be conducted pursuant to the Federal Arbitration
Act. The validity, construction, and interpretation of this Section 16.1(d),
and all procedural aspects of the arbitration conducted pursuant hereto,
including the determination of the issues that are subject to arbitration
(i.e., arbitrability), the scope of the arbitrable issues, allegations of
waiver, laches, delay or other defenses to arbitrability, and the rules
governing the conduct of the arbitration (including the time for filing an
answer, the time for the filing of counterclaims, the times for amending the
pleadings, the specificity of the pleadings, the extent and scope of
discovery, the issuance of subpoenas, the times for the designation of
experts, whether the arbitration is to be stayed pending resolution of related
litigation involving third parties not bound by this Agreement, the receipt of
evidence, and the like), shall be decided by the arbitrators. The arbitration
shall be conducted using the Commercial Arbitration Rules (but not the
auspices) of the American Arbitration Association (the "Rules") or any
successor when not in conflict with the Federal Arbitration Act.

 

(ii) All arbitration proceedings hereunder shall be conducted in Dallas, Texas
or such other mutually agreeable location. 

(iii) Arbitration shall be commenced by the initiating party (the "claimant")
giving the other party (the "respondent") written notice of its intention to
arbitrate (the "Arbitration Demand"), which shall contain a

 



53  statement setting forth the nature of the dispute, the names and addresses
of all other parties, the amount involved, if any, the remedy sought, and the
hearing locale requested.

 

(iv) All arbitration proceedings hereunder shall be before a panel of three
(3) arbitrators. Each Person acting as an arbitrator must be impartial and
independent and have at least ten (10) years of experience in or relating to
the oil and gas industry. Seller and the Buyer Party shall each appoint one
arbitrator within fifteen (15) days after the Arbitration Demand and the
third arbitrator shall be selected by the arbitrators appointed by Seller and
the Buyer Party within fifteen (15) days after their appointment. If either
Seller or the Buyer Party has failed to designate an arbitrator within
fifteen (15) days after the Arbitration Demand or if the two appointed
arbitrators shall fail to select a third arbitrator within fifteen (15) days
after their appointment, then an arbitrator shall be selected by a U.S.
District Judge for the Northern District of Texas. Except as to the
impartiality or independence of an arbitrator, no party may dispute the
appointment of any arbitrator selected by the other party.

 

(v) Discovery shall be made pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
and completed within sixty (60) days of selection of the third arbitrator.

(vi) In deciding the substance of the Dispute, the arbitrators shall refer to
the substantive laws of the State of Texas for guidance (excluding choice-of-
law principles that might call for the application of the laws of another
jurisdiction). Matters relating to arbitration shall be governed by the
Federal Arbitration Act.

(vii) The arbitrators shall conduct a hearing within ninety (90) days after
appointment of the third arbitrator and shall render a final decision
completely disposing of the Dispute that is the subject of such proceedings as
within thirty (30) days after the final hearing. The parties shall instruct
the arbitrators to impose time limitations they consider reasonable for each
phase of such proceeding, including, without limitation, limits on the time
allotted to each party for the presentation of its case and rebuttal. The
arbitrators shall actively manage the proceedings as they deem best so as to
make the proceedings fair, expeditious, economical and less burdensome than
litigation. To provide for speed and efficiency, the arbitrators may: (i)
limit the time allotted to each party for presentation of its case; and (ii)
exclude testimony and other evidence they deem irrelevant or cumulative.

(viii) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
the parties expressly agree that the arbitrators shall have absolutely no
authority to award consequential, incidental, special, treble, exemplary or
punitive damages of any type under any circumstances regardless of whether
such damages may be available under Texas law, or any other laws, or under the
Federal Arbitration Act or the Rules.

 



54 (ix) The final decision of the arbitrators shall be in writing, be as
brief as possible, set forth the reasons for such final decision, and if the
arbitrators award monetary damages to either party, contain a certification by
the arbitrators that they have not included any incidental, special, treble,
exemplary or punitive damages. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the
arbitration proceeding and the arbitrators decision and award shall be
maintained in confidence by the parties and the parties shall instruct the
arbitrators to likewise maintain such matters in confidence.

(x) The fees and expenses of the arbitrators shall be borne equally by Seller
and the Buyer Party.

(xi) The decision and award of the arbitrators shall be binding upon the
parties and final and nonappealable to the maximum extent permitted by law,
and judgment thereon may be entered in a court of competent jurisdiction and
enforced by any party as a final judgment of such court.

 

 _Article XVII._

Miscellaneous Matters

Section 17.1. _Further Assurances_. After the Closing, Seller shall execute
and deliver, and shall otherwise cause to be executed and delivered, from time
to time, such further instruments, notices, division orders, transfer orders
and other documents, and do such other and further acts and things, as may be
reasonably necessary to more fully and effectively grant, convey and assign
the Interests and the Properties to Buyer.

Section 17.2. _Waiver of Consumer Rights_. Buyer hereby waives its rights
under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices - Consumer Protection Act, Section
17.41 et seq., Business and Commerce Code, a law that gives consumers special
rights and protections, and any similar law in any other state to the extent
such Act or similar law would otherwise apply. After consultation with an
attorney of Buyers own selection, Buyer voluntarily consents to this waiver.
To evidence Buyers ability to grant such waiver, Buyer represents to Seller
that it (a) is in the business of seeking or acquiring, by purchase or lease,
goods or services for commercial or business use, (b) has knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters that enable it to evaluate the
merits and risks of the transactions contemplated hereby, (c) is not in a
significantly disparate bargaining position, and (d) has consulted with, and
is represented by, an attorney of Buyers own selection in connection with
this transaction, and such attorney was not directly or indirectly identified,
suggested, or selected by Seller or an agent of Seller.

 

Section 17.3. _Parties Bear Own Expenses/No Special Damages_. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, each party shall bear and pay all
expenses (including, without limitation, legal fees) incurred by it in
connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE ANY
OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION
HEREWITH, FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE
DAMAGES, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH DAMAGES ARE AN ELEMENT OF A

 



55  THIRD PARTY CLAIM AGAINST AN INDEMNIFIED PARTY WHICH IS THE OBJECT OF
INDEMNIFICATION HEREUNDER. For purposes of the foregoing, actual damages may,
however, include indirect, special, consequential, exemplary or punitive
damages to the extent (i) the injuries or losses resulting in or giving rise
to such damages are incurred or suffered by a Person which is not an
Indemnitee pursuant to the Agreement or an Affiliate of such Indemnitee and
(ii) such damages are recovered against an Indemnitee by a Person which is not
Indemnitee or an Affiliate of such Indemnitee. This Section shall operate only
to limit a partys liability and shall not operate to increase or expand any
contractual obligation of a party hereunder or cause any contractual
obligation of a party hereunder to survive longer than provided in Section
13.3.

Section 17.4. _Transfer Taxes_. No Transfer Tax will be collected at Closing
from Buyer in connection with this transaction. If, however, this transaction
is later deemed to be subject to Transfer Tax, for any reason, Buyer and
Seller each agrees to be responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold the
other (and its Affiliates, and its and their respective directors, officers,
employees, attorneys, contractors and agents) harmless, for fifty percent
(50%) of all Transfer Taxes due by virtue of this transaction To the extent
any such Transfer Taxes are due and payable by Seller (or its Affiliates, or
their respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys, contractors or
agents), Buyer shall remit to Seller the amount of such Transfer Taxes for
which Buyer is responsible under this Section 17.4 within 5 days of Buyers
receipt of documentation evidencing Sellers payment of such Transfer Taxes.
To the extent any such Transfer Taxes are due and payable by Buyer (or its
Affiliates, or their respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys,
contractors or agents), Seller shall remit to Buyer the amount of such
Transfer Taxes for which Seller is responsible under this Section 17.4 within
five (5) days of Sellers receipt of documentation evidencing Buyers payment
of such Transfer Taxes. Seller and Buyer agree to cooperate with each other
in demonstrating that the requirements for exemptions, if any, from such
Transfer Taxes have been met.

Section 17.5.  _Guaranty_. Issuer hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
guarantees to Seller the prompt and full discharge by Buyer of all of Buyers
covenants, agreements, obligations and liabilities under Article XIII,
including the due and punctual payment of all amounts which are or may become
due and payable by Buyer thereunder when and as the same shall become due and
payable (collectively, the "Buyer Obligations"), in accordance with the terms
thereof and this Section 17.5. Issuer acknowledges and agrees that, with
respect to all Buyer Obligations to pay money, such guaranty shall be a
guaranty of payment and performance and not of collection and shall not be
conditioned or contingent upon the pursuit of any remedies against Buyer. If
Buyer shall default in the due and punctual performance of any Buyer
Obligation, including the full and timely payment of any amount due and
payable pursuant to any Buyer Obligation, Issuer will forthwith perform or
cause to be performed such Buyer Obligation and will forthwith make full
payment of any amount due with respect thereto at its sole cost and expense.

Section 17.6. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement contains the entire
understanding of the parties hereto with respect to subject matter hereof and
supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations, and
discussions among the parties with respect to such subject matter.

 



56 Section 17.7. _Choice of Law, etc._ Without regard to principles of conflicts
of law, this Agreement, and all claims of causes of action (whether in
contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related
to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement
or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement) shall be construed and
enforced in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Texas
applicable to contracts made and to be performed entirely within such state
and the laws of the United States of America, except that, to the extent that
the law of a state in which a portion of the Properties is located (or which
is otherwise applicable to a portion of the Properties) necessarily governs,
the law of such state shall apply as to that portion of the property located
in (or otherwise subject to the laws of) such state. EACH PARTY
HERETO WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT
IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.

 

Section 17.8. _Time of Essence_. Time is of the essence in this Agreement.

 

Section 17.9. _No Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding on and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns, provided that neither party shall have the right to assign this
Agreement, including any indemnification rights, or any obligations or
benefits hereunder, without the prior written consent of the other
party first having been obtained. Any transfer in absence of such consent
shall be null and void.

Section 17.10.  _Counterpart Execution_. For execution, this Agreement may be
executed in counterparts, all of which are identical and all of which
constitute one and the same instrument. It shall not be necessary for Buyer

Section 17.11. _Exclusive Remedy_.

 

(A) THE PARTIES HERETO HAVE VOLUNTARILY AGREED TO DEFINE THEIR RIGHTS,
LIABILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS RESPECTING THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT
EXCLUSIVELY IN CONTRACT PURSUANT TO THE EXPRESS TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS
AGREEMENT; AND, WITHOUT LIMITING THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO RELY ON THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE TO SUCH PARTY IN ARTICLE III AND ARTICLE
IV HEREIN, THE PARTIES HERETO EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM THAT THEY ARE OWED ANY DUTIES
OR ARE ENTITLED TO ANY REMEDIES NOT EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.
FURTHERMORE, THE PARTIES EACH HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS AGREEMENT EMBODIES
THE JUSTIFIABLE EXPECTATION OF SOPHISTICATED PARTIES DERIVED FROM ARMS LENGTH
NEGOTIATIONS; ALL PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NO
PARTY HAS ANY SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH ANOTHER PARTY THAT WOULD JUSTIFY ANY
EXPECTATION BEYOND THAT OF AN ORDINARY BUYER AND AN

 



57  ORDINARY SELLER IN AN ARMS LENGTH TRANSACTION. THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE
REMEDY FOR ANY BREACH OF THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING
ANY REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SET FORTH HEREIN) SHALL BE THOSE REMEDIES
AVAILABLE AT LAW OR, SOLELY TO THE EXTENT PROVIDED IN SECTION 17.11(B), IN
EQUITY FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT ONLY (AS SUCH CONTRACTUAL REMEDIES MAY BE
FURTHER LIMITED OR EXCLUDED PURSUANT TO THE EXPRESS TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT);
AND, WITHOUT LIMITING THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO RELY ON THE REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES MADE TO SUCH PARTY IN ARTICLE III AND ARTICLE IV HEREIN, THE
PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVE AND RELEASE ANY AND ALL TORT CLAIMS AND CAUSES
OF ACTION THAT MAY BE BASED UPON, ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT,
OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY
TORT CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO ANY
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY MADE IN OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR AS
AN INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT). WITHOUT LIMITATION OF THE
FOREGOING, FROM AND AFTER THE CLOSING, THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF BUYER
AND ISSUER FOR ANY AND ALL (A) CLAIMS RELATING TO ANY REPRESENTATIONS,
WARRANTIES, COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, (B) OTHER
CLAIMS PURSUANT TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND (C) OTHER CLAIMS
RELATING TO THE PROPERTIES AND THE PURCHASE AND SALE THEREOF SHALL BE ANY
RIGHT TO INDEMNIFICATION FROM SUCH CLAIMS THAT IS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS
AGREEMENT, AND IF NO SUCH RIGHT OF INDEMNIFICATION IS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED, THEN
SUCH CLAIMS ARE HEREBY WAIVED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

(B) If the Closing does not occur due to the breach of Seller, Seller agrees
that Buyer and Issuers legal remedies will be inadequate and that the
Properties are unique. In addition as to such breach to the extent permitted
by applicable law, the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer and Issuer shall be
the right to return of the Deposit provided herein and to specific
performance under applicable law and Buyer and Issuer shall not be entitled to
recover any monetary damages; _provided however_ , if the foregoing limitation
of Buyer and Issuers remedy to specific performance should for any reason be
legally unenforceable, then the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer and Issuer,
in such event, shall instead be any right to recover (i) the Deposit and (ii)
all third party out-of-pocket costs, expenses and fees incurred by Buyer or
Issuer (including but not limited to attorneys, accountants, consultants,
lenders and proposed lenders and investors) in connection with this Agreement,
the transactions contemplated hereby, and any financings by Buyer or Issuer
contemplated hereby (collectively, "Buyer Transaction Expenses"); provided
further, that in no event shall Buyer and Issuer be entitled to recover an
amount in excess of (i) the Deposit plus (ii) Buyer Transaction Expenses in
an amount equal to the Deposit. It is acknowledged and agreed by the parties
that,

 



58  notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the right of
Seller to retain the Deposit (and interest earned thereon) as liquidated
damages pursuant to Section 2.4(a) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Seller and the Company for such failure to close.

(C) UPON CLOSING, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 13.2, BUYER AND ISSUER SHALL
ALSO BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT TO CONTRIBUTION AGAINST SELLER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, ANY CONTRIBUTION CLAIM ARISING UNDER ANY APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL
LAW) AND ANY AND ALL OTHER RIGHTS, CLAIMS AND CAUSES OF ACTION IT MAY HAVE
AGAINST SELLER ARISING UNDER OR BASED ON ANY FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL STATUTE,
LAW, ORDINANCE, RULE OR REGULATION OR COMMON LAW OR OTHERWISE. IF BUYER OR
ISSUER OBTAIN SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE, THE DEPOSIT SHALL BE APPLIED TO THE
PAYMENT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE TO SELLER.

other subdivisions refer to corresponding articles, sections, subsections and
