ARTICLE I.

 

THE OFFER

1.1 The Offer.

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with _Section 7.1_, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within ten
(10) Business Days) after the date hereof, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase all of the Shares at a price per share
equal to the Offer Price.

 

(b) The obligation of Purchaser to, and of Parent to cause Purchaser to,
accept for payment and pay for any Shares validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction, or
waiver by Purchaser or Parent, of the conditions set forth in _Annex A_ (the "
_Offer Conditions_ "). Subject to the satisfaction, or waiver by Purchaser or
Parent, of the Offer Conditions, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms and accept for
payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable (and in any event within
three (3) Business Days) after the Expiration Date and in any event in
compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (the time of such
acceptance for payment, the " _Acceptance Time_ "). The Offer Price payable
in respect of each Share validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant
to the Offer shall be paid net to the seller of such Share in cash, without
interest, subject to the withholding of any Taxes required by applicable Law,
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. The
time scheduled for payment for shares of Company Common Stock accepted for
payment pursuant to and subject to the conditions of the Offer is referred to
in this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing_ ", and the date on which the Offer
Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing Date_
_._ "

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase that describes
the terms and conditions of the Offer as set forth in this Agreement.
Purchaser and Parent expressly reserve the right to waive (in whole or in
part) any Offer Condition at any time and from time to time, to increase the
Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the
Offer; __provided__ , __however__ , that without the prior written consent of
the Company, Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii) change the
form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) reduce the number of Shares
to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) amend

 



2  or modify any of the Offer Conditions in a manner that is adverse to the
holders of Shares or impose conditions to the Offer that are different than or
in addition to the Offer Conditions, (v) amend, modify or waive the Minimum
Condition, (vi) add to the Offer Conditions or amend, modify or supplement any
Offer Condition in a manner that is or could reasonably be expected to be
adverse to the holders of Shares in any respect, or (vii) extend or otherwise
change any time period for the performance of any obligation of Purchaser or
Parent (including the Expiration Date) in a manner other than pursuant to and
in accordance with this Agreement.

 

(d) Unless extended as provided in this Agreement, the Offer shall initially
be scheduled to expire at midnight, New York City time, on the date that is
the later of (such later date being the " _Initial Expiration Date_ "): (i)
twenty (20) Business Days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and
Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act) after the commencement of the Offer and
(ii) the second Business Day following the Go-Shop Period End Date (or if the
Company has engaged with a Qualified Go-Shop Bidder with respect to a
Qualified Acquisition Proposal after the Go-Shop Period End Date, the
expiration of the fifteen (15) day period described in the last sentence of
_Section 5.4(b)_). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at midnight, New York
City time, on the Initial Expiration Date or any subsequent date as of which
the Offer is scheduled to expire, any Offer Condition is not satisfied or, to
the extent waivable in accordance with the terms hereof, has not been waived
by Purchaser or Parent, Purchaser shall (subject to the rights or remedies of
the parties hereto hereunder, including under _Article VII_ ), extend (and
re-extend) the Offer and its expiration date beyond the Initial Expiration
Date (the Initial Expiration Date as it may be extended herein is referred to
as the " _Expiration Date_ ") for one or more periods, in consecutive
increments of up to ten (10) Business Days each, the length of each such
period to be determined by Parent in its sole discretion (or such longer
period as Parent and the Company may mutually agree) to permit such Offer
Condition to be satisfied; __provided__ , __however__ , that in no event shall
Purchaser be required to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date or, if
earlier, the date that is five (5) Business Days following the Proxy
Statement Clearance Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Purchaser shall, without the written consent of the Company, extend the Offer
for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position
of the SEC or its staff or applicable Law, in each case, applicable to the
Offer.

 

(e) Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration
Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except for a
termination of this Agreement permitted in accordance with the terms of
_Section 7.1_. In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 7.1_, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to)
promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of such termination),
irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer, not acquire any Shares
pursuant thereto, and cause any depositary acting on its behalf to
promptly return in accordance with applicable Law all tendered Shares to the
registered holders thereof.

(f) If the Acceptance Time occurs, but the number of Shares that have been
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn in the Offer, together with any
Shares then owned by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent (assuming exercise of
the Top-Up Option in full and excluding from such ownership, but not from
then-outstanding Shares, Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery
procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of
such guarantee), is less than 90% of the outstanding Shares, Purchaser may,
in its sole discretion,

 



3  commence a "subsequent offering period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under
the Exchange Act (a " _Subsequent Offering Period_ ") and one or more
extensions thereof. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
the Offer, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) immediately
accept for payment, and pay for, all Shares that are validly tendered pursuant
to the offer during such Subsequent Offering Period.

(g) On the commencement date of the Offer, Purchaser and Parent shall (i) file
or cause to be filed with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3 under the
Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule TO_ ") that will contain or incorporate by reference the related
offer to purchase the Shares pursuant to the Offer, the form of the related
letter of transmittal, the summary advertisement and other ancillary Offer
documents pursuant to which the Offer will be made and instruments pursuant
to which the Offer will be made (collectively, and together with all exhibits,
amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "); and (ii) cause
the Schedule TO and related Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of
Shares in accordance with applicable federal securities Laws. The Company
shall promptly furnish to Purchaser and Parent in writing all information
concerning the Company and its stockholders that may be required by
applicable Law to be set forth in the Offer Documents or reasonably requested
in connection with any action contemplated by this _Section 1.1(g)_. The
Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Offer Documents prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and
Purchaser and Parent shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any
comments made by the Company and its counsel. Each of Purchaser, Parent and
the Company agrees to promptly correct any information provided by it for use
in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required
by applicable Law. Purchaser and Parent further agree to take all steps
necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected (if applicable) to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. Upon receipt of
any written or oral comments by Purchaser, Parent or their counsel from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents, or any request from the
SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Offer Documents,
Purchaser and Parent agree to (i) promptly provide the Company and its counsel
with a copy of any such written comments or requests (or a description of any
such oral comments or requests); (ii) provide the Company and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to comment on any proposed response thereto, and to
give reasonable and good faith consideration to any such comments made by the
Company and its counsel; (iii) provide the Company and its counsel an
opportunity to participate with Purchaser, Parent or their counsel in any
material discussions or meetings with the SEC or its staff; and (iv) provide
the Company with copies of any written comments or responses submitted
by Purchaser and Parent in response thereto.

(h) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect
of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, merger,
issuer tender offer, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to
Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to
Purchasers acceptance for payment of, and payment for, Company Common Stock
tendered in the Offer, and such adjustment to the Offer Price shall provide
to the holders of Company

 



4  Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such action and shall as so adjusted from and after the date of such
event, be the Offer Price;  _ _provided_ , _however__ , that no such
adjustment shall be made to reflect the issuance of additional shares of
capital stock of the Company as a result of Purchasers exercise of the Top-Up
Option or as a result of Parents and Purchasers acquisition of Company
Common Stock tendered in the Offer; and __provided__ , __further__ , that
nothing in this _Section 1.1(h)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to
take any action with respect to the Company Common Stock that is prohibited
by the terms of this Agreement.

(i) Subject in all respects to the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Offer Conditions, Parent shall provide or cause to be
provided to Purchaser on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any
shares of Company Common Stock that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer.

under this _Section 1.2(b)_, shall use such information only in connection
with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated,
shall, upon request, deliver to the Company or destroy (and confirm such
destruction in writing) all such information and documents (along with all
copies thereof) then in their possession or control.

1.3 Directors of the Company.

 

(a) Effective on the Acceptance Time and from time to time thereafter, Parent
shall be entitled to designate up to such number of directors (rounded up to
the next whole number) on the Company Board equal to the product of (i) the
total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the election
of any additional directors pursuant to this  _Section 1.3(a)_); and (ii) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Shares owned by Purchaser
and Parent (giving effect to Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the
Offer), and the denominator of which is the total number of then outstanding
Shares. In furtherance thereof, the Company and the Company Board shall, after
the purchase of and payment for Shares by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer,
promptly increase the size of the Company Board or secure the resignations of
such number of directors as is necessary to enable Parents designees to be so
elected to the Company Board, and shall cause Parents designees to be so
elected. In addition, subject to applicable Law, the Company shall cause the
individuals so designated by Parent to constitute substantially the same
percentage (rounding up where appropriate) of each committee of the Company
Board as the percentage represented by such individuals on the Company Board
as a whole. 

(b) The Companys obligations under _Section 1.3(a)_ to appoint Parents
designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly
file with the SEC and mail to the holders of Shares the information required
by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder
and shall promptly take all other actions reasonably required to effect the
appointment of Parents designees pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_. Purchaser and
Parent will supply the Company with, and will be solely responsible for, any
information with respect to

 



6  them and their nominees, officers, directors and Affiliates required by such
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1, and the Companys obligations under _Section
1.3(a)_ and this  _Section 1.3(b)_ shall be conditioned upon receipt of such
information.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 1.3_,
Purchaser, Parent and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to cause the Company Board to include, at all times prior to the
Effective Time, at least three (3) of the members of the Company Board,
selected by members of the Company Board, who (x) were directors of the
Company immediately prior to the Acceptance Time (y) are not officers of the
Company and (z) are independent directors for purposes of the continuing
listing requirements of Nasdaq (the " _Continuing Directors_ "); __provided__
, __however__ , that if at any time prior to the Acceptance Time there shall
be fewer than three (3) Continuing Directors on the Company Board for any
reason, the Company Board shall cause the person(s) designated by the
remaining Continuing Director(s) to fill such vacancy who shall be deemed to
be a Continuing Director for all purposes of this Agreement, or if no
Continuing Directors then remain, the other directors of the Company then in
office shall designate three (3) persons to fill such vacancies who are not
directors, officers, employees, stockholders, designees or Affiliates of
Purchaser or Parent and such persons shall be deemed to be Continuing
Directors for all purposes of this Agreement. Following the election or
appointment of Parents designees to the Company Board pursuant to _Section
1.3(a)_ and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the
Continuing Directors (or the approval of the sole Continuing Director if there
shall be only one (1) Continuing Director) shall be required to authorize: (i)
any amendment or modification to, or termination of, or any agreement to
amend, modify or terminate, this Agreement by or on behalf of the Company;
(ii) any extension or waiver by the Company of the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of Purchaser or Parent under this
Agreement; (iii) any exercise or waiver of any of the Companys rights or
remedies hereunder; (iv) any amendment to the Companys Charter Documents; (v)
any authorization of any agreement between the Company and any of the Company
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Purchaser, Parent or any of their
Affiliates on the other hand; (vi) the taking of any other action by the
Company in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby required to be taken by the Company Board as contemplated by this
Agreement; or (vii) any other action not contemplated by this Agreement that
could adversely affect the rights of the Companys stockholders hereunder.
Following the election or appointment of Parents designees to the Company
Board pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_ and until the Effective Time, any action
by the Company with respect to the enforcement of this Agreement by
the Company shall be effected only by and at the direction of a majority of
the Continuing Directors (or the action of the sole Continuing Director if
there shall only be one (1) Continuing Director then in office), and any such
authorization or direction shall constitute the authorization and direction
of the full Company Board with respect thereto, and no other action on the
part of the Company, including any action by any other director of the
Company, shall be required to authorize, or for the Company to take, any such
action. The Continuing Directors shall have the authority to retain such
counsel and other advisors at the expense of the Company as reasonably
determined by the Continuing Directors and any such reasonable expenses shall
be paid by the Company promptly upon written request by the Continuing
Directors.

 



7 1.4 Top-Up Option.

 

(a) The Company hereby grants to Purchaser an irrevocable option (the " _Top-
Up Option_ "), exercisable only once and only upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this _Section 1.4_, and only for so long as this
Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1_, to purchase at a
price per share equal to the Offer Price an aggregate number of validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Company Common Stock (the "
_Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to up to the number of then-available
authorized and unissued shares of Company Common Stock; __provided__ ,
__however__ , that the Top-Up Option shall not be deemed to be exercised (i)
to purchase an amount of Top-Up Option Shares in excess of the number of
shares of Company Common Stock authorized and unissued (treating shares owned
by the Company as treasury stock as unissued) at the time of exercise of the
Top-Up Option (treating shares of Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to
all then-outstanding stock options, restricted stock units and any other
rights to acquire Company Common Stock as if such shares were outstanding),
(ii) unless immediately after such exercise and the issuance of the Top-Up
Option Shares, Purchaser and Parent shall, when added to the shares of
Company Common Stock owned by Purchaser and Parent, own at least 90% of the
shares of the Company Common Stock outstanding (excluding from the calculation
of the number of shares of Company Common Stock Purchaser and Parent then
owns, but not from the calculation of then-outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock, the Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures
that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such
guarantee) immediately after the Acceptance Time (the " _Short-Form
Threshold_ "), (iii) unless the Acceptance Time shall have occurred, (iv)
unless Purchaser irrevocably commits upon acquisition of the Top-Up Shares to
immediately effect the Merger pursuant to  _Section 2.3_ and (v) if the
exercise of the Top-Up Option, the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Option
Shares and compliance with this _Section 1.4_ shall be prohibited by any
outstanding order or Law (excluding any rules of Nasdaq that require
stockholder approval). Purchaser shall pay the Company the aggregate purchase
price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares as set forth in
_Section 1.4(b)_.

 

(b) Subject to the limitations set forth in _Sections 1.4(a)_ and the
satisfaction of the conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article VI_ , if
there shall not have been validly tendered in the Offer and not validly
withdrawn that number of shares of Company Common Stock which, when added to
the shares of Company Common Stock owned by Purchaser and Parent prior to
giving effect to the exercise of the Top-Up Option, does not represent at
least the Short-Form Threshold on the Offer Closing Date, Purchaser shall on
such date be deemed to have exercised the Top-Up Option for such number of
Top-Up Option Shares as is necessary for Purchaser to reach the Short-Form
Threshold and on such date shall give the Company prior written notice
specifying (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock directly or
indirectly owned by Purchaser and Parent at the time of such notice (giving
effect to the Offer Closing but prior to giving effect to the exercise of the
Top-Up Option) and (y) the number of Top-Up Option Shares. Such notice will
also include an undertaking signed by Purchaser and Parent that, immediately
following the Top-Up Closing, Purchaser will, and Parent will cause Purchaser
to, consummate the Merger in accordance with _Section 2.3_. The Company
shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice (and in any
event no later than the Offer Closing), deliver written notice to Purchaser
specifying the number of Shares then outstanding and, based on such number
and, based on the information provided by Purchaser in its notice, the number
of Top-Up Option Shares to be purchased. If the number of Top-Up Option
Shares specified in the

 



8  notice provided delivered by Purchaser is different than the number of Top-
Up Option Shares specified in the notice delivered by the Company, the Company
and Purchaser shall, as promptly as practicable and in any event on the Offer
Closing Date, reasonably agree on the appropriate number of Top-Up Option
Shares. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares (the "
_Top-Up Closing_ "), which shall take place simultaneously with the Offer
Closing, the purchase price owed by Purchaser to the Company to purchase the
Top-Up Option Shares shall be paid to the Company, at Purchasers option: (i)
in cash, by wire transfer of same-day funds; or (ii) by (A) paying in cash,
by wire transfer of same-day funds, an amount equal to not less than the
aggregate par value of the Top-Up Option Shares and (B) executing and
delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal
to the aggregate purchase price pursuant to the Top-Up Option less the amount
paid in cash pursuant to the preceding clause (A) (the " _Promissory Note_ ").
The Promissory Note: (1) shall be due on the first anniversary of the Top-Up
Closing; (2) shall bear simple interest of 5% per annum, payable in arrears at
maturity; (3) shall be fully recourse to Purchaser and Parent; (4) may be
prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty; and (5)
shall have no other material terms. At the Top-Up Closing, the Company shall
cause to be issued to Purchaser a certificate representing the Top-Up Option
Shares.

 

(c) Each of Purchaser and Parent acknowledges that the Top-Up Option Shares
that Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. The
parties hereto shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up
Option Shares is accomplished consistent with all applicable Laws, including
compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Option
Shares under the Securities Act. Each of Purchaser and Parent represents and
warrants to the Company that Purchaser is, and will be upon the exercise of
the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited investor," as defined in Rule 501 of
Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. Each of Purchaser and
Parent represents, warrants and agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up
Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and
will be acquired by Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with a
view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within
the meaning of the Securities Act). Any certificates evidencing Top-Up Option
Shares shall include any legends required by applicable securities Laws.

 

(d) Any dilutive impact on the value of the shares of Company Common Stock
resulting from the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares or the payment by
Purchaser to the Company of consideration of the Top-Up Option Shares,
including the Promissory Note, will not be taken into account in any
determination of the fair value of any Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL as contemplated by _Section 2.10_ and none of the parties
hereto shall take any position to the contrary in any appraisal proceeding.

if the Company has engaged with a Qualified Go-Shop Bidder with respect to a

Business Days thereafter), in consideration of the deemed exercise and
cancellation of such Company Option, an amount in cash (without interest and

interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax as
contemplated in Section 2.9), equal to the product of: (i) the excess, if
any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price of each such Company
SAR; and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Company SAR; provided, however, that if the exercise price per share
represented by any such Company SAR is equal to or greater than the per share
Merger Consideration, such Company SAR shall be canceled and terminated
without any cash payment being made in respect thereof.

  



12 (c) Neither Purchaser nor Parent shall assume any Company RSU or substitute
for any Company RSU any similar award for Purchaser or Parent stock, in

14 (g) In addition to the actions required by _Section 2.6(f)_, the
Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the

thereof or any administrator of a Stock Plan as may be necessary and (ii)
ensure that the Company will not at the Effective Time be bound by any
options, stock appreciation rights, warrants, convertible debt or other

Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof
administering the Stock Plans) shall take all such actions as are necessary to

outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company Stock
Certificate_ ") is presented to the Payment Agent or to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and
shall be exchanged as provided in _Section 2.8_ below.

2.8 Surrender of Certificates.

(a) On or prior to the Merger Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable
bank or trust company to act as payment agent in the Merger (the " _Payment
Agent_ "). At the Effective Time or as promptly as practicable thereafter (but
in no event later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day
following the Effective Time), Parent shall deposit with the Payment Agent
cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
_Section 2.5_. The cash amount so deposited with the Payment Agent is
referred to as the " _Payment Fund_." The Payment Agent will invest the funds
included in the Payment Fund in the manner directed by Parent; __provided_ ,
_however__ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by
the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and
backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available). Any
interest or other income resulting from the investment of such funds shall be
the property of Parent.

 



15 (b) Within five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, the Payment
Agent will mail to the Persons who were record holders of Company Stock
Certificates or book-entry shares immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than to holders of Dissenting Shares to the extent such holders do not
also hold Shares that are not Dissenting Shares): (i) a letter of transmittal
in customary form reasonably acceptable to the Company; and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates in exchange
for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate to
the Payment Agent for exchange, together with a duly completed and validly
executed letter of transmittal or receipt of an "agents message" by the
Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer to the Payment
Agent as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of such book-
entry shares, together with a duly completed and validly executed letter of
transmittal or, in each case, such other documents as may be reasonably
required by the Payment Agent or Parent: (A) the holder of such Company Stock
Certificate or book-entry share shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration; and (B) the Company Stock Certificate
so surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 2.8(b)_, each Company Stock Certificate or book entry share shall be
deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to
receive Merger Consideration as contemplated by _Section 2.5_. No interest
shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of
any Certificate or book-entry share. If any Company Stock Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of any Merger
Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Company Stock Certificate, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate
affidavit and to deliver a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving
Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against the Payment Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with
respect to such Company Stock Certificate. Upon the making of such affidavit
and delivering such bond, the Payment Agent will issue, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate as contemplated under this Article II.

 

Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed or undistributed to
holders of Company Stock Certificates or book-entry shares as of the date
that is one (1) year after the Merger Closing Date shall be delivered to
Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company Stock Certificates (other than
with respect to any Dissenting Shares) who have not theretofore surrendered
their Company Stock Certificates or book-entry shares in accordance with this
_Section 2.8_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for
satisfaction of their claims for the Merger Consideration pursuant to this 
_Section 2.8_. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of
Company Common Stock two (2) years after the Effective Time (or such earlier
date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat
to or become property of any Governmental Body) shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall be liable to any holder of any Company Stock Certificate or to any other
Person with respect to any Merger Consideration delivered to any public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property Law, escheat Law or
similar Law.

 



16 2.9 Withholding Rights. Each of the Payment Agent, Purchaser, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Offer Price or Merger Consideration, as applicable, payable to any holder of
any Company Stock Certificate (in his or her capacity as a holder of Company
Common Stock), Company Option, Company SAR, Company RSU, Company RCU, 2012
Company PBRSU, or 2012 Company Equity Awards pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld from such consideration
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law or under
any other applicable Law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have
been paid.

2.10 Dissenting Shares.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has made a demand for
appraisal of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (any such
shares being referred to as " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such
holder effectively withdraws or fails to perfect or otherwise loses such
holders appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such
shares) shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.5_, but shall be entitled only
to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares. At
the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL.

 

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the
date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into
and shall represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.5_, without interest thereon, upon surrender of
the Company Stock Certificate representing such shares or transfer of such
book-entry share, as the case may be, in accordance with the terms hereof.

(c) The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt written notice of (A) any demand
for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the DGCL; (B) any withdrawal or attempted withdrawal of any such demand; and
(C) any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to
the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL; and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment or settlement offer or settle any
such demands prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand,
notice or instrument. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled
under Section 262 of the DGCL to receive payment of the "fair value" for such
holders shares shall receive such payment therefor from the Surviving
Corporation after giving effect to any withholdings received by applicable Law
(but only after the amount thereof shall have been finally determined pursuant
to the DGCL), and such shares shall be retired and cancelled. 

 



17 2.11 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Purchaser and
the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Purchaser, in the name of the
Company and otherwise) to take and shall take such action.

regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company SEC
Reports, and none of the Company SEC Reports contained any untrue statement of

respects the consolidated financial position and the consolidated

timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the
Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

representation or warranty with respect to the Company or Company Subsidiaries
or their respective business or operations, including with respect to any
information provided or

Affiliates or Representatives or any other Person; and (b) except in the case
of Fraud, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives or any other Person will have or be
subject to any liability or indemnification obligation or other obligation of
any kind or nature to Purchaser, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates
or Representatives or any other Person, resulting from the delivery,

Purchaser, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives or
any other Person, in "data rooms," confidential information memoranda or

4.8 Non-Reliance on Company Estimates, Projections, Forecasts, Forward-Looking
Statements and Business Plans. In connection with the due diligence
investigation of the Company by Purchaser and Parent and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives, Purchaser and Parent and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives have received and may continue to receive after
the date hereof from the Company and its Affiliates and Representatives
certain estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking
information, as well as certain business plan information, regarding the
Company and its business and operations. Purchaser and Parent hereby
acknowledge and agree that: (a) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting
to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking
statements, as well as in such business plans, with which Purchaser and
Parent are familiar; (b) Purchaser and Parent are taking full responsibility
for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as such
business plans, so furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking
information or business plans); and (c) except in the case of Fraud, Purchaser
and Parent hereby waive any claim against the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives with
respect to any information described in this _Section 4.8_, and have relied
solely on the results of their own independent investigation and on the
representations, warranties, agreements and covenants made by the Company and
contained in this Agreement. Accordingly, Purchaser and Parent hereby
acknowledge and agree that none of the Company nor any Company Subsidiaries,
or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives, has made or is
making any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to such
estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or business
plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or business
plans).

4.9 Financing.

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies of
(i) the executed commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, from Deutsche
Bank Trust Company Americas, Deutsche Bank AG Cayman Islands Branch and
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and from Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association, WF Investment Holdings, LLC and

 



36  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (together with all exhibits, annexes, schedules
and attachments thereto, including the Redacted Fee Letter, collectively, the
" _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms
and conditions thereof, the lender parties thereto have committed to lend the
amounts set forth therein to Purchaser for the purpose of funding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Debt Financing_ "), and
(ii) the executed equity commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof (the "
_Equity Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the Debt Commitment Letter,
the " _Financing Commitments_ ") from certain funds affiliated with
Centerbridge Associates II, L.P. (" _Sponsor_ ") pursuant to which Sponsor has
caused such funds to commit to invest the amounts set forth therein subject
to the terms and conditions therein (the " _Equity Financing_ " and, together
with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ "). The Equity Commitment Letter
provides, and will continue to provide until such time as this Agreement
and/or the Equity Commitment Letter is terminated, that the Company is a third
party beneficiary thereof as set forth therein.

(b) As of the date hereof: (i) each of the Financing Commitments is in full
force and effect and has not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any
respect or otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any respect, (ii)
is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser and Parent, and (in the
case of the Debt Commitment Letter only, to the Knowledge of Purchaser and
Parent) the other parties thereto, (iii) the Debt Commitment Letter delivered
pursuant to _Section 4.9(a)_ are true and complete copies (as amended through
the date hereof), except that the Redacted Fee Letters have been redacted with
respect to certain fees and similar arrangements which do not affect the
conditionality of the Debt Financing; (iv) except for the Financing
Commitments in the form delivered pursuant to _Section 4.9 (a)_ there are no
side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements relating to the
Financing or the Financing Commitments, including any that could affect the
availability of the Financing, to which Purchaser, Parent, Sponsor or any of
their respective Affiliates is a party; and (v) assuming the satisfaction of
the conditions to Parents obligation to consummate the Offer and/or the
Merger (as applicable), to the Knowledge of the Purchaser or Parent, no event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to (x) constitute a default or breach on the part of
Purchaser, Parent or Sponsor (solely with respect to the Equity Financing),
and (in the case of the Debt Commitment Letter only, to the Knowledge
of Purchaser and Parent) any of the other parties thereto, under any term of
the Financing Commitment, (y) result in a failure of any condition of the
Financing Commitments, or (z) result in any portion of the Financing
contemplated thereby to be unavailable. Purchaser and Parent have fully paid
any and all commitment fees or other fees or deposits required by the
Financing Commitments to be paid on or before the date hereof. Assuming the
satisfaction of the conditions to Parents obligation to consummate the Offer
and/or the Merger (as applicable), the aggregate net proceeds of the Financing
will be sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Purchasers and Parents
obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the Offer Price in
respect of each share of Company Common Stock validly tendered and accepted
for payment in the Offer and payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 2.8_, all amounts to be paid pursuant to _Section
2.6_, the payment of all associated costs and expenses of the Offer and the
Merger (including any repayment or refinancing of Indebtedness of the Company
required in connection therewith) and the payment of all other
amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related
to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the
Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments. As
of the date

 



37  hereof, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to Parents obligation
to consummate the Offer and/or the Merger (as applicable), neither Purchaser
nor Parent has any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Financing will not be satisfied or that the full amount of the Financing will
not be available to Purchaser on the date of the Closing.

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 4.9(c)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter,
neither Purchaser nor Parent is a party to any Contract which expressly limits
or restricts the ability of any Person to provide debt financing for other
potential purchasers of the Company.

4.10 Guarantee. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has
delivered to the Company the Guarantee duly executed by the Guarantor with
respect to certain matters on the terms specified therein. The Guarantee is in
full force and effect and constitutes a valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of the Guarantor party thereto in favor of the Company, and no
event has occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default on the part of the Guarantor under such
Guarantee. 

4.11 Solvency. Neither Purchaser nor Parent is entering into this Agreement
with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future
creditors of the Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries. After giving effect
to the Transactions and the Debt Financing, including the Financing, any

share of Company Common Stock validly tendered and accepted for payment in the
Offer and payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
2.8_, all amounts to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.6_, the payment of all
associated costs and expenses of the Offer and the Merger (including any
repayment or refinancing of Indebtedness of the Company required in connection
therewith) and the payment of all other amounts required to be paid
in connection with the consummation of the Transactions and to allow
Purchaser and Parent to perform all of their obligations under this Agreement,
and assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to Purchasers and Parents
obligations to consummate the Offer and/or the Merger (as applicable) and the
accuracy of the representations and warranties in _Article III_ , the
Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of and after the Effective Time. For
the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ " means that, as of any
date of determination and with respect to any Person: (a) the fair value of
the assets of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, is
greater than the total amount of liabilities, including contingent
liabilities, of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, (b)
the present fair saleable value of the assets of such Person and its
Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, is not less than the amount that will
be required to pay the probable liability of such Person and its Subsidiaries,
on a consolidated basis, on their debts and liabilities as they become
absolute and matured, (c) such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated
basis, are not engaged in business or a transaction, and are not about to
engage in business or a transaction, for which such Persons and its
Subsidiaries assets, on a consolidated basis, would constitute unreasonably
small capital, and (d) such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated
basis, do not intend to, and do not believe that they will, incur debts or
liabilities beyond their ability to pay such debts and liabilities as they
mature; provided, however, for the purposes hereof, the amount of any
contingent liability at any time shall be computed as the amount that, in
light of all of the facts and circumstances existing at such time, represents
the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured
liability (irrespective of whether such contingent liabilities meet the
criteria for accrual under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 5).

 



38 4.12 Ownership of Company Common Stock. None of Purchaser or Parent or any of
their "affiliates" or "associates" is, or at any time during the last three
(3) years has been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company as defined in

5.3 Proxy Statement; Company Stockholder Meeting.

obligations under _Section 5.3(c)_, the Company shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days) after
the date hereof, prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement in
preliminary form (collectively, as amended or supplemented, the " _Proxy
Statement_ ") that will be provided to the Companys stockholders in
connection with the solicitation of proxies for use at the meeting of the
Companys stockholders called to vote upon the Merger and other Transactions
(the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ "). Parent and its counsel shall be
given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement
prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and the Company shall
give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent
and its counsel. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of
any comments from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) or any request from the
SEC (or the staff of the SEC) for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement, and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between
the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC (or the
staff of the SEC), on the other hand, and the Company agrees to provide
Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to comment on and respond
thereto, and to give reasonable and good faith consideration to any such
comments made by Parent and its counsel prior to responding to any
comments or requests of the SEC or its staff. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable and
to resolve any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect to
the Proxy Statement.

 

(b) If the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders is
required by applicable Law to consummate the Merger, then the Company shall
promptly after the Proxy Statement Clearance Date (and in any event within
three (3) Business Days of

 



42  clearance), (x) establish a record date (which record date shall be as soon
as reasonably practicable) for and give notice of the Company Stockholders
Meeting for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement, and
(y) cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as of
the record date established for the Company Stockholders Meeting (the date the
company elects to take such action or is required to take such action, the "
_Proxy Date_ "). The Company shall duly call, convene and hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Proxy
Date (but, subject to the following sentence, in no event later than 35
calendar days following the date the Proxy Statement is mailed to the
Companys stockholders). Any adjournment or postponement of the Company
Stockholders Meeting shall require the prior written consent of Parent other
than (i) in the case it is required to allow reasonable additional time for
the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the SEC
or its staff has instructed the Company is necessary under applicable Law and
for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by
the Companys stockholders prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting; (ii) if
insufficient Shares are present in person or by proxy prior to the start
of the Company Stockholders Meeting to constitute a quorum; or (iii) if, as
of the scheduled date and time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, the
Company shall not have received an aggregate number of proxies voting for the
adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions, which have not been
withdrawn, such that the condition in _Section 6.1(a)_ will be satisfied at
such Company Stockholders Meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may
require the Company to adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting
one (1) time (for a period of not more than 30 calendar days but not past 2
Business Days prior to the Outside Date), unless prior to such adjournment the
Company shall have received an aggregate number of proxies voting for the
adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions, which have not been
withdrawn, such that the condition in _Section 6.1(a)_ will be satisfied at
such Company Stockholders Meeting. Once the Company has established a record
date for the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall not change such
record date or establish a different record date for the Company Stockholders
Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent, unless required to do so
by applicable Law or the Company Charter Documents. If at any time prior to
the Effective Time any event or circumstance relating to the Company or Parent
or any of the Companys or Parents Subsidiaries, or their respective
officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent,
respectively, which, pursuant to the Exchange Act, should be set forth in an
amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, such party shall promptly
inform the others. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agree to
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement
which shall have become false or misleading.

(c) Parent shall furnish to the Company all information concerning Purchaser
and Parent required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement and shall
otherwise assist and cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the
Proxy Statement and the resolution of comments from the SEC (or the staff of
the SEC). Except with respect to any amendments filed in connection with a
Change in Company Board Recommendation, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, the
Company shall provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and to propose comments on such document or response and give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any such comments made by Parent
and its counsel prior to responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff
of the SEC).

 



43 (d) Unless a Change in Company Board Recommendation shall have been effected,
the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions and shall ensure that all
proxies solicited in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting are
solicited in compliance with all applicable Laws and all rules of Nasdaq. At
any Company Stockholders Meeting, Parent shall ensure that all Company Common
Stock owned beneficially or of record by Purchaser, Parent or any of Parents
other Affiliates, or any shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which
Purchaser or Parent or any of Parents other Affiliates holds a valid proxy,
will be voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, following the Offer Closing and the
exercise, if any, of the Top-Up Option, Purchaser and Parent and Purchasers
other Affiliates shall own at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock, the parties hereto shall take all necessary
and appropriate action, including with respect to the transfer to Purchaser
of any shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent or its Affiliates, to
cause the Merger to become effective immediately following the Offer Closing
without the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Section 253 of
the DGCL.

5.4 No Solicitation by the Company; Other Offers.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing
until 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the day that is thirty (30) days
following the date of this Agreement (the " _Go-Shop Period End Date_ ") the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives shall
have the right (acting under the direction of the Company Board or a committee
thereof) to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, facilitate and
encourage any Acquisition Proposals, including by way of providing access to
non-public information pursuant to (but only pursuant to) one or more
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements; and (ii) enter into, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in
or facilitate any such discussions or negotiations or any effort or attempt to
make any Acquisition Proposal. Any material non-public information concerning
the Company or any Company Subsidiary provided or made available to any third
party given such access shall, to the extent not previously provided to
Purchaser or Parent, be provided or made available to Purchaser or Parent
prior to or concurrently with providing it to such third party. In addition,
the Company shall not provide any commercially sensitive nonpublic information
to any competitor of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in connection
with the actions contemplated by this _Section 5.4_, except in a manner that
the Company determines is reasonably designed to protect the Company if no
Company Acquisition Agreement is agreed to with such Person.

(b) From and after the Go-Shop Period End Date, until the earlier of the
Effective Time and the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 7.1_, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not, and shall
cause its and their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly
through another Person, except as otherwise provided below in this _Section
5.4_: (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage any proposal or inquiry
that constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal;
(ii) other than informing Persons of the provisions contained in this _Section
5.4_, enter into, continue or 

 



44  participate in any discussions or any negotiations regarding any Acquisition
Proposal; (iii) approve, endorse or recommend an Acquisition Proposal or any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or other Contract contemplating
an Acquisition Proposal or requiring the Company to abandon or terminate its
obligations under this Agreement; or (iv) resolve, propose or agree to do any
of the foregoing. From and after the Go-Shop Period End Date, the Company
shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
discussions or negotiations with any Person previously conducted with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal and request any such Person promptly return or
destroy all confidential information concerning the Company and any Company
Subsidiary. Notwithstanding the commencement of the obligations of the Company
under this _Section 5.4(b)_, between the Go-Shop Period End Date and the
date that is 15 days following the Go-Shop Period End Date, the Company may
continue to engage with, and provide information as contemplated by this
Agreement to, a Qualified Go-Shop Bidder which made a Qualified Acquisition
Proposal on or before the Go-Shop Period End Date (and not subsequently
withdrawn), including with respect to any amended or revised Qualified
Acquisition Proposal submitted by such Qualified Go-Shop Bidder.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.4_ to the contrary, at any
time prior to the earlier of the Acceptance Time and the receipt of the
Required Company Stockholder Vote, in response to an unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal (for the purpose of clarity, an Acquisition Proposal from
a Person that discussed or negotiated an Acquisition Proposal under _Section
5.4(a)_ shall not constitute an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal) that the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor) constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal, the Company may, upon a good faith determination by the Company
Board (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel) that failure to take
such action would be a violation of the Company Boards fiduciary duties
under applicable Law: (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and
such Persons Representatives);  _ _provided__ , __however__ , that the
Company and such Person enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and
such Acquisition Proposal was not solicited in violation of this _Section
5.4_; and __provided further__ , that any material non-public information
concerning the Company or any Company Subsidiary provided or made available to
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal shall, to the extent not
previously provided to Purchaser or Parent, be provided or made available to
Purchaser or Parent prior to or concurrently with providing it to such Person
making such Acquisition Proposal; and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its
Representatives) regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

(d) The Company shall promptly advise Parent in writing, in no event later
than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal and
shall indicate the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and
the material terms and conditions of any proposal or offer or the nature of
any inquiries or contacts, and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably
informed of all material developments affecting the status and the material
terms of any such Acquisition Proposal.

 



45 (e) The Company Board shall not: (A) fail to make, withhold, withdraw,
amend, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, or publicly propose
to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent,
the Company Board Recommendation (including any failure to include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9, when mailed); (B) adopt, approve,
recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable (or make any public
announcement of its decision to adopt, approve, recommend or otherwise declare
advisable) the adoption of any Acquisition Proposal; or (C) with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal which is publicly known, fail to recommend against
such Acquisition Proposal within ten (10) Business Days after Parent so
requests in writing (each such foregoing action or failure to act in clauses
(A) through (C) being referred to as a " _Change in Company Board
Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) no action permitted to
be taken by the Company or its Representatives in accordance with the last
sentence of _Section 5.4(b)_ shall be deemed a "Change in Company Board
Recommendation", (y) the determination (but not the adoption, approval,
recommendation or endorsement) by the Company Board that an Acquisition
Proposal submitted by a Qualified Go-Shop Bidder on or before the Go-Shop
Period End Date is a Qualified Acquisition Proposal shall not be deemed a
"Change in Company Board Recommendation", and (z) the Company Board may, at
any time prior to the earlier of the Acceptance Time and the Required Company
Stockholder Vote, take any of the actions set forth in _Sections
5.4(e)(i)-(iii)_ below; __provided__ ,  _ _however__ , that prior to taking
any such action, the Company complies with _Section 5.4(f)_ of this
Agreement:

(i) if there is an Intervening Event, effect a Change in Company Board
Recommendation if the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would
be a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

(ii) effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation in response to an
Acquisition Proposal if the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would
be a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and the Company
Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Companys financial
advisor, that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and

(iii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(i)_ (and, if
applicable, enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement), if the Company
receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board concludes in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys financial advisor, constitutes a
Superior Proposal and the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to enter into such
definitive agreement would be a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 5.4(e)_,
the Company shall not be entitled to: (i) make a Change in Company Board
Recommendation pursuant to _Section 5.4(e)(i)_ or _Section 5.4(e)(ii)_;
or (ii) terminate this Agreement (and, if applicable, enter into any Company
Acquisition Agreement) pursuant to _Section 5.4(e)(iii)_, unless in all such
instances: (A) the Company shall have first provided prior written notice
to Parent that it is prepared to (i) make a Change in Company Board
Recommendation (a " _Recommendation Change Notice_ "), or (ii) terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(i)_ in response to a Superior Proposal (a
" _Superior Proposal Notice_ "), which notice shall, if the basis for the
proposed action by the Company Board is not related to a Superior Proposal,

 



46  contain a description of the Intervening Event giving rise to such proposed
action or, if the basis for the proposed action by the Company Board is a
Superior Proposal, contain a description of the material terms and conditions
of such Superior Proposal, including a copy of the Company Acquisition
Agreement in the form to be entered into, a copy of any financing commitments
(including Redacted Fee Letters redacted to comply with confidentiality
provisions) related thereto and the identity of the Person or Persons who made
the Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that the delivery of
such notice shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a Change in
Company Board Recommendation); and (B) Parent does not make, within three (3)
Business Days after the receipt of such notice, a binding proposal that would,
in the good-faith judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with
outside counsel and, in the case of a Superior Proposal, and the Companys
financial advisor), cause the Intervening Event to no longer form the basis
for the Company Board to effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation or
cause the offer previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal, as the case may be (it being understood that,
in the case of a Superior Proposal by a Qualified Go-Shop Bidder, if Parent
makes, within three (3) Business Days after the receipt of such notice, a
binding and fully committed proposal that would, in the good-faith judgment of
the Company Board (after consultation with outside counsel and the Companys
financial advisor), cause the offer by such Qualified Go-Shop Bidder
previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal, and such Qualified Go-Shop Bidder does not make a new Qualified
Acquisition Proposal within five (5) Business Days after the
public announcement of such binding and fully committed proposal by Parent,
the Company may no longer, at any time, enter into an Acquisition Transaction
with such Qualified Go-Shop Bidder). Any material changes with respect to such
Intervening Event mentioned above, or material changes to the terms of such
Superior Proposal, as the case may be, occurring prior to the Companys
effecting a Change in Company Board Recommendation or terminating this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.1(i)_ shall require the Company to provide
to Parent a new Recommendation Change Notice or Superior Proposal Notice and a
new three (3) Business Day period.

 

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the Companys
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; or (ii) making
any disclosure to the Companys stockholders with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal if, in the good-faith judgment of the Company Board, after
consultation with outside counsel, failure to so disclose would be a violation
of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; __provided__ , __however__ ,
that this _Section 5.4(g)_ shall not affect the obligations of the Company
and the Company Board and the rights of Purchaser and Parent under _Section
5.4(e)_ and  _Section 5.4(f)_ of this Agreement, to the extent applicable to
such disclosure (it being understood that neither any "stop, look and listen"
letter or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act, nor any accurate disclosure of factual information
(other than the Company or the Company Board taking any action set forth in
_Section 5.4(e)_ and _Section 5.4(f)_ of this Agreement) to the
Companys stockholders that is required to be made to such stockholders under
applicable Law or in satisfaction of the Company Boards fiduciary duties or
applicable Law, shall be deemed to be a Change in Company Board
Recommendation).

to be made, in cooperation with the other parties hereto and to the extent
applicable and as promptly as practicable (and in any event within five (5)

other party in connection with any investigation by any Governmental Body; (C)
furnish to each other all information required for any filing, form,
declaration, notification, registration and notice subject to advice of such
partys antitrust counsel; and (D) take all other actions reasonably necessary
consistent with this _Section 5.5_ to cause the expiration or termination of
the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or any foreign antitrust,
competition or similar Laws. In connection with the foregoing, each party
hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to: (w) whenever possible, each
party shall give the other party reasonable prior notice of any communication
with, and any proposed understanding or agreement with, any Governmental Body
regarding any filings, forms, declarations, notifications, registrations or
notices, and permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider
in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any proposed
communication, understanding or agreement with any Governmental Body with
respect to the Merger, subject to advice of such partys antitrust counsel;
(x) where reasonably practical, none of the parties hereto shall independently
participate in any meeting or conversation, or engage in any substantive
conversation with any Governmental Body in respect of any filings or
inquiry without giving the other party prior notice of the meeting or
conversation and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Body, the opportunity
to attend and/or participate; (y) if one party is prohibited by applicable Law
or by the applicable Governmental Body from participating in or attending any
meetings, conferences or conversations, the attending party shall keep the
other reasonably apprised with respect thereto; and (z) the parties hereto
shall consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any
information or proposals submitted in connection with proceedings under or
relating to any antitrust Laws. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company
and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts: (1) to avoid the entry
of any Restraint; and (2) to eliminate every impediment under any antitrust
Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Body so as to enable the
Effective Time to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event,
not later than the Outside Date).

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Purchaser, Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party or parties hereto in
doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Law to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using
reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary actions or non-actions,
waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from all Governmental
Bodies and make all necessary registrations, declarations and filings with all
Governmental Bodies, that are necessary to consummate the Offer and the
Merger; __provided_ , _however__ , that all obligations of the Company,
Purchaser and Parent relating to the Financing shall be governed exclusively
by _Section 5.13_, and not this _Section 5.5_.

 



48 5.6 Public Announcements. The initial press release with respect to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Except as permitted in
accordance with _Section 5.4_, Parent and the Company shall thereafter
consult with each other before issuing, and, to the extent practicable, give
each other the reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press
release or other public statements with respect to the Offer and the Merger
and consider in good faith the views of the other party, and shall not issue
any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities
exchange or trading market on which securities of Parent or the Company are
listed, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement
shall use reasonable best efforts to allow the other party or parties
hereto reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance
of such issuance (it being understood that the final form and content of any
such release or announcement, as well as the timing of any such release or
announcement, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party).

5.7 Director and Officer Liability.

 

(a) From and after the Offer Closing Date, Purchaser and Parent shall and
shall cause the Company, Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
applicable Subsidiaries, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, to: (i)
for six (6) years after the earlier to occur of: (i) the Offer Closing and
(ii) the Merger Closing, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, against any
costs or expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses and disbursements),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, and provide advancement of
expenses to, all past and present directors and officers of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries (in all of their capacities) to the same extent such
persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of
the Agreement Date by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries pursuant
to the Company Charter Documents, other charter and organizational documents
of the Companys Subsidiaries and the indemnification agreements in existence
on the date hereof and as set forth in Section _ 5.7_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter with any directors and officers of the Company and any of
the Company Subsidiaries subject to the Surviving Corporations receipt of an
undertaking by such director or officer to repay such legal and other fees and
expenses paid in advance if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such director
or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under applicable Law; and (ii)
include and cause to be maintained in effect in the Companys or the Surviving
Corporations (or any successors), as the case may be, charter and bylaws
for a period of six (6) years after the Offer Closing Date, the current
provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of
officers, directors and employees and advancement of expenses contained
in the Company Charter Documents. If the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, or any of their respective successors or
assigns (A) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporations or
entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger; or (B) shall transfer all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity,
then and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section
5.7_.

 



49 (b) The Company shall, at or prior to the earlier to occur of: (i) the
Offer Closing and (ii) the Merger Closing, purchase a six (6) year "tail"
prepaid policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the indemnified
parties, or any other person entitled to the benefit of this  _Section 5.7_,
as applicable, than the existing directors and officers liability (and
fiduciary) insurance maintained by the Company, covering, without limitation,
the Offer and the Merger and Purchaser and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain such "tail" prepaid policy in full force and effect
for six (6) years after the Offer Closing Date.

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to assume, honor and fulfill all obligations
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to any written
indemnification agreements with the indemnified parties, or any other person
entitled to the benefit of this _Section 5.7_, as applicable.

 

5.8 Notification of Certain Events. Each of the Company and Parent shall, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, notify the other: 

(a) upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by it in this
Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any
failure of such Person to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement; __provided__ ,  _ _however__ , that no such notification
shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warrant of such
party set forth herein or the conditions to the obligations of the other party
to consummate the Merger, or the remedies available to the parties hereto,
and __provided_ _further_ ,_ that failure to give any such notice shall not be
treated as a breach of covenant for the purposes of _Section 1(d)(iii)_ of
_Annex A_ or  _Section 7.1(f)_ or _Section 7.1(h)_ of this Agreement, as
applicable;

(b) to the extent the Company has Knowledge of such notice or communication
or the Parent has Knowledge of such notice or communication, as the case may
be, of any written communication from any Person alleging that the consent of
such Person is or may be required in connection with the Offer or the Merger;

(c) of any communication from any Governmental Body related to the Offer
or the Merger;

(d) of any proceedings commenced and served upon it or any Company
Subsidiaries, or to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing

any Section of this Agreement; and any change that would have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

5.9 Shareholder Litigation. Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the
date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_: (a) the
Company shall promptly advise Parent in writing of any shareholder litigation
against the Company or its directors relating to this Agreement, the Offer or
the Merger and shall keep Parent fully informed regarding any such
shareholder litigation; and (b) the Company shall control such defense and
this _Section 5.9_ shall

 



50  not give Parent the right to direct such defense; __provided__ , __that__
the Company shall consult with Parent regarding the defense, settlement or
prosecution of any shareholder litigation; and, __provided__ , __further__ ,
that (x) neither the Company nor any of its Representatives or any Company
Subsidiary shall compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree
to compromise, settle, or come to an arrangement regarding any shareholder
litigation or consent to the same unless Parent shall have consented in
writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and (y)
after the earlier of the Acceptance Time and the Required Company Stockholder
Vote, the Company shall, if requested by Parent, use its reasonable best
efforts to settle any unresolved shareholder litigation in accordance with
Parents direction so long as such settlement is conditioned on the
consummation of the Merger, does not require the payment of any amount prior
to the consummation of the Merger and does not require modification of the
terms of this Agreement.

 

5.10 Rule 16b-3. Purchaser, Parent and the Company shall take all such steps
as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by _Article II_ ,
and any other dispositions of equity securities (including derivative
securities) of the Company or acquisitions of equity securities of Parent by
each individual who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

5.11 Employee Matters.

(a) For purposes of this  _Section 5.11_, (i) the term _"_ _Covered
Employees_ " shall mean employees who are actively employed by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary at the Effective Time; and (ii) the term "
_Continuation Period_ " shall mean the period beginning at the Effective Time
and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time.

(b) During the Continuation Period, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or any Company Subsidiary to, provide to the Covered Employees for
so long as such Covered Employees remain employees of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Company Subsidiary during the Continuation Period,
compensation (such term to include salary, annual cash bonus opportunities,
commissions and severance) and benefits that are in the aggregate, no less
favorable than the compensation (excluding any equity or equity-based
compensation (for purposes of clarity, including restricted cash units),
retention, change of control, transaction or similar bonuses, and nonqualified
deferred compensation) and benefits (excluding, any defined benefit pension
plan or retiree medical benefits) being provided to Covered Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) In the event any Covered Employee first becomes eligible to participate
under any employee benefit plan, program, policy, or arrangement of the
Parent or Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries ("
_Parent Employee Benefit Plan_ ") following the Effective Time, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, for Covered Employees who become
eligible during the calendar year including the Effective Time: (i) waive any
preexisting condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to any Covered
Employee under any Parent Employee Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, or
vision benefits to the same extent such limitation would have been waived or
satisfied under the Company Employee Benefit Plan the Covered Employee 

 



51  participated in immediately prior to coverage under the Parent Employee
Benefit Plan; and (ii) provide each Covered Employee with credit for any
copayments and deductibles paid prior to the Covered Employees coverage
under any Parent Employee Benefit Plan during the calendar year in which such
amount was paid, to the same extent such credit was given under the employee
benefit plan Covered Employee participated in immediately prior to coverage
under the Parent Employee Benefit Plan, in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under the Parent Employee Benefit
Plan.

(d) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall recognize, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries to recognize, all
service of each Covered Employee prior to the Effective Time, to the Company
(or any predecessor entities of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries) for vesting and eligibility purposes (but not for benefit
accrual purposes, except for vacation and severance, as applicable) to the
same extent as such Covered Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time,
to credit for such service under any similar Company Plan in which such
Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time; for the
avoidance of doubt, service of each Covered Employee prior to the Effective
Time shall not be recognized for the purpose of any entitlement to participate
in, or receive benefits with respect to, any (i) non-elective employer
contributions under any plan of Parent under Section 401(k) of the Code; or
(ii) Parent retiree medical program in which any Covered Employee participates
after the Effective Time. In no event shall anything contained in this
_Section 5.11(d)_ result in any duplication of benefits for the same period
of service.

(e) Nothing in this _Section 5.11_, express or implied, shall (i) be
construed to limit the right of Parent, the Company, or any of the Company
Subsidiaries (including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation) to amend or terminate any Company Plan or other employee
benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or termination is permitted by the
terms of the applicable plan, (ii) be construed to require Parent, the
Company, or any of the Company Subsidiaries (including, following the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation), to maintain any specific
compensation or benefit plan, program arrangement, policy or Contract, (iii)
be construed to require Parent, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
(including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) to
retain the employment of any particular Person for any fixed period of time
following the Effective Time, (iv) constitute an amendment to any Company Plan
or any employee benefit or compensation plan of Parent or any of its
Affiliates, (v) give any third party, including any employee of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, any third-party beneficiary right or right to enforce
the provisions of this _Section 5.11_, or (vi) create any obligations of the
parties to this Agreement with respect to any employee benefit or compensation
plan of Parent, the Company, or any of the Company Subsidiaries (including,
following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation). The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this _Section 5.11_ shall
not create any right in any Covered Employee or other Person to any continued
employment with the Surviving Corporation.

 

5.12 Confidentiality. The parties hereto acknowledge that Centerbridge
Associates II, L.P. and the Company have previously executed a
confidentiality agreement, dated as of March 2, 2012 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), which Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with its terms, except as expressly modified herein
and except as set forth in Section _ 5.12_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed terminated as of the
Effective Time.

 



52 5.13 Financing.

 

(a) Each of Purchaser and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, consummate and
obtain the proceeds of the Financing on the terms and conditions described in
the Financing Commitments, including using their respective reasonable best
efforts to: (i) enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto which
are subject to no additional conditionality (other than conditionality that
would be permitted pursuant to _Section 5.13(b)_) than, and are otherwise
on substantially the terms and conditions contained in the Financing
Commitments, (ii) satisfy, or use reasonable best efforts to cause their
Representatives to satisfy, on a timely basis all conditions applicable to,
and within the control of, Parent or Purchaser or their respective
Representatives in such definitive agreements and (iii) upon the satisfaction
of the conditions thereto and to Purchasers obligation to consummate the
Offer or the Merger, as applicable, consummate the Debt Financing and the
Equity Financing, at the Offer Closing (with respect to amounts required to
consummate the Offer) and the Merger Closing (with respect to amounts required
to consummate the Merger) and, upon the satisfaction of the conditions
thereto and to Purchasers obligation to consummate the Offer or the Merger,
as applicable, cause the lenders who are party to the Debt Financing
Commitments and any other person providing Financing to fund the Financing at
the Offer Closing (with respect to amounts required to consummate the Offer)
and the Merger Closing (with respect to amounts required to consummate the
Merger).

(b) Purchaser and Parent shall not agree to any amendments or modifications
to, or grant any waivers of, any condition or other provision or remedy under
the Financing Commitments or Financing Agreements without the prior written
consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), to the extent such amendments, modifications or waivers would
reduce the aggregate amount of aggregate cash proceeds available from the
Financing to fund the amounts required to be paid by Purchaser or Parent under
this Agreement (as compared to the amount of such aggregate proceeds
contemplated under the Financing Commitments as in effect on the date hereof)
to an amount committed below the amount that is required to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser and Parent shall not agree without
the prior written consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) to impose new or additional conditions precedent or
otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions precedent to funding
of the Financing Commitments other than immaterial customary conditions which
are likely to be satisfied and which do not (i) prevent or delay the funding
of the Financing or (ii) make the timely funding of the Financing or
satisfaction of the conditions precedent to obtaining the Financing (taking
into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) less likely to
occur. Neither Purchaser nor Parent shall release or consent to the
termination of the obligations of the lenders and other Persons under the
Financing Commitments or Financing Agreements, except for (1) assignments
and replacements of an individual lender in accordance with the terms of the
syndication provisions of the Debt Commitment Letter with respect to the Debt
Financing, or in accordance with the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter
or  _Section 5.13(c)_ with respect to the Equity Financing or (2) in
connection with any amendment, modification, waiver or

 



53  replacement thereof otherwise permitted hereby. For purposes of
clarification, the foregoing shall not prohibit Purchaser and Parent from
amending the Debt Commitment Letter to add or replace lender(s), lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities and their
respective Affiliates as parties thereto or in any other manner consistent
with this Agreement as a party thereto.

 

(c) Except as set forth in Section _ 5.13(c)_ of the Parent Disclosure
Letter, in no event shall Purchaser or Parent (i) award any agent, broker,
investment banker, financial advisor or other firm or person any financial
advisory role on an exclusive basis in connection with the Merger or the Offer
or (ii) prohibit or seek to prohibit any bank or investment bank or other
potential provider of debt or equity financing, from providing or seeking to
provide financing or financial advisory services to any Person in connection
with a transaction relating to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or in
connection with the Offer _or_ the Merger.

(d) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable
in the manner or from the sources contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter
or Financing Agreements (other than as a result of the Companys breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement),
(i) Parent shall promptly so notify the Company and (ii) Purchaser and Parent
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, and
to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect
to, alternative debt financing from the same or alternative financial
institutions in an amount sufficient to consummate the Transactions (or
replace any unavailable portion of the Financing) on terms and conditions that
are not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Purchaser and Parent
than those in the Financing Commitments that such alternative debt financing
would replace (taking into account any flex provisions), as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event; __provided__ , __that__
neither Purchaser nor Parent shall be required to execute any new debt
commitment letter or arrange for such alternative debt financing on terms and
conditions that are materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Purchaser

Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_, Section _7.1(h)_ or
_Section 7.1(j)_ even if the Financing Proceeds Condition has not been
satisfied).

(d) In the event that this Agreement has been terminated by either Parent or
the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_, then the Company shall, following
receipt of an invoice detailing Parents reasonably documented out-of-pocket
fees and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses)
actually incurred by Parent, Purchaser and their Affiliates on or prior to
the termination of this Agreement in connection with the Transactions as shown
on invoices therefor, promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business
Days) following such receipt pay such fees and expenses; provided, however,
in no event shall the Company or any Company Subsidiary have any obligation to
pay more than $6,000,000 in the aggregate of such fees and expenses. Payment
of such fees and expenses by the Company, if any, shall be made by wire
transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent.

(e) All payments under this _Section 7.3_ shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the party
to whom payment is owed.

(f) The parties hereto agree that:

(i) Subject to  _Section 8.7_ and notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, each of Parent and Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that its receipt of the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ and _Section 7.3(b)_, and
reimbursement of expenses pursuant to _Section 7.3(d)_, if any, shall, except
in the case of Fraud, constitute the sole and exclusive remedy under this
Agreement of Parent and Purchaser and each of their Affiliates and
Representatives, and the receipt of the Company Termination Fee shall be
deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or
incurred by Parent, Purchaser, each of their Affiliates and Representatives
and any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination
hereof), the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (and the abandonment or termination thereof) or any
matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Purchaser,
their respective Affiliates or Representatives or any other Person shall be
entitled to bring or maintain any Legal Proceeding against the Company or its
Affiliates arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Offer,
the Top-Up Option, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby (or the abandonment or termination 

 



64  thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such termination. Parent shall
not be entitled to specific performance under _Section 8.7_ if the Company
has paid in full, and Parent or Purchaser have accepted, the Company
Termination Fee.

(ii) Subject to _Section 8.7_ and notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, the Company acknowledges and agrees on behalf
of itself, its Affiliates and the Companys stockholders, that the Companys
receipt of the Parent Termination Fee in accordance with  _Section 7.3(c)_,
shall, except in the case of Fraud, constitute the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Company and its Affiliates and each of their Representatives and the
Companys stockholders against Parent, Purchaser, Guarantor, Financing
Sources or any of their respective former, current or future general or
limited partners, shareholders, managers, members, directors, officers or
Affiliates (collectively, the " _Parent Related Parties_ ") for any
loss suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Guaranty, the Offer, the
Top-Up Option, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter,
the Guaranty, the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the Merger or the Transactions,
and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee shall be deemed liquidated
damages for and none of the Parent Related Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions. The Company shall not be entitled to specific performance
under  _Section 8.7_ if Parent has paid in full, and the Company has
accepted, the Parent Termination Fee and in no event shall the Company or its
Affiliates be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance and the Parent Termination Fee; __provided_ , _however__ , and,
for further clarity, in any circumstance where performance by the Parent or
Purchaser of its obligations under this Agreement would relieve Parent of its
obligation to pay the Parent Termination Fee the Company may, in its sole
discretion: (i) seek specific performance pursuant to _Section 8.7(b)_, (ii)
withdraw any claim for specific performance and require payment of the Parent
Termination Fee if entitled to payment of the Parent Termination Fee under
_Section 7.3(c)_, or (iii) if the Company is unable for any reason to obtain
specific performance, require payment of the Parent Termination Fee if
entitled to payment of the Parent Termination Fee under _Section 7.3(c)_.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall (A) any Related Party (as defined in the Equity Commitment Letter, which
excludes, for the avoidance of doubt, Sponsor (as defined in the Equity
Commitment Letter), Parent and Purchaser) have any liability for monetary
damages to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries (whether at law, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, other than Sponsors obligations
under the Guarantee and the Equity Commitment Letter and other than the
obligations of Parent and Purchaser as provided herein, or (B) any former,
current or future general or limited partners, equityholders, directors,
officers, employees, managers, members, Affiliates or agents of the Company
or any Company Subsidiaries have any liability to Sponsor, Parent or Purchaser
or any Related Party for monetary damages (whether at law, in contract, in
tort or otherwise) relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby. In no event shall the Company seek or
obtain, nor shall it permit any of its Representatives to seek or obtain, nor
shall any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or
monetary award against any Related Party with respect to, this Agreement, the
Equity Commitment Letter or the Guarantee or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby (including, any breach by Sponsor, Parent or

 



65  Purchaser), the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any claims or actions under
applicable Law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure, other
than from Parent or Purchaser to the extent expressly provided for in this
Agreement or Sponsor to the extent expressly provided for in the Guarantee or
the Equity Commitment Letter.

 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) neither
the Company nor any of its stockholders, Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, controlling persons or agents shall have any rights or claims
against any Financing Sources or any of their respective former, current or
future general or limited partners, shareholders, managers, members,
directors, officers or Affiliates in connection with this Agreement, the Debt
Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law,
in contract, in tort or otherwise; and (ii) no Financing Source or any of
its respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
shareholders, managers, members, directors, officers or Affiliates have any
liability or obligation to the Company or any of its stockholders, Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, controlling persons or agents relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained
herein shall restrict the ability of the Company to seek specific performance
of Parents or Purchasers obligations hereunder in connection with the Debt
Financing pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 8.7_.

 

(g) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither
the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if
the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails promptly to pay the fee due
pursuant to _Section 7.3_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or
the Company commences litigation that results in an award against the other
party for such fee, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall pay to
the other party its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses) in connection with such litigation, together with interest on
the amount of the applicable fee from the date such payment was required to be
made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as published in _The
Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made.

ARTICLE VIII.

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 

8.1 Amendment or Supplement. At any time prior to the Effective Time, this
Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects, whether
before or after receipt of the Required Company Stockholder Vote, by written
agreement signed by all of the parties hereto; __provided__ , __however__ ,
that following approval of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders,
there shall be no amendment of or change to the provisions of this Agreement
which, pursuant to applicable Law, would require further approval by the
Companys stockholders without receipt of such approval.

 



66 8.2 Extension of Time, Waiver, etc. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
any party may, subject to applicable Law: (a) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of any other party hereto; __provided, however_

Stock (if applicable), no waiver shall be made which would pursuant to
applicable Law require further approval by such holders without obtaining such
further approval; (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or acts of any other party hereto; or (c) to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, waive compliance by the other party with any of the
agreements contained in this Agreement or, except as otherwise provided in the
Agreement, waive any of such partys conditions. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Purchaser or Parent in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver of rights, nor shall
any single or partial exercise of such rights preclude any other or further
exercise of such rights or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party. 

8.3 No Additional Representations; No Survival. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, none of the Company, Purchaser, Parent, their
respective Affiliates or their respective Subsidiaries, stockholders,
controlling Persons or Representatives shall have any liability or
responsibility whatsoever to any other party hereto, its Affiliates or any

state securities Laws or otherwise) based upon any information provided or
made available, or statements made (or any omissions therefrom), to such
party, its Affiliates or any of their respective Subsidiaries, stockholders,
controlling Persons or Representatives, including in respect of the specific
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Article III_ of
this Agreement and in respect of the specific representations and warranties
of Purchaser and Parent set forth in _Article IV_ of this Agreement, except as
and only to the extent expressly set forth in this Agreement with respect to
such representations and warranties, subject to the limitations and
restrictions contained in this Agreement. None of the representations and
warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to
this Agreement shall survive the Expiration Date. This _Section 8.3_ shall
not limit the survival of any covenant or agreement of the parties hereto
contained in this Agreement which by its terms contemplates performance after
the Expiration Date.

8.4 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiary. This Agreement, including
the exhibits and annexes hereto, the Company Disclosure Letter, the documents
and instruments relating to the Offer and the Merger referred to in this
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement,
and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement. This Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to create
any agreement of employment with any person, to confer any rights or remedies
upon any person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary
hereto, except with respect to: (i) the rights of the holders of 2012 Company
Options, 2012 Company RSUs and 2012 Company RCUs described in _Section
2.6(e)_, in each case, on the terms and subject to the conditions hereof; (ii)
the directors and officers of the Company covered by  _Section 5.7_; and

otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the negotiation,

governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflicts of laws. All actions and proceedings (whether at law,
in contract, in tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, the
Offer or the Merger shall be heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware, and the parties irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction
of such court (and, in the case of appeals, the appropriate appellate court
therefrom), in any such action or proceeding and irrevocably waive the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such action or
proceeding. The consents to jurisdiction set forth in this paragraph shall not
constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware
and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph
and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties
hereto. The parties agree that service of any court paper may be made in any
manner as may be provided under the applicable Laws or court rules governing
service of process in such court. The parties hereto agree that a final
judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by applicable Law. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER AT
LAW, IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT.

it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim

its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, controlling persons,
advisors, agents, attorneys or representatives) relating to this Agreement or
the Debt Financing other than in the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of New York, or if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is

District of New York (and the appellate courts thereof).

Agreement or the rights of any of the parties hereunder, the prevailing party
in such action or suit shall be entitled to receive a reasonable sum for its
attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs and expenses incurred in such
action or suit.

 

8.7 Specific Enforcement.

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur for which
monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed by Purchaser or Parent or the
Company, as applicable, in accordance with the terms hereof or are otherwise
breached, and that each party, shall be entitled to specific performance and
the issuance of injunctive and other equitable relief in any such event and
prior to the valid exercise of any termination right by the parties in
accordance with

 



68   _Section 7.1_; __provided__ ; __however__ , that the right of the Company
to seek specific performance to cause Purchaser and Parent to consummate the
Offer Closing or the Merger Closing shall be solely limited to the provisions
of _Section 8.7(b)_ with respect to causing the Equity Financing to be
funded. The parties further agree to waive any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any injunctive or
other equitable relief, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
the parties are entitled at law or in equity.

(b) The right of the Company to obtain an injunction, or other appropriate
form of specific performance or equitable relief, in each case, solely with
respect to causing Parent and Purchaser to cause the Equity Financing to be

subject to the requirements that:

(i) with respect to any funding of the Equity Financing to occur at the Offer
Closing, all of the Offer Conditions shall have been satisfied or waived as of
the expiration of the Offer, and, with respect to any funding of the Equity
Financing to occur at the Merger Closing, all the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.1_ (other than _Section 6.1(d)_, to the extent the Offer shall
have terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) and _Section
6.2_ would have been satisfied if the Merger Closing were to have occurred at
such time (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied
by actions taken at the Merger Closing, each of which shall be capable of
being satisfied at the Merger Closing);

(ii) the Debt Financing (or, in the case alternative debt financing has been
obtained in accordance with _Section 5.13(d)_ for all the Debt Financing,
such alternative debt financing) has been funded or would be funded in
accordance with the terms thereof at the Offer Closing or the Merger Closing,
as applicable, if the Equity Financing is funded at the Offer Closing or the
Merger Closing, as applicable; and

(iii) the Marketing Period has ended and the Company has irrevocably confirmed
to Parent in writing that (A) all conditions in _Section 6.1_ and _Section
6.3_ have been satisfied or that it is willing to waive any such open
conditions, (B) if specific performance is granted and (C) if the Equity
Financing and the Debt Financing were funded, the Merger Closing would occur.

 

8.8 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in
whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior
written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except that
Purchaser may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates or,

the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

 ANNEX A

CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER

Capitalized terms used in this _Annex A_ and not otherwise defined herein
will have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement and Plan of Merger to
which it is attached (the " _Agreement_ ").

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement, Purchaser shall
not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Purchaser to,
accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the
SEC (including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to the
obligation of Purchaser to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after
termination or withdrawal of the Offer)), to pay for any Shares
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to any then-scheduled
Expiration Date in connection with the Offer if, immediately prior to the
then-scheduled Expiration Date:

(a) any waiting period (and extensions thereof) applicable to the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) under the
HSR Act shall not have expired or been terminated;

(b) there shall have not been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior
to the Expiration Date that number of Shares which, together with (without
duplication of Shares) any Shares then owned, directly or indirectly, by
Purchaser, Parent and any other Subsidiaries of Parent, collectively
represents as of the Expiration Date the sum of at least 83% of the Shares
then outstanding (the " _Minimum Condition_ ");

(c) Parent (either directly or through its Subsidiaries) shall not have
received the proceeds of the Debt Financing (or any alternative debt
financing) and/or the lenders party to the Debt Commitment Letter (or a new
commitment letter for any alternative debt financing) shall have confirmed to
Parent or Purchaser that the Debt Financing (or any alternative debt
financing) will be available at the Offer Closing in an amount sufficient to
consummate the Offer Closing and the Merger Closing on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (or a new commitment
letter for any alternative debt financing) (" _Financing Proceeds Condition_
"); and

(d) any of the following conditions shall have occurred and be continuing as
of the then scheduled Expiration Date:

(i) there shall be any Restraint in effect enjoining or otherwise preventing
or prohibiting the making of the Offer or the consummation of the Merger or
the Offer;

 

(ii) The representations and warranties of the Company (a) set forth in
_Section 3.2_ (other than for immaterial deviations thereof), _Section
3.3(a)_, _Section 3.3(b)_, _Section 3.9_, _Section 3.11_ and _Section
3.21_ shall not be true and correct in all respects as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the expiration of the Offer as though made as of the
expiration of the Offer, (b) set forth in _Section 3.6_ shall not be true and
correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of 

 



73  the expiration of the Offer as though made as of the expiration of the Offer
without disregarding the "Company Material Adverse Effect" qualification set
forth therein and (c) set forth in this Agreement, other than those described
in clauses (a) and (b) above, shall not be true and correct (disregarding all
qualifications or limitations as to "materiality", "Company Material Adverse
Effect" and words of similar import set forth therein) as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the expiration of the Offer as though made as of the
expiration of the Offer, except, in the case of this clause (c), where the
failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct
would not have a Material Adverse Effect; __provided__ in each case that
representations and warranties made as of a specific date shall be required to
be so true and correct (subject to such qualifications) as of such date only.
Parent shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by
the chief executive officer or chief financial officer thereof to such effect;

 

(iii) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply in all material
respects with its obligations or covenants under the Agreement and such
failure to perform or comply with such obligations or covenants shall not have
been cured prior to the Expiration Date;

(iv) since the Agreement Date, a Company Material Adverse Effect shall have
occurred;

(v) there is a pending Legal Proceeding by a Governmental Body challenging or
seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Transactions;

 

(vi) in the event that the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares is necessary
to ensure that Parent or Purchaser reaches the Short-Form Threshold
immediately after the Acceptance Time, the Top-Up Option Shares available to
be issued to Purchaser, together with the shares of Company Common Stock
validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn, are
insufficient for Purchaser to reach the Short-Form Threshold; or

(v) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

For purposes of determining whether the Minimum Condition and the condition
set forth in  _Section 1(b)_ above have been satisfied, Purchaser and Parent
shall have the right to include or exclude for purposes of its determination
thereof Shares tendered in the Offer pursuant to guaranteed delivery
procedures.

 

The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the
rights and obligations of Purchaser and Parent to extend, terminate or modify
the Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Purchaser and Parent
and, subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and applicable Law,
may be waived by Purchaser or Parent, in whole or in part at any time and from
time to time prior to the Expiration Date in the 

 



74  sole discretion of Purchaser or Parent (other than the Minimum Condition,
which may be waived by Purchaser and Parent only with the prior written
consent of the Company). The failure by Purchaser or Parent at any time to
exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such
right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be
asserted at any time and from time to time, subject to the applicable rules
and regulations of the SEC.

employees of the Corporation or its subsidiaries. No amendment or repeal of
this _Article Tenth_ shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or
alleged liability of any officer, director or stockholder of the Corporation
for or with respect to any opportunities of which such officer, director or
stockholder becomes aware prior to such amendment or repeal.
