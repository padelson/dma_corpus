Class B Common Stock was converted pursuant to the Class B Conversion)
shall be consolidated into a fraction of a share of Bishop Common Stock equal
to the Bishop Share Consolidation Ratio. Pursuant to the Amended Bishop
Charter, in the event that, as a result of the Reverse Split, a stockholder of
Bishop would hold a fractional share of Bishop Common Stock (after
aggregating all fractional shares that would be held by such stockholder after
giving effect to the Reverse Split), such stockholder shall be entitled to
receive cash (without interest) in lieu of such fractional share of
Bishop Common Stock in an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) such fractional share interest, by (ii) the closing price of
a share of Bishop Common Stock on the NYSE on the date on which the Charter
Amendment Effective Time occurs (or such other amount in cash as the board of
directors of Bishop shall determine in good faith to be equitable). No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Bishop Common Stock shall be
payable on or with respect to any such fractional share interest, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a stockholder of Bishop. The payment of cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Bishop Common Stock is not a separately bargained-for
consideration and solely represents a mechanical rounding-off of the
fractions as a result of the Reverse Split.

Article II 
 CONVERSION AND EXCHANGE OF SHARES IN THE MERGER

  



  

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Securities_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Rook, Bishop, Merger Sub or the holders of any shares
of capital stock of Rook or Bishop:

  



  

(i) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
thereupon be converted into one (1) validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

  



  

(ii) Each share of Rook Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) shall
thereupon be converted into the right to receive one (1) validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable share of Bishop Common Stock (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). The parties hereto agree that the one-for-one exchange
ratio and the Merger Consideration were determined assuming that the Reverse
Split shall have occurred prior to the Merger.

  



  

(iii) Each share of Rook Common Stock held in the treasury of Rook or
owned or held, directly or indirectly, by Bishop or any wholly
owned Subsidiary of Bishop or Rook immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any such share of Rook Common Stock held in a fiduciary capacity
on behalf of a third-party) (each such share, a " _Cancelled Share_ ") shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist without any conversion
thereof, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(iv) All shares of Rook Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
shall thereafter only represent the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii), and any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e), in each case to be
issued or paid in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest, but subject
to Section 2.2(c).

  



    

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 2.2 _Exchange and Payment_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Closing, Bishop and Rook shall jointly appoint a
bank or trust company to act as exchange agent for the payment of the
Merger Consideration (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). Prior to the Effective Time,
and prior to filing the Statement of Merger with the Arizona Corporation
Commission, Bishop shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) book-entry shares
of Bishop Common Stock representing the aggregate Merger Consideration with
the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of record of
shares of Rook Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii). In addition, Bishop
shall make available by depositing with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from
time to time after the Effective Time, any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to Section 2.2(e). In the event such deposit shall be insufficient to
make payments, Bishop shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited,
additional book-entry shares of Bishop Common Stock or funds, as
applicable, with the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal to the
deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. All book-entry shares
of Bishop Common Stock, dividends and distributions deposited with the
Exchange Agent are referred to in this Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund_."
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund
payments pursuant to Section 2.1 and Section 2.2, except as expressly provided
for in this Agreement.

  



  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and
in any event not later than the fifth (5th) Business Day thereafter, Bishop
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate (" _Certificates_ "), and may cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of a book-entry share (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), in each case
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Rook Common Stock (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, or in the case
of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the
letter of transmittal, and which letter shall be in customary form and contain
such other provisions as Bishop, Rook and the Exchange Agent may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii) and any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e) (which instructions shall be in customary
form and contain such other provisions as Bishop, Rook and the Exchange Agent
may reasonably specify). With respect to holders of Rook Book-Entry Shares,
the parties shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Exchange Agent
to allow the Exchange Agent to transmit, following the Effective Time, to
such holders or their nominees, upon surrender of Rook Common Stock, the
Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions, in each case, to
which such holders are entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

(c) Each holder of shares of Rook Common Stock that have been
converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon proper
surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably require, shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (i) the number of shares of Bishop Common Stock to which
such holder of Rook Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the
provisions of Section 2.1(a)(ii) (which shall be in uncertificated book-
entry form), and (ii) an amount (if any) in immediately available funds,
after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section
2.5) of any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section
2.2(e), and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger
Consideration, or any unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Bishop shall cause the Exchange
Agent to make all payments required pursuant to the preceding sentence as
soon as practicable following the valid surrender of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable pursuant
to Section 2.1(a)(ii) in respect thereof and any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e), but shall not entitle its
holder or any other Person to any rights as a stockholder of Rook or Bishop.

  



    

 | 6| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry
Share is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate
so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper
form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and
that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and
other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share or shall have established to the satisfaction of Bishop and the
Exchange Agent that such Tax is not applicable.

  



  

(e) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Bishop
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to
the shares of Bishop Common Stock that the holder thereof has the right to
receive upon the surrender thereof, until the holder thereof shall surrender
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Article II.
Following the proper surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share in
accordance with this Article II, there shall be paid to the record holder
thereof, without interest, in addition to the Merger Consideration,
(i) promptly following such surrender, the amount of any dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and payment date on
or prior to the date of such surrender in respect of the whole shares of
Bishop Common Stock issued as Merger Consideration in exchange for such
surrender and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but with a
payment date subsequent to such surrender in respect of the shares of
Bishop Common Stock issued as Merger Consideration in exchange for such
surrender. For purposes of dividends and other distributions in respect of
the Bishop Common Stock, the Bishop Common Stock to be issued as Merger
Consideration shall be entitled to dividends and other distributions pursuant
to this Section 2.2(e) as if issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

  



  

(f) The Merger Consideration and any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e) issued and paid upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance
with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been issued and
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Rook
Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.
At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Rook shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers of the shares of Rook
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent for transfer, or transfer is sought for
Book-Entry Shares, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled
and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

  



  

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest or
other income earned on the Exchange Fund) that remains undistributed to the
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares one (1) year after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any
remaining holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation, as general creditors thereof, for payment
of the Merger Consideration and any unpaid dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e). None of Bishop, the Surviving
Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any
Person in respect of shares of Bishop Common Stock, dividends or other
distributions with respect thereto properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  



    

 | 7| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(h) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the
Exchange Fund as directed by Bishop; _provided_ that (i) no such
investment shall relieve Bishop or the Exchange Agent from making the
payments required by this Article II, and following any losses Bishop shall
promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the
holders of Rook Common Stock in the amount of such losses, (ii) no such
investment shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be
made pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) such investments shall be in short-
term obligations of the United States with maturities of no more than
thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United States and backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid as agreed between Bishop and the
Exchange Agent.

  



  

(i) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Bishop and the Exchange Agent, of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Bishop or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
amount as Bishop or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof and any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e).

  



  

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Rook Equity Awards_.

  



  

(a) _Rook Stock Options_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each
vested and unvested stock option granted under a Rook Plan (each, a " _Rook
Stock Option_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be assumed by Bishop and shall be automatically
converted into an option (a " _New Bishop Stock Option_ ") to acquire the
number of shares of Bishop Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Rook
Common Stock subject to such Rook Stock Option as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, in exchange for the exercise price per share of Bishop Common
Stock equal to the exercise price per share of Rook Common Stock of such
Rook Stock Option; provided, however, that each such Rook Stock Option that
is an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall
be adjusted in accordance with the foregoing in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 424 of the Code. The parties hereto intend that the
adjustments in this Section 2.3(a) are in accordance with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D) and will not subject any Rook Stock
Option that is converted into a New Bishop Stock Option to Section 409A of
the Code. Except as provided in this Section 2.3(a), each such Rook Stock
Option assumed and converted into a New Bishop Stock Option pursuant to this
Section 2.3(a) shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms
and conditions as applied to the corresponding Rook Stock Option as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) _Rook Restricted Stock Awards_. As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holders thereof, each award of Rook Common Stock subject to vesting,
repurchase or other lapse restriction granted under a Rook Plan (each, a "
_Rook Restricted Stock Award_ ") that is outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be assumed by Bishop and shall be automatically
converted into a restricted stock award of Bishop Common Stock equal to the
number of shares of Rook Common Stock subject to such Rook Restricted Stock
Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _New Bishop
Restricted Stock Award_ "). Except as otherwise provided in this Section
2.3(b), each Rook Restricted Stock Award assumed and converted into a New
Bishop Restricted Stock Award pursuant to this Section 2.3(b) shall continue
to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to
the corresponding Rook Restricted Stock Award as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

  



    

 | 8| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) _Rook RSU Awards_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each vested
and unvested restricted stock unit award that corresponds to a number of
shares of Rook Common Stock granted under a Rook Plan (each, a " _Rook RSU
Award_ ") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be assumed by Bishop and shall be automatically converted into a
restricted share unit award of Bishop Common Stock equal to the number of
shares of Rook Common Stock subject to such Rook RSU Award as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _New Bishop RSU Award_ "). Except as
otherwise provided in this Section 2.3(c), each Rook RSU Award assumed and
converted into a New Bishop RSU Award pursuant to this Section 2.3(c) shall
continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as

Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each vested
and unvested performance share unit award that corresponds to a number of
shares of Rook Common Stock granted under a Rook Plan (each, a " _Rook PSU
Award_ ") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be assumed by Bishop and shall be automatically converted into a
performance share unit award of Bishop Common Stock equal the number of
shares of Rook Common Stock subject to such Rook PSU Award as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (subject to such adjustment as may be determined
by the board of directors of Rook or any applicable committee thereof in its
reasonable discretion) (each, a " _New Bishop PSU Award_ "). Except as
adjusted in accordance with this Section 2.3(d), each Rook PSU Award that is
assumed and converted into a New Bishop PSU Award pursuant to this Section
2.3(d) shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and
conditions as applied to the corresponding Rook PSU Award as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(e) _Rook Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, Rook, the board of
directors of Rook and any applicable committee thereof shall
pass resolutions, provide any notices, obtain any consents, make any
amendments to Rook Plans or Rook Equity Awards and take such other actions as
are necessary to provide for the treatment of Rook Stock Options, Rook
Restricted Stock Awards, Rook RSU Awards and Rook PSU Awards (collectively,

(f) _Plans and Awards Assumed by Bishop_. At the Effective Time,
Bishop shall assume all rights and obligations in respect of each equity-
based Rook Plan (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Rook Employee
Stock Purchase Plan), including each outstanding Rook Equity Award, and will
be able to grant stock awards, to the extent permissible by applicable Law
under the terms of Rook Plans if Bishop elects to assume the share reserves
of such Rook Plans as of the Effective Time, except that: (i) stock covered by
such awards shall be shares of Bishop Common Stock; (ii) all references in
such Rook Plan to a number of shares of Rook Common Stock shall be amended or
deemed amended to refer instead to a number of shares of Bishop Common Stock
equal to the number of referenced shares of Rook Common Stock; and (iii) the
board of directors of Bishop or a committee thereof shall succeed to the
authority and responsibility of the board of directors of Rook or any
committee thereof with respect to the administration of such Rook Plan.

  



  

(g) _Bishop Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, Bishop, the
board of directors of Bishop and any applicable committee thereof shall
take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a number of
authorized but unissued shares of Bishop Common Stock sufficient to cover the
exercise or settlement of the New Bishop Stock Options, stock appreciation
rights granted under a Bishop Plan, New Bishop Restricted Stock Awards, New
Bishop RSU Awards and New Bishop PSU Awards that are converted in accordance
with this Section 2.3. Rook and Bishop shall cooperate in connection with the
preparation of registration statements on Form S-8 (or any successor or other
appropriate form, including a Form S-1 or Form S-3 in the case of awards held
by former employees and service providers of Rook) with respect to the shares
of Bishop Common Stock subject to such awards, in order to file such forms
effective as of the Effective Time or, in the event the necessary financial
information required for such filings is not filed or able to be filed with
the SEC as of the Effective Time, as soon as reasonably practicable following
the Effective Time. In addition, Bishop shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such awards remain outstanding.

Section 2.4 _Treatment of Bishop Equity Awards_.

  



  

(a) _Bishop Stock Options_. As of the Reverse Split Time, by virtue
of the Reverse Split and without any action on the part of the
holders thereof, each stock option granted under a Bishop Plan (a " _Bishop
Stock Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and
unexercised as of immediately prior to the Reverse Split shall be adjusted to
be a Bishop Stock Option to acquire (i) that number of whole shares of Bishop
Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Bishop Common
Stock subject to such Bishop Stock Option as of immediately prior to the
Reverse Split Time by (B) the Bishop Share Consolidation Ratio, (ii) at an
exercise price per share of Bishop Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest

Bishop Share Consolidation Ratio; provided, however, that each such Bishop
Stock Option that is an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422
of the Code) shall be adjusted in accordance with the foregoing in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code. The parties
intend that the adjustments in this Section 2.4(a) are in accordance with
Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D) and will not subject any
Bishop Stock Option to Section 409A of the Code. Except as otherwise provided
in this Section 2.4(a), each such Bishop Stock Option adjusted pursuant to
this Section 2.4(a) shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same
terms and conditions as applied to the Bishop Stock Option as of immediately
prior to the Reverse Split Time.

  



  

(b) _Bishop Restricted Stock Awards_. As of the Reverse Split Time,
by virtue of the Reverse Split and without any action on the part of the
holders thereof, each award of Bishop Common Stock subject to vesting,
repurchase or other lapse restriction granted under a Bishop Plan (each, a "
_Bishop Restricted Stock Award_ ") that is outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Reverse Split Time and that will not by its terms vest as of the
Effective Time shall be adjusted to correspond to a number of shares
of Bishop Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of restricted shares of Bishop
Common Stock subject to such Bishop Restricted Stock Award as of immediately
prior to the Reverse Split Time by (ii) the Bishop Share Consolidation Ratio.
Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.4(b), each Bishop Restricted
Stock Award adjusted pursuant to this Section 2.4(b) shall continue to have,
and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the
Bishop Restricted Award as of immediately prior to the Reverse Split Time. As
of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holders thereof, each Bishop Restricted Stock Award that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and that vests by
its terms as of the Effective Time or that is otherwise vested (taking into
account any accelerated vesting thereof as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) shall entitle the holder thereof to a number
of shares of Bishop Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Bishop Common
Stock that such holder holds upon vesting under the terms of such Bishop
Restricted Stock Award as of immediately prior to the Reverse Split (without
giving effect to the Reverse Split) by (y) the Bishop Share
Consolidation Ratio (it being understood that any Bishop Restricted Stock
Award subject to the adjustment contemplated by this sentence shall not be
subject to the adjustment contemplated by the prior sentence).

(c) _Bishop RSU Awards_. As of the Reverse Split Time, by virtue of
the Reverse Split and without any action on the part of the holders thereof,
each unvested restricted stock unit award that corresponds to a number of
shares of Bishop Common Stock granted under a Bishop Plan (each, a " _Bishop
RSU Award_ ") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Reverse
Split Time and that will not by its terms vest as of the Effective Time,
shall be adjusted to correspond to a number of shares of Bishop Common Stock
(rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) the number of shares of Bishop Common Stock subject to such
Bishop RSU Award as of immediately prior to the Reverse Split Time by (ii) the
Bishop Share Consolidation Ratio. Except as otherwise provided in this
Section 2.4(c), each Bishop RSU Award adjusted pursuant to this Section 2.4(c)
shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and
conditions as applied to the Bishop RSU Award as of immediately prior to the
Reverse Split Time. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each Bishop RSU Award
that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (taking into
account any accelerated vesting thereof as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) and that vests by its terms as of the
Effective Time or that is otherwise vested shall entitle the holder thereof
to a number of shares of Bishop Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole
share) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares
of Bishop Common Stock that such holder is entitled to receive upon vesting
under the terms of such Bishop RSU Award as of immediately prior to the
Reverse Split Time (without giving effect to the Reverse Split) by (y) the
Bishop Share Consolidation Ratio (it being understood that any Bishop
RSU Award subject to the adjustment contemplated by this sentence shall not
be subject to the adjustment contemplated by the prior sentence).

  



  

(d) _Bishop PSU Awards_. As of the Reverse Split Time, by virtue of
the Reverse Split and without any action on the part of the holders thereof,
each unvested performance share unit award that corresponds to a number of
shares of Bishop Common Stock granted under a Bishop Plan (each, a " _Bishop
PSU Award_ ") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Reverse
Split Time and that will not by its terms vest as of the Effective Time,
shall be adjusted to correspond to a number of shares of Bishop Common Stock
(rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) the number of shares of Bishop Common Stock subject to such
Bishop PSU Award as of immediately prior to the Reverse Split Time by by (ii)
the Bishop Share Consolidation Ratio (subject to such adjustment as may be
agreed by Bishop and Rook). Except as adjusted in accordance with this Section
2.4(d), each Bishop PSU Award adjusted pursuant to this Section 2.4(d) shall
continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as
applied to the Bishop PSU Award as of immediately prior to the Reverse Split
Time. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof, each Bishop PSU Award that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (taking into
account any accelerated vesting thereof as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and that vests by its terms as
of the Effective Time or that is otherwise vested shall entitle the holder
thereof to a number of shares of Bishop Common Stock (rounded to the nearest
whole share) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of
shares of Bishop Common Stock that such holder is entitled to receive upon
vesting under the terms of such Bishop PSU Award as of immediately prior to
the Charter Amendment Effective Time (without giving effect to the
Reverse Split) by (y) the Bishop Share Consolidation Ratio (it being
understood that any Bishop PSU Award subject to the adjustment
contemplated by this sentence shall not be subject to the adjustment
contemplated by the prior sentence).

(e) _Bishop ESPP_. Bishop shall take such action as may be
necessary with respect to the Bishop 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "
_Bishop ESPP_ ") to cause the "Offering Period" (if any) within the meaning
of the Bishop ESPP that otherwise would be in effect immediately before
consummation of the Merger to be shortened by setting a new "Purchase Date"
(within the meaning of the Bishop ESPP) in respect of such Offering Period
that is the day that is at least ten (10) business days before the Reverse
Split Time, and any outstanding right to purchase shares of Bishop Common
Stock under the Bishop ESPP (" _Bishop ESPP Shares_ ") on such Purchase Date
shall be exercised automatically in accordance with the otherwise applicable
terms of the Bishop ESPP as in effect on the date hereof and to terminate all
purchase rights under any ongoing offering or purchase periods immediately
after such exercise. Any amounts withheld by Bishop on behalf of participants
in the Bishop ESPP that have not been used to purchase Bishop ESPP Shares
will be returned to the participants without interest pursuant to the terms of
the Bishop ESPP upon the termination of the Bishop ESPP.

  



  

(f) _Bishop Actions_. Prior to the Reverse Split Time, Bishop shall
pass resolutions, provide any notices, obtain any consents, make
any amendments to the Bishop Plans or Bishop Equity Awards and take such
other actions as are necessary and approved by Rook (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) to provide for the equitable
adjustment of the Bishop Stock Options, Bishop RSU Awards and Bishop PSU
Awards (collectively, " _Bishop Equity Awards_ ") as contemplated by this
Section 2.4.

  



  

Section 2.5 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Bishop, Rook, the
Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amount otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such

applicable Treasury Regulations or any provision of state, local or foreign
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

Section 2.6 _Adjustments_. If between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Bishop Common Stock or Rook
Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class, by reason of any stock dividend or any subdivision split
(including a reverse stock split), combination or consolidation of shares, or
any similar event shall have occurred (in each case, other than the Reverse
Split and the Class B Conversion), then any number or amount contained herein
(including any exchange ratio) which is based upon the number of shares of
Bishop Common Stock or Rook Common Stock, as the case may be, will be
equitably adjusted to provide to Bishop, the holders of Bishop Common Stock,
the holders of Bishop Equity Awards, the holders of Rook Common Stock and the
holders of Rook Equity Awards the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
Section 2.6 shall be construed to permit Bishop or Rook to take any action
with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

of the ABCA, holders of Rook Common Stock will not have dissenters' rights
with respect to the Merger. Holders of Bishop Common Stock and Bishop Class B

violation of any purchase option, call option, right of first refusal,
preemptive right, subscription right or any other similar right under any
provision of the Rook Charter, the Rook Bylaws or any Contract to which Rook

Rook. Neither Rook nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding any bonds,
debentures or notes having the right to vote (or convertible into, or
exchangeable or exercisable for, securities having the right to vote) with
the stockholders of Rook on any matter. Except as set forth above in this

shares of Rook Common Stock subject to such Rook Equity Award, the name of the
plan under which such Rook Equity Award was granted, the date of grant,

stock and other voting securities or equity interests of each Subsidiary of
Rook have been duly authorized and validly issued. All outstanding shares of
capital stock and other voting securities or equity interests of each such
Subsidiary are owned by Rook or a wholly owned Subsidiary of Rook, free and
clear of all liens, claims, mortgages, options, rights of first refusal,

Subsidiaries or by which Rook or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound, except in the cases of clauses

Section 3.6 _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_.

  



  

(a) Rook has filed with or furnished to the SEC on a timely basis
all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents required to be
filed with or furnished to the SEC by Rook under the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act since January 1, 2014 (all such documents, together with all
exhibits and schedules to the foregoing materials and all information
incorporated therein by reference, and any amendments or supplements thereto,
the " _Rook SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective filing or
furnished dates (or, if amended or superseded by a filing or a document
furnished prior to the date of this Agreement, then on such filing or
furnished date), the Rook SEC Documents complied in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, including, in each case, the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, and none of the Rook SEC Documents at the time it was
filed or furnished contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

  



  

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including the related
notes thereto) included (or incorporated by reference) in Rook SEC
Documents (i) have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the case
of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto, or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by
Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X of the Exchange Act), (ii) comply as to form in
all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and (iii)
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position
of Rook and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their consolidated
results of operations, cash flows and changes in stockholders equity for the
periods reflected therein (subject, in the case of unaudited interim
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments, to the absence of notes and
to any other adjustments described therein, including any notes thereto, in
each case, that were not, or are not expected to be, individually or in the
aggregate, material in amount). Since January 1, 2014, Rook has not made any
change in the accounting practices or policies applied in the preparation of
its financial statements, except as required by GAAP, SEC rule or policy or
applicable Law.

  



  

(c) Rook has established and maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act). Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably
ensure that information relating to Rook, including its consolidated
Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in Rook's periodic and current reports
under the Exchange Act, is made known to Rook's management, including its
principal executive and principal financial officers, or others
performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures as required under the Exchange Act. Rook's
management has evaluated, with the participation of Rook's principal executive
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions,
the effectiveness of Rook's disclosure controls and procedures and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Rook SEC
Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment
thereto, their conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls
and procedures as of the end of the period covered by such report or
amendment based on such evaluation.

  



    

 | 17| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Rook and its Subsidiaries have established and maintain a system
of "internal control over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) regarding the reliability of Rook's
financial reporting and the preparation of Rook's financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP which is sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP,
consistently applied, (ii) that transactions are executed only in accordance
with the authorization of management and (iii) regarding prevention or timely
detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
properties or assets of Rook and its Subsidiaries. Rook has disclosed, based
on its most recent evaluation of Rook's internal control over
financial reporting prior to the date hereof, to Rook's auditors and audit
committee, which disclosure is set forth in Section 3.6(d) of the Rook

(c) Bishop has established and maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange

reports under the Exchange Act, is made known to Bishop's management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or
others performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures as required under the Exchange Act.

procedures and, to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any
applicable Bishop SEC Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or

statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP which is sufficient
to provide reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP, consistently applied, (ii) that transactions are executed only in
accordance with the authorization of management and (iii) regarding
prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the properties or assets of Bishop and its Subsidiaries.

weaknesses in the design or operation of Bishop's internal control over

ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Bishop's internal control over

control over financial reporting required to be disclosed in any Bishop SEC
Document has been so disclosed.

material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods of Bishop or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal
accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion
or claim that Bishop or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in improper
accounting or auditing practices and (ii) no attorney representing Bishop or
any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Bishop or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Bishop or any of its

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at
any time prior to obtaining Rook Stockholder Approval or the Bishop
Stockholder Approval, as applicable, in response to a written Acquisition
Proposal from any Person or Persons that (w) the board of directors of Rook
or Bishop, as applicable, determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and the
failure to take the following actions would be inconsistent with the Rook or
Bishop directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law, as applicable, (x)
was made after the date of this Agreement, and (y) did not result from a
breach of Section 5.2(a), Rook or Bishop, as applicable, may (and may
authorize and permit its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to),
subject to compliance with this Section 5.2, (A) furnish nonpublic
information with respect to itself and its Subsidiaries to the Person or
Persons making such Acquisition Proposal (and its or their respective
Representatives and financing sources) ( _provided_ that all such nonpublic
information that is furnished in writing has previously been provided to the
other party or is provided to the other party substantially concurrently with
the time it is provided to such Person or Persons) pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement not materially less restrictive of such Person or
Persons than the Confidentiality Agreement, and (B) participate in
discussions and negotiation with the Person or Persons making such Acquisition
Proposal (and its or their respective Representatives and financing sources).
Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that, if any Representative of
Rook or Bishop or any of their respective Subsidiaries takes any action that
would constitute a breach of this Section 5.2 if it were authorized or
permitted by Rook or Bishop, as applicable, such action shall constitute a
breach of this Section 5.2 by Rook or Bishop, as applicable, whether or not
such action shall have been authorized or permitted by Rook or Bishop or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, unless such Representative has agreed (in
any capacity) in a writing enforceable by such party not to take any such
action.

  



  

(c) Except as set forth below, neither the board of directors of
Rook or Bishop nor any committee thereof shall (i) either (A) withdraw (or
modify, withhold or qualify in any manner adverse to the other party), or
propose publicly to withdraw (or modify, withhold or qualify in any manner
adverse to the other party), the Rook Recommendation or the Bishop
Recommendation, as applicable, or (B) adopt, approve, recommend or declare
advisable, or propose publicly to adopt, approve, recommend or declare
advisable, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in this clause (i)
being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) adopt,
recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to adopt, recommend or
declare advisable, or allow Rook or Bishop, as applicable, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, or other similar agreement or arrangement (each, an "
_Acquisition Agreement_ ") constituting or related to, or that is intended to
or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other
than a confidentiality agreement referred to in this Section 5.2).

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at
any time prior to obtaining Rook Stockholder Approval or Bishop Stockholder
Approval, as applicable, the board of directors of Rook or Bishop may (A)
make an Adverse Recommendation Change or authorize Rook or Bishop, as
applicable, to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(e) or Section
7.1(h), as applicable, if such party has received a Superior Proposal after
the date hereof that did not result from a breach of Section 5.2(a), or (B)
make an Adverse Recommendation Change of the type described in clause (A) of
the definition thereof in response to any material event,
development, circumstance, occurrence or change in circumstances or facts
(including any material change in probability or magnitude of
circumstances) that (i) relates to such party and not any other party to this
Agreement, (ii) was not known to such party's board of directors on the date
of this Agreement (or if known, the consequences of which were not known as of
the date of this Agreement) and (iii) does not relate to an Acquisition
Proposal (an " _Intervening Event_ "), and in either case the board of
directors of such party determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to its stockholders under applicable Law.

  



    

 | 51| 
---|---|--- 

 



     



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
board of directors of Rook or Bishop, as applicable, shall not be entitled to
exercise its right to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or authorize the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 5.2(d) until after
the third Business Day following the other party's receipt of written notice
(a " _Determination Notice "_) advising of an intention to take such action
and specifying the reasons therefor, including in the case of a Superior
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal that are
the basis of the proposed action by the board of directors (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to any material term of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new Determination Notice and a new three (3)
Business Day period); and _provided_ , _further_ , that during such three (3)
Business Day period the party seeking to take such action shall and shall
instruct its Representatives to negotiate in good faith with the other party
(to the extent such party desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments to
the terms and condition of this Agreement so that, in the case of a Superior
Proposal, such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal or,
in the case of an Intervening Event, an Adverse Recommendation Change will no
longer be necessary. In determining whether to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change, the applicable board of directors shall take into account any changes
to the terms of this Agreement timely proposed by the other party in response
to a Determination Notice or otherwise.

  



  

(f) In addition, each of Rook and Bishop shall promptly (but in any
event within one (1) Business Day) advise the other of any
Acquisition Proposal received by such party, the material terms and
conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal (including any material
changes thereto) and the identity of the Person making any such Acquisition
Proposal. Rook or Bishop, as applicable, shall keep the other party
reasonably informed of the status of any discussions and negotiations
concerning the material terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(g) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 shall prohibit Rook or
Bishop from (i) issuing a "stop-look-and-listen communication" pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act or taking and disclosing to
its stockholders positions contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any "stop-look-and-
listen" communication to its stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (iii) making any disclosure to its
stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of its board of directors (after
consultation with outside counsel), failure to so disclose would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to its
stockholders under applicable Law or is otherwise required by applicable Law;
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not permit the board of directors of
Rook or Bishop, as applicable, to make an Adverse Recommendation Change,
except as permitted by Section 5.2(d).

  



  

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

  



  

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer (whether
or not in writing), with respect to any (A) sale, lease, contribution or
other disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way of merger,
consolidation, other business combination, partnership, joint venture, sale
of capital stock of or other equity interests in either Rook or Bishop or
their respective Subsidiaries) of any business or assets of Rook or Bishop or
any of their respective Subsidiaries representing twenty percent (20%) or more
of the consolidated revenues or assets of Rook or Bishop and their respective
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B) issuance, sale or other disposition,
directly or indirectly, to any Person or group (including by way of merger,
consolidation, other business combination, partnership, joint venture, sale
of capital stock of or other equity interests in Rook or Bishop or their
respective Subsidiaries) of securities (or options, rights or warrants to
purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for,
such securities) representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the voting
power or economic interests in Rook or Bishop, as applicable, or (C)
transaction (including a merger, consolidation, other business combination,
partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity
interests in a Subsidiary of Rook or Bishop or otherwise) in which any Person
or group shall acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership (as
defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of securities (or options,
rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for, such securities) representing twenty percent (20%) or more
of the voting power or economic interests in Rook or Bishop, as applicable;
_provided_ that an Acquisition Proposal does not include any proposal or
offer by another party to this Agreement or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



    

 | 52| 
---|---|--- 

 



     



  

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal (with all percentages in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
increased to fifty percent (50%)) that the board of directors of Rook or
Bishop, as applicable, determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation,
after taking into consideration the identity of the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal all terms of such Acquisition Proposal and the reasonable
likelihood and timing of consummation of such Acquisition Proposal in
addition to such other factors as the board of directors of Rook or Bishop,
as applicable, considers to be appropriate) is (i) more favorable to its
stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)
reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms of such Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

Section 5.3 _RESERVED_.

  



  

Section 5.4 _SEC Filings; Stockholders Meetings_.

  



  

(a) _Preparation of Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus_.

  



  

(i) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement,
Rook and Bishop shall jointly prepare and Bishop shall cause to be filed with
the SEC the Form S-4, which will include the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
to be sent to the stockholders of Rook relating to the Rook Stockholders
Meeting and to the stockholders of Bishop relating to the Bishop Stockholders
Meeting that will also constitute a prospectus with respect to the shares of
Bishop Common Stock issuable to the stockholders of Rook in the Merger. Each
of Bishop and Rook will use its reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4
declared effective and the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus cleared by the
SEC as promptly as practicable after the filing thereof with the SEC and keep
the Form S-4 effective for so long as necessary to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each of Rook and Bishop shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
to be mailed to the holders of the Rook Common Stock and to the holders of
the Bishop Common Stock and the Bishop Class B Common Stock, as applicable, as
promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 shall have become effective and
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall have been cleared by the SEC.

  



  

(ii) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information
should be discovered by Rook or Bishop that should be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents would not contain any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and each of the parties shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information to be promptly filed with the SEC and,
to the extent required under applicable Law, disseminated to stockholders of
Rook and/or Bishop, as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery
of such notice and the filing of any such amendment or supplement shall not
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by any party
hereunder or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any party.

  



  

(iii) Rook and Bishop shall promptly notify each other upon the
receipt of any comments, whether oral or written, from the SEC or the
staff of the SEC on, or any request from the SEC or the staff of the SEC for
amendments or supplements to, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Form S-4, and shall provide each other with copies of all correspondence (and
a summary of all substantive oral communications) with the SEC or the staff
of the SEC with respect to the S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.
Each of Rook and Bishop shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC or the staff of
the SEC with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4.
Each party shall cooperate and provide the other party with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any substantive correspondence (including
responses to SEC comments) or amendments or supplements to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 prior to filing with the SEC, and shall
provide to the other a copy of all such filings made with the SEC.

  



    

 | 53| 
---|---|--- 

 



     



  

(iv) Except for the purpose of disclosing any Adverse Recommendation
Change, no amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
the Form S-4, nor any response to any comments or inquiry from the SEC with
respect to such filings, will be made by Rook or Bishop without the approval
of the other party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned (it being understood that it shall be unreasonable to withhold
consent with respect to any amendment or supplement to the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4 to the extent such amendment or
supplement is required to be included therein so that the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4 will not contain an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading as may be
required by Rule 10b-5 or Rule 14a-9 under the Exchange Act or Section 11 or
Section 12 of the Securities Act).

  



  

(v) Bishop shall also take any action (other than qualifying to do
business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or filing a
general consent to service of process) reasonably required to be taken under
any applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws in connection with the
issuance of shares of Bishop Common Stock in the Merger, and Rook shall
furnish all information concerning Rook as Bishop may reasonably request in
connection with any such action.

  



  

(vi) Each of Bishop and Rook, as applicable, will advise the other
promptly after it receives oral or written notice of the time when the Form
S-4 has become effective or any amendment or supplement thereto has been
filed, the issuance of any stop order, or the suspension of the qualification
of the Bishop Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering
or sale in any jurisdiction.

  



  

(b) _Rook Stockholders Meeting_. Rook shall use its reasonable best
efforts to, as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act and the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is cleared by the SEC, in accordance with
applicable Law, the Rook Charter and the Rook Bylaws duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold the Rook Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of
considering and voting upon the approval and adoption of this Agreement, and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger. Except during
such time as an Adverse Recommendation Change is in effect in accordance with
Section 5.2, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Rook, through
the board of directors of Rook, shall (i) recommend to its stockholders that
they approve and adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger (the " _Rook Recommendation_ "), (ii) include
such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and (iii) solicit
and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Rook Stockholders Approval.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Rook may
adjourn or postpone the Rook Stockholders Meeting (A) to the extent necessary
to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is provided to Rook's stockholders in advance of a vote
to approve and adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger (B) if, as of the time for which the Rook Stockholders
Meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Rook Common
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct Rook Stockholders Meeting, (C) with the prior written
consent of Bishop or (D) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of
obtaining the Rook Stockholders Approval; provided, that without the prior
written consent of Bishop, the Rook Stockholders Meeting may not be postponed
or adjourned to a date that is more than thirty (30) days after the date
for which the Rook Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled. Rook shall,
upon the reasonable request of Bishop, provide the aggregate vote tally of
the proxies received with respect to the Rook Stockholder Approval. Rook
shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in no event later than the
tenth (10th) Business Day following the date of this Agreement) conduct a
"broker search" as contemplated by and in accordance with Rule 14a-13
promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to the Rook
Stockholders Meeting (based on a record date that is twenty (20) Business
Days following the date on which such broker search is commenced). If at any
time the current record date for the Rook Stockholders Meeting is not
reasonably likely to satisfy the requirements of Rook's organizational
documents and applicable Law, Rook shall, in consultation with Bishop, set a
new record date and shall continue to comply with the "broker search"
requirements of Rule 14a-13 promulgated under the Exchange Act with
respect to any such new record date.

(c) _Bishop Stockholders Meeting_. Bishop shall use its reasonable
best efforts to, as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act and the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is cleared by the SEC, in accordance with
applicable Law, the Bishop Charter and the Bishop Bylaws duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Bishop Stockholders Meeting for the purpose
of considering and voting upon the approval of the Charter Amendment (as the
components thereof may be combined or separately required to be proposed or
presented) and the Share Issuance. Except during such time as an Adverse
Recommendation Change is in effect in accordance with Section 5.2, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Bishop, through the board of
directors of Bishop, shall (i) recommend to its stockholders that they
approve the Charter Amendment (as the components thereof may be combined or
separately required to be proposed or presented) and the Share Issuance (the "
_Bishop Recommendation_ "), (ii) include such recommendation in the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and (iii) solicit and use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the Bishop Stockholders Approval. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Bishop may adjourn or postpone
the Bishop Stockholders Meeting (A) to the extent necessary to ensure that any
necessary supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is
provided to Bishop's stockholders in advance of a vote to approve the Charter
Amendment (as the components thereof may be combined or separately required
to be proposed or presented) and the Share Issuance, (B) if, as of the time
for which the Bishop Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled, there are
insufficient shares of Bishop Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct Bishop Stockholders
Meeting, (C) with the prior written consent of Rook, or (D) to solicit
additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Bishop Stockholders
Approval; provided, that without the prior written consent of Rook, the
Bishop Stockholders Meeting may not be postponed or adjourned to a date that
is more than thirty (30) days after the date for which the Bishop Stockholders
Meeting was originally scheduled. Bishop shall, upon the reasonable request
of Rook, provide the aggregate vote tally of the proxies received with respect
to the Bishop Stockholder Approval. Bishop shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and in no event later than the tenth (10th) Business Day
following the date of this Agreement) conduct a "broker search" as
contemplated by and in accordance with Rule 14a-13 promulgated under the
Exchange Act with respect to the Bishop Stockholders Meeting (based on a
record date that is twenty (20) Business Days following the date on which
such broker search is commenced). If at any time the current record date for
the Bishop Stockholders Meeting is not reasonably likely to satisfy the
requirements of Bishop's organizational documents and applicable Law, Bishop
shall, in consultation with Rook, set a new record date and shall continue to
comply with the "broker search" requirements of Rule 14a-13 promulgated under
the Exchange Act with respect to any such new record date.

  



  

(d) _Merger Sub Approval_. Immediately following execution of this
Agreement, Bishop shall execute and deliver, in accordance with the Act and
in its capacity as sole stockholder of Merger Sub, a written consent approving
the Merger and this Agreement.

  



  

(e) Each of Bishop and Rook agree to the matters set forth on
Section 5.4(e) of the Bishop Disclosure Letter.

  



    

 | 55| 
---|---|--- 

 



     



  

(f) Each of Bishop and Rook shall cooperate and use their reasonable
best efforts to cause the Bishop Stockholders Meeting and the
Rook Stockholders Meeting to be held on the same date and to cause the record
date for the Rook Stockholders Meeting and the Bishop Stockholders Meeting to
occur on the same date.

earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms:

  



  

(a) Rook shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, afford to Bishop and its
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon

shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to
Bishop and its Representatives, as applicable, all information concerning the
business, properties, assets and Contracts of Rook and its Subsidiaries as
may be reasonably requested by such parties; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the foregoing shall not require Rook or its Subsidiaries to provide
access to conduct environmental sampling without Rook's consent, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, or to disclose any
information to the extent such disclosure would (i) contravene applicable Law
or the provisions of any Contract to which Rook or its Subsidiaries is a
party, (ii) cause significant competitive harm to Rook or its Subsidiaries if
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated or (iii),
in Rook's good faith determination, constitute information protected by
attorney/client privilege ( _provided_  that, with respect to information
that may be the subject of clauses (i) through (iii), Rook and its
Subsidiaries shall cooperate in good faith with Bishop and its
Representatives to disclose the subject information in an alternative manner

such information provided in connection with this Agreement shall be
held confidential in accordance with the terms of the confidentiality letter
agreement entered into between Bishop and Rook dated as of January 16, 2017,

the foregoing shall not require Bishop or its Subsidiaries to provide access
to conduct environmental sampling without Bishop's consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, or to disclose any
information to the extent such disclosure would (i) contravene applicable Law
or the provisions of any Contract to which Bishop or its Subsidiaries is a
party, (ii) cause significant competitive harm to Bishop or its Subsidiaries
if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated or
(iii), in Bishop's good faith determination, constitute information protected

Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with

before the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility and vesting, to the same
extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time,
to credit for such service under any similar Rook Plans or Bishop Plans, as
applicable, except to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of
benefits and except for benefit accruals under any defined benefit
pension plan or post-retirement health, welfare or life insurance plan. In

to any applicable Law: (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans
which are welfare benefit plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan
replaces coverage under a comparable Rook Plan or Bishop Plan, as applicable,
in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before
the Effective Time; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee,
Bishop or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents, and Bishop or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Old Plan ending on the date such Continuing Employee's participation
in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New
Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan.

implied, (i) shall cause either Bishop or any of its Affiliates to be
obligated to continue to employ any Person for any period of time following
the Effective Time, (ii) shall prevent Bishop or its Affiliates from

of Bishop or of any of their respective Subsidiaries (including any
beneficiary or dependent of such individual).

  



  

Section 5.11 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

  



  

(a) Bishop, Rook and Merger Sub each agrees that all rights to
indemnification and exculpation now existing in favor of the current or
former directors or officers (the " _Rook DandO Indemnified Parties_") of
Rook or its Subsidiaries as provided in the Rook Charter, the Rook Bylaws,
the organizational documents of Rook's Subsidiaries or in any contract to
which Rook or any of its Subsidiaries is a party as in effect on the date of
this Agreement for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time,
whether claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including matters
arising in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby), shall be
assumed by the Surviving Corporation and shall continue in full force
and effect following the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time,
Bishop shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, and advance expenses to Rook DandO Indemnified Parties with respect to
all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time prior
to the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby), to the fullest extent
that Rook would be permitted by applicable Law and to the fullest extent
required by the Rook Charter, the Rook Bylaws, the organizational documents of
Rook's Subsidiaries or in any contract to which Rook or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party as in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_
, that any Rook DandO Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced agrees to
return any such funds to which a court of competent jurisdiction has
determined in a final, nonappealable judgment such Rook DandO Indemnified Party
is not ultimately entitled. For a period of six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, Bishop shall cause the organizational documents of the
Surviving Corporation to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and limitation of director and officer liability that
are no less favorable to the Rook DandO Indemnified Parties than those set forth
in the Rook Charter and the Rook Bylaws as of the date of this Agreement,
which provisions thereafter shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
the Rook DandO Indemnified Parties.

hereby), shall continue in full force and effect following the Effective
Time. From and after the Effective Time, Bishop shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless, and advance expenses to the Bishop DandO Indemnified Parties
with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at
any time prior to the Effective Time (including any matters arising in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby), to
the fullest extent that Bishop would be permitted by applicable Law and to the
fullest extent required by the Bishop Charter, the Bishop Bylaws or in any
contract to which Bishop or any of its Subsidiaries is a party as in effect on
the date of this Agreement;  _provided_ , that any Bishop DandO Indemnified
Party to whom expenses are advanced agrees to return any such funds to
which a court of competent jurisdiction has determined in a final,
nonappealable judgment such Bishop DandO Indemnified Party is not ultimately
entitled. For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time,
Bishop shall cause the organizational documents of Bishop to contain
provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
limitation of director and officer liability that are no less favorable to
the Bishop DandO Indemnified Parties than those set forth in the Bishop Charter
and the Bishop Bylaws as of the date of this Agreement, which provisions
thereafter shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Bishop DandO
Indemnified Parties.

  



  

(c) Unless Rook shall have purchased a "tail" policy prior to the
Effective Time as provided below, for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time, Bishop shall cause to be maintained in effect for the benefit
of the Rook DandO Indemnified Parties an insurance and indemnification policy

Effective Time (the " _Rook D andO Insurance_") covering each such person
currently covered by the officers' and directors' liability insurance policy
of Rook on terms with respect to coverage and in amounts no less favorable
than those of Rook's directors' and officers' insurance policy in effect on
the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Bishop shall not be
required to pay an annual premium for the Rook DandO Insurance in excess of
300% of the annual premium currently paid by Rook for such coverage; and
provided, further _,_ that if any annual premium for such insurance coverage
exceeds 300% of such annual premium, Bishop shall obtain as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for a cost not exceeding such amount. Bishop's
obligations under this Section 5.11(c) may be satisfied by Rook purchasing,
with the prior written consent of Bishop (not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) prior to the Effective Time, a "tail" policy which
(i) has an effective term of six (6) years from the Effective Time, and (ii)
covers each person covered by Rook's directors' and officers'
insurance policy in effect on the date of this Agreement for actions and

Affiliates and their respective Representatives with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in the circumstances in
which any such payment is payable. In no event shall Rook be obligated to pay

Section 8.8 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. The parties hereby
irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of
Chancery or, if such court shall lack subject matter jurisdiction, the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware, solely in respect of the

proceeding relating hereto except in the courts described above in the State
of Delaware, other than actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to
enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such court in Delaware
as described herein. Each of the parties further agrees that notice as

insufficient. However, the foregoing shall not limit the right of a party to
effect service of process on the other party by any other legally available

Agreement) were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof.
Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that each party shall be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such
party is entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby further
waives (a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy
at Law would be adequate or that an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity and (b) any requirement
under any Law to post any bond or other security as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief.

be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected,
impaired or invalidated. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible and the

accordance with Article FOURTH Section (c)(5) below) shall represent, from
and after the Reverse Split Effective Time and without any action required to
be taken by any stockholder of the Corporation, the number of shares of Class
A Common Stock represented thereby immediately prior to the Reverse Split
Effective Time multiplied by 0.72, except that any such fractional share
interests shall be treated as set forth above.

  



  

(b) _Authorized Capital Stock_. From and after the Charter
Amendment Effective Time, the total number of shares of stock which the
Corporation shall have authority to issue is 760,000,000 shares of capital

Permitted Holder or Affiliated Person or (ii) any amendment to Article SIXTH,
TWELFTH or FOURTEENTH of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or to
this sentence, or to the definition of "Affiliated Person" or "Permitted

from the estates of Jerry Moyes or Vickie Moyes and (iv) any corporation,
limited liability company or partnership the sole stockholders, members or
partners of which are Permitted Holders. "Affiliated Person" means any entity
(other than the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation) of which
more than 10% of the capital stock or other equity interests or voting power

sale, assignment, gift, bequest or otherwise, except to a Permitted Holder.

  



  

(5) _Conversion of Class B Common Stock_. Effective upon the Charter
Amendment Effective Time, by virtue of this Restated Certificate of
Incorporation without any further action on the part of the Corporation, any
stockholder of the Corporation or any other person, each share of Class B
Common Stock outstanding as of the Charter Amendment Effective Time shall
automatically be converted into one share of Class A Common Stock.
Thereafter, the Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out
of its authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock, solely for the
purpose of issuance upon conversion of the outstanding shares of Class B
Common Stock, such number of shares of Class A Common Stock that shall be
issuable upon the conversion of all such outstanding shares of Class B Common
Stock. Each share of Class B Common Stock shall be convertible by the holder
thereof, at such holder's option, into one share of Class A Common Stock at
any time by written notice to the Corporation specifying the number of
shares to be converted and the date for conversion. Upon transfer or
purported transfer to any person other than a Permitted Holder, shares of
Class B Common Stock shall automatically be converted into and become shares
of Class A Common Stock. Shares of Class B Common Stock that are converted
into shares of Class A Common Stock as provided herein shall be retired and
restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Class B Common
Stock and be available for reissue by the Corporation to Permitted Holders
in compliance with Article FOURTH Section (c)(2)b.

  



  

Upon conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A
Common Stock, the certificate previously representing shares of Class B Common
Stock shall represent shares of Class A Common Stock until a new certificate
is issued pursuant hereto. As promptly as practicable after delivery of
certificates previously representing shares of Class B Common Stock converted
to shares of Class A Common Stock, the Corporation shall issue and deliver at
such office or agency, to or upon the written order of the holder thereof,
certificates for the number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon
such conversion. In the event any certificate representing shares of Class B
Common Stock shall be surrendered for conversion of a part only of the shares
represented thereby, the Corporation shall deliver at such office or agency,
to or upon the written order of the holder thereof, a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Class B Common Stock represented by
such surrendered certificate which are not being converted. The issuance of
certificates representing shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon the
conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock by the registered holder thereof
shall be made without charge to the converting holder for any tax imposed on
the Corporation in respect of the issue thereof. The Corporation shall not,
however, be required to pay any tax which may be payable with respect to any
transfer involved in the issue and delivery of any certificate in a name
other than that of the registered holder of the shares being converted, and
the Corporation shall not be required to issue or deliver any such
certificate unless and until the person requesting the issue thereof shall
have paid to the Corporation the amount of such tax or has established to the
satisfaction of the Corporation that such tax has been paid.

(6) _Dividends_. Subject to the rights of the holders of Preferred
Stock, and subject to any other provisions of this Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and shares of Class
B Common Stock shall be entitled to receive such dividends and
other distributions in cash, stock or property of the Corporation when, as
and if declared thereon by the Board of Directors from time to time out of
assets or funds of the Corporation legally available therefor. If, at any
time, a dividend or other distribution in cash or other property (other than
dividends or other distributions payable in shares of Common Stock or other
voting securities of the Corporation, or rights, options or warrants to
purchase shares of Common Stock or other voting securities of the
Corporation or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of
Common Stock or other voting securities of the Corporation) is declared or
paid on the shares of Class A Common Stock or shares of Class B Common Stock,
a like dividend or other distribution in cash or other property shall also be
declared or paid, as the case may be, on shares of Class B Common Stock or
shares of Class A Common Stock, as the case may be, in an equal amount per
share. If, at any time, a dividend or other distribution payable in shares
of Common Stock or other voting securities of the Corporation, or rights,
options or warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock or other voting
securities of the Corporation, or securities convertible into or exchangeable
for shares of Common Stock or other voting securities of the Corporation is
paid or declared on shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, a
like dividend or other distribution shall also be paid or declared, as the
case may be, on shares of Class B Common Stock or Class A Common Stock, as
the case may be, in an equal amount per share; provided, that, for this
purpose, if shares of Class A Common Stock or other voting securities of the
Corporation, or rights, options or warrants to purchase shares of Class A
Common Stock or other voting securities of the Corporation or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Class A Common Stock or other
voting securities of the Corporation, are paid on shares of Class A Common
Stock, and shares of Class B Common Stock or voting securities identical to
the other voting securities paid on the shares of Class A Common Stock (except
that the voting securities paid on the Class B Common Stock shall have two
times the number of votes per share as the other voting securities to be
received by the holders of the Class A Common Stock) or rights, options or
warrants to purchase shares of Class B Common Stock or such other
voting securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares
of Class B Common Stock or such other voting securities, are paid on shares
of Class B Common Stock, in an equal amount per share of Class A Common Stock
and Class B Common Stock, such dividend or other distribution shall be deemed
to be a like dividend or other distribution.

(7) _Reclassification, etc_. In the case of any split, subdivision,
combination or reclassification of shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B
Common Stock, the shares of Class B Common Stock or Class A Common Stock, as
the case may be, shall also be split, subdivided, combined or reclassified so
that the number of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock
outstanding immediately following such split, subdivision, combination or
reclassification shall bear the same relationship to each other as did the
number of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to such split, subdivision, combination or reclassification.

  



  

(8) _Liquidation, Dissolution, etc_. In the event of any
liquidation, dissolution or winding up (either voluntary or involuntary) of
the Corporation, the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and the
holders of shares of Class B Common Stock shall be entitled to receive
the assets and funds of the Corporation available for distribution after
payments to creditors and to the holders of any Preferred Stock of the
Corporation that may at the time be outstanding, in proportion to the number
of shares held by them, respectively, without regard to class.

  



  

(9) _No Preemptive or Subscription Rights_. No holder of shares of
Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock shall be entitled to preemptive
or subscription rights.

  



  

(d) _Preferred Stock_. The Board of Directors is hereby expressly
authorized to provide for the issuance of all or any shares of the
Preferred Stock in one or more classes or series, and to fix for each such
class or series such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and
such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other
special rights and such qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof,
as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions adopted by
the Board of Directors providing for the issuance of such class or series,
including, without limitation, the authority to provide that any such class
or series may be (i) subject to redemption at such time or times and at such
price or prices; (ii) entitled to receive dividends (which may be cumulative
or non-cumulative) at such rates, on such conditions, and at such times, and
payable in preference to, or in such relation to, the dividends payable on
any other class or classes or any other series; (iii) entitled to such rights
upon the dissolution of, or upon any distribution of the assets of, the
Corporation; or (iv) convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any
other class or classes of stock, or of any other series of the same or any
other class or classes of stock, of the Corporation at such price or prices
or at such rates of exchange and with such adjustments; all as may be stated
in such resolution or resolutions.

  



  

 _Fifth_ : The following provisions are inserted for the management of the
business and the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and for further
definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation and of
its directors and stockholders.

  



  

(a) The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by
or under the direction of the Board of Directors.

  



  

(b) The size of the Board of Directors shall be fixed from time to
time by resolution of the Board of Directors. Election of directors need not
be by written ballot unless the By-Laws so provide.

  



    

 6

 



    



  

(c) The directors, other than those who may be elected by the
holders of any series of Preferred Stock, shall be classified, with
respect to the time for which they severally hold office, into three classes,
as nearly equal in number as possible, designated Class I, Class II and Class
III. The directors in Class I shall serve for an initial term expiring at the
Corporation's first annual meeting of stockholders held after the Charter
Amendment Effective Time, the directors in Class II shall serve for an initial
term expiring at the Corporation's second annual meeting of stockholders held
after the Charter Amendment Effective Time, and the directors in Class III
shall serve for an initial term expiring at the Corporation's third annual
meeting of stockholders held after the Charter Amendment Effective Time, with
each director in a class to hold office until his successor is elected
and qualified, or until such director's earlier death, resignation or
removal. At the Corporation's third annual meeting of the stockholders of the
Corporation and at each subsequent annual meeting of the stockholders of the
Corporation held after the Charter Amendment Effective Time, the members (or
successors) of the class of directors whose term expires at that
meeting shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual
meeting of stockholders held in the third year following the year of their
election, with each director in a class to hold office until his successor is
elected and qualified, or until such director's earlier death, resignation or
removal. Advance notice of stockholder nominations for the election of
directors shall be given in the manner provided in the By-Laws of the
Corporation.

  



  

(d) Subject to the terms of any one or more series of Preferred
Stock, any vacancy on the Board of Directors that results from an increase in
the number of directors may be filled by a majority of the Board of Directors
then in office, provided that a quorum is present, and any other vacancy
occurring on the Board of Directors may be filled by a majority of the Board
of Directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole
remaining director. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article
FIFTH, whenever the holders of any one or more series of Preferred Stock
issued by the Corporation shall have the right, voting separately by class or
series, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders,
the election, term of office, filling of vacancies and other features of such
directorships shall be governed by the terms of this Restated Certificate of
Incorporation applicable thereto.

  



  

(e) Subject to the requirements of applicable law, the Corporation
shall have the power to issue and sell all or any part of any shares of any
class of stock herein or hereafter authorized to such persons, and for such
consideration, as the Board of Directors shall from time to time, in its
discretion, determine, regardless of whether greater consideration could be
received upon the issue or sale of the same number of shares of another
class, and as otherwise permitted by law. Subject to the requirements of
applicable law, the Corporation shall have the power to purchase any shares
of any class of stock herein or hereafter authorized from such persons, and
for such consideration, as the Board of Directors shall from time to time, in
its discretion, determine, regardless of whether less consideration could be
paid upon the purchase of the same number of shares of another class, and as
otherwise permitted by law.

  



  

(f) In addition to the powers and authority hereinbefore or by
statute expressly conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to
exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised
or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the
DGCL and this Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

  



    

 7

 



    



  

 _Sixth_ : So long as Permitted Holders and their Affiliated Persons hold in
excess of 20% of the voting power of the Corporation, the Corporation shall
not enter into any contract or transaction with any Permitted Holder or
Affiliated Person unless such contract or transaction shall have been
approved by either (i) at least 75% of the Independent Directors, including
the affirmative vote of the Chairman of the Board of Directors if the
Chairman is an Independent Director, or the Lead Independent Director if the
Chairman is not an Independent Director or (ii) the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock held by persons other than
Permitted Holders or Affiliated Persons. "Independent Director" means a
director who is not a Permitted Holder or a director, officer or employee of
an Affiliated Person and is "Independent," as that term is defined in the
governance standards of the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") applicable
to directors (but not applicable to directors by virtue of such director
being a member of a committee of the Board of Directors), or if the Company is
not an NYSE listed company, such other exchange or trading system on which
the Company is primarily listed.

  



  

 _Seventh_ : Any action required to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders
of the Corporation, or any action that may be taken at a meeting of the
stockholders, may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing setting
forth the action so taken shall be signed by all of the stockholders entitled
to vote with respect to the subject matter thereof. This consent shall have
the same effect as a unanimous vote of stockholders and may be stated as such
in any document.

  



  

 _Eighth_ : No director shall be personally liable to the Corporation or any
of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a
director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation
thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter
be amended. If the DGCL is amended hereafter to authorize the further
elimination or limitation of the liability of directors, then the liability
of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the
fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as so amended. Any repeal or
modification of this Article EIGHTH shall not adversely affect any right or
protection of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such
repeal or modification with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to
such repeal or modification.

  



  

 _Ninth_ : The Corporation shall indemnify its directors and officers to the
fullest extent authorized or permitted by law, as now or hereafter in effect,
and such right to indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased
to be a director or officer of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit
of his or her heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives;
provided, however, that, except for proceedings to enforce rights to
indemnification, the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any
director or officer (or his or her heirs, executors or personal or legal
representatives) in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated
by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or
consented to by the Board of Directors. The right to indemnification
conferred by this Article NINTH shall include the right to be paid by the
Corporation the expenses incurred in defending or otherwise participating in
any proceeding in advance of its final disposition. The Corporation may, to
the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, provide
rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to employees and
agents of the Corporation similar to those conferred in this Article NINTH to
directors and officers of the Corporation.

  



    

 8

 



    



  

The Corporation shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on
behalf of any person who is or was or has agreed to become a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Corporation against any liability asserted
against him or her and incurred by him or her or on his or her behalf in such
capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such
liability.

  



  

The rights to indemnification and to the advance of expenses conferred in
this Article NINTH shall not be exclusive of any other right any person may
have or hereafter acquire under this Restated Certificate of Incorporation,
the By-Laws of the Corporation, any statute, agreement, vote of stockholders
or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

  



  

Any repeal or modification of this Article NINTH shall not adversely affect
any rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses of a
director or officer of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or
modification with respect to any acts or omissions occurring prior to such
repeal or modification.

  



  

 _Tenth_ : Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred
Stock, special meetings of the stockholders, unless otherwise prescribed by
statute, may be called at any time by (i) the Board of Directors or (ii) the
Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer of the
Corporation, or the Lead Independent Director (if any). The Board of Directors
shall call a special meeting upon written notice to the Secretary of the
Corporation by stockholders representing, as of the close of business on the
day immediately preceding the date of delivery of such notice to the
Corporation, or if applicable, as of any record date set by the Board of
Directors in connection with a solicitation by a stockholder seeking to
request the Board of Directors to call such a meeting, at least (1) 20% of
all of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of Class A Common Stock or (2)
20% of all of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of all of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock, in either case on any issue or business to
be considered at such meeting (the "Requisite Percentage"). Any special
meeting so requested by stockholders shall be held at such place, date
and time as may be fixed from time to time by resolution of the Board of
Directors, provided such special meeting shall be held not later than the
90th day after receipt by the Secretary of the Corporation of the requisite
notice for such meeting, and provided further that the Board of Directors
shall not be required to call a special meeting upon stockholder request if
the Board of Directors calls an annual or special meeting of stockholders to
be held not later than ninety (90) days after the date on which valid
stockholder requests for a special meeting submitted by the Requisite
Percentage of stockholders in accordance with this Article TENTH have been
delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation (the "Delivery Date") and the
purpose(s) of such meeting include the purpose(s) specified by the Requisite
Percentage of stockholders in their request for a special meeting, which
included the purpose(s) specified by the Requisite Percentage of stockholders
in their request for a special meeting, with such determination being made in
good faith by the Board of Directors. For business or a proposal to be
properly brought before a special meeting of stockholders by stockholders,
the stockholders must have given notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of
the Corporation, setting forth, as to each matter the stockholders propose to
bring before a special meeting of stockholders, evidence that
such stockholders owned such shares representing, and are entitled to cast,
not less than 20% of the votes entitled to be cast on such issue or business
to be considered at such meeting, and shall otherwise comply with any notice
and other requirements set forth in the By-Laws. Only such business shall be
conducted as shall have been properly brought before the special meeting as
provided in this Article TENTH, and set forth in the notice of meeting.

  



    

 9

 



    



  

 _Eleventh_ : Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without the
State of Delaware, as the By-Laws may provide. The books of the
Corporation may be kept (subject to any provision contained in the DGCL)
outside the State of Delaware at such place or places as may be
designated from time to time by the Board of Directors or in the By-Laws of
the Corporation.

  



  

 _Twelfth_ : In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred
upon it by the laws of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors shall
have the power to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Corporation's By-Laws,
except as otherwise stated in the By-Laws.

  



  

 _Thirteenth_ : Unless the Corporation otherwise consents to an alternative
forum in writing, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the
sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought
on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of
a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer of the Corporation to the
Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a
claim against the Corporation arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or
the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws or (iv) any action
asserting a claim against the Corporation governed by the internal
affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any
interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to
have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article THIRTEENTH.

  



  

 _Fourteenth_ : The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change,
or repeal any provision contained in this Restated Certificate of
Incorporation but only in the manner now or hereafter prescribed in this
Restated Certificate of Incorporation the Corporation's By-Laws or the DGCL,
and all rights herein conferred upon stockholders are granted subject to such
reservation.

(g) Nothing contained in this Section 6 of this Article II shall be
deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of
nominees for director in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to
Section 17 of this Article II.

  



  

Section 7. _Adjournments_. Any meeting of the stockholders may be
adjourned from time to time by the stockholders entitled to vote thereat,
present in person or represented by proxy, or the Chairman of the meeting to
reconvene at the same or some other place, and notice need not be given of
any such adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, thereof and the
means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and
proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned
meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At
the adjourned meeting, the Corporation may transact any business which might
have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more
than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed
for the adjourned meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting in accordance with
the requirements of Section 4 hereof shall be given to each stockholder of
record entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting.

  



  

Section 8. _Quorum_. Unless otherwise required by applicable law or
the Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of shares of capital stock of

the Corporation's capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote
with respect to the particular matter, present in person or represented by
proxy, shall constitute a quorum of the stockholders for the transaction of
business with respect to such matter. A quorum, once established, shall not be
broken by the withdrawal of holders of enough voting power to leave less than
a quorum. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any
meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat,
present in person or represented by proxy, or the Chairman of the meeting
shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, in the manner
provided in Section 7 hereof, until a quorum shall be present or represented.

  



  

Section 9. _Votin_ g. Unless otherwise required by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, or the rules of any stock
exchange on which the Corporation's shares are listed and traded, any
question brought before any meeting of the stockholders, other than the
election of directors, shall be decided by a majority of the votes cast by the
stockholders entitled to vote thereon who are present in person or
represented by proxy, and where a separate vote by class or series is
required, a majority of the votes cast by the stockholders of such class or
series who are present in person or represented by proxy shall be the act of
such class or series. Except as otherwise provided by law, each stockholder
of record of any series of Preferred Stock shall be entitled at each meeting
of the stockholders to such number of votes, if any, for each share of such
stock as may be fixed in the Certificate of Incorporation or in the
resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board providing for the issuance of
such stock, each stockholder of record of Class B Common Stock (as defined in
the Certificate of Incorporation) shall be entitled at each meeting of the
stockholders to two votes for each such share of such stock and each
stockholder of record of Class A Common Stock (as defined in the
Certificate of Incorporation) shall be entitled at each meeting of the
stockholders to one vote for each share of such stock, in each
case, registered in such stockholder's name on the books of the Corporation
on the date fixed pursuant to Section 13 of Article II of these By-Laws as
the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of
and to vote at such meeting. The Board of Directors, in its discretion, or
the officer of the Corporation presiding at a meeting of the stockholders, may
require that any votes cast at such meeting shall be cast by written ballot.

Section 10. _Proxies_. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a
meeting of the stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate
action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons
to act for such stockholder as proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted upon
after three years from its date, unless such proxy provides for a longer
period. Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize
another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy, the following
shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such
authority:

  



  

(a) A stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person
or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy. Execution may
be accomplished by the stockholder or such stockholder's authorized officer,
director, employee or agent signing such writing or causing such person's
signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means, including,
but not limited to, by facsimile signature.

  



  

(b) A stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for
such stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of
a telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission to the person
who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy
support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who
will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that
any such telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission must
either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be
determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was
authorized by the stockholder. If it is determined that such telegrams,
cablegrams or other electronic transmissions are valid, the inspectors or, if
there are no inspectors, such other persons making that determination shall
specify the information on which they relied.

  



  

Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the
writing or transmission authorizing another person or persons to act as proxy
for a stockholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing
or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or
transmission could be used; provided, however, that such copy, facsimile
telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of
the entire original writing or transmission.

  



  

Section 11. _Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting_. Unless
otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required
to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, or any action
that may be taken at a meeting of the stockholders, may be taken without a
meeting if a consent in writing setting forth the action so taken shall be
signed by all of the stockholders entitled to vote with respect to the
subject matter thereof. This consent shall have the same effect as a
unanimous vote of stockholders and may be stated as such in any document.

Section 12. _List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote_. The officer of
the Corporation who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall
prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of the
stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each
stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any
stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business
hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting (i) on a
reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information
required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the
meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of
business of the Corporation. In the event that the Corporation determines to
make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take
reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to
stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place,
then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting
during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is
present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication,
then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during
the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network,
and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the
notice of the meeting.

  



  

Section 13. _Record Date_.

  



  

(a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of the stockholders or any
adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which
record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the
record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall
not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of
such meeting. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at
a meeting of the stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day
next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at
the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting
is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of the stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the
meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record
date for the adjourned meeting.

  



  

(b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders
entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting or
request that the Board of Directors call a Special Meeting of Stockholders
pursuant to Section 3 of Article II, the Board of Directors may fix a record
date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution
fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date
shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any
stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take
corporate action by written consent or request that the Board of Directors
call a Special Meeting pursuant to Section 3 of Article II shall, by written
notice to the Secretary of the Corporation, request the Board of Directors to
fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events
within ten (10) days after the date on which such a request is
received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has
been fixed by the Board of Directors within ten (10) days of the date on
which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting or
request that the Board of Directors call a Special Meeting pursuant to Section
3 of Article II, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent
setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken or on which a signed
request by a stockholder to call a Special Meeting pursuant to Section 3 of
Article II (as applicable) is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its
registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business,
or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which
proceedings of meetings of the stockholders are recorded, to the attention of
the Secretary of the Corporation. Delivery made to the Corporation's
registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested.

Section 14. _Stock Ledger_. The stock ledger of the Corporation
shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine
the stock ledger, the list required by Section 12 of this Article II or the
books of the Corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of
the stockholders.

  



  

Section 15. _Conduct of Meetings_. The Board of Directors of the
Corporation may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the
conduct of any meeting of the stockholders as it shall deem appropriate.
Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted
by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of any meeting of the
stockholders shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules,
regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of
such Chairman, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such
rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors
or prescribed by the Chairman of the meeting, may include, without limitation,
the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for
the meeting; (ii) the determination of when the polls shall open and close
for any given matter to be voted on at the meeting; (iii) rules and procedures
for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iv)
limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders
of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies
or such other persons as the Chairman of the meeting shall determine; (v)
restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement
thereof; and (vi) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments
by participants.

  



  

Section 16. _Inspectors of Election._ In advance of any meeting
of the stockholders, the Board of Directors, by resolution, the Chairman or
the President shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting and
make a written report thereof. One or more other persons may be designated as
alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no
inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of the stockholders, the
Chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the
meeting. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, inspectors may be
officers, employees or agents of the Corporation. Each inspector,
before entering upon the discharge of the duties of inspector, shall take and
sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict
impartiality and according to the best of such inspector's ability. The
inspector shall have the duties prescribed by law and shall take charge of
the polls and, when the vote is completed, shall make a certificate of the
result of the vote taken and of such other facts as may be required by
applicable law.

(ii) disclosures about the Nominee and the Nominating Stockholder
required under the rules of the SEC or other applicable law to be included
in the proxy statement;

  



    

 | 10| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) any statement included by the Nominating Stockholder in the
Qualified Nomination Notice for inclusion in the proxy statement in
support of the Nominee's election to the Board of Directors (subject, without
limitation, to Section 17(e)(ii) of this Article II), if such statement does
not exceed 500 words; and

  



  

(iv) any other information that the Corporation or the Board of
Directors determines, in its discretion, to include in the proxy
statement relating to the nomination of the Nominee, including, without
limitation, any statement in opposition to the nomination and any of the
information provided pursuant to this Section 17 of this Article II.

  



  

(c) _Maximum Number of Nominees_.

  



  

(i) The Corporation shall not be required to include in the proxy
statement for an Annual Meeting more Nominees than the Maximum Number for
such Annual Meeting. The Maximum Number for a particular Annual Meeting shall
be reduced by: (1) Nominees who are subsequently withdrawn or that the Board
of Directors itself decides to nominate for election at such Annual Meeting,
and (2) the number of incumbent directors who were Nominees with respect to
any of the preceding two Annual Meetings and whose reelection at the
upcoming Annual Meeting is being recommended by the Board of Directors. If
one or more vacancies for any reason occurs on the Board of Directors after
the deadline set forth in Section 17(e) of this Article II, but before the
date of the Annual Meeting, and the Board of Directors resolves to reduce the
size of the Board in connection therewith, the Maximum Number shall be
calculated based on the number of directors in office as so reduced.

  



  

(ii) If the number of Nominees pursuant to this Section 17 of this
Article II for any Annual Meeting exceeds the Maximum Number then,
promptly upon notice from the Corporation, each Nominating Stockholder will
select one Nominee for inclusion in the proxy statement until the Maximum
Number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of the
ownership position as disclosed in each Nominating Stockholder's Qualified
Nomination Notice, with the process repeated if the Maximum Number is not
reached after each Nominating Stockholder has selected one Nominee. If, after
the deadline for submitting a Qualified Nomination Notice as set forth in
Section 17(e) of this Article II, a Nominating Stockholder becomes ineligible
or withdraws its nomination, or a Nominee becomes unwilling to serve on the
Board of Directors, whether before or after the mailing of the definitive
proxy statement, then the nomination shall be disregarded, and the
Corporation: (1) shall not be required to include in its proxy statement or on
any ballot or form of proxy the disregarded Nominee or any successor or
replacement Nominee proposed by the Nominating Stockholder or by any other
Nominating Stockholder, and (2) may otherwise communicate to its stockholders,
including, without limitation, by amending or supplementing its proxy
statement or ballot or form of proxy, that the Nominee will not be included as
a Nominee in the proxy statement or on any ballot or form of proxy and will
not be voted on at the Annual Meeting.

  



  

(d) _Eligibility of Nominating Stockholder_.

  



    

 | 11| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(i) An Eligible Holder or group of up to twenty (20) Eligible
Holders may submit a nomination in accordance with this Section 17 of
this Article II only if the person or group (in the aggregate) has
continuously owned at least the Minimum Number of shares of the Common Stock
(as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends or similar events)
throughout the three (3)-year period preceding, including the date of
submission of, the Qualified Nomination Notice, and continues to own at least
the Minimum Number through the date of the Annual Meeting. A group of funds
under common management and investment control shall be treated as one
Eligible Holder if such Eligible Holder shall provide, together with the
Qualified Nomination Notice, documentation reasonably satisfactory to
the Corporation that demonstrates that the funds are under common management
and investment control. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a
nomination by a group of Eligible Holders, any and all requirements and
obligations for an individual Eligible Holder that are set forth in this
Section 17 of this Article II, including the minimum holding period, shall
apply to each member of such group; provided, however, that the Minimum
Number shall apply to the ownership of the group in the aggregate. If any
stockholder withdraws from a group of Eligible Holders acting together as a
Nominating Stockholder at any time prior to the Annual Meeting, the group of
Eligible Holders shall only be treated as owning the shares held by the
remaining members of the group.

  



  

(ii) For purposes of this Section 17(d) of this Article II, an
Eligible Holder "owns" only those outstanding shares of Common Stock as to
which the Eligible Holder possesses both: (A) the full voting and investment
rights pertaining to the shares; and (B) the full economic interest in
(including the opportunity for profit and risk of loss on) such shares. The
number of shares calculated in accordance with clauses (A) and (B) shall not
include any shares: (1) sold by such Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates
in any transaction that has not been settled or closed, (2) borrowed by such
Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates for any purpose or purchased by such
Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates pursuant to an agreement to resell,
or (3) subject to any option, warrant, forward contract, swap, contract of
sale, other derivative or similar agreement entered into by such
Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates, whether any such instrument or
agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional
amount or value of outstanding shares of Common Stock, in any such case which
instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have, the purpose or effect
of: (x) reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future,
such Eligible Holder's or any of its affiliates' full right to vote or direct
the voting of any such shares, and/or (y) hedging, offsetting, or altering to
any degree, gain or loss arising from the full economic ownership of such
shares by such Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates.

  



  

An Eligible Holder "owns" shares held in the name of a Nominee or other
intermediary, so long as the Eligible Holder retains the right to instruct how
the shares are voted with respect to the election of directors and possesses
the full economic interest (including the opportunity for profit and risk of
loss on) in the shares. An Eligible Holder's ownership of shares shall be
deemed to continue during any period in which the Eligible Holder has
delegated any voting power by means of a proxy, power of attorney, or other
similar instrument or arrangement that is revocable at any time by the
Eligible Holder. The terms "owned," "owning" and other variations of the word
"own" shall have correlative meanings. Whether outstanding shares of Common
Stock are "owned" for these purposes shall be determined by the Board of
Directors, acting in good faith.

  



  

(iii) No person shall be permitted to be in more than one group
constituting a Nominating Stockholder, and if any person appears as a
member of more than one group, it shall be deemed to be a member of the group
that has the largest ownership position as reflected in the Qualified
Nomination Notice.

(e) _Qualified Nomination Notice_. To nominate a Nominee, the

however, that if (and only if) the Annual Meeting is not scheduled to be held

submission of the Qualified Nomination Notice; (H) a representation and
warranty that the Nominating Stockholder will not engage in a "solicitation"

rules) with respect to the Annual Meeting, other than with respect to the

(notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received
by the Corporation), and the Nominating Stockholder may not, after the last
day on which a Qualified Nomination Notice would be timely, cure in any way
any defect preventing the nomination of the Nominee, if: (A) the Nominating

qualified representative thereof, does not appear at the meeting of
stockholders to present the nomination submitted pursuant to this Section 17
of this Article II or the Nominating Stockholder withdraws its nomination; (B)
the Board of Directors, acting in good faith, determines that such Nominee's
nomination or election to the Board of Directors would result in the

Certificate of Incorporation or any applicable law, rule or regulation to
which the Corporation is subject, including any rules or regulations of any
stock exchange on which the Corporation's securities are traded; (C) the

under this Section 17 of this Article II.

Section 17 of this Article II, the Corporation may omit from its proxy
statement, or may supplement or correct, any information, including all or

statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; (B) such
information directly or indirectly impugns character, integrity or personal
reputation of, or directly or indirectly makes charges concerning
improper, illegal or immoral conduct or associations, without factual
foundation, with respect to, any person; or (C) the inclusion of such

ARTICLE III

  

 _DIRECTORS_

  



  

Section 1. _Number; Classification and Election of Directors._

  



  

(a) The Board of Directors shall consist of not less than three (3)
members, the exact number of which shall be fixed from time to time by the
Board of Directors. The directors, other than those who may be elected by the
holders of any series of Preferred Stock, shall be classified, with respect
to the time for which they severally hold office, into three (3) classes, as
nearly equal in number as possible, designated Class I, Class II and Class
III. The directors in Class I shall serve for an initial term expiring at the
Corporation's first Annual Meeting held after the Charter Amendment Effective
Time (as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation), the directors in Class
II shall serve for an initial term expiring at the Corporation's second
Annual Meeting held after the Charter Amendment Effective Time, and the
directors in Class III shall serve for an initial term expiring at the
Corporation's third Annual Meeting held after the Charter Amendment Effective
Time, with each director in a class to hold office until his successor is
elected and qualified, or until such director's earlier death, resignation or
removal. At the Corporation's third Annual Meeting held after the Charter
Amendment Effective Time and at each subsequent Annual Meeting of
Stockholders of the Corporation, the directors (or successors) of the class of
directors whose term expires at that meeting shall be elected to hold office
for a term expiring at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held in the third
year following the year of their election, with each director in a class to
hold office until his successor is elected and qualified, or until
such director's earlier death, resignation or removal.

  



    

 | 16| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Except as otherwise provided as to any series of Preferred Stock
in the Certificate of Incorporation or in the resolution or
resolutions adopted by the Board providing for the issuance of such stock,
newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of
authorized directors, and directorships eliminated as a result of a decrease
in the number of authorized directors, shall be apportioned by the Board of
Directors among Class I, Class II and Class III so that the number of
directorships in Class I, Class II and Class III shall be as nearly equal as
reasonably possible. No decrease in the number of authorized directors shall
shorten the term of any incumbent director.

  



  

(c) Except as provided in Section 2 of this Article III, a nominee
for director shall be elected to the Board of Directors if the votes cast for
such nominee's election exceed the votes cast against such nominee's election;
_provided_ , _however_ , that directors shall be elected by a plurality of
the votes cast at any meeting of stockholders for which the Secretary of
the Corporation determines that the number of nominees exceeds the number of
directors to be elected as of the record date of such meeting.

  



  

(d) At least two-thirds of the directors shall consist of persons
who are not employees of the Corporation or of any subsidiary of
the Corporation, provided that there shall not be at any time more than two
directors who are employees of the Corporation. Should the death, resignation
or other removal of any non-employee director result in the failure of the
requirement set forth in the preceding sentence to be met, such requirement
shall not apply during the time of the vacancy caused by the death,
resignation or removal of any such non-employee director, and the remaining
directors of the Corporation shall cause any such vacancy to be filled
in accordance with these By-Laws within a reasonable period of time. At the
Annual Meeting or a Special Meeting at which directors are to be elected in
accordance with the Corporation's notice of meeting, directors shall be
elected in accordance with the requirements of these By-Laws and the
Certificate of Incorporation.

  



  

(e) To be eligible for election or reelection and to be seated as a
director of the Corporation, a person must agree in advance to abide by (i)
the Corporation's director resignation policy applicable to any director who
fails to receive the required number of votes for reelection in connection
with the Company's majority voting requirements and (ii) the applicable
corporate governance, trading, conflict of interest and confidentiality
policies and guidelines of the Corporation applicable to directors.

  



    

 | 17| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 2. _Vacancies_. Except as otherwise provided as to any
series of Preferred Stock in the Certificate of Incorporation or in the
resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board providing for the issuance of
such stock, vacancies on the Board of Directors arising from a
director's death, resignation or removal and newly created directorships
resulting from an increase in the number of authorized directors may be
filled by a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a
quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Any director chosen in accordance
with the preceding sentence shall hold office until the next election of the
class for which such director shall have been chosen, and until his or her
successor shall be elected and qualified. Unless otherwise required by law or
the Certificate of Incorporation, vacancies on any committee of the Board of
Directors arising from the death, resignation or removal of a member of the
committee and newly created committee memberships resulting from an increase
in the number of authorized members of the committee shall be filled only by
a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a
sole remaining director and any member of a committee of the Board of
Directors so chosen shall hold office until his or her successor is
duly appointed by the Board of Directors or until his or her earlier death,
resignation or removal.

  



  

Section 3. _Duties and Powers_. The business and affairs of the
Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of
Directors which may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all
such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the Certificate of
Incorporation or by these By-Laws required to be exercised or done by the
stockholders.

  



  

Section 4. _Meetings_. The Board of Directors and any committee
thereof may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or without
the State of Delaware. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors or any
committee thereof may be held without notice at such time and at such place
as may from time to time be determined by the Board of Directors or such
committee, respectively. Special Meetings of the Board of Directors may be
called by the Chairman or by a majority of the directors. Special Meetings of
any committee of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman of such
committee, if there be one, or a majority of the directors serving on such
committee. Notice thereof stating the place, date and hour of the meeting
shall be given to each director (or, in the case of a committee, to each
member of such committee) either by mail not less than forty-eight (48) hours
before the date of the meeting, by telephone, telegram or electronic means on
twenty-four (24) hours' notice, or on such shorter notice as the person or
persons calling such meeting may deem necessary or appropriate in the
circumstances.

  



  

Section 5. _Organization_. At each meeting of the Board of
Directors or any committee thereof, the Chairman of the Board of Directors or
the Chairman of such committee, as the case may be, or, in his or her absence
or if there be none, the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors or the Vice
Chairman of such committee, if there be one, or another director chosen by a
majority of the directors present, shall act as chairman of the meeting.
Except as provided below, the Secretary of the Corporation shall act as
secretary at each meeting of the Board of Directors and of each committee
thereof. In case the Secretary shall be absent from any meeting of the Board
of Directors or of any committee thereof, an Assistant Secretary shall
perform the duties of secretary at such meeting; and in the absence from any
such meeting of the Secretary and all the Assistant Secretaries, the chairman
of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the members of each committee of the Board of
Directors may appoint any person to act as secretary of any meeting of such
committee and the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the Corporation
may, but need not if such committee so elects, serve in such capacity.

Section 6. _Resignations and Removals of Directors_. Any director
of the Corporation may resign from the Board of Directors or any committee
thereof at any time, by giving notice in writing or by electronic transmission
to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the
Secretary of the Corporation and, in the case of a committee, to the Chairman
of such committee, if there be one. Such resignation shall take effect at the
time therein specified or, if no time is specified, immediately; and, unless
otherwise specified in such notice, the acceptance of such resignation shall
not be necessary to make it effective. Except as otherwise required by
applicable law and subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of shares of
preferred stock then outstanding, any director or the entire Board of
Directors may be removed from office at any time by the affirmative vote of
the holders of at least a majority in voting power of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in the election
of directors; provided that if the director serving as Chairman of the Board
of Directors is an Independent Director (as defined in the Corporation's
Certificate of Incorporation) then such director, or if the Chairman of the
Board of Directors is not an Independent Director then the director serving as
Lead Independent Director, may only be removed as a director with the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Class A Common
Stock excluding Permitted Holders and Affiliated Persons. Any director
serving on a committee of the Board of Directors may be removed from such
committee at any time by the Board of Directors. "Permitted Holder" shall mean
(i) Jerry Moyes, Vickie Moyes and their respective estates, executors and
conservators, (ii) any trust (including the trustee thereof) established for
the benefit of Jerry Moyes, Vickie Moyes or any children (including adopted
children) thereof, (iii) any such children upon transfer from Jerry Moyes or
Vickie Moyes, or upon distribution from any such trust or from the estates of
Jerry Moyes or Vickie Moyes and (iv) any corporation, limited liability
company or partnership the sole stockholders, members or partners of which are
Permitted Holders. "Affiliated Person" means any entity (other than the
Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation) of which more than 10% of
the capital stock or other equity interests or voting power of which is held
by one or more Permitted Holders, and any director, officer or employee
hereof.

  



  

Section 7. _Quorum_. Except as otherwise required by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation, these By-Laws or the rules and regulations of
any securities exchange or quotation system on which the Corporation's
securities are listed or quoted for trading, at all meetings of the Board of
Directors or any committee thereof, a majority of the entire Board of

Section 10. _Committees_. The Board of Directors may designate one

quotation system on which the securities of the Corporation are listed or
quoted for trading, in the absence or disqualification of a member of a
committee, and in the absence of a designation by the Board of Directors of an
alternate member to replace the absent or disqualified member, the member or
members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting,
whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may unanimously
appoint another qualified member of the Board of Directors to act at the
meeting in the place of any absent or disqualified member. Any committee, to

committee, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the
Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the
Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to
all papers which may require it. Each committee shall keep regular minutes and
report to the Board of Directors when required. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Article III, the resolution of the Board of
Directors establishing any committee of the Board of Directors and/or the
charter of any such committee may establish requirements or procedures
relating to the governance and/or operation of such committee that are
different from, or in addition to, those set forth in these By-Laws and, to
the extent that there is any inconsistency between these By-Laws and any such
resolution or charter, the terms of such resolution or charter shall be
controlling.

Board of Directors, from time to time, determines appropriate. Nothing in
these By-Laws shall preclude the paying by the Corporation of a salary or
other compensation to an officer or employee who is also a director.

between the Corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or
between the Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association or
other organization in which one or more of its directors or officers are
directors or officers or have a financial interest, shall be void or
voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is
present at or participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or
committee thereof which authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely
because any such director's or officer's vote is counted for such purpose if:
(i) the material facts as to the director's or officer's relationship or
interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to
the Board of Directors or the committee, and the Board of Directors or

as to the director's or officer's relationship or interest and as to the
contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the
stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is
specifically approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or (iii) the
contract or transaction is fair as to the Corporation as of the time it is
authorized, approved or ratified by the Board of Directors, a committee
thereof or the stockholders. Common or interested directors may be counted in
determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors
or of a committee which authorizes the contract or transaction. In addition

Affiliated Person shall be subject to the provisions of Article SIXTH of the

Chairman of the Board may be exercised by the Lead Independent Director, if
there be one, or another independent director designated for this purpose
by the Board of Directors. The Chairman of the Board of Directors shall also
perform such other duties and may exercise such other powers as may from time
to time be assigned by these By-Laws or by the Board of Directors, and shall

gross negligence or willful misconduct with respect to the Corporation, (2)

not fulfilling his or her responsibilities in a manner that is in the best
interests of the Corporation and its stockholders.

as may from time to time be assigned by these By-Laws or by the Board of
Directors, and shall have the authority to sign such contracts, certificates
and other instruments of the Corporation as may be authorized by the Board of
Directors. The Lead Independent Director may be removed from his office as
Lead Independent Director only with the affirmative vote of a majority of the
Independent Directors and only for the following reasons: (1) gross negligence
or willful misconduct with respect to the Corporation, (2) breach of a
fiduciary duty to the Corporation and its stockholders or (3) a determination
by a majority of the Independent Directors that the Lead Independent Director

respect to certificated shares of stock, every certificate exchanged,

ARTICLE VI 
  _NOTICES_

  



  

Section 1. _Notices_. Whenever written notice is required by law,
the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, to be given to any
director, member of a committee or stockholder, such notice may be given by
mail, addressed to such director, member of a committee or stockholder, at
such person's address as it appears on the records of the Corporation, with
postage thereon prepaid, and such notice shall be deemed to be given at the
time when the same shall be deposited in the United States mail. Without
limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to
stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation
under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws shall
be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission if consented to by
the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent shall be
revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the Corporation. Any such
consent shall be deemed to be revoked if (i) the Corporation is unable to
deliver by electronic transmission two (2) consecutive notices by the
Corporation in accordance with such consent and (ii) such inability becomes
known to the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Corporation or to the
transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice;
provided, however, that the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a
revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. Notice given by
electronic transmission, as described above, shall be deemed given: (i) if by
facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the
stockholder has consented to receive notice; (ii) if by electronic mail, when
directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented
to receive notice; (iii) if by a posting on an electronic network, together
with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the
later of (A) such posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and
(iv) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the
stockholder. Notice to directors or committee members may be given personally
or by telegram, telex, cable or by means of electronic transmission.

  



  

Section 2. _Waivers of Notice_. Whenever any notice is required by
applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, to be
given to any director, member of a committee or stockholder, a waiver thereof
in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to notice, or a waiver
by electronic transmission by the person or persons entitled to notice,
whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent
thereto. Attendance of a person at a meeting, present in person or
represented by proxy, shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting,
except where the person attends the meeting for the express purpose of
objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business
because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business
to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any Annual or Special Meeting of
Stockholders or any regular or Special Meeting of the directors or members of
a committee of directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice
unless so required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws.

ARTICLE VIII 
  _INDEMNIFICATION_

  



  

Section 1. _Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings
other than Those by or in the Right of the Corporation_. Subject to Section 3
of this Article VIII, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is
a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the
Corporation), by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the
Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such
person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted
in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such
person's conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or
proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo
contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that
the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
reasonable cause to believe that such person's conduct was unlawful.

Section 2. _Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings by
or in the Right of the Corporation_. Subject to Section 3 of this Article
VIII, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action
or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its
favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer
of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or
settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a
manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in
respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been
adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such
action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the
adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case,
such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses
which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.

  



  

Section 3. _Authorization of Indemnification_. Any indemnification
under this Article VIII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the
Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that
indemnification of the present or former director or officer is proper in the
circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct
set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be.
Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a director
or officer at the time of such determination, (i) by a majority vote of the
directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though
less than a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by a
majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if
there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent
legal counsel in a written opinion or (iv) by the stockholders. Such
determination shall be made, with respect to former directors and officers,
by any person or persons having the authority to act on the matter on behalf
of the Corporation. To the extent, however, that a present or former director
or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise
in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above, or in defense of
any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against
expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such
person in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the
specific case.

  



  

Section 4. _Good Faith Defined_. For purposes of any determination
under Section 3 of this Article VIII, a person shall be deemed to have acted
in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe
such person's conduct was unlawful, if such person's action is based on the
records or books of account of the Corporation or another enterprise, or on
information supplied to such person by the officers of the Corporation or
another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal
counsel for the Corporation or another enterprise or on information or
records given or reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an
independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert
selected with reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise. The
provisions of this Section 4 shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit
in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met
the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of
this Article VIII, as the case may be.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 5. _Indemnification by a Court_. Notwithstanding any
contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article
VIII, and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any
director or officer may apply to the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware
for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Section 1 or
Section 2 of this Article VIII. The basis of such indemnification by a court
shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the director or
officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this
Article VIII, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the
specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII nor the absence of any
determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a
presumption that the director or officer seeking indemnification has not met
any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for
indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 shall be given to the Corporation
promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in
part, the director or officer seeking indemnification shall also be entitled
to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application.

  



  

Section 6. _Expenses Payable in Advance_. Expenses (including
attorneys' fees) incurred by a director or officer in defending any civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be
paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action,
suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of
such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be
determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the
Corporation as authorized in this Article VIII. Such expenses (including
attorneys' fees) incurred by former directors and officers or other employees
and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the
Corporation deems appropriate.

  



  

Section 7. _Non-exclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of
Expenses_. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or
granted pursuant to, this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of
expenses may be entitled under the Certificate of Incorporation, these By-
Laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or
otherwise, both as to action in such person's official capacity and as to
action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of
the Corporation that indemnification of the persons specified in Section 1
and Section 2 of this Article VIII shall be made to the fullest extent
permitted by law. The provisions of this Article VIII shall not be deemed to
preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in Section 1
or Section 2 of this Article VIII but whom the Corporation has the power or
obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the DGCL, or otherwise.

  



  

Section 8. _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the
Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at
the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such
person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such,
whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to
indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this
Article VIII.

Section 9. _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this Article
VIII, references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the
resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent
of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its
separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to
indemnify its directors or officers, so that any person who is or was a
director or officer of such constituent corporation, or is or was a director
or officer of such constituent corporation serving at the request of such
constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall
stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VIII with
respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have
with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had
continued. The term "another enterprise" as used in this Article VIII shall
mean any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at
the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent. For
purposes of this Article VIII, references to "fines" shall include any excise
taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and
references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any
service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which
imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director or officer with
respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a
person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably
believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an
employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed
to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred to in this Article
VIII.

  



  

Section 10. _Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of
Expenses_. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or
granted pursuant to, this Article VIII shall, unless otherwise provided when
authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors
and administrators of such a person.

  



  

Section 11. _Limitation on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Article VIII to the contrary, except for
proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification (which shall be governed by
Section 5 of this Article VIII), the Corporation shall not be obligated to
indemnify any director or officer (or his or her heirs, executors or
personal or legal representatives) or advance expenses in connection with a
proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding
(or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the Board of Directors of
the Corporation.

  



  

Section 12. _Indemnification of Employees and Agents_. The
Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of
Directors, provide rights to indemnification and to the advancement of
expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation similar to those
conferred in this Article VIII to directors and officers of the Corporation.

Section 5. _Capital Stock_

    



  

5.1 _Payment for Shares_. The consideration for the issuance of
shares may be paid, in whole or in part, in money, in other property,
tangible or intangible, or in labor or services actually performed for the
Corporation. When payment of the consideration for which shares are to be
issued shall have been received by the Corporation, such shares shall be
deemed to be fully paid and nonassessable. Neither promissory notes nor
future services shall constitute consideration for the issuance of shares. In
the absence of fraud in the transaction, the judgment of the Board of
Directors as to the value of the consideration received for shares shall be
final and conclusive. No share shall be issued until fully paid.

  



  

5.2 _Certificates Representing Shares_. The capital stock of the
Corporation shall be issued in book entry form only, unless the Board of
Directors determines otherwise. If the Board of Directors determines that
stock shall be represented by certificates, then each holder of capital stock
of the Corporation shall be entitled to a certificate signed by the President
and the Secretary of the Corporation, certifying the number of shares owned
by him or her in the Corporation.

  



  

5.3 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. The Corporation
shall issue a new stock certificate in place of any certificate
theretofore issued where the holder of record of the certificate:

  



  

(1) Makes proof in affidavit form that the certificate has been lost,
destroyed or wrongfully taken;

  



  

(2) Requests the issuance of a new certificate before the Corporation
has notice that the certificate has been acquired by a purchaser for value in
good faith and without notice of any adverse claim;

  



  

(3) Gives a bond in such form and with such surety as the Corporation
may direct, to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made
on account of the alleged loss, destruction, or theft of the certificate; and

  



    

6

 



    



  

(4) Satisfies any other reasonable requirement imposed by the
Corporation.

  



  

When a certificate has been lost, apparently destroyed, or wrongfully taken
and the holder of record fails to notify the Corporation within a
reasonable time after he or she has notice of it, and the Corporation
registers a transfer of the shares represented by this certificate
before receiving such notification, the holder of record is precluded from
making any claim against the Corporation for the transfer or for a new
certificate.

  



  

5.4 _Purchase of Its Own Shares_. The Corporation may purchase its
own shares of stock from the holders thereof subject to the
limitations imposed by applicable Arizona law with respect thereto.

  



  

5.5 _Dividends_. The Board, in its discretion, may from time to
time declare dividends upon the capital stock from the surplus or net profits

Section 6. _Waiver of Notice_

    



  

Any shareholder, director or officer may waive any notice required to be
given by these Bylaws of any meeting otherwise prescribed hereunder. Any
meeting at which all shareholders or directors are present (or with respect
to which notice is waived by any absent shareholder or director) may be held
at any time for any purpose and at any place and shall be deemed to have been
validly called and held, and all acts performed and all business conducted at
such meeting shall be valid in all respects.

Section 7. _Indemnification_

    



  

7.1 _Indemnification_. The Corporation shall indemnify and save
harmless all of its existing and former officers and directors from and
against all expenses incurred by them, including, but not limited to, legal
fees, judgments, penalties (to the extent permitted by law), and amounts paid
in settlement or compromise, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law, as
it now exists or may hereafter be amended, in connection with any proceeding,
actual or threatened, to which they may be made a party by reason of their
service to or at the request of the Corporation (including service in their
capacity as officers or service on behalf of affiliates of the Corporation or
with unrelated entities, if serving at the request of the Corporation), unless
it is established that: (i) the act or omission of the indemnified party was
committed in bad faith; (ii) the indemnified party did not believe such act or
omission to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation;
(iii) in the case of any criminal proceeding, the indemnified party
had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful; or
(iv) the indemnified party is adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless
a court of competent jurisdiction determines that such person is entitled to
indemnity. The Corporation shall advance to any director or officer seeking
indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.1, or reimburse a director or
officer, for expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and reasonably
incurred in investigating or defending any civil or criminal action, suit or
proceeding in advance of any final disposition of such action, suit or
proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or
officer seeking indemnification (i) attesting to the fact that such director
or officer is entitled to indemnification hereunder and under the applicable
legal standards, and (ii) agreeing to repay such amount, if it is
ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the
Corporation. If the Corporation is requested to indemnify an existing or
former director or officer in connection with any threatened, pending or
completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure
judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person was a director,
officer, or employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation in such capacity, the Corporation shall
indemnify such person against expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually
and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the defense or
settlement of such action or suit, if such person acted in good faith and in a
manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests
of the Corporation. No indemnification shall be made in respect to any claim,
issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable
to the Corporation, unless and only to the extent that a court in which such
action or suit was brought shall determine, upon application, that despite the
adjudication of liability, but in view of all circumstances of the case, such
person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses
which the court shall deem to be proper. No indemnification shall be made if
a director or officer is determined in any proceeding to have received an
improper financial benefit, whether or not involving actions by such person in
his or her official capacity as such, the director or officer intentionally
inflicted harm on the Corporation or its shareholders, violated A.R.S. Section
10-833, or intentionally violated criminal law.

  



  

7.2 _Determination by Board_. Whenever any existing or former
director or officer shall report to the President that he or she has incurred
or may incur expenses described in Section 7.1, the Board of Directors
(excluding any interested director) shall, at its next regular meeting or at
a special meeting held within a reasonable time thereafter, determine whether,
in regard to the matter involved, the person in question is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 7.1. If the Board determines that the
standards of Section 7.1 are met, indemnification shall be made. If the Board
of Directors refuses to indemnify a person who is determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be entitled to indemnification under Section 7.1 or
applicable law, the Corporation shall, in addition to extending such
indemnification, reimburse the person entitled to indemnification for all
attorneys' fees and costs of court actually incurred. The Corporation shall
have the right to refuse indemnification in any instance in which the person
to whom indemnification would otherwise have been extended unreasonably
refuses to cooperate in the investigation or defense of such matter or to
permit the Corporation, at its own expense, to retain counsel of its own
choosing to defend him or her.

  



  

7.3 _Indemnification Agreement_. The Board of Directors may
authorize the Corporation to indemnify directors, officers, or employees to
the fullest extent permitted by law including through agreements and
insurance.

  



  

7.4 _Non-Exclusivity_. The indemnification rights contained in
this Section 7 shall not be exclusive of or preclude any other rights of
indemnification to which a director, officer, employee or agent may be
entitled, whether pursuant to law or agreement.

Section 8. _Amendment and Repeal_

    



  

These Bylaws may be amended or repealed or new Bylaws may be adopted by the
Board of Directors in such instance as the Board may determine to be
advisable; provided, however, that the provisions of Section 7 shall not be
amended except with the consent of a sixty-seven percent (67%) majority of
the Board of Directors. No notice need be given of any action concerning these
Bylaws previous to any such meeting, if the proposed amendment, repeal or
adoption of new Bylaws is one of necessity arising at such meeting, and is in
furtherance of the legitimate aims of the Corporation. In all other
situations, unless properly waived, notice of any meeting at which any action
concerning the Bylaws is proposed shall be mailed to all directors at least
ten days prior to such meeting, and in the same manner prescribed for giving
notice of special meetings of the Board of Directors. Such notice shall state
in general terms the nature of any proposed action concerning the Bylaws.

  



  

Section 9. _Effective Date_
