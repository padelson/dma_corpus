 **8.**

|

 **GUARANTEE** 

---|--- 

8.1

|

 **The CPG Guarantee and CPG Guarantor Warranties** 

---|--- 
|

8.1.1

|

The CPG Guarantor hereby: 

---|---|--- 
|

(a)

|

absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Buyer the prompt
and full discharge by the Sellers of all of the liabilities and obligations of
the Sellers under this Deed (including, without limitation, pursuant to
Clauses 2, 3, 6.1, 7 and 9) and any other Transaction Document (the " **CPG
Obligations** ") in accordance with the terms hereof (the " **CPG Guarantee**
"); and 

---|---|--- 
|

(b)

|

agrees that if the Sellers fail to perform and timely discharge all or any of
the CPG Obligations, the CPG Guarantor shall, upon demand perform or discharge
the same. 

---|---|--- 
|

8.1.2

|

The CPG Guarantor acknowledges that the CPG Guarantee is an absolute and
unconditional guarantee of payment and performance and not merely of
collection. 

---|---|--- 
|

8.1.3

|

The CPG Guarantor as principal obligor and as a separate and independent
obligation and liability from its obligations and liabilities under this
Clause 8 agrees to indemnify and keep indemnified the Buyer in full and on
demand from and against all and any losses, cost, claims, liabilities,
damages, demands and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) suffered or
incurred 

---|---|--- by the Buyer arising out of, or in connection with, the enforcement of the CPG
Guarantee and any failure of the Sellers (or their respective successor in
interest) to perform or discharge any of the obligations.

|

8.1.4

|

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the CPG Guarantor waives diligence,
protest, notice of protest, presentment, demand of payment, notice of
dishonour and all other suretyship defences other than the defence of actual
payment and/or performance. No beneficiary of the CPG Guarantee shall be
obligated to file any claim relating to the CPG Obligations in the event that
any of the Sellers becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar
proceeding, and the failure to so file shall not affect the CPG Guarantor's
obligations hereunder. 

---|---|--- 
|

8.1.5

|

The CPG Guarantor's liability under the CPG Guarantee shall not be affected by
any waiver, concession, allowance of time, compromise or forbearance given to,
or made with, the Sellers (or any successor in interest). 

---|---|--- 
|

8.1.6

|

Where an obligation of any of the Sellers has arisen and/or a liability of the
Sellers has been incurred and any such obligation or liability remain
unsatisfied, the beneficiaries of the CPG Guarantee do not have to pursue any
remedy against the Sellers (or its successor in interest) before proceeding
against the CPG Guarantor under the CPG Guarantee. As long as any liability
incurred by the Sellers (or their respective successor in interest) to the
Buyer guaranteed under the CPG Guarantee remains unsatisfied, the CPG
Guarantor shall not, in respect of any payment made or liability arising under
the CPG Guarantee, effect (or try to effect) any recovery from the Sellers (or
their respective successor in interest), whether by receipt of money, set-off,
proof of debt, enforcement of security or otherwise. For the avoidance of
doubt, any demand under the CPG Guarantee shall be made after the dispute
resolution mechanism available to the Buyer under this Deed against the
Sellers has first been exhausted. 

---|---|--- 
|

8.1.7

|

The CPG Guarantor agrees that the CPG Guarantee constitutes a continuing
guarantee and will remain in full force and effect by way of a continuing
security regardless of any intermediate payment for discharge in whole or in
part until no sum remains payable (or could be required to be paid) by the
Sellers to the Buyer in respect of the CPG Obligations. The CPG Guarantee may
be enforced as many times as may be necessary to enforce the CPG Obligations.

 **The NVAX Guarantee and NVAX Guarantor Warranties** 

---|--- 
|

8.2.1

|

The NVAX Guarantor hereby: 

---|---|--- 
|

(a)

|

absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Sellers the
prompt and full discharge by the Buyer of the payment obligations of the Buyer
in respect of the Purchase Price in accordance with the terms hereof (the "
**NVAX Obligations** ") (the " **NVAX Guarantee** "); and 

---|---|--- 
|

(b)

|

agrees that if the Buyer shall fail to perform and timely discharge all or any
of the NVAX Obligations, the NVAX Guarantor shall, upon demand perform or
discharge the same. 

---|---|--- 
|

8.2.2

|

The NVAX Guarantor acknowledges that the NVAX Guarantee is an absolute and
unconditional guarantee of payment and not merely of collection. 

---|---|--- 
|

8.2.3

|

The NVAX Guarantor as principal obligor and as a separate and independent
obligation and liability from its obligations and liabilities under this
Clause 8 agrees to indemnify and keep indemnified the Buyer in full and on
demand from and against all and any losses, cost, claims, liabilities,
damages, demands and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) suffered or
incurred by the Sellers arising out of, or in connection with, the enforcement
of the NVAX Guarantee and any failure of the Buyer (or its successor in
interest) to perform or discharge any of the obligations. 

---|---|--- 
|

8.2.4

|

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the NVAX Guarantor waives diligence,
protest, notice of protest, presentment, demand of payment, notice of
dishonour and all other suretyship defences other than the defence of actual 

---|---|--- payment and/or performance. No beneficiary of the NVAX Guarantee shall be
obligated to file any claim relating to the NVAX Obligations in the event that

proceeding, and the failure to so file shall not affect the NVAX Guarantor's
obligations hereunder.

|

8.2.5

|

The NVAX Guarantor's liability under the NVAX Guarantee shall not be affected
by any waiver, concession, allowance of time, compromise or forbearance given
to, or made with, the Buyer (or any successor in interest). 

---|---|--- 
|

8.2.6

|

Where an obligation of any of the Buyer has arisen and/or a liability of the
Buyer has been incurred and any such obligation or liability remain
unsatisfied, the beneficiaries of the NVAX Guarantee do not have to pursue any
remedy against the Buyer (or its successor in interest) before proceeding
against the NVAX Guarantor under the NVAX Guarantee. As long as any liability
incurred by the Buyer (or its successor in interest) to the Buyer guaranteed
under the NVAX Guarantee remains unsatisfied, the NVAX Guarantor shall not, in
respect of any payment made or liability arising under the NVAX Guarantee,
effect (or try to effect) any recovery from the Buyer (or its successor in
interest), whether by receipt of money, set-off, proof of debt, enforcement of
security or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, any demand under the NVAX
Guarantee shall be made after the dispute resolution mechanism available to
the Sellers under this Deed against the Buyer has first been exhausted. 

---|---|--- 
|

8.2.7

|

The NVAX Guarantor agrees that the NVAX Guarantee constitutes a continuing
guarantee and will remain in full force and effect by way of a continuing
security regardless of any intermediate payment for discharge in whole or in

Buyer to the Sellers in respect of the NVAX Obligations. The NVAX Guarantee
may be enforced as many times as may be necessary to enforce the NVAX
Obligations but the Sellers shall in no event be entitled to seek an amount in
excess of the payment obligations of the Buyer in respect of the Purchase
Price payable in accordance with the terms of this Deed. Furthermore, the
NVAX Guarantor's obligations under the NVAX Guarantee are additional to, and
not in substitution for, any security or other guarantee or indemnity at any
time existing in favour of any person, whether from or by the NVAX Guarantor
or otherwise and whether in respect of the same or similar obligations or
otherwise. The Parties agree that the NVAX Guarantee shall terminate and cease
to have any effect whatsoever in the event the this Deed is terminated (and
there is no NVAX Obligation outstanding as at termination), and/or the
Purchase Price has been paid by on or behalf of the Buyer.

|

this Deed and any of the Transaction Documents to be executed by it will, when
executed, constitute lawful, valid and binding obligations on it in accordance
with their respective terms; 

---|---|--- 
|

(c)

|

the execution and delivery of this Deed (and any of the Transaction Documents
to be executed by it) and the performance of and compliance with their terms

1.2

|

The Sellers shall not be liable in respect of a Business Warranty Claim unless
and until: 

---|--- 
|

(a)

|

the amount of each individual Business Warranty Claim exceeds [***], in which
event, subject to paragraph 1.2(b), the Sellers' liability, in respect of such
Business Warranty Claim, shall be for the total amount of such Business

purpose, a number of Business Warranty Claims arising out of the same, related
or similar matters, facts or circumstance shall be aggregated and form a
single Business Warranty Claim); and 

---|---|--- 
|

(b)

|

the aggregate amount of all Business Warranty Claims against the Sellers

---|--- 

2.

|

 **Time Limits for Claims**

in the case of a Tax Claim on or prior to [***]; and 

---|---|--- 
|

(b)

|

Completion Date, 

---|---|--- 

2.2

|

Following the giving of Notice under paragraph 2.1(b): 

---|--- 
|

(a)

|

where the claim arises by reason of a liability of the Buyer or a member of
the NVAX Group, which at the time of service of the notice, is contingent only

commenced within [***] of such claim ceasing to be contingent or becoming
capable of being quantified; or 

---|---|--- 
|

(b)

|

where the claim does not fall within paragraph 2.2(a) above, the liability of
the Sellers shall determine, if legal proceedings have not been commenced
within [***] of the service of such notice. 

---|---|--- 2.3

|

The Notice shall provide reasonable details (to the extent that such details
are known to the Buyer) of the nature of the Business Warranty Claim or Tax
Claim (as the case may be), the circumstances that have given rise to it, the
calculation of the amount claimed (so far as it is possible for the Buyer to
calculate such amount), references to the particular provision of this Deed,
in each case on a without prejudice basis, and reasonable documentation (if
available) evidencing the Business Warranty Claim (provided that any failure
by the Buyer to provide any of such details shall not prejudice the Business
Warranty Claim or Tax Claim in question). 

---|--- 

2.4

|

Without prejudice to any remedies available to the Buyer except as expressly
provided in this Deed, the Buyer shall provide the Sellers with a reasonable
period of at least [***] for assessment of the Notice and/or the alleged

reasonable satisfaction of the Buyer to the extent that the relevant breach is
capable of remedy and without any loss to any NVAX Group Company. 

---|--- 

2.5

|

Nothing in this Schedule 7 shall have the effect of limiting or restricting
any liability in respect of a claim resulting from fraud, fraudulent
misrepresentation, dishonesty or wilful concealment. 

---|--- 

3.

|

 **Double Claims** 

---|--- 

If the same fact, matter, event or circumstance gives rise to more than one
claim for breach of any Business Warranties of this Deed, the Buyer shall not

4.

|

 **Changes and/or after Completion and other Exclusions** 

---|--- 

4.1

|

The Sellers shall not be liable for any claim or to the extent that it arises,

to correct an improper policy or practice. 

---|---|--- 

4.2

|

The Sellers shall not be liable for any Business Warranty Claim or Tax
Warranty Claim to the extent that: 

---|--- 
|

(a)

|

the Sellers remedy such claim to the reasonable satisfaction of the Buyer
without any loss to the Company or any member of the NVAX Group within [***]
of the notice of the relevant claim; or 

---|---|--- |

(b)

|

such claim directly and solely arises as a result of any voluntary act,
omission, transaction or arrangement carried out by, at the written request
of, or with the written approval of the Buyer save where such action act,
omission, transaction or arrangement was taken, made or entered into to comply
with applicable laws, regulation and the rules of any Governmental Entity
and/or any contractual obligation binding on the NVAX Group. 

---|---|--- 

5.

|

 **Reimbursement of Claims** 

---|--- 

5.1

|

If, after the Sellers have made any payment in respect of a Business Warranty
Claim, the Buyer recovers from a third party a cash sum which is directly

forthwith repay (or procure the repayment of) to the Sellers so much of the
Recovery Amount (less any Taxes incurred in relation thereto and all
reasonable costs, charges and expenses incurred in making such recovery) as
does not exceed [***]. 

---|--- 

5.2

|

If the Buyer or the Company becomes entitled to recover from some other person
any sum in respect of any matter giving rise to a Business Warranty Claim made
by the Buyer against the Sellers for a breach of any Business Warranties, the
Buyer shall and shall procure that the Company shall take reasonable steps to
enforce such recovery and shall repay to the Sellers the amount paid by it to
the Buyer or the Company up to, but not exceeding, the sum recovered from such
other person less any Taxes incurred in relation thereto and any actual or
projected increased costs in obtaining insurance which the Buyer reasonably
determines are directly or indirectly attributable to the fact(s) or matter(s)
giving rise to such Warranty Claim. 

---|--- 

6.

|

 **Mitigation** 

---|--- 

Nothing in this Schedule 7 will in any way restrict or limit the general
obligation of the Buyer (or the relevant members of the NVAX Group) to
mitigate any loss or damage which it may suffer as a result of any matter
giving rise to any Warranty Claim.

7.

|

 **Insurance** 

---|--- 

If at any time after Completion the Sellers wish to insure all or any part of
its liability in respect of any Business Warranty Claim, the Buyer shall
provide such information as the Sellers or any prospective insurer or broker
may reasonably require for the purposes of effecting such insurance subject to
such insurer or broker providing confidentiality undertakings in favour of the
Company and/or the Buyer to the reasonable satisfaction of the Buyer and
provided always that the Buyer shall not be required to provide any
information which reasonably breach or endanger the Buyer's (or any member of
the NVAX's Group's) legal privilege. **Certain Schedules Omitted from Share Purchase Agreement**
