the Closing; provided that, subject to _Article VII_ and _Article VIII_ , the
Closing shall occur notwithstanding the foregoing without any adjustment to
the Closing Cash Consideration on account thereof.

(b) For no later than nine (9) months following the Closing, each Seller and
the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cooperate with
each other, to obtain any such required consent, authorization, approval or
waiver, or any release, substitution or amendment required to novate all
liabilities and obligations under such Assumed Platform Contracts or to
obtain in writing the unconditional release of such Seller (or Affiliate
thereof) which is party to such arrangements, so that, in any case, the Buyer
shall be solely responsible for such liabilities and obligations from and
after the Closing Date; provided, however, that neither any Seller nor Buyer
shall be required to pay any consideration therefor. Once such consent,
authorization, approval, waiver, release, substitution or amendment is
obtained, the Seller shall assign, transfer, convey and deliver to the Buyer

approval, waiver, release, substitution or amendment relates for no additional
consideration.

the economic and operational benefits (including the exercise of rights) under
such Assumed Platform Contracts, (b) the Buyer, as agent or subcontractor for
the applicable Seller, shall perform and fully discharge the liabilities and
obligations of such Seller arising under or in connection with such Assumed
Platform Contracts and (c) each Seller shall, to the extent permitted by Law
and at the Buyers expense, (i) hold all monies received thereunder in trust

contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) of any material litigation, arbitration
or administrative hearing, or any written threat to commence any of the
foregoing, concerning or relating to any Assumed Platform Assets or the
operation thereof or any other material occurrence with respect to any Assumed

knowledge of any matter that may make the timely satisfaction of any of the
conditions to such Sellers obligation to proceed to the Closing impossible or

Subsidiaries and its Affiliates will promptly cease any existing discussions
or negotiations with any Persons (other than the Buyer and its

promptly notify the Buyer upon receipt of any bid, offer or proposal it
receives with respect to any Seller, its respective Subsidiaries or the
Assumed Platform Assets or any other transaction inconsistent with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 6.7. _Confidentiality_. For a period of one year following the
Closing, each Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, directors,

Liabilities and such Confidential Information shall not be disclosed or used
by any Seller or any Seller Representative without the Buyers prior written
consent unless required to disclose such Confidential Information pursuant to
any applicable Law, legal process or request by any Governmental Entity. If
any Seller or Seller Representative becomes legally compelled to disclose any
such information or documents as referred to in this _Section 6.7_, such
Seller shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law or legal process,
provide the Buyer with prompt written notice before such disclosure to enable
the Buyer either to seek, at its expense, a protective order or other
appropriate remedy preventing or prohibiting such disclosure or to waive
compliance with the provisions of this _Section 6.7_ or both.

or its designee. Each party shall cooperate with the other parties and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to set up procedures and notifications as are
reasonably necessary or advisable to effectuate the transfers contemplated by
this  _Section 6.8_. The party whose such Assumed Platform Asset or asset
was misallocated, shall promptly reimburse the other party (and/or its
applicable Affiliate(s)) for any reasonable documented out-of-pocket costs 

 



-21-  or expenses reasonably incurred by the party who received or retained such
misallocated assets (or such Affiliate(s)) in connection with actions taken in
compliance with this  _Section 6.8_.

Section 6.9. _Use of Name_. Effective as of the Closing Date, none of the

the sole and exclusive property of the Buyer. None of the Sellers, nor any of
their Affiliates, shall use, seek to register, register or authorize others to

will automatically be terminated upon the valid termination of the Other
Purchase Agreements.

(b) If, pursuant to the Other Purchase Agreements, the Buyer elects to extend
the Buyer Outside Date (as defined in the Other Purchase Agreements) until
the Buyer Extended Outside Date (as defined in the Other Purchase Agreements),
the Buyer shall deliver written notice to the Sellers and deliver a cash
payment in the amount of One Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($125,000)
to the Escrow Agent prior to December 15, 2014, and if, pursuant to the Other

Date until January 31, 2015 or such later date as the Parties may agree in

additional cash payment in the amount of One Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand
Dollars ($125,000) to the Escrow Agent prior to the Buyer Extended
Outside Date, in each case with such cash payment becoming part of the
Deposit pursuant to, and to be held in accordance with, _Section 3.2_.

 



-24- Section 9.2. _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section
9.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no
liability or obligation on the part of any party hereto or, to the extent
applicable, their respective officers, directors, stockholders, members or
Affiliates, except the terms set forth in this _Article IX_ and _Article X_
shall survive any such termination of this Agreement.

(b) If this Agreement shall terminate pursuant to the terms of this  _Article
IX_ , the Deposit shall be disbursed to the Sellers (in accordance with
_Schedule 2.3(b)_ ) or the Buyer at the same time, and in the same manner, in
which the Deposits (only for the purposes of this term, as defined in the
Other Purchase Agreements) under the Other Purchase Agreements shall be
disbursed to the Sellers (only for purposes of this term, as defined in the
Other Purchase Agreements) or the Buyer (only for purposes of this term, as
defined in the Other Purchase Agreements), respectively, pursuant to the
terms thereof, and the Buyer and the Sellers shall provide joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent, instructing the Escrow Agent to so disburse
the Deposit. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Sellers right to receive the Deposit when payable shall constitute the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Seller and any of its Subsidiaries, and
Representatives against the Buyer, any of its former, current and
future equityholders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees,
agents, Representatives, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited
partners, or assignees (or any former, current or future equityholder,
controlling person, director, officer, employee, agent, Representative
(including any financing source), Affiliate, member, manager, general or
limited partner, or assignee of any of the foregoing) (each, a " _Non-Recourse
Party_ ") for all losses suffered as a result of the failure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach
or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount,
none of the Buyer or any Non-Recourse Party shall have any further liability
or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this _Section 9.2(b)_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, that the damages resulting from termination of this
Agreement under circumstances where the Seller is entitled to the Deposit are
uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and that the delivery of the
Deposit is not a penalty but rather shall constitute liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate the Seller in the circumstances where
the Seller is entitled to the Deposit for the efforts and resources expended
and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance
on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, the
Seller would not enter into this Agreement.

 

(c) In the event that the Buyer terminates any Other Purchase Agreement
pursuant to _Section 10.1(e)_ thereof, the Seller shall pay to the Buyer an
amount equal to the documented, actual and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by Buyer in connection with the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement up to a maximum of Sixty Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars
($62,500); provided that the foregoing shall not limit the Buyers right to
commence a suit against the Seller for monetary damages if the Seller commits
an intentional or willful breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement and as a result Buyers
ability to close the transactions contemplated hereunder is inhibited.

modified, and any of the terms, covenants, representations, warranties or
conditions hereof may be waived, only by a written instrument executed by the
Buyer and each Seller, or in the case of a waiver, by the party or parties
waiving compliance. Any waiver by any party of any condition, or of the
breach of any provision, term, covenant, representation or warranty contained
in this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall not be deemed to be nor
construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such condition, or of the

this Agreement.

Section 10.8. _Public Announcements_. Except as required by Law or the rules
of any stock exchange on which the securities of the Buyer or its Affiliates
are listed and except with respect to the Buyers, direct or indirect,
investors, no party hereto shall make any press release or public

Section 10.9. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement together with the
Confidentiality Agreement and other Transaction Documents and the schedules

Agreement on any Persons other than parties hereto and their respective heirs,
legal representatives, successors and permitted assigns.

 



-28- Section 10.11. _Scheduled Disclosures_. Disclosure of any item on any Schedule
shall not constitute an admission or indication that such item or matter is
material or would have a Material Adverse Effect, it being expressly
acknowledged that items may be included in the Disclosure Schedule that are
not material in order to avoid any misunderstanding, and such inclusion, or
any references to dollar amounts, shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgement
or representation that such items are material, to establish any standard of
materiality or to define further the meaning of such terms for purposes of
this Agreement. No disclosure on a Schedule relating to a possible breach or
violation of any Contract, Law or order shall be construed as an admission or
indication that breach or violation exists or has actually
occurred. Disclosure of any matter, fact or circumstance in a Section of the
Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be disclosure thereof for purposes
of any other Section of the Disclosure Schedule, except to the extent (a) that

that the matters, facts or circumstances disclosed therein are applicable to
another Section of the Disclosure Schedule or (b) such disclosure is cross-

Section 10.12. _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would

and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of
competent jurisdiction. Each Seller on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
hereby waives any requirement for the posting of any bond or other security
in connection with any such remedy. Such remedies shall not be the exclusive
remedy for actual or threatened breaches of this Agreement but shall be in
addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity to the Buyer and
its Affiliates. Each Seller hereby agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that the Buyer has an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

Section 10.13. _Draftsmanship_. Each of the parties hereto has
been represented by its own counsel and acknowledges that it has participated
in the drafting of this Agreement, and any applicable rule of construction to
the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party
shall not be applied in connection with the construction or interpretation of
this Agreement.
