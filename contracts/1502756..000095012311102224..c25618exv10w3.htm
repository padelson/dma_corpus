Buyer to, together with Buyer&#146;s cash balances, make all payments required to be made to Sellers in

described in the Debt Commitment Letter, and shall, upon request by Sellers, provide to Sellers a

have expired or be terminated for any reason, (ii)&nbsp;any Debt Financing Source notifies Buyer that
such source no longer intends to provide financing to Buyer on the terms set forth therein, or

the amount of the Purchase Price. Buyer shall not amend or alter, or agree to amend or alter,
the Debt Commitment Letter in any manner that could reasonably be expected to impair, delay or

adverse to Buyer&#146;s ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for any
reason, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing as promptly as
practical in any amount that, together with existing cash resources, will equal the Purchase Price.
If obtained, Buyer will provide Sellers with a copy of the new financing commitment letters.
