(the " _Closing_ ") shall take place (a) at 10:00 a.m. local time at the

    ##### 

  

  

1.3 Consideration for Shares 

   

(a) The aggregate consideration (the " _Purchase Price_ ") payable by Buyer to
Sellers in exchange for the Shares shall consist of cash payments made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds: 

  

(i) to Sellers, to an account or accounts designated by Sellers, in the amount

(b) Immediately prior to Closing, each of the Company Subsidiaries shall
distribute all of its cash, if any, to the Company and the Company shall

the Company shall retain sufficient cash to settle any outstanding checks not
yet cleared as of the Closing and as otherwise provided in this Agreement. 

  

1.4 Escrow Amounts 

   

Subject to this Agreement and the terms of the Escrow Agreement among Buyer,
Parent and the Escrow Agent in substantially the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), the Indemnity Escrow Amount and
the FIRPTA Escrow Amount shall each be held in an account or accounts
designated by the Escrow Agent (the " _Escrow Account_ ") and such funds,
excluding any interest that may be earned thereon (to which Sellers shall be
entitled), will be available to: 

  

(a) in the case of the Indemnity Escrow Amount, satisfy (i) Indemnification
Claims made by Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 7.2_ of this
Agreement and (ii) any payments to be made pursuant to _Section 1.6_ of this
Agreement, and any amounts remaining available after eighteen (18) months
from the Closing (not subject to a pending Indemnification Claim) will be
disbursed to Parent; and 

  

(b) in the case of the FIRPTA Escrow Amount, satisfy any withholding
obligations pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder (the " _FIRPTA Withholding_ "), taking into account the FIRPTA
Certificate provisions under Treasury Regulations Section
1.1445-1(c)(2)(i)(B) applicable to any Seller, as more fully described in 
_Section 4.16_ of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and any amounts
remaining after deducting the FIRPTA Withholding (if any), which FIRPTA
Withholding amount shall be remitted to the IRS in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement, will be disbursed to Parent. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

All investment losses shall be charged against the funds in the Escrow
Account. All interest earned on the Escrow Account, including reinvested
interest, shall be the property of the Sellers and shall be paid to the
Sellers monthly. For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer and the
Sellers confirm that the amounts paid into the Escrow Account are part of the
sale proceeds. 

  

1.5 Dreier Escrow Amount 

   

If, in the case of _Sheila M. Gowan, Chapter 11 Trustee for Dreier LLP v.
360networks (USA) inc._, Case No. 10-03904 in the United States Bankruptcy
Court for the Southern District of New York (the " _Dreier Case_ "), any
financial obligations of the Company and Company Subsidiaries
remain outstanding immediately prior to the Closing, the Closing Cash Payment
shall be reduced by $16,100,000, and Buyer shall pay such amount, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, to the Escrow Agent (the " _Dreier
Escrow Amount_ "), to be held in an account or accounts designated by the
Escrow Agent, and the Escrow Agreement shall be revised accordingly to include
the Dreier Escrow Amount in the Escrow Account. The Dreier Escrow Amount,
excluding any interest that may be earned thereon (to which Sellers shall be
entitled), will be available to satisfy any financial obligations of the
Company and Company Subsidiaries arising from the Dreier case, with
any remaining funds after resolution of such matters to be distributed to
Sellers. 

  

1.6 Net Working Capital 

   

(a) At least five business days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, Sellers
shall prepare, or cause to be prepared and delivered to Buyer: (i) an
estimated balance sheet of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the
Closing Date, and (ii) a statement showing the estimated Net Working Capital
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (the "
_Estimated NWC Statement_ "), each prepared from books and records of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP and in a manner
consistent with the sample balance sheet and Net Working Capital calculation
attached hereto as _Exhibit B_. The calculation of Estimated Net Working
Capital shall be accompanied by a certificate of the Parents Chief Financial
Officer certifying that such estimates have been calculated in good faith in
accordance with this Agreement. For the purposes of this Agreement, "
_Estimated Net Working Capital_ " shall mean Current Assets less Current
Liabilities, as shown on the Estimated NWC Statement. If the Estimated
Net Working Capital exceeds the Target Net Working Capital, the Closing Cash
Payment shall be increased by the amount of such excess. If the Estimated Net
Working Capital is less than the Target Net Working Capital, then the Closing
Cash Payment shall be decreased by the amount of such shortfall. 

  

(b) As promptly as practicable, but in any event not later than forty-five
(45) days after the Closing Date, Buyer, at its own expense, shall cause to
be prepared and delivered to Sellers (i) a balance sheet of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, and (ii) a statement showing
the Net Working Capital of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the
Closing Date (the " _NWC Statement_ "), each prepared from books and records
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP and in a
manner consistent with the sample balance sheet and Net Working Capital
calculation attached hereto as _Exhibit B_. For purposes of this Agreement,
" _Net Working Capital_ " shall mean Current Assets less
Current Liabilities. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(c) Within thirty (30) days after delivery of the NWC Statement to Sellers,
Sellers may deliver written notice to Buyer of any objections to the Net
Working Capital of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as shown in the
NWC Statement, specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such objections
(the " _Dispute Notice_ "). If no Dispute Notice is delivered within such
thirty (30) day period, Sellers shall be deemed to have agreed with all items
and amounts shown in the NWC Statement, and the Net Working Capital of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date shall be deemed
to have been finally determined. If, within thirty (30) days after Buyers
receipt of any Dispute Notice, Buyer and Sellers are unable to resolve matters
raised by the Dispute Notice, Buyer and Sellers shall submit such matters to
the Accounting Arbitrator for resolution. The Accounting Arbitrator shall be
directed to make a final determination of Net Working Capital of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date within thirty (30) days
of engagement, limited to those areas at issue, and in accordance with the
methodology set forth herein. The determination of the Accounting Arbitrator
shall be conclusive and binding on the parties to this Agreement. Judgment
upon the determination of the Accounting Arbitrator may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is
to be enforced. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be
borne equally by Buyer and Parent. 

  

(d) If the final determination of Net Working Capital of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (either pursuant to mutual
agreement or by determination of the Accounting Arbitrator) (the " _Final
NWC_ ") exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital, Buyer shall pay to Parent
the amount of such excess in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds. 

  

(e) If the Final NWC is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital, Buyer and
Sellers shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay Buyer the amount of
such shortfall from the Indemnity Escrow Amount. 

  

(f) Any adjustment made pursuant to this _Section 1.6_ shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price. 

  

    ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE II

Buyer concurrently with the parties execution of this Agreement (the "

Date. After such review and approval, Buyer shall file, or cause to be filed,
all such Tax Returns. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 4.5_ to the
contrary, any Tax deductions attributable to payments of compensation or
other transaction costs incurred by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries
or Sellers in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be for the benefit of Sellers and, to the maximum extent
permitted by law, shall be treated as allocable to the taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending on the Closing Date. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) Buyer shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax
Returns (other than Tax Returns described in _Section 4.5(a)_) of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries required to be filed after the Closing
Date (taking into account any applicable extensions) and which relate to Pre-
Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Periods. Sellers shall pay any Taxes due
with respect to such Tax Returns (to the extent such Taxes (i) become due and
payable no later than eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date or are
shown as due on a Tax Return that is filed no later than eighteen (18) months
following the Closing Date and (ii) relate to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, as
determined in accordance with Section 4.5(e)), except to the extent reflected
as a Liability in Final NWC. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past custom and practice of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, except as otherwise may be required by applicable Law. To the
extent requested by Parent, Buyer shall provide each such Tax Return
to Parent for review and approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld)
at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return
(including any applicable extensions). 

  

(c) Buyer and Sellers shall provide each other with such assistance as may
reasonably be requested by the others in connection with the preparation of
any Tax Return, any audit or other examination by any taxing authority, or
any judicial or administrative Proceedings relating to Liabilities for Taxes.
Such assistance shall include making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or an explanation
of material provided hereunder and shall include providing copies of relevant
Tax Returns and supporting material. Buyer and Sellers shall provide each
other with any records or information that may be relevant to
such preparation, audit, examination, Proceeding or determination, and
execute and deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as are
necessary to carry out the intent of this _Section 4.5(c)._ Buyer and Sellers
further agree, upon request, to use reasonable efforts to obtain
any certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or any
other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax
that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby) provided that such actions do not require
any payment by or impose any additional Tax burden on the other party. Buyer
shall control the conduct of any audit or administrative or judicial
Proceeding involving any Taxes of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(or for which the Company or the Company Subsidiaries may be liable) for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, and Buyer shall promptly notify
Sellers of such audit or Proceeding and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to defend any such audit or Proceeding. Sellers shall have the right to
participate in any such audit or Proceeding at their expense and, with the
written consent of Buyer, and at their expense, may assume control of
the conduct of such audit or proceeding, but may not settle or compromise any
such audit or proceeding (or any material issue in connection therewith)
without the prior written consent of Buyer (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld). Buyer shall not settle or compromise any such audit or proceeding
(or any material issue in connection therewith) without the prior written
consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld). 

  

(d) After the Closing Date, Buyer, to the extent permitted by Law, shall have
the right to amend, modify or otherwise change all Tax Returns of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries for all Tax periods; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any such amendment, modification or change with respect to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period which may result in an indemnifiable Claim against Sellers under
_Article VII_ or may be included in the calculation of the Deductible under
_Section 7.4(a)_ of this Agreement shall not be made without the prior
written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or conditioned). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, including the determination of any Taxes
to be taken into account in determining Working Capital, the amount of any
Taxes (other than property or similar ad valorem Taxes) for a Straddle Period
that relate to the portion of such Straddle Period which is a Pre-Closing Tax
Period will be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the
end of the Closing Date, and the amount of any property or similar ad valorem
Taxes which relate to the portion of such Straddle Period which is a Pre-
Closing Tax Period will be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days in the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the total number of days in such
Straddle Period. 

  

(f) The amount of any refunds of Taxes of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, to the extent (i) such Taxes
were paid on or prior to the Closing Date, or accrued and reflected as a
Liability in Final NWC and (ii) such refunds were collected by the Company or
a Company Subsidiary prior to eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date,
shall be for the account of Sellers, provided, however, that any refunds of
Taxes reflected as an asset in Final NWC or arising as a result of Buyer
carrying back losses generated after the Closing to Pre-Closing Tax Periods
shall be for the account of Buyer, and provided further that Buyer shall, and
cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to, use reasonable efforts to
promptly collect any refund to which the Company or a Company Subsidiary
becomes entitled. Buyer shall forward or cause to be forwarded to Parent the
amount of any refund to which Sellers are entitled within thirty (30)
days after such refund is actually received. Parent shall have the right to
review and approve (not to be unreasonably withheld) the calculation of any
such refund. 

  

(g) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
similar transfer Taxes, including any Washington real estate excise Taxes or
similar Taxes imposed by any other jurisdiction, incurred in connection with
the consummation of the transfer of the Shares shall be borne by Buyer. The
party required by applicable law shall file all necessary Tax Returns
and other documentation with respect to such Taxes and, if required by
applicable law, the other party or parties shall join in the execution of
such Tax Returns and other documentation. 

  

(h) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in the
event an election under Section 338 of the Code is made with respect to the
purchase of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement, the Sellers shall not be
obligated to pay, or indemnify any Person for, any Taxes arising out of or
relating to such election, except to the extent such Taxes relate to a Breach
of a representation that would have occurred in the absence of any such
election. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(i) The Closing Cash Payment shall be reduced by an amount equal to aggregate
amount of the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income Tax withholding
and employment Taxes (whether imposed on the employer or the employee under
applicable Law) payable with respect to (i) the vesting of Parent restricted
stock in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any such Taxes arising under an agreement by the Company or any
Seller to pay such Taxes on behalf of the holder of such restricted stock, and
(ii) the exercise of compensatory stock options to purchase Parent stock in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each
case, to the extent such amounts have not been remitted to the applicable
Governmental Authority as of the Closing. In the event that any Seller or the
Company collects any of such Taxes from an employee, such collected amount
shall be retained by such Seller, or distributed by the Company to Sellers,
as the case may be, on or prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall timely
remit, or cause the Company to timely remit, the Taxes described in this
_Section 4.5(i)_ to the applicable Governmental Authorities. The Taxes
described in this _Section 4.5(i)_ shall not be included in the
determination of Net Working Capital. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, including _Section 2.9 and this Section 4.5_,
Sellers shall not be obligated to pay, or indemnify any Person for, any
Taxes described in this _Section 4.5(i)_. 

  

4.6 Employee Benefits 

   

(a) As of the Closing Date, and for a period of at least twelve (12) months
thereafter, Buyer shall provide, or shall cause its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates to provide employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
who remain employed by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (or who
are employed by Buyer or any of its other Subsidiaries or Affiliates)
immediately after the Closing (" _Continuing Employees_ ") with base salary,
bonus potential and employee benefits as described in _Section 4.6(a) of the
Disclosure Schedules_. Buyer and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall treat,

eligible to participate (each, a " _Buyer Benefit Plan_ ") to treat, for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting, accrual of
and entitlement to benefits (but not for accrual of benefits under any
"defined benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA) and all other
purposes, all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates
(and predecessor employers to the extent the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or the analogous Employee Benefit Plan
provides past service credit) prior to the Closing as service with Buyer and
its Subsidiaries and Affiliates. Buyer and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates
shall cause each Buyer Benefit Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit
plan," within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, (a) to waive any and all
eligibility waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, pre-
existing condition limitations, at-work requirements and other exclusions and
limitations with respect to the Continuing Employees and their spouses and
dependents to the extent waived, satisfied, not applicable or not included
under the analogous Employee Benefit Plan, and (b) to recognize for each
Continuing Employee and his or her spouse and dependents for purposes of
applying annual deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums under such
Buyer Benefit Plan any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses
paid by the Continuing Employee and his or her spouse and dependents under
the analogous Employee Benefit Plan during the plan year of such Employee
Benefit Plan in which occurs the later of the Closing Date and the date on
which the Continuing Employee begins participating in such Buyer Benefit
Plan.

(b) After Closing, Buyer shall pay (or cause the Company to pay) to employees
any and all accrued bonuses that are included in the determination of the
Final NWC, which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include all bonus amounts
payable under the annual bonus program of the Company and the Key Performance
Indicator long term incentive plan, within ten (10) calendar days following
the Closing. 

  

(c) After Closing, and except as otherwise provided in Section 4.6(b) of this

Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall grant to Sellers and their
Affiliates a nonexclusive, royalty-free, fully paid, worldwide, limited right
and license to use the Acquired Names for a transitional period, provided that
upon expiration of such period, Sellers will promptly remove any Acquired

reasonably required to change the names of any Sellers or any Subsidiary of
Sellers to the extent such names include any of the Acquired Names. 

  

4.9 Discharge of Affiliate Obligations 

   

The Sellers will cause all Contracts by and between Sellers or any Affiliates
of Sellers (other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries), on the one
hand, and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, on the other hand, to be

obligation to the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or Buyer. 

  

4.10 No Financing Contingency 

   

Buyer acknowledges and agrees that its obligations under this Agreement,
including but not limited to its obligation to pay the Purchase Price, are

other Transaction Documents. 

  

4.11 Directors and Officers

(ii) participate in any discussions, conversations, negotiations or
other communications regarding, or furnish to any other Person any
information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way, assist or
participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by any other
Person to seek to do any of the foregoing; provided, however, that the
Sellers, Company and Company Subsidiaries shall be entitled to furnish to the
shareholders of Parent the fact that an Acquisition Proposal was received and
the terms of such Acquisition Proposal. The Sellers immediately shall, and
shall cause the Company to, cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions, conversations, negotiations and other communications with any
Persons (other than the shareholders of Sellers, Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, as applicable) conducted heretofore with respect to any of

    ##### 

  

   

(iii) The Sellers shall notify the Buyer promptly, but in any event within 24
hours, orally and in writing if any such Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry
or other contact with any Person with respect thereto, is made. Any such
notice to the Buyer shall indicate in reasonable detail the offer, inquiry or
other contact and the terms and conditions of such proposal, offer, inquiry
or other contact. The Sellers shall not, and shall cause the Company not to,
release any Person from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality
or standstill agreement to which the Sellers or the Company is a party,
without the prior written consent of the Buyer. 

  

(b) Except as set forth in Section 4.18(d), the boards of directors of Sellers
and the Company shall not (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to
withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Buyer, the approval or
recommendation by such board of directors of this Agreement or the
approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of Parent at the Parent
Stockholder Meeting (a " _ _Change of Recommendation__ "), (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal, or (iii) cause or permit Sellers or the Company to enter into any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other
similar agreement or understanding (an " _ _Acquisition Agreement__ ")
related to any Acquisition Proposal other than an acceptable confidentiality
agreement entered into pursuant to _Section 4.18(b)_. 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 4.18,
prior to approval of this Agreement by the Parents stockholders at the
Parent Stockholder Meeting, the boards of directors of Sellers and the
Company may, if such boards of directors determine in good faith that such
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal and, after consultation with its
legal counsel, determine that their failure to take such actions would be
inconsistent with their fiduciary duties to their stockholders under
applicable Law, (i) approve or recommend such Superior Proposal and,
in connection with the approval or recommendation of such Superior Proposal,
make a Change of Recommendation, and/or (ii) cause the Sellers to terminate
this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _that_ : 

   

(i) Sellers shall have provided prior written notice to Buyer at least three
business days in advance of its intention to effect a Change of
Recommendation, which notice shall specify, as applicable, (A) the identity
of the party making a Superior Proposal and the material terms thereof and
include copies of all relevant documents relating to such Superior Proposal
(including copies of the then-current form of any acquisition
agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal that Sellers have received from the Person that made such
Superior Proposal, together with copies of any commitment letters or
similar material documents received by the Company with respect to any
financing for such Superior Proposal) (it being understood that any fee
letters provided pursuant to this sentence may be redacted to omit
confidential information and any other numerical amounts provided therein); 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(ii) after providing such notice and prior to effecting such Change of
Recommendation, Sellers shall, and shall cause their Representatives to,
negotiate with Buyer in good faith (to the extent Buyer desires to negotiate)
to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as
would enable the boards of directors of Sellers and the Company to determine
not to effect such Change of Recommendation; 

   

(iii) the boards of directors of Sellers and the Company shall have (A)
considered in good faith any changes to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement offered in writing by Buyer in a manner that would form a binding
contract if accepted by the Company and (B) determined that (x) such Superior
Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes
offered in writing by Parent were to be given effect or (y) such
changes would not affect the determination of the boards of directors of
Sellers and the Company to effect a Change of Recommendation, as applicable;
and 

   

(iv) in the event of any material revisions to such Superior Proposal or
material changes related to such Acquisition Proposal, Sellers shall be
required to deliver a new written notice to Buyer and to comply with the
requirements of this _Section 4.18(d)_ with respect to such new written
notice, except that the deadline for such new written notice shall be reduced
to two business days before the Change of Recommendation (rather than the
three business days otherwise contemplated by this Section 4.18(d)). 

  

4.19 Financing 

   

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, Buyer has, and has delivered to Sellers
a true and complete copy of, the Debt Commitment Letter from the Debt
Financing Sources committing such lender(s) to provide, in whole or part, a
financing for Buyer in an amount sufficient to permit Buyer to, together with
Buyers cash balances, make all payments required to be made to Sellers
in connection with the Closing under this Agreement. 

  

(b) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to complete the Debt Financing
and satisfy its obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance
with and by the date specified in the terms and conditions of the Debt
Commitment Letter. Buyer shall keep Sellers reasonably informed of all
material developments, positive and negative, concerning the status of the
Debt Financing described in the Debt Commitment Letter, and shall, upon
request by Sellers, provide to Sellers a copy of the proposed and final
credit agreements or other documents related to the Debt Financing. Without
limiting the foregoing, Buyer agrees to notify Sellers promptly, and in any
event within two (2) business days, if at any time prior to the Closing (i)
the Debt Commitment Letter shall have expired or be terminated for any
reason, (ii) any Debt Financing Source notifies Buyer that such source no
longer intends to provide financing to Buyer on the terms set forth therein,
or (iii) Buyer no longer believes in good faith that it will be able to
obtain the amount of the Purchase Price. Buyer shall not amend or alter, or
agree to amend or alter, the Debt Commitment Letter in any manner that could
reasonably be expected to impair, delay or prevent the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, without the prior written consent of Parent.
If the Debt Commitment Letter shall be terminated or modified in a manner
materially adverse to Buyers ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement for any reason, Buyer shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain alternative financing as promptly as practical in any
amount that, together with existing cash resources, will equal the Purchase
Price. If obtained, Buyer will provide Sellers with a copy of the new
financing commitment letters. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(c) Sellers shall provide, and shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to cause the respective officers, employees and advisors (including
legal and accounting advisors) of Sellers, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to provide, to Buyer all cooperation reasonably requested by
Buyer in connection with (i) the Debt Financing and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, and (ii) Buyers satisfaction of the
conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter, including (A) participation in
meetings, presentations, road shows, drafting sessions, due diligence
sessions and sessions with rating agencies, including direct contact between
senior management and representatives and advisors of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and the Debt Financing Sources and potential lenders and
investors in the Debt Financing, (B) assisting with the preparation of
materials for rating agencies and rating agency presentations, lender
and investor presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda,
bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents required in
connection with the Debt Financing, and providing reasonable and customary
authorization letters to the Debt Financing Sources authorizing the
distribution of information to prospective lenders and containing customary
information (all such documents and materials, collectively, the " _Offering
Documents_ "), (C) preparing and furnishing Buyer and the Debt Financing
Sources on or prior to November 15, 2011 (or such later date as mutually
agreed upon by Buyer and Sellers) with all Required Financial Information and

Agreement, together with the Disclosure Schedules as delivered upon execution

or other document delivered by the Sellers pursuant to Article V (in each
case, giving effect to any limitations or qualifications as to
materiality, Company Material Adverse Effect, knowledge or other exception
set forth therein for purposes of determining whether a Breach has occurred
but not for purposes of determining Losses therefrom); 

  

(b) any Breach by Sellers of any covenant or other obligation in this
Agreement or in any other Transaction Document; or 

  

(c) the litigation set forth on _Section 7.2 of the Disclosure Schedules_.

(a) any Breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in this
Agreement or in any other Transaction Document (in each case, giving effect

Losses arising under Sections 7.2(a) and (b) unless and until such time as
the cumulative aggregate amount of all indemnifiable Losses exceeds

Parties shall be entitled to recover the full amount of such Losses from the
first dollar thereof without regard to the Deductible. 

  

(b) The maximum aggregate liability of Sellers for all Indemnification Claims

_Indemnifying Party_ ") shall not be obligated to indemnify and hold harmless
any Person claiming indemnification under this _Article VII_ (an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") after the expiration of any applicable Survival Period
unless a Claim Notice with respect to such Indemnification Claim shall have
been given by the Indemnified Party prior to the expiration of the applicable
Survival Period. 

  

7.5 Calculation of Losses; Mitigation 

   

(a) The amount of Losses otherwise eligible for indemnification under this
_Article VII_ shall be reduced by (i) any insurance proceeds actually
received by the Indemnified Party (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to
such Losses, (ii) any net Tax benefit that the Indemnified Party actually
realizes as a result of the incurrence of such Losses, and (iii) any actual
recovery from third Persons (less the fees and expenses incurred to obtain
such proceeds). Each Indemnified Party shall exercise commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain such proceeds, benefits and recoveries. If any such
proceeds, benefits or recoveries are received by an Indemnified Party (or any
of its Affiliates) with respect to any Losses after an Indemnifying Party has
made a payment to the Indemnified Party with respect thereto, the Indemnified
Party (or such Affiliate) shall pay to the Indemnifying Party the amount of
such proceeds, benefits or recoveries (up to the amount of the Indemnifying
Partys payment). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) Each party shall take all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate Losses
upon or after becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be expected
to give rise to Losses indemnifiable by the other party. Each Indemnified
Party shall seek full recovery under all insurance policies covering any
Losses to the same extent as it would if such Losses were not subject
to indemnification hereunder. 

  

7.6 Procedure for Indemnification 

   

(a) An Indemnified Party shall give written notice (the " _Claim Notice_ ") of
any Indemnification Claim (i) in the case of an Indemnification Claim against
Buyer, to Buyer, and (ii) in the case of an Indemnification Claim against the
Sellers, to Parent, reasonably promptly upon learning of such Claim or the
facts constituting such Claim, but in any event (A) prior to the expiration of
any applicable Survival Period, and (B) if such Indemnification Claim relates
to the assertion against an Indemnified Party of any Claim by a third party
(a " _Third Party Claim_ "), within thirty (30) days after receipt by the
Indemnified Party of written notice of a legal process relating to such
Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall
be relieved of its indemnification obligations under this _Article VII_ to
the extent that it is materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys
failure to give prompt notice. Any such Claim Notice shall describe in
reasonable detail the facts and circumstances on which the asserted
Indemnification Claim is based and specify the amount of such Indemnification
Claim to the extent then ascertainable. 

  

(b) Unless the Indemnifying Party contests the Indemnification Claim in a
written notice given to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of
receipt of the Claim Notice and describing in reasonable detail the basis for
contesting the Indemnification Claim, the Indemnified Party shall, subject to
the other terms of this _Article VII_, be paid the amount of the Losses
related to such Indemnification Claim or the uncontested portion thereof.
Contested Indemnification Claims shall be resolved either (i) in a written
agreement signed by Buyer and Parent, or (ii) by the final decision of a
trier of fact. 

  

(c) In the case of a Third Party Claim, upon written notice to the Indemnified
Party within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Claim Notice, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend and to direct the defense
against any such Third Party Claim, in its name or in the name of the
Indemnified Party, as the case may be, at the expense of the Indemnifying
Party, and with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party (which is
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party) and, in connection therewith,
the Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party
and make available to the Indemnifying Party all pertinent requested
information under its control, provided that the Indemnified Party may
participate in any Proceedings with counsel of its choice at its own expense.
The Indemnifying Party shall not agree to a compromise, settlement or other
resolution of, or consent to the entry of any judgment to, any Third
Party Claim, without the Indemnified Partys prior written consent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless (i) the
sole relief provided is monetary damages, there is no finding or admission of
any violation of Law in connection therewith and there is no material adverse
effect on any other Claims that may be made against such Indemnified Party or
its Affiliates, (ii) each Indemnified Party that is a party to such Third
Party Claim is fully and unconditionally released from liability with respect
to such claim, and (iii) such settlement, compromise or resolution will not,
in the good faith judgment of the Indemnified Party, be reasonably likely to
establish a precedent, custom or practice that is materially adverse to the
continuing business interests of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party
shall not agree to a settlement of any Third Party Claim that is being
defended and handled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section
7.6(c)_. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(d) If the Indemnifying Party does not give written notice to the Indemnified
Party within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Claim Notice of a Third
Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense of
such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may, at the Indemnifying
Partys expense, select counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying
Party to defend or handle such Third Party Claim in consultation with the
Indemnifying Party and in a manner that is reasonable under the
circumstances; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall keep
the Indemnifying Party timely apprised of the status of such Third Party
Claim. The Indemnified Party shall not agree to a compromise, settlement or
other resolution of, or consent to the entry of any judgment to, such Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the
Indemnified Party defends or handles such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnified Party,
provided that the Indemnifying Party may participate in any such Proceedings
with counsel of its choice at its own expense. 

  

7.7 Exclusive Remedy 

   

Following the Closing, (except for Claims arising out of fraud and for claims
for injunctive relief), the indemnification provisions of this _Article VII_
will be the sole and exclusive remedy of any Buyer Indemnified Party or
Seller Indemnified Party for Breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement or in any Transaction Document (other
than the Escrow Agreement ) and for any Claim arising from this Agreement,
the Transaction Documents (other than the Escrow Agreement) or the

Sellers as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. 

  

7.10 No Duplication 

   

Any liability for indemnification pursuant to this _Article VII_ shall be
determined without duplication of recovery to the extent that the facts
giving rise to such liability constitute a Breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

7.11 No Punitive, Special, or Consequential Damages 

   

No party shall be liable to any other party or Indemnified Party for any
punitive, special, or consequential damages (other than punitive, special or
consequential damages arising in connection with a Third Party Claim)
resulting from Breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement or in any other Transaction Document or resulting
from any Claim arising from this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the parties acknowledge and agree that for purposes of this _Article
VII_, any damages resulting from Breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement that result in Losses based
on the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as conducted on
the date hereof, without regard to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, shall not be considered punitive, special, or consequential
damages and shall be indemnifiable Losses hereunder, but any Losses
that arise from expectations of the Buyer as a result of the combination of
the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with the business of
Buyer shall not be indemnifiable Losses hereunder. Buyer shall not be
entitled to seek or obtain any recovery or judgment (including for damages)
other than the Break-Up Fee in the circumstances in which it becomes payable
pursuant to Sections 6.1(f) and 6.1(g) of this Agreement. 

  

7.12 Remedies Not Affected by Investigation or Knowledge 

   

If the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, Buyer expressly
reserves the right to seek indemnity or other remedy pursuant to _Article
VII_ of this Agreement for any Losses arising out of or relating to any
Breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein,
notwithstanding any investigation by, or knowledge of, such party in respect
of any fact or circumstances that reveals the occurrence of any such Breach,
whether before or after the execution and delivery hereof.

8.13 Remedies 

   

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies provided
herein shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon any party, and the exercise by a
party of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.
The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the parties hereto do not perform their respective obligations under the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of them hereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement) in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise
Breach such provisions. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VI_ , the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent Breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case without
posting a bond or undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that
it shall not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement on the basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at law
or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at law or equity.
