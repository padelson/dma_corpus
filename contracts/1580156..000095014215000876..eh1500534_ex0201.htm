_provided_ , _however_ , that the Sellers shall not be responsible for any
product liability claims or warranty or repair obligations for or in
connection with any component that was a Work in Progress if and after such
component ceases to be a Work in Progress;

  

    

(j) any Liabilities retained by the Sellers or their Affiliates under the
Sublease;

  

(k) any other Liabilities arising out of, relating to or resulting from any
current, former or prospective Business Service Provider with respect to
his/her services or termination of services at or before the Closing
(including as a result of the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions)
with the Sellers or any of their Affiliates; and

  

(l) any Liabilities arising out of, relating to or resulting from Covered
Claims.

  

Section 2.5 _Consideration_. In consideration for the sale of the Transferred
Assets by the Sellers, at the Closing, the Purchaser shall assume the Assumed
Liabilities and pay the Closing Purchase Price to the Sellers. The term "
_Closing Purchase Price_ " means: (i) $575,000,000 (the " _Base Consideration_
") adjusted at the Closing as follows: _minus_ (ii) $34,500,000 (the " _Escrow
Amount_ "); _plus_ (iii) the Adjustment Amount (if the Adjustment Amount is a
positive number); _minus_ (iv) the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount (if
the Adjustment Amount is a negative number). The Closing Purchase Price
payable at Closing shall be estimated in accordance with _Section __2.6_ _(a)_
and shall be subject to adjustment following the Closing pursuant to the other
clauses of _Section __2.6_.

  

Section 2.6 _Closing Purchase Price Estimate and Adjustment_.

  

(a) Not fewer than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Parent Seller shall prepare and deliver to the Purchaser a certificate
executed by an executive officer of the Parent Seller (the " _Pre-Closing
Statement_ ") setting forth the Sellers' good faith estimates of (i) the Net
Working Capital and the resulting Adjustment Amount and (ii) the resulting
Closing Purchase Price calculated in accordance with _Section 2.5_, together
with supporting documentation for such estimate and any additional information
reasonably requested by the Purchaser. The Pre-Closing Statement shall be
prepared in accordance with the Accounting Standards and in consultation with
the Purchaser, and it shall be reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser.

  

(b) Not later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser
shall prepare and deliver to the Parent Seller a certificate executed by an
executive officer of the Purchaser (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth
the Purchaser's determination of (i) the Net Working Capital and the resulting
Adjustment Amount and (ii) the resulting Closing Purchase Price calculated in
accordance with _Section 2.5_. The Closing Statement shall be prepared in
accordance with the Accounting Standards. Promptly following delivery of the
Closing Statement, the Purchaser shall provide the Parent Seller with such
supporting documentation as the Parent Seller may reasonably request.

  

(c) Within thirty (30) days after the Parent Seller's receipt of the Closing
Statement, the Parent Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser a written
statement

  

    

either accepting the Closing Statement or specifying any objections thereto.
If the Parent Seller does not deliver any such written statement within such
thirty (30) day period, then the Closing Statement shall become final and
binding upon all parties. If the Parent Seller does deliver a written
statement specifying objections within such period, then the parties shall
negotiate in good faith for a period of thirty (30) days following the
Purchaser's receipt of such objections to resolve any such objections. If the
parties are able to resolve the Parent Seller's objections during such thirty
(30) day period, then the Closing Statement, as revised in accordance with
such resolution, shall become final and binding upon all parties. If the
parties are not able to resolve such objections during such thirty (30) day
period, then any remaining disputes shall be referred for resolution to KPMG
LLP or, if KPMG LLP is not available for (or declines) such assignment, such
other nationally recognized accounting firm upon which the Parent Seller and
the Purchaser shall reasonably agree (the "Accounting Firm"). The Accounting
Firm shall be instructed to resolve any such disputes within thirty (30) days
after its appointment. The resolution of such disputes by the Accounting Firm
shall be (i) set forth in writing, (ii) determined in accordance with this
Agreement, (iii) within the range of dispute between the Purchaser and the
Parent Seller, and (iv) binding upon all parties, absent manifest error. Upon
delivery of such resolution by the Accounting Firm, the Closing Statement, as
modified in accordance with such resolution, shall become final and binding
upon all parties.

  

  

(d) The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be allocated
between the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Parent Seller, on the other
hand, based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not
awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested by such party.
For example, if the Parent Seller claims the appropriate adjustments are
$1,000 greater than the amount determined by the Purchaser and if the
Accounting Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding to the Sellers
$300 of the $1,000 contested, then the fees, costs and expenses of arbitration
will be allocated 30% (i.e., 300 ÷ 1,000) to the Purchaser and 70% (i.e., 700
÷ 1,000) to the Parent Seller.

  

(e) As used herein " _Final Closing Purchase Price_ " means (i) if the Parent
Seller fails to deliver a written statement specifying objections in
accordance with _Section 2.6(c)_, the Closing Purchase Price as set forth in
the Closing Statement or (ii) if the Parent Seller delivers a written
statement of objection, the Closing Purchase Price mutually agreed by
negotiation of the parties and/or by submission to the Accounting Firm as
contemplated by _Section 2.6(c)_, the Closing Purchase Price as so resolved.

  

(f) If the Final Closing Purchase Price is greater than the Closing Purchase
Price paid at Closing, then the Purchaser shall promptly (but in any event
within five (5) Business Days following the determination of the Final Closing
Purchase Price) deliver to the Parent Seller, on behalf of the Sellers, such
excess by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated in writing by the Parent Seller. If the Final Closing
Purchase Price is less than the Closing Purchase Price paid at Closing, then
the Parent Seller shall promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business
Days following determination of the Final Closing Purchase Price) deliver to

  

    

  

the Purchaser, such shortfall by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to one or more accounts designated by the Purchaser. All payments made
pursuant to this Section 2.6 shall be treated by all parties for tax purposes
as adjustments to the purchase price.

  

  

Section 2.7 _Escrow Account_. At the Closing, the Purchaser shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with the Escrow Agent cash in the amount of the
Escrow Amount, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by the Escrow Agent no fewer than two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing (the " _Escrow Account_ "). The Escrow Account shall be
used to satisfy claims of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for
indemnification pursuant to _Article __X_ made from and after Closing but on
or before the applicable Expiration Date or claims pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement. Any funds in the Escrow Account not so used shall be
distributed to the Parent Seller, on behalf of the Sellers, in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement.

  

Section 2.8 _Nonassignable Assets_.

  

(a) Nothing in this Agreement nor the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions shall be construed as an attempt or agreement to assign or
transfer any Transferred Asset to the Purchaser which by its terms or by any
Law is not assignable or transferable without a consent or approval of any
Governmental Authority or other third party or satisfaction of any other
condition or is cancelable by a third party in the event of an assignment or
transfer (a " _Nonassignable Asset_ "), unless and until such consent or
approval shall have been obtained or condition satisfied.

  

(b) The Sellers and the Purchaser shall each use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain as expeditiously as possible any consent or approval that
may be required and to satisfy a condition necessary to the assignment or
transfer of a Nonassignable Asset to the Purchaser.

  

(c) Unless and until any such consent or approval that may be required is
obtained or condition satisfied, and provided payment of the Closing Purchase
Price as adjusted pursuant to _Section __2.6_ herein has been made to Sellers
without holdback or reduction for any consent of approval, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law and by the terms of the applicable Nonassignable
Asset, the Sellers and the Purchaser will cooperate and use commercially
reasonable efforts to establish an arrangement reasonably satisfactory to the
Purchaser under which the Purchaser would obtain the rights and benefits to,
and assume the corresponding Assumed Liabilities relating to, such
Nonassignable Asset (including by means of any subcontracting, sublicensing or
subleasing arrangement) or under which the Sellers would enforce for the
benefit of the Purchaser, in respect of such Nonassignable Asset, all rights
and benefits of the Sellers against a third party thereto.

  

(d) If and when the applicable consents or approvals, the absence of which
caused the deferral of transfer of any Nonassignable Asset pursuant to this
_Section __2.8_ , are obtained, the transfer of the applicable Nonassignable
Asset to

  

    

  

the Purchaser shall automatically and without further action or consideration
be effected in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the applicable
Transaction Documents.

  

  

(e) A Nonassignable Asset shall also have been deemed to be effectively
transferred to the Purchaser if it is a Transferred Contract that (i) has been
replaced or superseded by a new Contract between the Purchaser and the
counterparty to such Transferred Contract on substantially the same terms and
conditions as such Transferred Contract, (ii) has been assigned in part to the
Purchaser as a shared Contract in a manner reasonably acceptable to the
Purchaser and the Sellers, or (iii) with respect to Transferred Contracts that
the Purchaser cannot assume as a result of the Purchaser's lack of Permits,
the Purchaser has agreed to enter into an agreement with the Sellers as a
distributor or supplier of the applicable Business Products (such agreement
not to be unreasonably withheld by either the Purchaser or the Sellers).

determination letter from the IRS or is a prototype plan that is the subject
of a favorable opinion letter issued by the IRS, in each case, to the effect
that the Benefit Plan satisfies the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code
and that its related trust is exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the
Code. To the Knowledge of the Sellers, there are no facts or circumstances
that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification. No
Liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by any Sellers or any of

the Business Employees.

  

(d) None of the Business Service Providers participates or is eligible to

on _Schedule 4.19(g)(iii)_ of the Disclosure Letter, no Seller nor any ERISA
Affiliate of such Seller contributes to, or has in the past six (6) years

subject to Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA or any "multiple
employer plan" within the meaning of Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA. No Benefit
Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA and no Seller, nor any ERISA Affiliate of a Seller, has at any time
sponsored or contributed to, or had any Liability in respect of, any such
multiemployer plan. None of the Sellers, any of their Affiliates or any
Benefit Plan has engaged in any "prohibited transaction" (as such term is
defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) which could
reasonably be expected to be material to the Business taken as a whole.

  

(h) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.19(h)_ of the Disclosure Letter, no
Action with respect to any Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for
benefits) that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected
to result in material liability in respect of the Business Employees to any
Seller, any of its Affiliates or any Transferred Subsidiary is pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Sellers, threatened. To the Knowledge of the Sellers, no
event has occurred and no condition exists that would, either directly or by
reason of any Seller's affiliation with any ERISA Affiliates, subject any
Seller or any of its Affiliates to any material Tax, fine, Lien, penalty or
other Liability imposed by ERISA, the Code or other applicable Laws in respect
of the Business Employees.

  

(i) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.19(i)_ of the Disclosure Letter,

Benefit Plan or otherwise materially accelerate or increase any obligation
under any Benefit Plan in respect of the Business Employees; (ii) severance
pay or any increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment by a
Business Employee after the date of this Agreement; (iii) any payment,
compensation or benefit becoming due, or increase in the amount of any
payment, compensation or benefit due, to any current or former Business
Employee or Business Service Provider; or (iv) any limitation or restriction
on the right of any Seller or any of its Affiliates to merge, amend or
terminate any of the Benefit Plans.

  

(j) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the Contemplated Transactions (either alone or in combination with another
event) will result in any payment or deemed payment (whether in cash,
property, the vesting of property or otherwise) to any "disqualified
individual" (as such term is

  

    

defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) that could reasonably be
construed, individually or in combination with any other such payment, to
constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of
the Code). No Business Employee or Business Service Provider is entitled to
receive any additional payment (including any tax gross-up or other payment)
from any Seller or any of its Affiliates as a result of the imposition of the
excise Taxes required by Section 4999 of the Code or any Taxes required by
Section 409A of the Code.

Allocation Schedule on any Tax Return or in any proceeding before any
Governmental Authority or otherwise, unless required by a Final Determination.
In the event that such Allocation Schedule is disputed by any Governmental
Authority, the party receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the
other party hereto, and both the Sellers and the Purchaser agree to use their
commercially reasonable efforts to defend such Allocation Schedule in any
audit or similar proceeding.

  

    

(c) _Section 338(h)(10) Elections_.

  

(i) The applicable Sellers (or their Affiliates) and the Purchaser shall
jointly make timely and irrevocable elections under Section 338(h)(10) of the
Code with respect to the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of the
Transferred Equity, and, if permissible, similar elections under any
applicable state and local Tax Laws (collectively, the " _Section 338(h)(10)
Elections_").

  

(ii) The Purchaser shall prepare IRS Form 8023 (or any successor form) and any
similar forms required by applicable state and local Tax Laws with respect to
each Transferred Subsidiary for which a Section 338(h)(10) Election may be
made (collectively, the " _Section 338 Forms_"). The applicable Sellers shall
cooperate with the Purchaser in the preparation of the Section 338 Forms and
shall deliver two (2) duly completed, executed copies of such Section 338
Forms to the Purchaser on or prior to the Closing Date. The Sellers shall
execute (or cause to be executed) and deliver to the Purchaser such additional
or substitute documents or forms as are reasonably requested by the Purchaser
to complete the Section 338(h)(10) Election at least thirty (30) days prior to
the date such documents or forms are required to be filed. The applicable
Sellers and the Purchaser shall cooperate with each other to take or cause to
be taken all actions necessary and appropriate (including filing such
additional forms, Tax Returns, elections, schedules and other documents as may
be required) to effect and preserve the Section 338(h)(10) Elections. The
Sellers and the Purchaser shall not (nor shall they permit any of their
respective Affiliates to) take any action that would reasonably be expected to
cause the Section 338(h)(10) Elections to be invalid.

  

(iii) The parties shall determine and allocate the "aggregate deemed sales
price" (" _ADSP_ ") with respect to the assets of each Transferred Subsidiary
in accordance with _Section 6.3(b)_ hereof (including the dispute resolution
mechanics therein), Section 338 of the Code and the applicable Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder or comparable provisions for state, local
and foreign Tax Law (the " _ADSP Allocation_ "). The Purchaser, the Sellers,
and their respective Affiliates shall be bound by the Section 338(h)(10)
Election and the ADSP Allocation for all Tax purposes. The Purchaser and the
Sellers shall file, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to file, all
Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Election and
the ADSP Allocation and shall take no position contrary thereto unless
required to do so by a change in applicable Law or a Final Determination.

  

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, neither of the Sellers nor any of their
respective Affiliates shall have any Liability to the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates for the failure of any Section 338(h)(10) Election to be valid to
the extent such failure results from actions (or omissions) of the Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates.

  

    

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of
the Sellers (jointly and severally), on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on
the other hand, shall pay, on or before the date the same became due, one-half
of all federal, state, local or foreign or other excise, sales, use, value
added, transfer (including real property transfer or gains), stamp,
documentary, filing, recordation and other similar Taxes and fees that may be
imposed or assessed as a result of the Contemplated Transactions, together
with any interest, additions or penalties with respect thereto and any
interest in respect of such additions or penalties (" _Transfer Taxes_ ").

  

(e) _Consolidated Tax Returns_. The Parent Seller shall prepare and timely
file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Consolidated Tax Returns
in respect of the Transferred Assets (including the Transferred Subsidiaries)
and the Business that are required to be filed (taking into account any
applicable extensions) after the Closing Date and to the extent related to the
Transferred Subsidiaries in a manner consistent with past practice, unless
required by a change in applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parent
Seller shall otherwise provide the Purchaser with true and correct copies of
such Tax Returns of the Transferred Subsidiaries, including pro forma Tax
Returns (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the Consolidated
Tax Return of the Parent Seller).

  

(f) _Other Tax Returns_. The Purchaser shall prepare and timely file, or cause
to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns (other than those the Sellers
are entitled to prepare pursuant to _Section __6.3(a)_ or _Section 6.3(e)_),
including those relating to Transfer Taxes (unless the Sellers are required to
file such Tax Returns related to Transfer Taxes), required to be filed in
respect of the Transferred Assets (including the Transferred Subsidiaries) or
the Business after the Closing Date. The Sellers shall cooperate with the
Purchaser in respect of preparing any Tax Returns with respect to Transfer
Taxes. With respect to Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Tax Periods or Straddle
Periods, the Sellers shall be responsible for the Pre-Closing Taxes due in
respect of such Tax Returns that are in excess of the amount of Taxes which
are included as Current Liabilities and taken into account in determining the
Purchase Price. The Purchaser shall provide a draft of any such Tax Return for
a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period for which the Sellers may have an
indemnification obligation pursuant to _Section __10.2_ to the Parent Seller
on or prior to the date that is ten (10) Business Days prior to the due date
(including extensions), along with a supporting schedule that shows the
allocation of the portion of the Taxes shown as due on such Tax Return to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period, for the Parent Seller's review and approval, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. If the
Parent Seller disputes any item on such Tax Return, it shall notify the
Purchaser of such disputed item (or items) and the basis for its objection.
The Purchaser and the Parent Seller shall cooperate in good faith to resolve
any dispute as to any matter in such Tax Return. If the parties cannot resolve
any disputed item, the item in question shall be resolved by an Accounting
Firm in a manner consistent with _Section 2.6(c)_ prior to the due date (with
extensions) for such Tax Return. The Sellers shall include the income of the
Business and its Transferred Subsidiaries (including any deferred income
triggered into income under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-13 and any
excess loss accounts taken into income under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-19, and any income triggered under any comparable

  

    

provisions of state, local or foreign Tax law) resulting from or related to
Contemplated Transactions on the relevant Tax Returns for all periods through
and including the Closing Date and pay any Taxes attributable to such income.

  

  

(g) _Straddle Periods_. For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any
Taxes of the Sellers or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries that are payable
with respect to any Tax period that begins before and ends after the Closing
Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of any such Taxes that constitutes
Pre-Closing Taxes shall: (i) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) based
upon or related to income or receipts, or (B) imposed in connection with any
sale, transfer or assignment or any deemed sale, transfer or assignment of
property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), be deemed equal to the
amount that would be payable if the Tax year or period ended at the Effective
Time; and (ii) in the case of Taxes (other than those described in clause (i)
above) that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the business or
assets of the Sellers or the Transferred Subsidiaries or otherwise measured by
the level of any item, be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis,
the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding Tax period) multiplied
by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the
portion of the Straddle Period ending at the Effective Time and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period. For purposes of clause (i) of the preceding sentence, any exemption,
deduction, credit or other item (including the effect of any graduated rates
of Tax) that is calculated on an annual basis shall be allocated to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending at the Effective Time on a pro rata
basis determined by multiplying the total amount of such item allocated to the
Straddle Period times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending at the Effective
Time and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
Straddle Period. In the case of any Tax based upon or measured by capital
(including net worth or long-term debt) or intangibles, any amount thereof
required to be allocated under this _Section __6.3_ _(g)_ shall be computed by
reference to the level of such items on the Closing Date. The parties hereto
will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, elect with the relevant
taxing authorities to treat a portion of any Straddle Period as a short
taxable period ending as of the Effective Time.

  

(h) _Tax Reporting_. For all Tax purposes, the Purchaser and the Sellers agree
to report the Contemplated Transactions in a manner consistent with the terms
of this Agreement, and shall take no position contrary thereto unless required
to do so by applicable Law or a Final Determination.

  

Section 6.4 _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. On the Closing Date, all
Tax sharing agreements and arrangements and any similar Contracts between (a)
any Transferred Subsidiary, on the one hand, and (b) any Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than any Transferred Subsidiary), on the other hand, shall
be terminated effective as of the close of business on the Closing Date and
shall have no further effect for any Tax period (whether past, present or
future) and, after the Closing Date, no additional payments shall be made
thereunder with respect to any Tax period, whether in respect of a
redetermination of Liabilities for Taxes or otherwise. The Sellers and the
Purchaser

  

    

shall take all steps necessary to ensure that each such termination is
effective in the manner described above.

  

  

Section 6.5 _Tax Cooperation_. The Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Sellers, on the other hand, shall provide the other with such information and
records, and make such of its officers, directors, employees and agents
available, as may reasonably be requested by such other party in connection
with the preparation of any Tax Return or the conduct of any audit, claim for
refund or administrative or judicial proceeding involving any asserted Tax
liability or refund (any such audit, claim for refund or administrative or
judicial proceeding, a " _Tax Contest_ "). Any information and records
obtained under this _Section __6.5_ shall be kept confidential, except as may
be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or in the
conduct of a Tax Contest.

  

Section 6.6 _Public Announcements_. No party hereto will issue or cause the
publication of, or permit any of its Affiliates to issue or cause the
publication of, any press release or other public announcement with respect to
this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
herein will prohibit any party hereto from issuing or causing publication of
any such press release or public announcement to the extent that such
disclosure is, upon advice of counsel, required by Law or the rules of any
stock exchange on which the securities of the disclosing party are listed, in
which case the party making such determination will, if practicable in the
circumstances, use reasonable efforts to allow the other parties reasonable
time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of its issuance.

  

Section 6.7 _Collection of Seller Accounts Receivable_. The Sellers agree
that, from and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall have the right and
authority to collect for the Purchaser's own account or for the account of its
Affiliates all Transferred Accounts Receivable. The Purchaser shall have the
right to endorse with the name of the applicable Seller any checks received on
account of any Transferred Accounts Receivable. The Sellers agree to promptly
transfer and deliver to the Purchaser any cash or other assets that any Seller
or its Affiliates may receive in respect of any Transferred Accounts
Receivable.

  

Section 6.8 _Collection of Other Payments_.

  

(a) In addition to the obligations set forth above in _Section __6.7_ , if, at
any time or from time to time after the Closing, the Sellers or any of their
Affiliates receive any cash payments that constitute Transferred Assets
(including insurance or condemnation proceeds referred to in _Section
__2.1(l)_ ) (the " _Post-Closing Collection Amounts_ "), (a) such Post-Closing
Collection Amounts shall be received by the receiving party as agent for and
on behalf of the Purchaser, and (b) the receiving party shall promptly notify
the Purchaser thereof and shall promptly remit all such receipts to the
Purchaser as soon as practicable, and shall provide to the Purchaser
appropriate information as to the nature, source and classification of such
payment.

  

    

(b) If, at any time or from time to time after the Closing, the Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates receive any cash payments in respect of the Excluded
Assets, (i) such payments shall be received by the Purchaser or its Affiliates
as agent for and on behalf of the Sellers, and (ii) the Purchaser or its
Affiliates shall promptly notify the Sellers thereof and shall promptly remit
all such receipts to the Parent Seller as soon as practicable, and shall
provide to the Parent Seller appropriate information as to the nature, source
and classification of such payment.

  

Section 6.9 _Insurance_. For a period of three (3) years from the Closing
Date, the Sellers shall (a) use their respective reasonable efforts to take
such actions as are necessary to cause insurance policies of the Sellers that
immediately prior to the Closing provide coverage to or with respect to the
Business, the Transferred Assets or the Assumed Liabilities to continue to
provide such coverage with respect to acts, omissions and events occurring
prior to the Closing in accordance with their terms as if the Closing had not
occurred or (b) replace, at the Sellers' sole cost and expense, such insurance
policies with a new insurance policy or policies which provide comparable
coverage. The Sellers shall cooperate with and assist the Purchaser, if the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates determines to make any claim under any such
policy with respect to any pre-Closing act, omission or event.

  

Section 6.10 _Employee Matters_.

  

(a) The Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall offer employment to each
Business Employee (other than Inactive Employees and the individuals set forth
on _Schedule 6.10(a)_ of the Disclosure Letter) who is not employed by a
Transferred Subsidiary, subject to the Closing and commencing as of the
Effective Time on the Closing Date. Such offer for employment shall provide
(i) base pay that is no less than such Business Employee's rate of base pay as
in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) employee benefits
(excluding equity and cash incentive compensation, retiree medical and defined
benefit pension benefits) that are comparable in the aggregate to those
provided to similarly situated employees of the Purchaser. As of the Closing
Date, the Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall cause each of the
Transferred Subsidiaries to continue to employ all of its Business Employees.
The Sellers shall promptly update the information to be provided under
_Schedules 4.20(a)_ and _4.20(b)_ of the Disclosure Letter to reflect all
employment or service hirings or terminations occurring prior to the Closing
Date, with the final such update to occur no later than eight (8) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date. The Sellers shall permit the Purchaser to
distribute any such offers at least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date. The Purchaser and the Sellers agree to cooperate and cause their
respective Affiliates to cooperate in respect of communicating with the
Business Employees, and the Sellers and the Purchaser each agree not to take
any action to discourage any Business Employee from accepting the offer of
employment with the Purchaser. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Sellers
shall permit representatives of the Purchaser to be present physically at the
location(s) where Business Employees receiving offers are employed or
providing services to facilitate the collection of all necessary onboarding
paperwork. Business Employees who accept offers of employment under this
_Section 6.10_ shall be referred to herein as " _Transferred Employees_ ". The
employees employed by the

  

    

  

Transferred Subsidiaries as of the Closing and the Transferred Employees shall
collectively be referred to herein as "Continuing Employees".

  

  

(b) The Sellers shall retain all Business Employees in their employ through
the Effective Time on the Closing Date and shall not terminate the employment
of any Business Employees after the date of this Agreement other than under
circumstances that would constitute "cause" for immediate termination as
reasonably determined by the Parent Seller and, with respect to those Business
Employees who accept the Purchaser's offers of employment, the Sellers shall
establish their termination date with the Sellers on the Closing Date.
Following the making of any offer of employment by the Purchaser, the Sellers
agree not to terminate the employment of any such Business Employee who has
received such an offer for any reason without first consulting with the
Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). Each Transferred
Employee shall be hired on an "at will" basis unless otherwise agreed by the
Purchaser. Neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall be obligated
to continue to employ any Continuing Employee for any specific period of time
following the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers and their
Affiliates shall remain sponsors of all Benefit Plans and there shall be no
transfer of assets and Liabilities from any Benefit Plan to any plan or
arrangement maintained by the Purchaser or its Affiliates. For the avoidance
of doubt, a contract of employment that is a Transferred Contract shall not be
considered a Benefit Plan for purposes of this _Section 6.10(b)_.

  

(c) Any Inactive Employee shall not be considered a Transferred Employee
unless and until such Inactive Employee returns to active status pursuant to
the following sentence and accepts the Purchaser's offer of employment, and
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall only be responsible for Liabilities relating to any Inactive
Employees from and after the date such Inactive Employee becomes a Transferred
Employee. The Purchaser's obligation to employ any Inactive Employee shall be
conditioned upon such Inactive Employee's return to active work, provided that
the Inactive Employee reports to work with the Purchaser within fifteen (15)
days after the end of any such approved leave and, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, in no event later than one hundred eighty (180) days following
the Closing Date, and such Inactive Employee shall be a Transferred Employee
upon his or her acceptance of the Purchaser's offer of employment. The
Purchaser shall make an offer of employment, consistent with the provisions of
_Section 6.10(a)_, to each Inactive Employee who notifies the Purchaser of his
or her intent to return to active work within the timelines set forth in the
preceding sentence.

  

(d) Prior to the Closing, and prior to the Sellers or any of their Affiliates
making any written or oral communications to any Business Employees pertaining
to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the Contemplated
Transactions, or to any other matters relating thereto, the Purchaser shall
have a reasonable period of time (not in excess of five (5) days) to review
and comment on the communication, and the Sellers and the Purchaser shall
cooperate in revising such communication in a mutually agreeable manner.

  

    

(e) Subject to, and effective as of, the Closing, the Sellers hereby waive and
release each of the Transferred Employees from any post-termination
contractual restrictions enforceable by the Sellers and their Affiliates on
the employment, activities or other conduct of such individuals with the
Business after their employment or service commences with the Purchaser or one
of its Affiliates, except with respect to obligations related to
confidentiality and trade secrets.

  

(f) Prior to the Closing Date, and to the extent necessary to implement this
sentence, the Sellers shall cause to be taken all actions as may be reasonably
required to amend any Benefit Plan and take or cause to be taken all other
action as may be reasonably required to provide that severance or separation
payments shall not be payable to any Transferred Employee on account of such
Transferred Employee's termination of employment with the Sellers and their
Affiliates, and for the avoidance of doubt, Excluded Employee Liabilities
include all Liabilities with respect to any such severance or separation
payments that may become payable as a result of the Contemplated Transactions.
The Sellers shall be liable for any amounts to which any current or former
Business Employee becomes entitled under any Benefit Plan, agreement,
arrangement or program which exists or arises, or may be deemed to exist or
arise, under any applicable Law or otherwise (excluding all payments under the
Sales Incentive Plans for the Business), prior to or on the Effective Time, as
a result of, or in connection with, the execution of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions. Notwithstanding any other
provision in the Agreement to the contrary, no Business Employee (or his or
her beneficiary or dependent) shall accrue additional benefits following the
Closing Date under, remain covered as an "active" participant by, or
participate in any Benefit Plan.

  

(g) Effective as of the Closing, each applicable Purchaser 401(k) Plan shall
be amended to accept as part of a "direct rollover" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(30) of the Code) from a Continuing Employee any loan
outstanding under the Sellers' 401(k) Plan. Effective not later than the
Closing, the Sellers shall cause the Scholastic Corporation 401(k) Savings and
Retirement Plan (the " _Sellers ' 401(k) Plan_") to be amended to provide
that, for purposes of any loans outstanding under such plan, no loan of a
Continuing Employee shall become due on account of such Continuing Employee's
termination from employment with the Sellers and their Affiliates pursuant to
the Contemplated Transactions or, if applicable, the Transferred Subsidiaries'
withdrawal from participation in the Sellers' 401(k) Plan immediately prior to
the Closing.

  

(h) Effective as of the Closing Date and in accordance with the Sellers'
policies and procedures, each Retiree Medical Eligible Transferred Employee
(and his or her eligible dependents) shall be required to elect whether or not
to receive retiree medical benefits under the Scholastic Inc. Retiree Medical
Plan (the " _Retiree Medical Plan_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Retiree Medical Eligible Transferred Employee_ " means each Continuing
Employee who will have satisfied as of the Closing Date the age and service
eligibility requirements to receive (and who would have been eligible to
receive) retiree medical benefits under the Retiree Medical Plan if he or she
had elected such coverage immediately following his or her severance of
employment at

  

    

the Closing. Notwithstanding any other provision in the Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall impact any right the Seller might
have to amend or terminate the Retiree Medical Plan.

  

  

(i) As of the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall have created a health care
flexible spending account or limited-purpose health care flexible spending
account, as applicable, under the Purchaser's flexible spending account plan
for medical maintained under Section 125 of the Code (an " _FSA Plan_ ") for
each Continuing Employee who, as of immediately prior to the Closing Date,
maintained a health care flexible spending account or limited-purpose health
care flexible spending account under the Sellers' FSA Plan, and shall credit
such account with an amount equal to such balance; _provided_ , to the extent
that the FSA Plan accounts are not reflected on the Closing Statement, then
the Sellers shall transfer, in accordance with Revenue Ruling 2002-32 and any
subsequent guidance, to the Purchaser within sixty (60) days after the Closing
Date a cash payment in a net amount equal to contributions to the Sellers' FSA
Plan by the Continuing Employees from January 1, 2015 up to the Closing Date,
less reimbursements to Continuing Employees during such period. The Sellers
shall not be responsible for, and shall have no Liability relating to,
resulting from or arising out of the provision of health care reimbursement
benefits to Continuing Employees following the transfer of the flexible
spending account balances to the Purchaser's FSA Plan. Continuing Employee
participant elections, contribution levels and coverage levels, as in effect
prior to the Closing Date, will continue to be effective on and after the
Closing Date and, accordingly, honored under the Purchaser's FSA Plan in the
same manner as under the Sellers' FSA Plan.

  

(j) Upon the Closing, the Sellers shall, or shall cause their Affiliates to,
pay to all Continuing Employees: (i) any account balances under all vacation
paid time off and sick leave policies accrued but unused as of the Closing
Date; (ii) all bonuses (excluding all payments under the Sales Incentive Plans
for the Business) for the fiscal year that includes the Closing, pro-rated
based on the length of time elapsed since the beginning of such fiscal year
through the Closing Date and paid out to the extent targets in respect of such
bonuses have been obtained (with such targets pro-rated based on the length of
time elapsed since the beginning of such fiscal year through the Closing
Date); and (iii) any earned but unpaid bonuses (excluding all payments under
the Sales Incentive Plans for the Business) with respect to the fiscal year
prior to the fiscal year that includes the Closing.

  

(k) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Sellers shall, or shall cause, each
Continuing Employee who was participating in the Sellers' 401(k) Plan
immediately prior to the Closing Date to be fully vested in his or her account
as of the Closing Date, to the extent not fully vested.

  

(l) The Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, credit Continuing
Employees for service earned on and prior to the Closing Date with the Sellers
and their Affiliates, or any of their respective predecessors, in addition to
service earned with the Purchaser and its Affiliates on or after the Closing
Date, to the extent that service is relevant for purposes of eligibility,
vesting or the calculation of vacation, sick

  

    

days, severance, layoff and similar benefits (but not for purposes of equity
compensation, nonqualified defined contribution plans, retiree medical or
pension benefit accruals) under any retirement or other employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates for the
benefit of the Continuing Employees on or after the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that (i)
such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or (ii) such
service was not recognized under the corresponding Benefit Plan. Without
limiting the foregoing, from and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause
to be waived any pre-existing conditions or limitations, eligibility waiting
periods or required physical examinations under welfare benefit plans,
policies or practices of the Purchaser or its Affiliates for the Continuing
Employees and their beneficiaries and dependents. As of the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall have created an account (a "Purchaser HRA Account") under the
Purchaser's health reimbursement account plan (the "Purchaser HRA Plan") or an
account (a "Purchaser HSA Account") under the Purchaser's health savings
account plan (the "Purchaser HSA Plan") for each Continuing Employee who, as
of immediately prior to the Closing Date, maintained an account (a "Seller HRA
Account") under the Sellers' health reimbursement account plan (the "Seller
HRA Plan"), and shall either (A) if such Continuing Employee elects to
participate in the Purchaser HRA Plan, credit such Purchaser HRA Account with
an amount equal to the sum of (x) the balance in his or her Seller HRA Account
as of the Closing Date plus (y) the annual amount (not prorated) that such
Continuing Employee would be eligible to receive for 2015 based on his or her
coverage election under the Purchaser HRA Plan, or (B) if such Continuing
Employee elects to participate in the Purchaser HSA Plan, credit such
Purchaser HSA Account with an amount equal to the balance in his or her Seller
HRA Account as of the Closing Date (and he or she shall be eligible to receive
the Purchaser contributions in 2015 to the Purchaser HSA Account in accordance
with the terms of the Purchaser HSA Plan). Within thirty (30) days following
the Closing Date, the Sellers shall provide to the Purchaser a schedule
setting forth for each Continuing Employee with a Seller HRA Account the
remaining balance thereunder as of the Closing Date (reflecting any run-out
claims debited post-Closing).

  

  

(m) In the case of non-U.S. Business Employees, the Sellers, the Purchaser and
their respective Affiliates shall cooperate in complying with any additional
obligations or standards arising under applicable Law governing the terms and
conditions of their employment or termination of employment in connection with
the transfer of the Business or otherwise.

  

(n) Pursuant to the "Standard Procedure" provided in Section 4 of Revenue
Procedure 2004-53, 2004-2 C.B. 320, (i) the Purchaser and the Sellers shall
report on a predecessor/successor basis as set forth therein, (ii) the Sellers
will not be relieved from filing a Form W-2 with respect to any Transferred
Employees, and (iii) the Purchaser will undertake to file (or cause to be
filed) a Form W-2 for each such Transferred Employee with respect to the
portion of the year during which such Transferred Employees are employed by
the Purchaser that includes the Closing Date, excluding the portion of such
year that such Transferred Employee was employed by the Sellers and their
Affiliates.

  

    

(o) Without limiting the generality of this _Section __6.10_ , no provision of
this Agreement shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any current
or former Business Employee, Business Service Provider or Continuing Employee
(including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) in respect of continued
employment by the Sellers, any of the Sellers' Affiliates, the Purchaser, any
of the Purchaser's Affiliates or otherwise. Nothing herein shall (i) guarantee
employment for any period of time or preclude the ability of the Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates to terminate any Continuing Employee for any reason,
(ii) require the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to continue any Benefit
Plans, employee benefits plans or arrangements or prevent the amendment,
modification or termination thereof after the Closing, or (iii) constitute an
amendment to any Benefit Plan, employee benefit plans or arrangements.

  

(p) Aside from Business Service Providers who are subject to a Transferred
Contract, the Purchaser or one of its Affiliates may offer to employ certain
Business Service Providers as it determines in its sole discretion.

  

Section 6.11 _Bulk Sales Compliance_. The Purchaser hereby waives compliance
by the Sellers or any of their Affiliates with any applicable bulk sale or
bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the sale of the
Transferred Assets to the Purchaser.

  

Section 6.12 _Restrictive Covenants_.

  

(a) In order for the Purchaser to have and enjoy the full benefit of the
Business, and as a material inducement to the Purchaser to enter into this
Agreement (without such inducement the Purchaser would not have entered into
this Agreement), each Seller agrees that it shall not, directly or indirectly
(whether by itself, through an Affiliate, or in partnership or conjunction
with any other Person):

  

(i) for a period of three (3) years commencing from the Closing Date,
undertake, participate, carry on, be engaged or have any financial or other
interest in, or in any other manner advise or assist any other Person in
connection with, the operation of any Competing Business in the United States
other than:

  

(A) making passive investments in up to five percent (5%) of the outstanding
publicly-traded securities of any Person engaged in a Competing Business;
_provided_ , neither the Sellers nor any of their Affiliates participate in
the management or governance of such Person;

  

(B) exercising their rights or complying with their obligations under this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents; or

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Purchaser and the Parent Seller upon
written notice to the other party hereto;

  

(b) by the Purchaser (if it is not in material breach of its representations,
warranties or covenants under this Agreement so as to cause any of the
conditions set forth in _Section __8.1_ or _Section 8.2_ not to be satisfied),
upon written notice to the Parent Seller, if there has been a material
violation, breach or inaccuracy of any

  

    

representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of any Seller contained in
this Agreement, which violation, breach or inaccuracy would cause any of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 not to be satisfied, and
such violation, breach or inaccuracy has not been waived by the Purchaser or
cured by the Sellers within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Parent
Seller of written notice thereof from the Purchaser or is not reasonably
capable of being cured prior to the Termination Date;

  

  

(c) by the Parent Seller (if no Seller is in material breach of its
representations, warranties or covenants under this Agreement so as to cause
any of the conditions set forth in _Section __7.1_ or _Section 7.2_ not to be
satisfied), upon written notice to the Purchaser, if there has been a material
violation, breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of the Purchaser contained in this Agreement, which violation,
breach or inaccuracy would cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section
__8.1_ or _Section 8.2_ not to be satisfied, and such violation, breach or
inaccuracy has not been waived by the Parent Seller or cured by the Purchaser
within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Purchaser of written notice
thereof from the Parent Seller or is not reasonably capable of being cured
prior to the Termination Date;

  

(d) by the Purchaser or the Parent Seller, upon written notice to the other
parties hereto, if the Contemplated Transactions have not been consummated on
or before August 21, 2015 (the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ , neither
party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
__9.1(d)_ if such party's willful breach of this Agreement has been the
proximate cause of the failure of the Contemplated Transactions to have been
consummated on or prior to such Termination Date;

  

(e) by either the Purchaser or the Parent Seller, upon written notice to the
other parties hereto, if a court of competent jurisdiction or any other
Governmental Authority shall have issued a final, non-appealable Order or Law
preventing or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

  

(f) by either the Purchaser or the Parent Seller, if (i) the Closing shall not
have occurred on or before the Termination Date, (ii) all of the conditions
set forth in _Article VII_ and _Article VIII_ have been satisfied at the time
of such termination (other than conditions that, either (A) by their nature,
are to be satisfied at the Closing (and which are, at the time of termination
of this Agreement, capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur at

Sellers have notified the Purchaser in writing that all conditions with
respect to the Sellers' obligation to effect the Closing set forth in _Article

waive any such unsatisfied conditions) and the Sellers are ready, willing and
able to effect the Closing at the time of termination, and (iv) the Debt
Financing has not or cannot be funded on or before the date by which the
Closing is required to be consummated pursuant to _Section 3.1_.

  

    

Section 9.2 _Survival After Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated by
the parties in accordance with _Section __9.1_ hereof, this Agreement shall
become void and of no further force and effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the provisions of this _Section __9.2_ and _Article __XI_ shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and that nothing herein shall relieve any party
hereto from any Liability for fraud or any breach of the provisions of this
Agreement prior to such termination.

  

Section 9.3 _Reverse Termination Fee_.

  

(a) If this Agreement is validly terminated by either the Purchaser or the
Parent Seller pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_, then within five (5) Business Days
after the date of such termination, the Parent Seller may elect, in lieu of
exercising any other remedy provided for under this Agreement, to request in
writing that the Purchaser pay the Reverse Termination Fee to the Parent
Seller. If the Parent Seller delivers such written notice requesting the
Reverse Termination Fee, the Purchaser shall pay, within five (5) Business
Days after receipt of such written notice, the Reverse Termination Fee in cash
by wire transfer to the Parent Seller in accordance with wire instructions
provided by the Parent Seller in such written notice.

  

(b) The Purchaser acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
9.3_ are an integral part of the Contemplated Transactions and that, without
these agreements, the Parent Seller would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Purchaser fails to pay the Reverse Termination Fee due
pursuant to this _Section 9.3_ upon request by the Parent Seller and, in order
to obtain such payment, the Parent Seller commences an Action that results in
a judgment against the Purchaser for the Reverse Termination Fee, the
Purchaser shall pay to the Parent Seller its fees, costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and expenses) in connection with
such Action, together with interest on the Reverse Termination Fee from the
date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the
prime lending rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made plus five percent (5%).

  

(c) The parties hereto further acknowledge and agree that the payment of the
Reverse Termination Fee and the interest thereon by the Purchaser specified in
this _Section 9.3_ is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages in a reasonable
amount that will compensate the Parent Seller in the circumstances in which
such fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and the
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, if the Parent Seller elects to receive and is paid the Reverse
Termination Fee, such payment shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Sellers and their Affiliates against the Purchaser or any of its
former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, members,
managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates or assignees
(collectively, the " _Purchaser Related Parties_ ") for all Losses suffered as
a result of the failure of the Contemplated Transactions to be consummated or
for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon

  

    

payment of such amount, none of the Purchaser Related Parties shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the Contemplated Transactions, other than any damages arising out of fraud.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, it is explicitly
agreed that the Parent Seller shall not be required to elect to request the
Reverse Termination Fee and shall be entitled to instead obtain an injunction,
specific performance or other appropriate form of equitable relief to cause
the Purchaser to consummate the Contemplated Transactions, but under no
circumstances shall the Parent Seller be permitted or entitled to receive both
a grant of specific performance and payment of the Reverse Termination Fee or
permitted or entitled to receive any other remedy in the event this Agreement
is validly terminated pursuant to Section 9.1(f).

  

  

Section 9.4 _Debt Financing Sources_. The Sellers and their Affiliates hereby
agree that (a) in no event shall the Debt Financing Sources have any liability
or obligation to the Sellers, any of their Subsidiaries or any of its
Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing,
any commitment letters or engagement letters relating thereto or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and (b) in no event shall the
Sellers or any of their Affiliates or stockholders seek or obtain any other
damages of any kind against any Debt Financing Source (including
consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages). The provisions of this
_Section 9.4_ shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, each Debt
Financing Source, its respective Affiliates and their respective successors
and permitted assigns, each of which is hereby intended to be an express third
party beneficiary of this _Section 9.4_. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 9.4_, such provisions will not limit the rights of
the parties to the Debt Financing under the definitive Debt Financing
agreements.

Section 10.2 _Indemnification of the Purchaser_. Subject to the limitations
set forth in this _Article __X_ , from and after the Closing, the Sellers,

not have any obligation to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant
to _Section 10.2(a)_ (x) unless the Losses incurred or sustained by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties for a breach or group of breaches relating to
the same claim or incident or series of similar claims or incidents exceed
$75,000 (the " _De Minimis Amount_ ") and (y) unless and until, and only to
the extent that, the aggregate amount of all such individual Losses which are
greater than the De Minimis Amount incurred or sustained by all Purchaser
Indemnified Parties with respect to which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
are entitled to indemnification under _Section __10.2(a)_ exceeds $3,250,000
(the " _Threshold Amount_ "), whereupon the Sellers shall be liable for only
such Losses in excess of the Threshold Amount, and (ii) the aggregate
liability of the Sellers to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for
Losses under _Section __10.2(a)_ shall in no event exceed

  

    

$57,500,000 (the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
limitations set forth in this Section 10.4(a) shall not apply to a claim for
indemnification to the extent such claim is based on a breach of any of the
Seller Fundamental Representations or the Seller's representations and
warranties set forth in Section 4.29(a) (Sufficiency of Assets). The
obligations of the Sellers, jointly and severally, to make any payment for a
claim for indemnification under Section 10.2 prior to the Expiration Date to
any Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be satisfied: (A) first, from
available amounts in the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement, and (B) thereafter from the Sellers, jointly and severally,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such Purchaser Indemnified
Party. The parties hereto shall promptly, and in any event no later than five
(5) Business Days after any Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to
payments from the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Article X, cause the Escrow
Agent to distribute such amounts from the Escrow Fund. For the avoidance of
doubt, none of the limitations set forth in the first sentence of this Section
10.4(a) shall apply to the indemnification obligation of the Sellers pursuant
to Section 10.2(b) through Section 10.2(f).

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (i) the Purchaser
shall not have any obligation to indemnify any Seller Indemnified Party
pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)_ (x) unless the Losses incurred or sustained by
the Seller Indemnified Parties for a breach or group of breaches relating to
the same claim or incident or series of similar claims or incidents exceed the
De Minimis Amount and (y) unless and until, and only to the extent that, the
aggregate amount of all individual Losses which are greater than the De
Minimis Amount incurred or sustained by all Seller Indemnified Parties with
respect to which the Seller Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification under _Section __10.3(a)_ exceeds the Threshold Amount,
whereupon the Purchaser shall be liable for only such Losses in excess of the
Threshold Amount, and (ii) the aggregate liability of the Purchaser to
indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties for Losses under _Section __10.3(a)_
shall in no event exceed an amount equal to the Cap; _provided_ , _however_ ,

breach of any of the Purchaser Fundamental Representations. The obligation of
the Purchaser to make any payment for a claim for indemnification under
_Section 10.3_ prior to the Expiration Date to any Seller Indemnified Parties
shall be satisfied by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
Seller Indemnified Party. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the limitations
set forth in the first sentence of this _Section 10.4(b)_ shall apply to the
indemnification obligation of the Purchaser pursuant to _Section 10.3(b)_

any, and reduced by the amount of the Tax benefit, if any, as a result of
incurring the Liability at issue, in each case only to the extent such Tax
cost or benefit is actually realized by the indemnified party in the year that
the indemnification payment is made, for the following taxable year. In
computing the amount of any Tax cost or Tax benefit, the indemnitee shall be
deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit
before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of any indemnification
payment hereunder or the incurrence or payment of any indemnified

  

    

Loss. Nothing in the foregoing shall provide the Sellers with any access or
right to review any Tax Return of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.

  

  

Section 10.5 _Limitation on Remedies_. From and after the Closing, except with
respect to claims arising from fraud and subject to _Section __11.13_ and
except as otherwise provided in the Transaction Documents, the provisions of
this _Article __X_ shall constitute the exclusive remedy for money damages in
respect of breaches of representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement, in any other Transaction Document or in any
certificate, schedule or document delivered with respect hereto or thereto.

  

Section 10.6 _Non-Third Party Claims_.

  

(a) In order to seek indemnification under this _Article __X_ other than in
connection with a Third Party Claim, any Person entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this _Article __X_ (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall deliver to
the party or parties obligated to indemnify it pursuant to this _Article __X_
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") written notice of such claim in reasonable
detail in light of the circumstances then known to such Indemnified Party (a "
_Notice of Claim_ "); _provided_ , that the failure of the Indemnified Party
to provide such Notice of Claim shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its obligations hereunder, subject to the period during which the Indemnified
Party can make claims under _Section 10.1_ (the " _Claim Period_ ") not having
expired, except to the extent that such failure to give notice shall prejudice
any substantive defense available to the Indemnifying Party. As used herein, "
_Claimed Amount_ " means the amount of any Losses incurred or reasonably
expected to be incurred by the Indemnified Party.

  

(b) Within thirty (30) days after delivery of a Notice of Claim (the " _Review
Period_ "), the Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a
written response (the " _Response_ "), in which the Indemnifying Party shall
either: (i) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive the
Claimed Amount; (ii) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive
part, but not all of the Claimed Amount (the " _Agreed Amount_ "); or (iii)
dispute that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the Claimed
Amount.

  

(c) During the 30-day period following the delivery of a Response that
reflects a dispute resulting from the Indemnifying Party disputing its
liability in a Response for all or part of the Claimed Amount (a " _Dispute_
"), the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall use good faith
efforts to resolve the Dispute. If the Dispute is not resolved within such
30-day period, then the parties will resolve such Dispute in accordance with
the provisions of _Section __11.10_ and _Section __11.11_.

  

(d) This _Section __10.6_ shall not apply to Tax Contests, which shall be
governed by _Section __10.8_.

  

    

Section 10.7 _Third Party Claims_.

  

(a) Promptly after the receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice of the
commencement of any Action by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such
Indemnified Party shall, if a claim with respect thereto is to be made against
the Indemnifying Party, give such Indemnifying Party written notice of such
Third Party Claim in reasonable detail in light of the circumstances then
known to such Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim Notice_ "); _provided_
, that the failure of the Indemnified Party to provide such notice shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, subject to the
Claim Period not having expired, except to the extent that such failure to
give notice shall prejudice any substantive defense available to the
Indemnifying Party.

  

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the defense of any
Third Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party, at the Indemnifying Party's sole expense; _provided_ , the Indemnifying
Party shall not be entitled to assume or continue control of the defense of
any Third Party Claim if (i) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in
connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or
investigation, (ii) the Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable
relief against any Indemnified Party, (iii) the Indemnifying Party has failed
to defend or is failing to defend in good faith the Third Party Claim, or (iv)
the Indemnifying Party has not acknowledged that such Third Party Claim is
subject to indemnification pursuant to this _Article __X_ , within thirty (30)
days after receipt of a Third Party Claim Notice. The Indemnifying Party shall
have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to monitor the defense of any
Third Party Claim, the defense of which it is not entitled to assume or
control pursuant to this _Section __10.7_.

  

(c) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim,
(i) it shall not settle the Third Party Claim without the consent of the
Indemnified Party unless the settlement shall include (A) no admission of
liability on the part of any Indemnified Party and (B) an unconditional
release of each Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as
applicable, reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, from all
liability with respect to such Third Party Claim, (ii) it shall indemnify and
hold the Indemnified Party harmless from and against any Losses caused by or
arising out of any settlement or judgment of such Third Party Claim and may
not claim that it does not have an indemnification obligation with respect
thereto, and (iii) the Indemnified Party shall have the right (but not the
obligation) to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim and to
employ, at its own expense, counsel separate from counsel employed by the
Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , that the fees, costs and expenses of such
counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party are both named parties to the proceedings and
the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that representation of
both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or
potential differing interests between them.

  

(d) The Indemnified Party shall not settle any Third Party Claim without the
consent of the Indemnifying Party if the Indemnifying Party shall have

  

    

any obligation as a result of such settlement (whether monetary or otherwise)
unless such settlement is consented to in writing by the Indemnifying Party,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

  

(e) Each party hereto shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates
to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim. Any
consent to be given by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties under this _Section
__10.7_ shall be given by the Purchaser acting on behalf of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties and any consent to be given by the Seller Indemnified
Parties under this _Section __10.7_ shall be given by the Parent Seller acting
on behalf of the Seller Indemnified Parties.

  

(f) This _Section __10.7_ shall not apply to Tax Contests, which shall be
governed by _Section __10.8_ nor shall it apply to Covered Claims, which shall
be governed by _Schedule 10.2(f)_ of the Disclosure Letter.

  

Section 10.8 _Tax Contests_.

  

(a) After the Closing Date, except as provided in _Section 10.8(b)_ and
_Section 10.8(c)_ below, the Purchaser shall control the conduct, through a
counsel of its own choosing, of any Tax Contest that is Related to the
Business or relates to the Transferred Assets (including the Transferred
Subsidiaries).

  

(b) The Purchaser shall notify the Sellers within ten (10) business days of a
Tax Contest for a Pre-Closing Tax Period with respect to a Transferred
Subsidiary or that directly relates to the Business. With respect to any Tax
Contest relating (i) solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period for which the Sellers
would have an indemnification obligation hereunder or (ii) to Consolidated
Taxes, the Sellers may choose in their sole discretion to control all
proceedings and may make all decisions taken in connection with any such Tax
Contest (including selection of counsel), and, without limiting the foregoing,
may, in their sole discretion, pursue or forego any and all administrative
appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any Governmental Authority
with respect thereto, and may, in their sole discretion, either pay the
applicable Tax Liability and sue for a refund or contest the Tax at issue in
such Tax Proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent Seller shall
keep the Purchaser reasonably advised during any such Tax Contest, and shall
not settle, compromise or concede any portion of such Tax Contest that is
reasonably likely to have an adverse effect on the Transferred Subsidiaries or
with respect to the Business for any taxable year (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Effective Time without the consent of the Purchaser, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. If the
Parent Seller fails to assume control of the conduct of any such Tax Contest
within a reasonable period following the receipt by the Parent Seller of
notice of such proceeding, the Purchaser shall have the right to assume
control of such Tax Contest and to settle, compromise and/or concede such
proceeding in its sole discretion.

  

(c) In the case of a Tax Contest after the Closing Date that relates to both
Taxes of the Transferred Subsidiaries and the Business (other than
Consolidated Taxes, which shall be governed by _Section 10.8(b)_ above) for
both a Pre-

  

    

Closing Tax Period for which the Sellers would have an indemnification
obligation hereunder and a Tax period (or portion thereof) that ends after the
Effective Time, the Parent Seller and the Purchaser shall jointly control the
conduct of such Tax Contest, and neither the Parent Seller nor the Purchaser
shall settle, compromise and/or concede such proceeding, or shall permit any
of their Affiliates to do so, without the consent of the other party, such
consent, in each case, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed.

  

  

Section 10.9 _Payments_.

  

(a) Any payment pursuant to a claim for indemnification under this _Article
__X_ shall be made no later than two (2) Business Days following the last day
of the Review Period, unless the claim is subject to defense as provided in
_Section __10.7_ above, in which case payment shall be made not later than two
(2) Business Days after the amount of the claim is finally determined by
written agreement between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party or
a nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. In addition,
such Party shall reimburse the other Party for any costs or expenses of any
nature or kind whatsoever (including all reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred
in seeking to collect any such Losses to which it is entitled. Any
indemnification payment pursuant to this _Article __X_ which is not made when
due shall bear interest at five percent (5%) per annum from the date due until
paid or, if less, the maximum rate permitted by applicable usury laws.
Interest on any such unpaid amount shall be compounded monthly, computed on
the basis of a 360-day year and shall be payable on demand. Any amounts
payable under _Article __X_ shall be treated by the Purchaser and the Sellers
as adjustments to the Purchase Price (including for applicable Tax purposes),
unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

  

(b) The Escrow Amount shall be available to satisfy all claims for
indemnification of Losses brought by a Purchaser Indemnified Party after such
Losses have been finally determined in accordance with _Article __X_ and
_Section __10.9(a)_ above. After the Escrow Amount has been fully released
from the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, a
Purchaser Indemnified Party shall assert claims for indemnification of Losses
directly against the Sellers, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Agreement.

  

Section 10.10 _Mitigation_. Each Indemnified Party will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses with respect to which it may be
entitled to seek indemnification pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, for the purpose of mitigating any such Losses, no
Indemnified Party shall be required to (a) incur any material out-of-pocket
costs or expenses or pay any other material amounts to third parties, except
to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has acknowledged in writing that
such costs, expenses or other amounts constitute indemnifiable Losses
hereunder or (b) make any claims (other than claims under then-existing
insurance policies) or initiate any legal proceedings against third parties.

  

Section 10.11 _Additional Matters_. For purposes of calculating the amount of
any Losses under this _Article __X_ , (but not for determining the existence
of any breach,

  

    

misrepresentation or inaccuracy with respect to any representation or warranty
of any Sellers), any qualification as to materiality or Material Adverse
Effect set forth in any such representation or warranty shall be disregarded.
The right to indemnification, payment of Losses or other remedies based on any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement or in any certificate delivered with respect hereto will not be
affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge or
information acquired (or capable of being acquired) by any party at any time,
whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance
with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

  

  

Section 10.12 _LIMITATION ON LIABILITY_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION
OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION DOCUMENT TO THE CONTRARY, IN NO EVENT
WILL ANY PARTY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR (A) ANY SPECIAL,
EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR (B) INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL OR LOST SALES), IN EACH CASE
ARISING OUT OF THE CONDUCT OF SUCH PARTY PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR BREACH
OF SUCH PARTY'S REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS OR AGREEMENTS UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE
NONPERFORMING PARTY WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR NOT;
_PROVIDED_ , _HOWEVER_ , THAT ANY SUCH DAMAGES OF THIRD PARTIES THAT ARE AN
ELEMENT OF A THIRD PARTY CLAIM SUBJECT TO INDEMNIFICATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
TO THE EXTENT DETERMINED BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION TO BE THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF A PARTY AND ACTUALLY PAID BY SUCH PARTY WILL CONSTITUTE
IDENTIFIABLE DAMAGES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND DIRECT DAMAGES BETWEEN THE
PARTIES.

waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now

inconvenient forum. Process in any such Action may be served on any party
anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such

respect of, or by reason of, the Contemplated Transactions.

  

Section 11.15 _Severability_. If any term, provision, agreement, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
agreements, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or legal substance of the Contemplated Transactions is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such a
determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to give effect to the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in a reasonably acceptable manner so that the Contemplated
Transactions may be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

ARTICLE II 
  
  _SERVICES_

  

  

Section 2.1 _Services_. Commencing as of the date hereof:

  

  

(a) Each applicable Provider shall provide the Services to the applicable
Recipient in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement (including any terms and conditions set forth in the applicable
Schedules attached hereto).

  

  

(b) Each Provider shall make available all Third Party Software to the
applicable Recipient, subject to the terms set forth in _Article V_.

  

  

(c) Each Provider shall provide (or cause to be provided) the applicable
Services with at least the same degree of care, skill and diligence with which
such Provider provided such services to the Recipient in the ordinary course
of business during the twelve (12) month period prior to the date hereof. With
respect to Services that are provided by or through any third parties, each
Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such third parties
to continue to perform in the same manner and at the same service levels at
which such Services were provided to the Provider in the ordinary course of
business during the twelve (12) month period prior to the date hereof. If a
Provider fails to perform in accordance with this provision, such Provider
will (i) promptly investigate the root causes of the failure, (ii) use
reasonable skill and care to resolve the root cause of the problem as soon as
practicable (regardless of cause or fault) and (iii) advise the Recipient of
the status as appropriate. Each Provider shall, at all times during the Term,
provide sufficient resources and maintain sufficient personnel or employ the
services of suppliers as appropriate to provide the Services in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 2.2 _Generally Agreed Service Principles_.

  

  

(a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that all of the Services will be
provided to the Recipient at the substantially same level and scope as such
Services were provided to the Business in the ordinary course of business
prior to the Closing Date, except to the extent such Services are limited or
changed pursuant to this Agreement, and as such Services may be amended from
time to time in accordance with the terms hereof. The Parties will use good
faith efforts to cooperate with each other in all matters relating to the
provision and receipt of Services. The Purchaser acknowledges that the receipt
of certain Services may be dependent on its employees responding to or
providing information to the Seller and recognizes that to the extent the
delivery of a Service is dependent on the action of such employee of the
Purchaser, the Seller shall not be in default or in breach of its obligations
to provide a Service to the extent the Purchaser's employees have not provided
the necessary information or assistance to the Seller. The Purchaser further
acknowledges that the receipt of the Services is also dependent upon Business
Employees employed by the Purchaser after the Closing Date continuing to
perform their activities for or with respect to the Business. It is understood

  

  

  

    

  

and agreed by each party that the performance of the Business Employees after
the Closing Date is the sole responsibility of the Purchaser and, for purposes
of this Agreement (including all schedules attached hereto) Sellers take no
responsibility for the performance of such Business Employees after the
Closing Date and it is further understood and agreed that the performance of
such Business Employees after the Closing Date shall not constitute in any way
Services of the Seller under this Agreement.

  

  

(b) The Seller will provide reasonable assistance to the Purchaser during the
Term to transition the Business to the Purchaser and facilitating the
communications described in _Section 6.2_. The Seller shall have no obligation
to provide any additional consultations, services or assistance to the
Purchaser except as set forth in this Agreement, _Schedule 1_ and the other
Transaction Documents and except as it may otherwise agree in writing. The
Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the transition
of the Business and cease the use of the Services by the 12 month anniversary
of the Closing Date; _provided_ ¸ that each Party acknowledges that Services
may be needed for the duration of the Term of this Agreement. Purchaser
acknowledges that the Seller is not in the business of providing separation
services and while Seller agrees to provide reasonable assistance to
transition the Business to the Purchaser, Seller makes no representation or
warranty as to the outcome or success of such assistance. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY
SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE SELLER DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES OR THE RESULTS OR OUTCOME OF
SUCH ASSISTANCE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY
OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

  

  

(c) The Purchaser shall provide the Seller within two (2) Business Days of the
end of the month any financial information required from the Purchaser to
assist with the financial closing process. Assuming the Purchaser provides
such information to the Seller within two (2) Business Days of the end of the
month, the Seller shall provide a financial close for the Business within
eight (8) Business Days.

  

  

(d) All Services will be provided on or with the Seller's existing systems
unless the Seller updates, replaces or substitutes such systems or
accompanying hardware which the Seller may do in its sole discretion;
_provided_ , that to the extent such update, replacement or substitution is
reasonably expected to have a material effect on the delivery or provisions of
the Services, the Seller shall provide as much advance written notice as is
practicable to the Purchaser of such update, replacement or substitution and
shall discuss in good faith with the Purchaser a mutually agreeable time and
manner to commence and conduct such update, replacement or substitution in
order to minimize the effect on the Purchaser's receipt of the Services. Each
of the Parties reserves the right to make changes to its applications, systems
and processes, _provided_ , that in the event that such changes would
reasonably be expected to affect the delivery of the Services or the Business,
(i) the Party planning such change shall provide advance notice thereof to the
other Party as soon as is reasonably practicable but no later than 30 days
prior to the implementation of such change and (ii) if such changes would
reasonably be expected to materially impact the Business or delivery

  

  

  

  

    

  

of the Services, the Party planning such changes agrees to provide reasonable
accommodations to the other Party to address such impact and to consider in
good faith a mutually agreeable time to commence such change in order to
minimize the expected adverse effect on the other Party. The Seller shall
continue to make available to the Purchaser the performance, functionality and
Services set forth on _Schedule 1_ and at the service levels set forth on
_Schedule 2_ attached hereto in the event of any such changes; _provided_ ,
that the Purchaser acknowledges that if it makes any material changes to its
applications, systems or processes during the Term that are technologically
incompatible with the Seller's applications, systems or processes, such
material changes may impair performance or the delivery of the Services. For
the avoidance of doubt, no advance notice by the Seller to the Recipient will
be required in the event of any emergency need for a change in the Services
provided that the Services resume as soon as is practicable after the
emergency ceases to exist. The Parties further acknowledge and agree that the
Seller shall be under no obligation to create, purchase or otherwise acquire
any new software, hardware, operating systems, reporting or data outputs;
_provided_ , that to the extent any of the foregoing is required for provision
of the Services, the Seller shall not be relieved of its obligations to
provide such Services.

  

  

(e) Seller shall not be responsible for any failure to perform the Services to
the extent such failure is caused by: an act of war, hostility, or sabotage;
act of God, pandemic, electrical, internet, telecommunication outage or other
similar force majeure event outside of the reasonable control of the obligated
party (each a " _Force Majeure Event_ "). Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate the effect of any Force Majeure Event and
restore any interrupted Services as soon as possible thereafter. This section
does not excuse Seller's obligation to take reasonable steps to follow its
normal disaster recovery procedures.

  

  

(f) The Seller shall transfer to the Purchaser such historical data, current
data (including data generated in the provisioning of Services during the
Term), associated schema, data context and metadata and reports, in each case
as included in the Transferred Assets. Such data, associated schema, metadata
and reports shall be in the format the Seller presently generates for the
Business and, other than the reports specifically set forth in Section 1C
(Operations) of _Schedule 1_ or as reasonably necessary to extract and
transfer such data to the Purchaser, the Seller shall have no obligation to
collect, generate or provide to the Purchaser any new, updated or different
data packets or reporting. Without limiting the foregoing, the Seller shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to separate data for the Business. The
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that data separation may not be commercially
or technically feasible in all cases and that separation may result in more or
broader data being provided to the Purchaser than was intended for inclusion
in the Transferred Assets. The Purchaser shall be solely responsible for
formatting data for use in its own systems.

  

  

(g) The Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the
Purchaser during regular business hours at mutually convenient times in
respect of any "gap fit" analysis related to the future state data, processes,
technologies or otherwise in order to determine future or incremental
requirements of the Business.

  

  

  

  

    

  

Section 2.3 _Service Levels_. The Seller shall provide the Services at the
service levels set forth on _Schedule 2_ attached hereto, as applicable. A
breach of the service levels set forth on _Schedule 2_ shall be deemed a
breach of this Agreement but shall not in itself constitute evidence of any
loss, cost or damages of or to the Purchaser; _provided_ , that the foregoing
shall not be deemed to amend _Article XI_ or _Section 6_ of the Escrow
Agreement.

  

  

Section 2.4 _Modified Services and Additional Services_. Each Recipient may,
during the Term, (a) request to modify the terms and conditions relating to
the performance of a previously agreed-upon Service by an applicable Provider
in order to reflect, among other things, new findings after the Closing or new
procedures or processes for providing such Service (a " _Service Modification_
") or (b) request that the applicable Provider provide additional services to
the Recipient (an " _Additional Service_ "), and, in each case, such Recipient
shall deliver a written description of the proposed Service Modification or
Additional Service to the applicable Provider, and such Provider shall
reasonably consider all such requests in good faith. The Parties shall
negotiate in good faith reasonable terms on which such Service Modification or
Additional Service, as applicable, will be provided and the price thereof and
the Service Modification or Additional Service, as applicable, will be deemed
to form part of the Services and _Schedule __1_ shall be updated to reflect
such addition.

  

  

Section 2.5 _Maintenance and Shutdowns_. Each Provider may, during the Term,
suspend any Services it provides under this Agreement due to scheduled or
emergency repairs, maintenance and/or modification. Suspension due to
scheduled maintenance shall be included in the service level calculations to
the extent scheduled during Business Hours. Seller shall provide notice to
Purchaser reasonably in advance of regularly scheduled maintenance windows and
Seller shall reasonably consider in good faith any objections that Purchaser
may raise with respect to such scheduled maintenance window. To the extent
practicable, each Provider shall notify the applicable Recipient in advance of
any other Service suspension.

  

  

Section 2.6 _Data Backup; System Security_ _; Data Breaches_. Each Party will
maintain data backup and recovery procedures in connection with all of its
systems used in performing or receiving the Services that are no less
protective than the data backup and recovery procedures in effect prior to the
Closing Date. Each Party will maintain and enforce physical, technical and
logical security procedures with respect to the access and maintenance of any
Confidential Information or Personal Data of the other Party that is in such
Party's possession in performing or receiving the Services, which procedures
shall be no less protective of the Confidential Information or Personal Data
than the physical, technical and logical procedures in effect prior to the
Closing Date. Each Party will report to the other Party immediately any known
or reasonably suspected data loss, breaches of security or unauthorized access
to such other Party's relevant systems that it detects or becomes aware of
that affects the Confidential Information or Personal Data of the other Party,
immediately act to prevent or mitigate the effects of such incident; provide
the other Party with such logs, backups and other information as such other
Party may reasonably request; notify the other Party of the status of all
investigations of such incidents at reasonable intervals and upon such other
Party's

  

  

  

  

    

  

request; and identify steps to prevent re‑occurrence of the incident and
report them to the other Party, with the costs of investigation, response and
remedy to be borne by the Party responsible for the breach of security unless
such incident is directly attributable due to the action or inaction of the
other Party or a third party (such as a hacker), in which event the other
Party shall reimburse such costs. Each Party shall cooperate with and follow
the reasonable instructions of the other Party in investigating and responding
to any such breach related to Personal Data of a Party in the possession of
the other Party.

Intellectual Property rights that may be contained therein) (the " _Works_ "),
shall be owned by the Purchaser. The Seller acknowledges and agrees that, to

_Section 13.3(a)_ );

a waiver of any subsequent breach or failure of the same term or condition, or
a waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement. The failure of a

New York, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such Action and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any such Action in any such court or that any such
Action brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
Process in any such Action may be served on any Party anywhere in the world,

RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED (WHETHER BASED ON

BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
agreements, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon
such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to give effect to the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in a reasonably acceptable manner so that the transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as originally contemplated to the

applicable Recipient to take an action, such requirement shall be deemed an
undertaking by the applicable Party to cause it and its Subsidiaries, and to
