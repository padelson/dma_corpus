Each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept), in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, operated or leased by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary, in each case except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company; without limiting the foregoing but still subject to the foregoing exception, each respective Company Subsidiary is so qualified or licensed and in good standing in each jurisdiction listed in _Schedule 3.2_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. The Company has made available to Acquirors legal counsel true and complete copies of the currently effective Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws (or other comparable charter documents) of each Company Subsidiary, each as amended to date.

nonassessable. All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of
each Company Subsidiary are owned by the Company free and clear of all
Encumbrances (except for Permitted Encumbrances and restrictions on transfer
imposed by applicable securities laws) and are not subject to any preemptive
right or right of first refusal created by statute, the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws (or other comparable charter documents), as
applicable, of such Company Subsidiary or any Contract to which such Company
Subsidiary is a party or by which it is bound. There are no stock
appreciation rights, options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments,
conversion privileges or preemptive or other rights or agreements outstanding
to purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of a Company
Subsidiary or any securities or debt convertible into or exchangeable for
capital stock of a Company Subsidiary or obligating the Company or any

call, right, commitment, conversion privilege or preemptive or other right or
agreement. Other than the Company Subsidiaries or as otherwise set forth in

conjunction with the Merger. Each nonqualified deferred compensation plan to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party complies with the

ARTICLE 5 

  

Company Covenants

    

 During the time period from the Agreement Date until the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time or (b) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of _Article 9_ , the Company covenants and agrees with Acquiror as follows: 

      ##### 

  

   

 5.1 _Preparation of SEC Documents; Company Shareholders  Meeting._ 

    

 (a) _Proxy Statement_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the Agreement Date, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company without Acquirors prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) and without providing Acquiror the opportunity to review and comment thereon. The Company will advise Acquiror, promptly after it receives oral or written notice thereof or any applicable SEC comment period has expired, of the time when the Proxy Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, or any oral or written request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information and will promptly provide Acquiror with copies of any written communication from the SEC or any state securities commission. The Company will respond in good faith to any comments of the SEC and will cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its shareholders as soon as reasonably practicable after responding to all such comments to the satisfaction of the SEC. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information (including any Change of Recommendation) relating to the Company, or any of its Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Acquiror or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Applicable Law, disseminated to the Company Shareholders. 

   

 (b) _Company Shareholders  Meeting_. The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Agreement Date, take all action necessary in accordance with the Company Charter Documents, Applicable Law and the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market to duly give notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting. Subject to _Section 5.2(d)_, the Company will use all commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the Merger, and will take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of its shareholders required by the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market or Applicable Law to obtain such approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to its shareholders in advance of a vote on the approval of this Agreement and the Merger, or, if, as of the time for which the Company Shareholders Meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting. Provided that there has not been any Change of Recommendation by the Board of Directors of the Company, the Company shall ensure that the Company Shareholders Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited in connection with the Company Shareholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with the Company Charter Documents, Applicable Law and the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market. Without the prior written consent of Acquiror, approval of this Agreement is the only matter (other than procedural matters) which the Company shall propose to be acted on by the Company Shareholders at the Company Shareholders Meeting. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (c) _Board Recommendation_. Except to the extent expressly permitted by _Section 5.2(d)_ , (i) the Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend that its shareholders vote in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the Merger at the Company Shareholders Meeting, (ii) the Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously recommended that the Company Shareholders vote in favor of approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby at the Company Shareholders Meeting, and (iii) neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Acquiror, the recommendation of the Board of Directors that the shareholders of the Company vote in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the Merger. 

  

 5.2 _No Solicitation_. 

   

 (a) _Alternative Transaction_. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, and shall not authorize or permit any of its or its Subsidiaries officers, directors or employees or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries to, directly, or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate any inquiries with respect to, or the making, submission or announcement of, any Alternative Transaction Proposal; (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish to any Person any information with respect to, or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement any, Alternative Transaction Proposal (except to disclose the existence of this Agreement and the terms hereof or as specifically permitted by this _Section 5.2_); (iii) approve, endorse or recommend any Alternative Transaction (except to the extent specifically permitted by _Section 5.2(d)_), or (iv) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to any Alternative Transaction Proposal (except any confidentiality agreement contemplated by this  _Section 5.2)_. The Company and its Subsidiaries will immediately cease, and will cause its officers, directors and employees and instruct any investment banker, financial adviser, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by it to cease, any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Alternative Transaction Proposal, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to enforce (and will not waive any provisions of) any confidentiality or standstill agreement (or any similar agreement) to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party relating to any such Alternative Transaction Proposal. 

   

 (b) _Notification_. As promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours) after receipt of any Alternative Transaction Proposal or any request for nonpublic information or any inquiry relating in any way to any Alternative Transaction Proposal, the Company shall provide Acquiror with oral and written notice of the material terms and conditions of such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity of the Person or Group making any such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry and a copy of all written materials provided to it in connection with such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry.

Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry, and, without limitation of
the other provisions of this _Section 5.2_, shall promptly provide to
Acquiror a copy of all written materials (including written materials
provided by email or otherwise in electronic format) subsequently provided by
or to it in connection with such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or
inquiry. The Company shall provide Acquiror with 48 hours prior notice

 (i) Furnish nonpublic information to the Person or Group making such Alternative Transaction Proposal, provided that (A) prior to furnishing any such nonpublic information, it receives from such Person or Group an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms at least as restrictive as the terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, and (B) contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic information to such Person or Group, it furnishes such nonpublic information to Acquiror (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been previously so furnished to Acquiror); and 

  

 (ii) Engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person or Group with respect to such Alternative Transaction Proposal. 

   

 (d) _Changes of Recommendation_. Solely in response to the receipt of an unsolicited, bona fide written Alternative Transaction Proposal which its Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, is a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company may make a Change of Recommendation, if all of the following conditions in clauses (i) through (v) are met: 

  

 (i) the Superior Proposal has been made and has not been withdrawn and continues to be a Superior Proposal;

information delivered or made available to the Person or Group making the
Superior Proposal in connection with such Superior Proposal, and (C) during

Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal;

If the Company acquires knowledge of a material deterioration in the relationship with any key customer, key advertiser, key supplier or key employee, it shall promptly bring such information to Acquirors attention in writing and, if reasonably requested by Acquiror, shall exert reasonable commercial efforts to promptly restore the relationship.

fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company to its
directors and officers as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
"Company Indemnified Persons") pursuant to any indemnification provisions
under the Companys Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws as in effect on the
Agreement Date and pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the
Company and such Company Indemnified Persons existing as of the Agreement

arising out of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time.
In connection therewith Acquiror shall advance expenses to the
Company Indemnified Persons as incurred to the fullest extent provided for
under the Company Indemnification Provisions, provided the person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.
Any claims for indemnification made under this _Section 6.8(a)_ on or prior
to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time shall survive such anniversary
until the final resolution thereof. From and after the Effective

The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time for purposes of this _Section 6.8(b)_, which policies provide such directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of six years after the Effective Time, including with respect to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including with respect to acts or omissions occurring in connection with approval of this Agreement and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby), and nothing in  _Section 5.4_ shall prohibit the Company from obtaining such prepaid policies prior to the Effective Time, provided that the cost thereof shall not exceed 300% of the per annum premium rate paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Agreement Date for such policies. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, each of Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation shall, and Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force and effect for their duration.

or asset to any Person, then, in each case, Acquiror shall take such action
as may be necessary so that such Person shall assume all of the applicable
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.8_. 

   

 (d) _Enforceability_. The provisions of this _Section 6.8_ are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Person (it being expressly agreed that the Company Indemnified Persons to whom this _Section 6.8_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.8_) and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Acquiror under this _Section 6.8_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Company Indemnified Person under this _Section 6.8_ without the consent of such affected Company Indemnified Person. 

   

 (e) _Survival_. This _Section 6.8_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is intended to benefit each Company Indemnified Person, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and Acquiror, and shall be enforceable by the Company Indemnified Persons.

Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid. 

   

 (c) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue and pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, a check in the amount of U.S. dollars into which the Company Common Stock and Company Options represented by such Certificates were converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror or the Exchange Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance of such cash, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the former holders of Company Common Stock and Company Options for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Acquiror, upon demand, and any such holders of Company Common Stock and Company Options who have not theretofore complied with the provisions of this  _Section 7.2_ shall thereafter look only to Acquiror for the cash to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_, without any interest thereon. 

   

 (e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Securities_. All cash and Acquiror Options issued in accordance with the terms hereof with respect to Company Common Stock and Company Options shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock and Company Options, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of Company Common Stock and Company Options that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If after the Effective Time Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article 7_. 

   

 (f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.2_ , neither the Exchange Agent, Acquiror, the Company, the Surviving Corporation nor Merger Sub shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock or Company Options for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

 This VOTING AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into as of October 2, 2005, by and between Symantec Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Acquiror"), and the undersigned shareholder ("Shareholder") of BindView Development Corporation, a Texas corporation (the "Company").

Recitals 

   

 A. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder is a material inducement to the willingness of Acquiror to enter into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of October 2, 2005 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among Acquiror, Buena Vista Acquisition Corp., a Texas corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquiror ("Sub"), and the Company, pursuant to which Sub will merge with and into the Company (the "Merger"), and the Company will survive the Merger and become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquiror. 

  

 B. Shareholder understands and acknowledges that the Company and Acquiror are entitled to rely on (i) the truth and accuracy of Shareholders representations contained herein and (ii) Shareholders performance of the obligations set forth herein. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants and agreements set forth in the Merger Agreement and in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 

  

 1. _Restrictions on Shares_. Subject to the terms and conditions herein and in the Merger Agreement, 

  

 (a) Shareholder shall not, directly or indirectly, transfer (except as may be specifically required by court order or by operation of law), grant an option with respect to, sell, exchange, pledge or otherwise dispose of or encumber the Shares (as such term is defined in Section 4 below) or any New Shares (as such term is defined in Section 1(d) below), or make any offer or enter into any agreement providing for any of the foregoing, at any time prior to the Expiration Date;  _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained herein will be deemed to restrict the ability of Shareholder to (i) exercise, prior to the Expiration Date, any Company Options held by Shareholder or (ii) transfer or otherwise dispose of Shares to a charitable organization qualified under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, provided that such organization agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and, if requested by Acquiror, to execute a Proxy (as hereinafter defined). As used herein, the term "Expiration Date" shall mean the earlier of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the date and time of the valid termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Expiration Date, Shareholder shall not, directly or indirectly, grant any proxies or powers of attorney with respect to any of the Shares, deposit any of the Shares into a voting trust, or enter into a voting agreement (other than this Agreement) or similar arrangement or commitment with respect to any of the Shares. 

  

 (c) Shareholder shall not, directly or indirectly, take any action (other than any action of Shareholder, in such Shareholders capacity as a director of the Company, in the exercise of such Shareholders fiduciary duties with respect to an Alternative Transaction Proposal or Superior Proposal in compliance with the terms of the Merger Agreement) that would make any representation or 

   ##### 

  

    

warranty contained herein untrue or incorrect or have the effect of impairing
the ability of Shareholder to perform its obligations under this Agreement or
preventing or delaying the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated hereby. 

  

 (d) Any shares of Company Common Stock or other securities of the Company that Shareholder purchases or with respect to which Shareholder otherwise acquires voting rights after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Expiration Date, including pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants to purchase Shares (collectively, the "New Shares"), shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement to the same extent as if they constituted Shares. 

  

 2. _Agreement to Vote Shares_. Prior to the Expiration Date, at every meeting of the shareholders of the Company called with respect to any of the following matters, and at every adjournment or postponement thereof, and on every action or approval by written consent or resolution of the shareholders of the Company with respect to any of the following matters, Shareholder shall vote, to the extent not voted by the person(s) appointed under the Proxy (as defined in Section 3 below), the Shares and any New Shares in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement and any matter that could reasonably be expected to facilitate the Merger, and against any Alternative Transaction Proposal (as such term is defined in Article I of the Merger Agreement) and any other matter that might reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or adversely affect the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. 

  

 3. _Irrevocable Proxy_. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Shareholder shall deliver to Acquiror a duly executed proxy in the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit A_ (the "Proxy"), which proxy is coupled with an interest, and, until the Expiration Date, shall be irrevocable to the fullest extent permitted by law, with respect to each and every meeting of shareholders of the Company or action or approval by written resolution or consent of shareholders of the Company with respect to the matters contemplated by Section 2 covering the total number of Shares and New Shares in respect of which Shareholder is entitled to vote at any such meeting or in connection with any such written consent. Upon the execution of this Agreement by Shareholder, (i) Shareholder hereby revokes any and all prior proxies (other than the Proxy) given by Shareholder with respect to the subject matter contemplated by Section 2, and (ii) Shareholder shall not grant any subsequent proxies with respect to such subject matter, or enter into any agreement or understanding with any Person to vote or give instructions with respect to the Shares and New Shares in any manner inconsistent with the terms of Section 2, until after the Expiration Date. 

  

 4. _Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Shareholder_. Shareholder hereby represents, warrants and covenants to Acquiror as follows: 

  

 (a) Shareholder is the beneficial or record owner of, or exercises voting power over, that number of shares of Company Common Stock set forth on the signature page hereto (all such shares owned beneficially or of record by Shareholder, or over which Shareholder exercises voting power, on the date hereof, collectively, the "Shares"). The Shares constitute Shareholders entire interest in the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, other than as set forth in the Merger Agreement, and Shareholder does not hold any other outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company. No person not a signatory to this Agreement has a beneficial interest in or a right to acquire or vote any of the Shares (other than, (i) if Shareholder is a partnership, the rights and interest of persons and entities that own partnership interests in Shareholder under the partnership agreement governing Shareholder and applicable partnership law or (ii) if Shareholder is a married individual and resides in a State with community property laws, the community property interest of his or her spouse to the extent applicable under such community property laws). The Shares are and will be at all times up until the Expiration Date free and clear of any security interests, liens, claims, pledges, options, rights of first refusal, co-sale 

   ##### 

  

    

rights, agreements, limitations on Shareholders voting rights, charges and
other encumbrances of any nature that would adversely affect the Merger or
the exercise or fulfillment of the rights and obligations of the Company
under the Merger Agreement or of the parties to this Agreement. Shareholders
principal residence or place of business is set forth on the signature page
hereto. 

  

 (b) Shareholder has all requisite power, capacity and authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder and the consummation by Shareholder of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary action, if any, on the part of Shareholder. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Shareholder and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by Acquiror, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Shareholder, enforceable against Shareholder in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors rights and remedies generally and to general principles of equity. 

  

 (c) The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the provisions hereof will not, conflict with, result in a breach or violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) under, or require notice to or the consent of any person under, any agreement, law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree by which Shareholder is bound, except for such conflicts, breaches, violations or defaults that would not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or delay consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and this Agreement or otherwise prevent or delay Shareholder from performing his, her or its obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 (d) Until the Expiration Date, Shareholder, in his, her or its capacity as a shareholder of the Company, shall not, and shall not authorize, encourage or permit any person or entity on Shareholders behalf to, directly or indirectly, take any action that would, or could reasonably be expected to, result in the violation by the Company of Section 5.2 of the Merger Agreement; provided that if the Shareholder is a director of the Company or has employees who are directors of the Company, nothing herein shall prevent the Shareholder (or such employees) from taking any action solely in such Shareholders (or employees) capacity as a director of the Company in the exercise of such directors fiduciary duties with respect to an Alternative Transaction Proposal or Superior Proposal in compliance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. 

  

 5. _Consent and Waiver; Termination of Existing Agreements_. Shareholder hereby gives any consents or waivers that are reasonably required for the consummation of the Merger under the terms of any agreement or instrument to which Shareholder is a party or subject or in respect of any rights Shareholder may have in connection with the Merger or the other transactions provided for in the Merger Agreement (whether such rights exist under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, any Contract to which the Company is a party or by which it is, or any of its assets are, bound under statutory or common law or otherwise). Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, Shareholder hereby waives any and all rights to contest or object to the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, the Company Board of Directors actions in approving and recommending the Merger, the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions provided for in the Merger Agreement, or to seek damages or other legal or equitable relief in connection therewith. From and after the Effective Time, Shareholders right to receive cash on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement shall constitute Shareholders sole and exclusive right against the Company and/or Acquiror in respect of Shareholders ownership of the Shares or status as a shareholder of the Company or any agreement or instrument with the Company pertaining to the Shares or Shareholders status as a shareholder of the Company. 

   ##### 

  

  

 6. _Confidentiality_. Shareholder shall hold any information regarding this Agreement and the Merger in strict confidence and shall not divulge any such information to any third person until the Acquiror has publicly disclosed the Merger. 

  

 7. _Appraisal Rights_. Shareholder agrees not to exercise any rights of appraisal or any dissenters rights that Shareholder may have (whether under applicable law or otherwise) or could potentially have or acquire in connection with the Merger. 

  

 8. _Miscellaneous_. 

  

 (a) _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given on (i) the date of delivery, if delivered personally or by commercial delivery service, or (ii) on the date of confirmation of receipt (or the next Business Day, if the date of confirmation of receipt is not a Business Day), if sent via facsimile (with confirmation of receipt), to the parties hereto at the following address (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice):

 (b) _Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief_. The parties hereto acknowledge that Acquiror will be irreparably harmed and that there will be no adequate remedy at law for a violation of any of the covenants or agreements of Shareholder set forth herein or in the Proxy. Therefore, it is agreed that, in addition to any other remedies that may be available to Acquiror upon any such violation of this Agreement or the Proxy, Acquiror shall have the right to enforce such covenants and agreements and the Proxy by specific performance, injunctive relief or by any other means available to Acquiror at law or in equity and Shareholder hereby waives any and all defenses which could exist in its favor in connection with such enforcement and waives any requirement for the security or posting of any bond in connection with such enforcement. 

  

 (c) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties hereto; it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) _Entire Agreement; Nonassignability; Parties in Interest_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto (including, without limitation, the Proxy) (i) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and (ii) are not intended to confer, and shall not be construed as conferring, upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests, or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by Shareholder without the prior written consent of Acquiror, and any such assignment or delegation that is not consented to shall be null and void. This Agreement, together with any rights, interests or obligations of Acquiror hereunder, may be assigned or delegated in whole or in part by Acquiror to any affiliate of Acquiror without the consent of or any action by Shareholder upon notice by Acquiror to Shareholder as herein provided. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns (including, without limitation, any person to whom any Shares are sold, transferred or assigned). 

  

 (e) _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties hereto further agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision. 

  

 (f) _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. 

  

 (g) _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas without reference to such states principles of conflicts of law. 

  

 (h) _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document shall be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. 

  

 (i) _Additional Documents, Etc._ Shareholder shall execute and deliver any additional documents necessary or desirable, in the reasonable opinion of Acquiror, to carry out the purpose and intent of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing or any other obligation of Shareholder hereunder, Shareholder hereby authorizes Acquiror to deliver a copy of this Agreement to the Company and hereby agrees that each of the Company and Acquiror may rely upon such delivery as conclusively evidencing the consents, waivers and terminations of Shareholder referred to in Section 5, in each case for purposes of all agreements and instruments to which such elections, consents, waivers and/or terminations are applicable or relevant. 

  

 (j) _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate and shall have no further force or effect from and after the Expiration Date and thereafter there shall be no liability or obligation on the part 

   ##### 

  

    

of the Shareholder, _provided_ , that no such termination shall relieve any
party from liability for any breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination. 

  

 (k) _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
