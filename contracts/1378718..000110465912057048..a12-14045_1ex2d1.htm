ARTICLE 2. 
PURCHASE AND SALE OF ASSETS

 



 

Section 2.1 _Transfer of Purchased Assets_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained herein, at the
Closing, Seller will (x) sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver to Parent,
and Parent will purchase from Seller, free and clear of any Encumbrances, all
of the Purchased Shares (with respect to the Interfast Europe Shares, with
Full Title Guarantee) and (y) sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver to
Buyer, and Buyer will purchase from Seller, free and clear of any Encumbrances
other than Permitted Encumbrances, all of Sellers Assets (other than the
Purchased Shares), including all of Sellers right, title and interest in all
Assets constituting, or used or useful in connection with, or related to, the
Business, except for the Excluded Assets (the

 



       
 

 



 

Assets described in clauses (x) and (y), collectively, the " _Purchased
Assets_ "), including all of the following Assets of Seller:

 



 

(i) accounts and notes receivable (whether current or noncurrent), including
all amounts due to Seller from the Acquired Entities, and all refunds,
deposits, prepayments or prepaid expenses, including any prepaid insurance
premiums;

 



 

(ii) Contracts relating or pertaining to the Business or the Purchased Assets;

 



 

(iii) Inventory;

 



 

(iv) Real Property Leases;

 



 

(v) Improvements;

 



 

(vi) Machinery and Equipment;

 



 

(vii) original Books and Records of Seller and each Acquired Entity, other
than original Tax-related records and receipts of Seller which relate to Pre-
Closing Tax Periods and other than original records that Seller is required by
law to retain in its possession;

 



 

(viii) Purchased Intellectual Property;

 



 

(ix) Permits (to the extent transferable);

 



 

(x) computer hardware and other hardware (including servers, routers,
desktops, laptops, peripherals and mobile computing devices);

 



 

(xi) all non-disclosure, non-competition, non-solicitation and assignment of
inventions agreements entered into with all Personnel of Seller;

 



 

(xii) all personnel and employment records relating to Transferred Employees
and Continuing Employees;

 



 

(xiii) prepayments (including security deposits) of Seller relating or
pertaining to the Business or the Purchased Assets, excluding prepaid Taxes;

 



 

(xiv) rights under or pursuant to all warranties, representations, guarantees,
and indemnities made by, and other rebate or credit obligations of, third
parties in favour of Seller relating or pertaining to the Business, the
Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities;

 



 

(xv) claims, causes of action, choses in action, rights of recovery and rights
of set-off of any kind in favour of Seller relating to the Purchased Assets or
the Assumed Liabilities against any Person (including any liens, security
interests, pledges or

 



      
 

 



 

other rights to payment or to enforce payment in connection with products
delivered by Seller on or prior to the Closing Date); and

 



 

(xvi) all goodwill of Seller pertaining to the Business and the Purchased
Assets.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Purchased Asset (or transfer
pursuant to a change of control or otherwise any Asset of any Acquired Entity)
or any right thereunder (in each case, a " _Non-Assignable Right_ ") if an
attempted assignment or transfer, without the consent of, or other action by,
any third party or Governmental Authority, would constitute a breach or other
contravention thereof or of any Law or Default thereunder. If any such consent
to assignment or transfer, or other action, as applicable, under any Contract
to which Seller or any Acquired Entity is a party, is not obtained prior to
Closing (or is obtained subject to a condition that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the rights of Parent, Buyer or their respective
Affiliates thereunder), Seller will (i) cooperate to promptly apply for and
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consent or other action, on
terms reasonably satisfactory to Parent, and (ii) prior to obtaining such
consent or other action, cooperate with Parent and Buyer in any reasonable
arrangement to provide Parent and Buyer with the benefits of, and be
responsible for the obligations under, the relevant Non-Assignable Right or
other Contract in accordance with this Agreement to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law (including, if requested by Parent, holding any
such Non-Assignable Right in trust for Parent and Buyer or acting as agent for
Parent and Buyer), provided that in each case Parent shall be entitled to
direct Seller to use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce, at the cost,
and for the account, of Parent and Buyer, any and all rights of Seller against
the other party thereto arising out of the breach or cancellation thereof by
such other party or otherwise.

 



 

(c) Seller will promptly pay over to Parent and Buyer, as applicable, all
moneys collected by or paid to Seller after the Closing Date in respect of (i)
all Contracts, accounts receivable and other items included in or arising from
the Purchased Assets, and payments under letters of credit for the benefit of
Seller with respect thereto, and (ii) all payments in respect of Non-
Assignable Rights (subject to the terms and conditions of any arrangements
among the parties pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_).

 



 

Section 2.2 _Assumption of Liabilities_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions contained herein, at the Closing, Parent and/or Buyer shall assume
and agree to discharge the following, and only the following, Liabilities of
Seller and the Acquired Entities, as applicable (the " _Assumed Liabilities_
"):

 



 

(a) Liabilities and obligations relating to the Purchased Assets and the
Acquired Entities that accrue, or arise out of or relate to events or
occurrences that occur, after the Closing Date, but excluding (i) any
Liability for any Default under any Contract to which any Interfast Entity is
a party that occurs on or prior to the Closing Date, (ii) any Excluded Taxes
and (iii) any Taxes for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 6.6(a)_;

 



      
 

 



 

(b) accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current Liabilities of the
Interfast Entities reflected in the Final Closing Balance Sheet, which, for
the avoidance of doubt, shall not include any Excluded Taxes or any Taxes for
which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification pursuant
to _Section 6.6(a)_;

 



 

(c) any Liability to customers of the Business under written warranties made
by Seller or any Acquired Entity, but solely to the extent that such Liability
is covered under a valid manufacturer warranty for which Parent or Buyer is
entitled to seek reimbursement from the applicable manufacturer; and

 



 

(d) Liabilities described in _Section 6.7(b)_ and _Section 6.7(g)_ of this
Agreement, subject to the terms thereof, all Liabilities relating to or
arising from any Acquired Plan in respect of periods subsequent to the Closing
Date, and all Liabilities for accrued vacation benefits of Continuing
Employees.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Excluded Liabilities_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, except for the Assumed Liabilities expressly specified in
_Section 2.2_ and subject to _Section 6.7_ and _Section 8.2(m)_, neither
Parent nor Buyer shall assume, or otherwise be responsible for, any
Liabilities of Seller, any Excluded Entity or any of their respective
Affiliates (other than Liabilities of the Acquired Entities by virtue of the
acquisition by Parent or Buyer of the Equity Interests thereof, but subject to
the next proceeding sentence), whether accruing, or arising out of or relating
to events or occurrences that occur, on, prior to or (except as may be limited
by the following sentence) after the Closing Date (the " _Excluded
Liabilities_ "). Excluded Liabilities shall also include all Liabilities of
the Acquired Entities, other than Assumed Liabilities, accruing, arising out
of or relating to events or occurrences that occur on or prior to the Closing
Date, and shall further include all Liabilities (other than Assumed
Liabilities or as otherwise expressly set forth below):

 



 

(a) with respect to any Indebtedness or other Liability of any Interfast
Entity, including Indebtedness or other Liability of any Acquired Entity owed
to Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Entities);

 



 

(b) for or in respect of Excluded Taxes;

 



 

(c) for Transaction Related Expenses;

 



 

(d) under any Bulk Sales Laws;

 



 

(e) under the Woollings Note;

 



 

(f) of Seller, any Excluded Entity or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives that specifically arise under this Agreement, any Ancillary
Agreement to which Seller or such Excluded Entity, Affiliate or Representative
is a party, or otherwise in connection with the Closing or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

 



 

(g) related to or arising from any Excluded Asset, except as contemplated in
_Section 6.7_ and _Section 8.2(m)_;

 



      
 

 



 

(h) arising from any injury to or death of any Person or damage to or
destruction of any property, whether based on negligence, breach of warranty,
strict liability, enterprise liability or any other legal or equitable theory,
arising from or related to events which occurred or conditions in existence on
or prior to the Closing Date;

 



 

(i) accruing, arising out of or relating to events or occurrences that occur
on or prior to the Closing Date, other than Assumed Liabilities or as
contemplated in _Section 6.7_ or _Section 8.2(m)_;

 



 

(j) that arise out of or relate to services performed by, or goods sold by, or
actions or omissions of, Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Entities) on or prior to the Closing Date, even though a claim may be
made or filed after the Closing Date, including the amount of any warranty
claim in excess of amounts covered under a valid manufacturer warranty, other
than Assumed Liabilities;

 



 

(k) the obligations of Interfast Asia under the JV Agreement;

 



 

(l) the obligations of Seller under the Cooperation Agreement;

 



 

(m) arising out of or resulting from compliance or noncompliance by Seller or
any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities) on or prior to the
Closing Date with any Law (including any Environmental Law);

 



 

(n) arising out of the Handling of Substances by Seller or any of its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities) on or prior to the Closing Date;

 



 

(o) subject to _Section 6.7_, in respect of, or arising out of or in
connection with the employment or cessation of employment with Seller or, for
periods prior to the Closing Date, any Acquired Entity, of any employees or
former employees (or the failure to hire or engage any prospective employee or
other service provider), including (i) any Liability under any employment or
consulting agreement, whether or not written, between any Interfast Entity and
any Person, except as provided in _Section 6.7(b)_; (ii) any Liability under,
relating to or arising from any Employee Plan other than Liabilities under
Acquired Plans that are incurred solely with respect to any period after
Closing; (iii) all employment-related claims, or any claim of an unfair labour
practice or grievance or any claim under any unemployment compensation,
employment standards, pay equity or workers compensation law or regulation or
under any federal, provincial, state, or foreign employment discrimination or
human rights law or regulation, which shall have been asserted on or prior to
the Closing Date or is based on acts, omissions, events or services which
occurred on or prior to the Closing Date, whether or not the affected
employees are hired by Buyer; (iv) any Liability relating to payroll, salary,
bonuses, commissions, health benefits, sick pay or any other compensation for
any current or former employee, director, officer, consultant or independent
contractor of Seller or any Acquired Entity (except with respect to
Liabilities for any period after the Closing); (v) with respect to any actual
or alleged pre-Closing agreements or promises by Seller to current or former
employees, directors, officers, consultants or independent contractors
regarding compensation or benefits (including in respect of periods on or
prior to the Closing Date), including stock options, equity or equity-based
compensation plans, programs or arrangements maintained by Seller; (vi) all
severance

 



      
 

 



 

payments, damages for wrongful or unfair dismissal and all related costs in
respect of the termination by Seller or, prior to Closing, any Acquired Entity
of the employment of any employee of Seller or any Acquired Entity; (vii) all
Liabilities for claims for injury, disability, death or workers compensation
arising from or related to employment with Seller or any Acquired Entity on or
prior to the Closing Date; (viii) any Liability with respect to the Phantom

any of the foregoing (the Liabilities described in this _Section 2.3(o)_,
which, subject to _Section 6.7_, include, for the avoidance of doubt, all
such Liabilities of the Acquired Entities arising on or prior to the Closing,
are referred to as " _Seller Employment Liabilities_ ");

 



 

(p) with respect to any actual or alleged agreement or promises (such as
volume guarantees) to vendors or suppliers, other than with respect to
Material Contracts set forth on _Section 4.10(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule;

 



 

(q) under that certain Technology Partnership Canada Agreement, dated December
21, 2004, by and between Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, as
represented by the Minister of Industry, and Seller, as amended from time to
time;

 



 

(r) under that certain Credit Agreement between Seller and Comerica Bank,
dated as of August 5, 2009, as amended from time to time;

 



 

(s) with respect to any Excluded Entity, including Liabilities accruing,
arising out of or relating to any act or omission by, or on behalf of, any
Interfast Entity or any of its Affiliates or Representatives with respect to
the JV Entity, Interfast Asia or any other Excluded Entity or their respective
Assets, businesses or Liabilities; and

 



 

(t) described on _Section 2.3(t)_ of the Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Purchase Price_.

 



 

(a) No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall prepare (in consultation and cooperation with Parent) and deliver to
Parent a written statement, certified by the chief financial officer of Seller
and prepared in good faith, setting forth in reasonable detail Sellers good
faith estimates (including work sheets and other reasonable supporting
documentation showing the calculation of such estimates, all in a form similar
to that which was delivered to Parent prior to the date hereof) of (i) the
consolidated balance sheet of Seller as of the Closing Date (the " _Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and (ii) the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount
as of the Closing Date, which may be positive or negative (the " _Estimated
Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that in
the event that Parent notifies Seller prior to the Closing Date that it
disputes Sellers estimate of the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount or any
component thereof, then Parent and Seller shall cooperate in good faith to
resolve any such dispute as promptly as practicable, and modify the Estimated
Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount and its component calculations as
appropriate to reflect any agreed adjustments thereto (it being understood
that any such dispute and cooperation to resolve any such dispute shall not,
unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, result in any extension of
the Closing Date). The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Net
Working Capital Adjustment Amount shall be prepared in accordance with

 



      
 

 



 

 _Exhibit C_. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount as calculated pursuant to this _Section 2.4(a)_ is
negative, the Cash Purchase Price will be reduced by such difference, and if
it is positive, the Cash Purchase Price will be increased by such difference.

 



 

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
Parent and Buyer agree to pay Seller an aggregate amount equal to $134,000,000
(the " _Cash Purchase Price_ "). The Cash Purchase Price (excluding any
adjustment pursuant to _Section 2.5_) shall be paid at Closing and delivered
by or on behalf of Parent and Buyer as follows:

 



 

(i) an amount in cash equal to (A) the Cash Purchase Price _plus_ (B) the
Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount _minus_ (C) the Escrow Amount,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Seller prior to the Closing Date; and

 



 

(ii) an amount in cash equal to (A) $1,000,000 (the " _Working Capital
Adjustment Escrow Amount_ ") _plus_ (B) $13,400,000 (the " _Indemnification
Escrow Amount_ " and together with the Working Capital Adjustment Escrow
Amount, the " _Escrow Amount_ ") by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to one or more accounts designated by an escrow agent mutually agreed
upon by Parent and Seller (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") prior to the Closing Date,
to be held in escrow in two separate accounts (the " _Escrow Accounts_ ") in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and an escrow
agreement among Parent, Buyer, Seller and the Escrow Agent in substantially in
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). The
Escrow Amount shall be released from escrow and paid in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.5 _Final Net Working Capital Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) _Final Closing Statement_. Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date,
Parent will prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to Seller, a closing
statement (the " _Final Closing Statement_ ") consisting of (i) an unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of Seller as of the Closing Date (the " _Final
Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and (ii) a written notice setting forth Parent and
Buyers calculation of the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount (the " _Final
Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount_ "). The Final Closing Balance Sheet and
the Final Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount shall be prepared in
accordance with _Exhibit C_ hereto.

 



 

(b) _Adjustment Amount_. The " _Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be positive or
negative, shall be equal to (x) the Final Net Working Capital Adjustment
Amount _minus_ (y) the Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount.

 



 

(i) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then (A) Parent and Buyer
shall promptly pay, or cause to be paid, to Seller an amount equal to the
Adjustment Amount and (B) Parent and Seller shall promptly issue joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to pay the Working
Capital Adjustment Escrow Amount, and any proceeds, income and reinvestments
thereon (collectively, net of any amounts released from the Escrow Account
established to hold

 



      
 

 



 

the Working Capital Adjustment Escrow Amount, the " _Working Capital
Adjustment Escrow Funds_ ") to an account designated by Seller.

 



 

(ii) If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then Parent and Seller
shall promptly issue joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause
the Escrow Agent to pay from the Working Capital Adjustment Escrow Funds to an
account designated by Parent an amount equal to the absolute value of the
Adjustment Amount. If the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount is greater
than the Working Capital Adjustment Escrow Funds (the amount of such excess,
the " _Excess Working Capital Adjustment Amount_ "), then Parent shall have
the option, in its sole discretion, to (A) require, pursuant to a written
notice delivered to the Escrow Agent and Seller, that the Excess Working
Capital Adjustment Amount be released and paid, subject to the terms and
conditions of the Escrow Agreement, by the Escrow Agent from the
Indemnification Escrow Amount __ and any proceeds, income and reinvestments
thereon (collectively, net of any amounts released from the Escrow Account
established to hold the Indemnification Escrow Amount, the " _Indemnification
Escrow Funds_ ") (in which case any payment so made shall reduce the
Indemnification Escrow Funds by a corresponding amount) or (B) require,
pursuant to written notice delivered to Seller, that Seller promptly pay to an
account designated by Parent the Excess Working Capital Adjustment Amount. If
the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount is less than the Working Capital
Adjustment Escrow Funds, then Parent and Seller shall promptly issue joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to pay the
remainder of the Working Capital Adjustment Escrow Funds to an account
designated by Seller.

 



 

(c) _Disputed Adjustment Amount_. Seller shall have fifteen (15) days from the
date that Parent delivers the Final Closing Statement (the " _Closing Dispute
Period_ ") to notify Parent, in writing, as to whether Seller disagrees with
the calculations set forth in the Final Closing Statement (such notice, a "
_Closing Dispute Notice_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that a Closing Dispute
Notice may only include objections based on (i) the failure of the Final
Closing Statement to comply with _Exhibit C_ hereto and/or (ii) mathematical
errors in the computations in the Final Closing Statement. During the Closing
Dispute Period, Seller and its accountants shall be permitted to review
(during regular business hours and upon reasonable prior notice) the working
papers of Parent and Buyer and (where applicable and subject to Seller and its
accountants entering into any undertakings required by Parent or Buyers
accountants) Parents and Buyers accountants relating to the matters set
forth in the Final Closing Statement. If Seller fails to deliver a Closing
Dispute Notice in accordance with this Agreement during the applicable Closing
Dispute Period, then (A) the Closing Date Balance Sheet as delivered by Parent
shall be deemed to have been correctly prepared, and (B) Parents calculation
of the items set forth in the Final Closing Statement shall be deemed to be
final and correct and shall be binding upon all of the parties hereto. Any
matter not specifically referenced in the Closing Dispute Notice shall be
conclusively deemed to have been agreed upon by the parties.

 



 

(d) Resolution of Disputed Adjustment Amount.

 



 

(i) Parent and Seller shall use their reasonable best efforts for a period of
thirty (30) calendar days after Sellers delivery of a Closing Dispute Notice
(or such longer period as Parent and Seller shall mutually agree upon) to
resolve any

 



      
 

 



 

disagreements raised by Seller in such Closing Dispute Notice. If, at the end
of such period, Parent and Seller are unable to resolve such disagreements,
the parties shall jointly select RSM Richter Chamberland (Toronto office) or,
if it is unable or unwilling to serve, another independent accounting firm of
recognized international standing (the " _Arbitrator_ ") for review and
resolution of all matters (but only such matters) which remain in dispute and
which were properly included in the Closing Dispute Notice. The parties shall
instruct the Arbitrator to, and the Arbitrator shall, make a final
determination of the items included in the Closing Dispute Notice (to the
extent such amounts are in dispute) in accordance with the guidelines and
procedures set forth in this Agreement. The parties shall instruct the
Arbitrator to not, and the Arbitrator shall not, assign a value to any item in
dispute greater than the greatest value for such item assigned by Parent, on
the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, or less than the smallest value
for such item assigned by Parent, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other

The determination by the Arbitrator shall be final, binding and conclusive on
all parties. Parent and Seller shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause the Arbitrator to make its determination within thirty (30) calendar
days of accepting its selection. Within five (5) Business Days after the date

Research Corporation or such other independent accounting or valuation firm
selected by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to Seller (the " _Valuation
Firm_ "), to determine an allocation in accordance with applicable standards
(the " _Allocation_ ") of the Cash Purchase Price, together with the Assumed
Liabilities treated as purchase price for Tax purposes (collectively, the "
_Allocated Purchase Price_ "), among the Purchased Assets (including all of
the Equity Interests of Interfast USA Holdings and Interfast Europe) and the
Non-Compete Agreements in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder (and any comparable provisions of state, local
and any non-U.S. Tax Law). Parent and Seller shall each have an opportunity to
provide comments, in good faith, to the Valuation Firm as to an appropriate
Allocation, provided that the determination of the Allocation by the Valuation
Firm shall be final and binding on the parties. The Parent shall instruct the
Valuation Firm to prepare and deliver a draft of the Allocation to Parent and
Seller for comment as soon as practicable after the date hereof and to prepare
and deliver to Parent and

 



      
 

 



 

Seller the final Allocation within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date (or

Buyer shall prepare and file their Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the
Allocation, as adjusted by Parent, acting reasonably, and delivered to Seller
for any adjustments to the Allocated Purchase Price under this Agreement (the
" _Revised Allocation_ "). Seller, Parent and Buyer agree that they will not
take, or cause or permit to be taken, any position on any Tax Return that
would be inconsistent with, prejudice or otherwise adversely affect the
Revised Allocation, without the prior written consent of the other parties;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained herein shall prevent any party
or its Affiliates from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any
Governmental Authority based upon or arising out of the Revised Allocation,
and no party hereto or its Affiliates shall be required to litigate before any
court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Authority
challenging such Revised Allocation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, the provisions of this _Section 2.6_ shall survive the
Closing.

 



 

Section 2.7 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, Parent and Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
cash otherwise deliverable under this Agreement, and from any other
consideration otherwise paid or delivered to any Person in connection with the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement, including in respect of amounts,
if any, allocable to the Non-Compete Agreements, to any Person such amounts
that Parent or Buyer is required to deduct and withhold with respect to any
such deliveries and payments under the Code or any provision of federal,
state, provincial, local, or non-U.S. Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by Parent or Buyer, Parent or Buyer shall disburse such withheld
amounts to the applicable Governmental Authority and such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

Section 2.8 _Acquisition by Buyer_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the parties acknowledge that Parent and Buyer intend that (a)
Parent or Buyer, as applicable, will acquire the Purchased Assets and Assumed
Liabilities directly or (b) Parent and/or Buyer may assign its rights
hereunder prior to the Closing in accordance with _Section 9.8_ to one or
more wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent or Buyer, whether existing on the
date hereof or formed prior to the Closing, and to cause such Subsidiaries to

Assumed Liabilities; _provided_ , that in the event of any assignment under
this clause (b), Parent agrees that it shall be responsible for the

in material breach or violation of, or Default under, any of the Material
Contracts and no Interfast Entity has received any written notice, or to the

Section 4.11 _Machinery and Equipment and Other Property_.

 



 

(a) Seller and the Acquired Entities, individually or collectively, own and
have legal and beneficial ownership of all items of machinery, equipment,
tools, spare parts, furniture, vehicles and other fixed Assets used in the
Business or otherwise reflected as owned directly or indirectly by Seller on
the Interim Financial Statements (the " _Machinery and_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Equipment_ "), in each case free and clear of any Encumbrances other than
Permitted Encumbrances and, as of the date hereof, any Encumbrances set forth
on _Section 4.11(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule. The Machinery and Equipment,
taken as a whole, are in reasonable operating condition and repair (subject to
normal wear and tear) and are suitable for the purposes for which they are
presently or have historically been used. Seller or the Acquired Entities,
individually or collectively, own, or, in the case of leases and licenses,
have valid and subsisting leasehold interests or licenses in, all of the
Assets and properties that are material to the Business (whether real or
personal, tangible or intangible but excluding Purchased Intellectual
Property, which is covered in _Section 4.13_), in each case free and clear of
any Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances and, as of the date hereof,
any Encumbrances set forth on _Section 4.11(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(b) _Section 4.11(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule contains a list of all (i)
motor vehicles owned by each Interfast Entity and (ii) other tangible

Section 4.12 _Real Property_.

 



 

(a) No Interfast Entity is an owner of any interest in real property. _Section
4.12(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule describes and lists the name of the record
owner of all real property leased or licensed for use by any Interfast Entity
(the " _Leased Real Property_ "). The Interfast Entities have good and
marketable title or leasehold interest in, and enjoy peaceful and undisturbed
possession of, all Leased Real Property, in each case free and clear of all
Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances and, as of the date hereof, any
Encumbrances set forth on _Section 4.11(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule. To
the Knowledge of Seller, there are no leases, subleases, licenses, occupancy
agreements, options, rights, concessions or other agreements or arrangements,
written or oral, granting to any Person the right to purchase, or the
exclusive right to use or occupy, any of the Leased Real Property. The
Interfast Entity party to each Real Property Lease is in good standing under
such Real Property Lease. With respect to each such lease, to the Knowledge of
Seller, there exists no event of Default or event, occurrence, condition or
act which, with the giving of notice, the lapse of time or the happening of
any other event or condition, would become a Default under such Real Property
Lease or which would adversely affect the current use of any Leased Real
Property. The Leased Real Property is all of the real property used in the
Business as currently conducted.

 



 

(b) All Improvements owned, leased, or used by the Interfast Entities on the
Leased Real Property are, and each of the Leased Real Properties is, in
reasonable condition and repair (normal wear and tear excepted), and, with
respect to such Improvements, such Improvements are free from material
structural defects. To the Knowledge of Seller, no such Improvement, or the
operation or maintenance thereof, violates any restrictive covenant, or
encroaches on any property owned or leased by any other Person, which would
materially impair the continued use of such Leased Real Property by any
Interfast Entity for the use currently being made thereof. All of such
Improvements were constructed in accordance with all applicable Laws and the
Interfast Entities have adequate rights of ingress and egress into the Leased
Real Property used in the operation of the Business.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) No Interfast Entity has received written notice of any special assessment
relating to any Leased Real Property or any portion thereof, and to the
Knowledge of Seller, no such special assessment is pending or threatened.
There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened condemnation
or expropriation proceedings with respect to any of the Leased Real Property.
To the Knowledge of Seller, there are no outstanding work orders from, or
required by, any municipality, police department, fire department, sanitation,
health or safety authorities or from any other Person relating to the Leased
Real Property, and there are no matters under discussion with or by any
Interfast Entity relating to any work orders.

 



 

(d) Prior to the date hereof, Seller has delivered to Parent true and correct
copies of all Real Property Leases, and all title reports, title policies and
surveys currently in the possession of any Interfast Entity with respect to
the Leased Real Property.

 



 

Section 4.13 _Intellectual Property Rights_.

 



 

(a) _Section 4.13(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule lists each Patent,
registered Copyright, registered Trademark and each application to register
any of the foregoing, that is included in Purchased Intellectual Property
(collectively, the " _Registered Intellectual Property_ "), including the
title, record owner, the registration or application number, the issue date or
filing date, and the expiration date. None of the Registered Intellectual
Property has been adjudged invalid or unenforceable, to the Knowledge of
Seller, all of the Registered Intellectual Property is valid, enforceable and
subsisting. No Interfast Entity has received any notice or other communication
claiming, alleging or suggesting that any of the Registered Intellectual
Property is invalid or unenforceable.

 



 

(b) Seller and the Acquired Entities, individually or collectively, are the
sole, direct and exclusive owners of each item of Registered Intellectual
Property and all other Purchased Intellectual Property (except for Licensed
Intellectual Property) that is material to the Business, and own such
Registered Intellectual Property and Purchased Intellectual Property free and
clear of any Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances and, as of the
date hereof, any Encumbrances set forth on _Section 4.11(a)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule. Seller and the Acquired Entities, individually or
collectively, possess valid and enforceable rights to use the Licensed
Intellectual Property (defined below) in the manner in which they currently
use such Licensed Intellectual Property. Except for any Intellectual Property
licensed to Seller or any Acquired Entity pursuant to a Material Contract or
as otherwise set forth on _Section 4.13(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule (the "
_Licensed Intellectual Property_ "), the Purchased Intellectual Property
includes all of the Intellectual Property necessary or useful to the conduct
of the Business as currently conducted. Immediately subsequent to the Closing,
except as otherwise contemplated under this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement, the Purchased Intellectual Property (other than any Non-Assignable
Rights) will be owned and available for use by, and the Licensed Intellectual
Property (other than any Non-Assignable Rights) will be licensed to and
available for use by, Parent and Buyer, as applicable, on terms and conditions
identical to those under which, immediately prior to the occurrence of the
Closing, Seller and the Acquired Entities, as applicable, owned and used,
without the imposition of any additional obligations, restrictions or
limitations.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) During the prior three (3)-year period, no Interfast Entity has, in the
operation of the Business, infringed, misappropriated or otherwise made any
unlawful or unauthorized use of any Intellectual Property of any Person. The
operation of the Business as currently conducted and currently contemplated to
be conducted by Seller does not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise make any
unlawful or unauthorized use of any Intellectual Property of any Person. The
products and services sold or performed by the Interfast Entities in
connection with the Business do not, and the, use, sale or distribution of
such products or services does not, infringe, misappropriate or otherwise make
any unlawful or unauthorized use of any Intellectual Property of any Person.
Except as set forth on _Section 4.13(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, no
Interfast Entity has received any unsolicited written, or to the Knowledge of
Seller, oral, offer to license Intellectual Property from any other Person
with respect to the Business or any written notice alleging infringement,
misappropriation or other unlawful or unauthorized use of any Intellectual
Property. During the prior three (3) year period, no Interfast Entity has been
a party to any Action relating to infringement, misappropriation or other
unlawful or unauthorized use of Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of
Seller, except as set forth in _Section 4.13(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule,
no other Person is infringing, misappropriating or otherwise making any
unlawful or unauthorized use of any Licensed Intellectual Property, for which
any Interfast Entity has the right to enforce, or any Purchased Intellectual
Property.

 



 

(d) Except as set forth on _Section 4.13(d)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, the
Interfast Entities have taken all reasonable steps to maintain and protect all
of the Registered Intellectual Property so as not to adversely affect the
validity or enforceability thereof, and, to the Knowledge of Seller, no loss
or expiration of any of the Registered Intellectual Property is threatened,
pending or reasonably foreseeable, except for Intellectual Property expiring
at the end of its statutory term (and not as a result of any act or omission
by any Interfast Entity, including a failure to pay any required maintenance
fees) and except for future maintenance fees, future Taxes or other future
required filings to maintain such Intellectual Property in force.

 



 

(e) The Interfast Entities have, and enforce, a policy requiring each
employee, consultant and contractor who has access to the Trade Secrets of the
Business to execute a written agreement protecting the confidentiality of any
information of a confidential nature. The Interfast Entities have used
reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of the Trade Secrets
included in the Purchased Intellectual Property and, to Knowledge of Seller,
no such Trade Secrets that are material to the Business have been to disclosed
to any third Person who is not bound to maintain the confidentiality of such
information.

 



 

(f) The Interfast Entities have information technology systems sufficient to
operate the Business as it is currently conducted.

Section 4.16 _Employee Benefit Plans and Other Agreements_.

 



 

(a) _Section 4.16(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete list
of each Employee Plan. _Section 4.16(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule
separately identifies all Employee Plans maintained, sponsored, contributed to
or required to be contributed to by any Acquired Entities or under which any
Acquired Entity could have any obligation or Liability and any other Employee
Plans that will transfer to Buyer (or one of its subsidiaries), or for which
Buyer (or any subsidiary of Buyer) could have any obligation or Liability by
operation or as a result of any applicable Laws (" _Acquired Plans_ "). Except
as disclosed in _Schedule 4.16(a)_ , no Employee Plans that are Acquired Plans
are subject to the Laws of Canada.

 



 

(b) With respect to each Employee Plan, Seller has delivered to Parent
complete copies of each Employee Plan, including all plan documents, trust
agreements, insurance contracts or other funding vehicles and all amendments
thereto, all summaries and summary plan descriptions, including any summary of
material modifications, and the most recent actuarial report or other
financial statement relating to such Employee Plan. With respect to each
Acquired Plan, Seller has also delivered to Parent (i) the most recent
determination or opinion letter, if any, issued by a Governmental Authority
and (ii) all non-routine filings or correspondence with any Governmental
Authorities.

 



 

(c) Each Employee Plan has been administered in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the
Code, and contributions and premiums required to be made under the terms of
any of the Employee Plans as of the date of this Agreement have been timely
made or, if not yet due, have been properly reflected in the Financial
Statements prior to the date of this Agreement. No event has occurred and no
condition exists in connection with any Employee Plan that could subject
Parent, Buyer or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any tax, fine,
Encumbrance, penalty or other similar Liability as a result of a failure to
comply with any applicable Laws.

 



 

(d) Each Employee Plan which is intended to be qualified within the meaning of
Section 401(a) of the Code or any similar applicable Law has received a
favorable determination or opinion letter as to its qualification, and nothing
has occurred, whether by action or failure to act, that would cause the loss
of such qualification.

 



 

(e) No Interfast Entity or any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any current or
projected Liability in respect of post-employment or post-retirement health,
medical or life insurance coverage for current, former or retired employees,
except as required to avoid an excise tax under Section 4980B of the Code or
otherwise except as may be required pursuant to any other applicable Law. None
of the Employee Plans (other than pension plans) provide for retiree benefits
or for benefits to retired employees or to the beneficiaries or dependents of
retired employees.

 



 

(f) No Employee Plan is a multiemployer pension plan (as defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA) (" _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or other pension plan subject to
Title IV of

 



      
 

 



 

ERISA, and no Interfast Entity or any ERISA Affiliate has sponsored or
contributed to or been required to contribute to a Multiemployer Plan or other
pension plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or other defined benefit pension
plan at any time within the previous six (6) years.

 



 

(g) None of the Acquired Entities is or has at any time been the "employer" or
"connected or associated" with the "employer" (as those terms in quotation
marks are used in the UK Pensions Act 2004) in relation to any UK defined
benefit pension plan.

 



 

(h) With respect to any Acquired Plan, (i) no actions, suits or claims (other
than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course) are pending or, to
the Knowledge of Seller, threatened; (ii) to the Knowledge of Seller, no facts
or circumstances exist that would give rise to any such actions, suits or
claims; and (iii) no administrative investigation, audit or other
administrative proceeding by the Department of Labour, the PBGC, the Internal
Revenue Service, the Canada Revenue Agency or other Governmental Authorities
are pending, or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened (including, without
limitation, any routine requests for information from the PBGC or similar
Governmental Authority). All Acquired Plans that are intended to be funded
and/or book-reserved are fully funded and/or book reserved, as appropriate,
based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions.

 



 

(i) Except as disclosed on _Section 4.16(i)_ of the Disclosure Schedule,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether alone
or in conjunction with a subsequent event) will result in the acceleration or
creation of any rights of any Person to payments or benefits or increases in
any funding, payments or benefits or any loan forgiveness.

 



 

(j) Each Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code and any award thereunder,
in each case that is nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section
409A of the Code, (i) has been operated in all material respects in good faith
compliance with Section 409A of the Code since January 1, 2005, and all
applicable regulations and notices issued thereunder, and (ii) since January
1, 2009, has been in documentary compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(k) No amount or benefit that could be, or has been, received (whether in cash
or property or the vesting of property or the cancellation of Indebtedness) by
any current or former employee, officer or director of Seller or any Acquired
Entity who is a "disqualified individual" within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code could be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as
defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code) as a result of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No Employee Plan provides for
the gross-up of any Taxes imposed by Section 4999 of the Code.

 



 

(l) With respect to Employee Plans providing benefits or compensation to any
employee or former employee of any Interfast Entity or dependent thereof,
which plan, program or arrangement is subject to the Laws of any jurisdiction
outside of the United States or Canada (" _Foreign Plans_ "): (i) if they are
intended to qualify for special tax treatment, the Foreign Plan must meet all
requirements for such treatment, and (ii) no material Liability exists or
would be imposed upon Buyer, any Subsidiary of Buyer, or any Acquired Entity
by reason of such Foreign Plans.

 



      
 

 



 

(m) No Employee Plan is a "registered pension plan", as such term is defined
in the Income Tax Act (Canada). No Employee Plan is a "multi-employer pension
plan" as such term is defined under the Pension Benefits Act (Ontario) or any
similar type plan for purposes of pension standards legislation of another
jurisdiction in Canada.

 



 

(n) No Insurance Policy or any other Contract of Seller or any Acquired Entity
affecting any Employee Plan requires or permits a retroactive increase in
contributions, premiums or other payments due under such insurance policy or
agreement. The level of insurance reserves under each insured Employee Plan is
reasonable and sufficient to provide for all incurred but unreported claims.

 



 

(o) Subject to the requirements of applicable Laws, no provision of any
Employee Plan or of any agreement, and no act or omission of any Interfast
Entity, in any way limits, impairs, modifies or otherwise affects the right of
any Interfast Entity to unilaterally amend or terminate any Employee Plan, and
no commitments to improve or otherwise amend any Employee Plan have been made.

 



 

(p) None of the Employee Plans enjoy any special tax status under any Laws,
nor have any advance tax rulings been sought or received in respect of any
Employee Plan.

 



 

(q) All employee data necessary to administer each Employee Plan in accordance
with its terms and conditions and all Laws is in possession of Seller or any
Acquired Entity and such data is complete, correct, and in a form which is
sufficient for the proper administration of each Employee Plan.

employee without an agreement as to notice or severance. None of the Interfast
Entities have entered into any Contract with any Person presently employed or
retained by Interfast USA (or Interfast USA Holdings) to vary the right of
Interfast USA (or Interfast USA Holdings) to terminate the employment of such
Person in accordance with applicable Laws. No collective agreement is

key employee or group of employees has any plans to terminate employment with
any Interfast Entity. Except as disclosed in _Section 4.17(a)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule, no Interfast Entity has entered into any severance or
similar arrangement in respect of any of its present employee(s) that will
result in any obligation (absolute or contingent) of Parent, Buyer, Seller or

 



      
 

 



 

any Acquired Entity to make any payment to any present employee of any
Interfast Entity following termination of employment or upon a change of
control of such Interfast Entity. No Interfast Entity has engaged in any
unfair labour practice and there are no complaints against any Interfast
Entity pending before the Ontario Labour Relations Board or any similar state
or local labour agency by or on behalf of any employee of any Interfast
Entity. No trade union has applied to have any Interfast Entity declared a
related employer pursuant to the Labour Relations Act (Ontario) or any similar
legislation in any jurisdiction in which the Interfast Entities carry on
business. There are no representation questions, arbitration proceedings,
labour strikes, slowdowns or stoppages, grievances or other labour disputes
pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened with respect to the
employees of any Interfast Entity, and no Interfast Entity is currently or
has, in the last three (3) years, experienced organizing attempts by organized
labour or its representatives. No applications for certification or voluntary
recognition have been received by any Interfast Entity in the last three (3)

Laws relating to employment, equal employment opportunity, pay equity, human
rights, nondiscrimination, immigration, wages, hours, benefits, collective
bargaining, the payment of social security, national insurance contributions
and similar Taxes, occupational safety and health, workplace safety and plant
closings (hereinafter collectively referred to as the " _Employment Laws_ ").
No Interfast Entity is liable for the payment of Taxes, fines, penalties or
other amounts, however designated, for failure to comply with any of the
foregoing Employment Laws, and no audits or investigations are currently
pending. Except as set forth on _Section 4.17(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule,
each Interfast Entity has paid in full to all employees and independent
contractors all amounts currently due and payable for wages, salaries, fees,
commissions, bonuses, vacation pay, benefits and other compensation and any

the Interfast Entities.

 



 

(b) _Section 4.17(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth the position,
title, location of employment, base salary, target bonus amount or
opportunity, commissions and other compensation, vacation entitlement, type of
employment ( _i.e._ , full time or part time) and employment status ( _i.e._ ,
active or on leave) of each of the employees of each Interfast Entity and a
list of their respective employees who have requested leave to begin after the
date hereof and identifies which Interfast Entity is the employer of each such
employee. For those employees on leave, Seller has provided Parent with an
explanation of the reason for such leave, as well as the expected date of
return, if any.

 



 

(c) There are no outstanding assessments, penalties, fines, Encumbrances,
charges, surcharges, or other amounts due or owing pursuant to any workplace
safety and insurance/workers compensation Laws in respect of any Interfast
Entity, and no Interfast Entity has been reassessed in any material respect
under such Laws during the past three (3) years. There are no claims or
potential claims which may materially adversely affect any Interfast Entitys
accident cost experience.

other written communication regarding any violation, alleged violation, or

Knowledge of Seller, threatened, relating to non-compliance with or Liability

Affiliates to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to

Section 6.5 _Discussions with AVIC Zhuhai_. During the period between the date
of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Parent agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts, acting in good faith, to meet and discuss with AVIC Zhuhai
(to the extent it makes its representatives reasonably available) and evaluate
a potential business relationship between Parent or its Affiliates and AVIC
Zhuhai that would be intended to replace the current business relationship
between Interfast Asia and AVIC Zhuhai. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in
this _Section 6.5 _shall be deemed to be a binding obligation of Parent or
any of its Affiliates to enter into a business relationship with AVIC Zhuhai
and any business arrangement between them shall be on terms and subject to a
definitive agreement mutually acceptable to Parent and AVIC Zhuhai in their
sole discretion. Following the Closing, the commitment set forth in this
_Section 6.5_ shall have no effect on any of the parties respective
obligations under this Agreement (including _Article 8_).

 



 

Section 6.6 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify, defend and save and
hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties, from and against any and all
Losses, whether or not involving any third party claims, arising out of or in
connection with any: (i) Taxes payable by or with respect to any Acquired
Entity with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period; (ii) any Excluded Taxes;
(iii) breach of any representation or warranty in _Section 4.21_; (iv) breach
of any covenant contained in _Section 6.4(t)_ or this _Section 6.6_; and (v)
any Transfer Taxes for which Seller is liable pursuant to _Section 6.6(e)_;
_provided_ , that the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
indemnification for Taxes to the extent, but only to the extent, that such
Taxes are set forth as a current Liability (other than a current Liability for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) on the Final Closing Balance Sheet and have been taken into account in
the calculation of the Final Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (x) references to
"Losses" in this _Section 6.6(a)_ shall be deemed to include amounts that
would have constituted "Losses" but for the set-off or other utilization of
any loss, deduction or credit realized in or attributable to a Post-Closing
Tax Period and (y) Sellers indemnification obligations pursuant to this
_Section 6.6(a)_ shall survive the Closing and continue in full force and
effect until 90 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations and shall not be subject to the limitations set forth in _Section
8.2(e)_.

 



 

(b) _Tax Returns_. Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or
cause to be filed all Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to
the Acquired Entities, the Business and the Purchased Assets for all taxable
periods that end on or before the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_
"). Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, Pre-Closing Tax Returns shall
be prepared on a basis consistent with past practices of the Acquired Entities
and the Business. If any Pre-Closing Tax Return (i) relates to income (or
similar) Taxes of any Acquired Entity or (ii) could reasonably be expected to
have an adverse effect on or increase the Tax Liability of Parent, Buyer or
any of their respective Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities) in a
Post-Closing Tax Period, Seller shall cause each such Pre-Closing Tax Return
to be delivered to Parent for its review and comment at least twenty (20) days
prior to the due date for such Tax Return (taking into account any applicable
extensions of time to file). Seller shall make such revisions to such Tax
Returns as may be reasonably requested by Parent. Parent shall prepare or
cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns required to
be filed

 



      
 

 



 

by or with respect to the Acquired Entities, the Business and the Purchased
Assets for any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing
Date (" _Straddle Period Tax Returns_ "). Unless otherwise required by
applicable Law, such Straddle Period Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis
consistent with past practices of the Acquired Entities and the Business.
Parent shall cause each Straddle Period Tax Return that relates to income (or
similar) Taxes of any Acquired Entity to be delivered to Seller for their
review and comment at least twenty (20) days prior to the due date for such
Tax Return (taking into account any applicable extensions of time to file).
Parent shall make such revisions to such Straddle Period Tax Returns as may be
reasonably requested by Seller to the extent such revisions relate to Taxes
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period (as determined pursuant to _Section
6.6(c)_). No later than five (5) days prior to the due date for filing any
Straddle Period Tax Return, Seller shall pay to Parent the amount of Taxes
payable with respect to such Straddle Period Tax Return for which Seller has
an indemnification obligation pursuant to _Section 6.6(a)_. Seller shall be
entitled to all Tax refunds received by the Acquired Entities (net of any
costs associated therewith) with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, except to
the extent such refund arises as the result of a carryback of a loss or other
tax benefit from a period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing
Date.

 



 

(c) _Calculation of Taxes_. For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any
Taxes that are payable with respect to a taxable period that includes (but
does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Taxes allocated to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall, (i) in the case of any property or _ad valorem_
Taxes applicable to the Purchased Assets or the Assets of the Acquired
Entities as of the Closing Date, be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for
the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days in the taxable period ending on (and including) the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable
period, and (ii) in the case of any other Taxes, be deemed equal to the amount
which would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing
Date.

 



 

(d) _Cooperation_. The parties hereto shall cooperate fully, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by any other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns and the conduct of any Tax audits, examinations, assessments, or other
administrative or judicial proceedings relating to the Acquired Entities, the
Business, the Purchased Assets or the Revised Allocation. Such cooperation
shall include, but shall not be limited to, providing applicable powers of
attorney for Taxes, retaining and (upon the other partys request) providing
records and information reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Buyer,
on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall not destroy or otherwise
dispose of any such records without first providing the other parties with a
reasonable opportunity to review and copy the same.

 



 

(e) _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, land transfer, documentary, registration
charges, recording, gross receipt, sales, provincial sales, use, consumption,
goods and services, harmonized sales, Quebec sales, value-added, turnover,
excise, stamp, customs duties, countervail, anti-dumping and special import
measures, import and export Taxes, and other similar Taxes and fees ("
_Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in connection with the transactions

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated by this Agreement and imposed on Parent or Buyer under applicable
Law (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any direct or indirect capital gain
Taxes and withholding Taxes, in each case, imposed on Seller in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) shall be borne by Parent
and Buyer. All other Transfer Taxes, if any, shall be borne by Seller. The
parties shall cooperate in the preparation and filing of all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all Transfer Taxes, and each
party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any
such Tax Returns and other documentation in accordance with applicable Law.

 



 

(f) _Tax Contests_. Parent shall promptly notify Seller in writing upon
receipt by Parent, Buyer or any of their Affiliates of a written notice of any
pending or threatened audit, examination, assessment, or other administrative
or judicial proceedings relating to Taxes for which Seller may have Liability
pursuant to this Agreement (" _Tax Contest_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , no
failure or delay by Parent to provide notice of a Tax Contest shall reduce or
otherwise affect Sellers obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified
Parties under this Agreement except to the extent Seller is actually
prejudiced thereby. With respect to any Tax Contest that relates solely to a
taxable period that ends on or before the Closing Date, Seller shall have the
right to control the conduct of such Tax Contest if Seller provides Parent
with written notice of their election to control such Tax Contest within
twenty (20) days after receipt of notice thereof (or such earlier date, if the
failure to assume the defense on such earlier date would materially impair the
ability of Parent to defend such Tax Contest); _provided_ , that (i) Seller
shall keep Parent fully informed regarding the progress and substantive
aspects of any such Tax Contest and shall promptly respond to any reasonable
inquiry by Parent with respect thereto, (ii) Parent shall be entitled to
participate (at its own expense) in any such Tax Contest and (iii) Seller
shall not compromise or settle any such Tax Contest without obtaining Parents
prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. If Seller does not elect to control a Tax Contest that
relates solely to a taxable period that ends on or before the Closing Date,
Parent shall be entitled to control such Tax Contest at Sellers expense. With
respect to any Tax Contest that does not relate solely to a taxable period
that ends on or before the Closing Date, Parent shall have the right to
control the conduct of such Tax Contest; _provided_ , that (i) Parent shall
keep Sellers fully informed regarding the progress and substantive aspects of
such Tax Contest and shall promptly respond to any reasonable inquiry by
Seller with respect thereto, (ii) Seller shall be entitled (at Sellers
expense) to participate in such Tax Contest and (iii) Parent shall not
compromise or settle any issues in such Tax Contest that relate to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period without obtaining Sellers prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In the
event of any conflict between this _Section 6.6(f)_ and _Section 8.2(d)_,
this _Section 6.6(f)_ shall control.

 



 

(g) _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. All amounts paid with respect to
indemnity claims under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties hereto
for all Tax purposes as adjustments to the Cash Purchase Price, unless
otherwise required by Law.

 



 

(h) _Tax Elections_.

 



 

(i) At the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall jointly execute elections under
section 167(1) of the ETA and section 75 of the QSTA, in the forms prescribed
for such purposes, such that the sale of the Purchased Assets hereunder will
take place

 



      
 

 



 

without payment of any goods and services tax, harmonized sales tax and Quebec
sales tax. The Buyer will file the elections with the appropriate Governmental
Authorities within the time permitted under the ETA and QSTA. Notwithstanding
_Section 4.14(c)_, Parent and Buyer jointly and severally agrees to indemnify
the Seller Indemnified Parties for Taxes, penalties, interest and costs
assessed or reassessed by a Governmental Authority on the basis that the
election or elections were invalid; _provided_ that any claim for

_Section 8.2(d)_.

 



 

(ii) Seller and Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts in good faith
to minimize (or eliminate) any other Transfer Taxes payable in respect of the
Closing by, among other things, making such other elections and taking such
other steps as may reasonably be requested by Parent in connection with the

(iii) Seller and Buyer agree to elect jointly in the prescribed form under

Section 6.7 _Employee and Employee Benefit Matters_.

 



 

(a) Parent or one or more of its Subsidiaries shall extend: (i) offers of
employment to all employees of Seller (other than to Douglas Woollings who
will become engaged as a consultant to Parent or one of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to the Consulting Agreement), including the part-time employees of
Seller (collectively, the " _Active Employees_ "), which offers of employment
shall provide for terms and conditions of employment that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than such employees terms and conditions of
employment as in effect as of the Closing Date; and (ii) offers of engagement
as a consultant to all consultants of Seller listed on _Section 6.7(a)_ of
the Disclosure Schedule. Those Active Employees who accept such offer of
employment are referred to herein as the " _Transferred Employees_ ". The
employment of the Transferred Employees with Parent or such Subsidiary shall
become effective at 12:01 am local time on the day after the Closing Date;
_provided_ , that, for any Transferred Employees whose employment would
otherwise automatically transfer by operation of law to Buyer as of the
Closing, such employment shall become effective immediately as of the Closing;
and, _provided_ _further_ , that unless Parent or such Subsidiary determines
otherwise, Seller shall take all action necessary to provide that those
employees who are not actively at work with Seller

 



      
 

 



 

as of the close of business on the Closing Date shall not become Transferred
Employees and shall remain employees of Seller until the applicable employee
is ready to return to active employment, as reasonably determined by Parent or
such Subsidiary. The parties acknowledge that Parents offers of employment to
Active Employees shall not be required to provide for a benefit similar to the
Phantom Stock Plan (as defined below), or any other equity-based compensation
plan, so long as such offers of employment provide for compensation and
benefits having economic value that is substantially comparable to the
economic value of the compensation and benefits provided to the Active
Employees as of immediately prior to the Closing Date (including any value
attributable to awards under the Phantom Stock Plan), as reasonably acceptable
to Parent and Seller. For purposes of this Agreement, an employee is not
"actively at work" if the employee is (i) receiving short-term or long-term
disability benefits under any plan or program established or maintained by any
Interfast Entity or (ii) on any type of leave other than vacation, leave for
jury duty, leave for national service/military duty, or any other statutorily
protected leave as may be required by Law. Seller shall cooperate with and use
its commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent and its Subsidiaries in
their respective efforts to secure satisfactory employment arrangements with
Active Employees. Except as provided in _Section 6.7(b)_, neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall assume any obligation or Liability, and Seller
shall remain responsible for, all claims or Liability relating to all
Personnel of Seller who are not Transferred Employees or Continuing Employees.
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be a guarantee of employment for
any Active Employee, or to restrict the rights of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to terminate any Transferred Employee. Following the date hereof
and prior to Closing, Seller (i) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide to Parent, Buyer and their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable,
such payroll transition services as may be requested by Parent or Buyer and
shall (and shall cause its employees to) use commercially reasonable efforts
to cooperate with and assist Parent, Buyer and their respective Subsidiaries
to transition employee payroll processes to Parent, Buyer or their respective
Subsidiaries, as applicable, for Transferred Employees in connection with the
Closing, and (ii) shall (and shall cause its employees to) use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with and assist Parent, Buyer and their
respective Subsidiaries to establish employee benefit plans and programs that
are consistent with the requirements of this _Section 6.7(a)_, including the
establishment of "mirror" benefit plans to provide employee benefits to
Transferred Employees following the Closing Date. Such cooperation and
assistance shall include assistance in negotiating with third party service
providers and the provision of such information and documents as Parent or
Buyer may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing.

 



 

(b) As of the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Acquired Entities to
continue, subject to the Continuing Employees right to resign, to employ the
Continuing Employees on such terms and conditions as may be required by
applicable Law. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be a guarantee of
employment for any Continuing Employee, or to restrict the rights of Parent,
its Subsidiaries or the Acquired Entities to terminate any Continuing Employee
after the Closing Date, provided that Seller shall have no Liability or other
obligation in either case for notice, severance or accrued vacation payments
in connection therewith.

 



 

(c) Seller shall be responsible for the employment or termination thereof of
all Personnel of Seller who do not become Transferred Employees effective as
of the Closing Date and Seller shall be responsible for all Liabilities or
obligations related thereto under the Law.

 



      
 

 



 

Without limiting the foregoing, Seller agrees that it shall, no later than
immediately prior to the Closing, terminate the employment of any Active
Employee who has not accepted Parent or one of its Subsidiaries offer of
employment described in _Section 6.7(a)_ and whose employment would otherwise
transfer to Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries by operation of Law. At the
Closing, Seller shall provide to Parent a true and complete list of all
employees of the Interfast Entities, other than the Transferred Employees and
Continuing Employees, who are terminated by any Interfast Entity in connection
with the Closing and all employees of the Interfast Entities who were
terminated by any Interfast Entity for any reason within the six (6) month
period prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) Seller shall be solely responsible for the Seller Employment Liabilities,
including the Employee Plans and all Liabilities thereunder (other than
Liabilities with respect to Acquired Plans that relate solely to post-Closing
periods). Seller agrees to promptly pay and satisfy in accordance with past
practices or reimburse Parent, its Subsidiaries or the Acquired Entities, as
applicable, for all Seller Employment Liabilities, including, without
limitation, all vacation pay accrued as of the Closing Date and any other
termination-related Liabilities to the Transferred Employees relating to their
termination of employment with Seller. Without limiting the foregoing, neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall assume any Liability for any
performance or other bonuses for Personnel of Seller or the Acquired Entities
for any period on or prior to the Closing Date, and Seller agrees to pay out
all such bonuses accrued through the Closing Date in accordance with past
practices as if the Closing Date constituted the end of the applicable
performance period for such bonuses; _provided_ , that Seller shall pay such
bonuses on or prior to the later to occur of (i) September 30, 2012 and (ii)
the date that is 60 days following the Closing Date. **** Without limiting
Sellers obligations hereunder, Seller shall be responsible for all
Liabilities for claims incurred under the Employee Plans by Transferred
Employees or the Continuing Employees on or prior to the Closing Date. For
purposes hereof, the date on which a benefit claim is incurred will be: (i) in
the case of a death claim, the date of death; (ii) in the case of a short term
disability claim, long term disability claim or a life insurance premium
waiver claim, the date of the first incidence of disability, illness, injury
or disease that first qualifies an individual for benefits or to commence a
qualifying period for benefits; (iii) in the case of extended health care
benefits, including, without limitation, dental and medical treatments, the
date of treatment or the date of purchase of eligible medical or dental
supplies; and (iv) in the case of a claim for drug or vision benefits, the
date the prescription was filled.

 



 

(e) Seller shall be responsible for all workers compensation claims (i)
asserted or filed by any employees of Seller and the Acquired Entities on or
before the Closing, (ii) asserted or filed by former employees or retired
employees of Seller and the Acquired Entities, and (iii) asserted or filed by
any employees of Seller and the Acquired Entities after the Closing if the
claim arises from pre-Closing events or circumstances regardless of whether
the events or circumstances are known or unknown as of the Closing.

 



 

(f) Prior to the Closing, if requested by Parent, Interfast USA shall adopt a
resolution terminating the Interfast USA 401(k) Plan (the " _401(k) Plan_")
effective as of or immediately prior to the Closing Date. In the event that
termination of the 401(k) Plan would reasonably be anticipated to trigger
liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees, then Seller shall take
such actions as are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such
charges

 



       
 

 



 

or fees and provide such estimate in writing to Parent no later than three (3)
business days prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(g) Subject to _Section 6.7(a)_, from and after the Closing, Parent or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall be responsible for the employment or
termination thereof of all Personnel of Seller who become Transferred
Employees, without any Liability to Seller (other than with respect to
Excluded Liabilities), and shall give each Transferred Employee full credit
for his or her prior years of service with Seller and with any predecessor
employer thereof for the purposes of calculating all amounts due on the
termination of the employment of the Transferred Employees and determining the
Transferred Employees entitlements under any employee benefit plan of Parent
or its Subsidiaries in which the Transferred Employees may participate
(including vacation accrual rates), in each case to the same extent recognized
by Seller or the Acquired Entities, as applicable, except to the extent such
credit would result in the duplication of benefits for the same period of
service.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries have any Liability of any kind under,
relating to or in connection with the Interfast Inc. Amended and Restated 2011
Long Term Incentive Plan for Designated Employees and Non-Employee Directors
or any predecessor plan (the " _Phantom Stock Plan_ "). Such Liabilities shall
be the sole responsibility of Seller. Seller shall take all action necessary
or advisable to terminate the Phantom Stock Plan, effective as of the Closing
Date and to pay out all amounts due thereunder to participants in the Phantom
Stock Plan within a reasonable period of time following the Closing Date. Such
termination and liquidation of the Phantom Stock Plan shall be conducted in a
manner that complies with Treas. Reg. 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B). In addition,
Seller shall take all actions necessary or advisable to cause the Phantom
Stock Plan to comply in form and operation with the requirements of Code
Section 409A prior to the Closing Date. Following the date of this Agreement,
Seller shall provide Parent an opportunity to review and comment on any
corporate resolutions, regulatory filings or written notices that may be
adopted, filed or provided to any Governmental Authority or any participant in
the Phantom Stock Plan in connection with the foregoing and shall consider in
good faith any comments reasonably proposed by Parent. To the extent paid
after the Closing Date, the parties shall reasonably cooperate with respect to
the procedures for paying out amounts due to participants in connection with
the termination of the Phantom Stock Plan.

 



 

(i) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall submit to its shareholders, as
applicable, for approval (in a manner satisfactory to Parent), by such number
of shareholders as is required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the
Code, any payments and/or benefits that may, in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, separately or in the aggregate,
constitute "parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder), such that such payments and
benefits shall not be deemed "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the
Code, and prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Parent evidence
satisfactory to Parent that (i) a shareholder vote was held in conformance
with Section 280G and the regulations promulgated thereunder and the requisite
shareholder approval was obtained with respect to any payments and/or benefits
that were subject to the shareholder vote (the " _280G Approval_ ") or (ii)
that the 280G Approval was not obtained and as a consequence, that such
"parachute payments" shall not be made or provided, pursuant to waivers of
those payments and/or benefits which were executed by the affected

 



      
 

 



 

individuals prior to the date the payments and/or benefits were submitted to
the shareholders for approval.

 



 

(j) No provision of this Agreement shall be construed as a guarantee of
continued employment of any employee and this Agreement shall not be construed
so as to prohibit Parent, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates from having the right to terminate the employment of any such
employee. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i) be treated as an
amendment or other modification of any employee benefit plan, program, or
arrangement, including any Employee Plan, (ii) give any employee or former
employee or any other individual associated therewith or any employee benefit
plan or trustee thereof or any other third party any right to enforce the
provisions of this _Section 6.7_, or (iii) obligate Parent, its Subsidiaries,
any Acquired Entity or any of their respective Affiliates to maintain any
particular benefit plan or retain any particular employee following the
Closing Date.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Name Change_. Within ten (10) Business Days following the
Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause all of its direct and indirect
Subsidiaries (with the exception of the JV Entity) to take all action
necessary to change the name of Seller and such Subsidiaries to a name not
including the word "Interfast" or any derivative thereof, including the words
"inter" or "fast". Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause,
to the extent within its control, the JV Entity to change its name to a name
not including the word "Interfast" or any derivative thereof, including the
words "inter" or "fast".

 



 

Section 6.9 _Collection of Accounts Receivable and Letters of Credit_. At the

of or relate to a part of the Purchased Assets or the Assets of any Interfast

the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that all such covenants and
agreements contemplating performance following the Closing Date shall survive
the Closing Date until performed in accordance with their terms; and (c) any
Claim pursuant to clauses ( _iii_ ), ( _iv_ ), ( _v_ ) or ( _vi_ ) of _Section
8.2(a)_ or clauses ( _iii_ ) or ( _iv_ ) of _Section 8.2(b)_ may be brought
without any time limitations. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, any claim which is asserted by delivery of a written notice of
claim to the Indemnifying Party within the time limitations set forth in this
_Section 8.1_ shall survive until the final resolution of such claim in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement even if the representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement underlying such claim has expired.

 



 

Section 8.2 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) _By Seller_. Subject to the provisions of this _Section 8.2_, from and
after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify, defend and save and hold harmless
Parent, Buyer, their respective Affiliates (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Acquired Entities), and their respective shareholders, members,
partners, officers, directors, employees and other Representatives
(collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ "), from and against any and
all Losses, whether or not involving any third party claims, arising out of,
resulting from, relating to, incurred in connection with or incident to (i)
any breach of any representation or warranty of Seller contained in _Article
4_ hereof, (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Seller contained
herein, including under _Section 2.5_, (iii) any Liability imposed upon
Parent or Buyer

 



      
 

 



 

by reason of the parties non-compliance with, or breach of, any Bulk Sales
Laws and the Retail Sales Tax Act (Ontario) in respect of the transaction of
purchase and sale contemplated under this Agreement, (iv) any violation or
(with respect to amounts paid in investigation, defense, settlement, penalties
or fines only) alleged violation of any Anti-corruption Laws applicable to any
Interfast Entity or any breach or (with respect to amounts paid in
investigation, defense, settlement, penalties or fines only) alleged breach of
_Section 4.31_ (disregarding any qualifications as to Knowledge of Seller),
directly or indirectly, by, on behalf of or with the knowledge of Seller or
any of its Affiliates or Representatives, (v) any Excluded Liabilities and
(vi) any Liabilities or express obligations of Seller arising under
arrangements made by the parties with respect to Non-Assignable Rights or
otherwise pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ so long as Parent and Buyer are not in
breach of their obligations thereunder. Any claim made by any Buyer
Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section 8.2_ shall, to the extent funds
are available therefor, be paid first from the Escrow Account and thereafter
by Seller.

 



 

(b) _By_ _Parent and_ _Buyer_. Subject to the provisions of this _Section
8.2_, from and after the Closing, Parent and Buyer shall jointly and severally
indemnify, defend and save and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates,
shareholders, members, partners, officers, directors, employees and other
Representatives (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ "), from and
against any and all Losses, whether or not involving any third-party claims,
arising out of, resulting from, relating to, incurred in connection with or
incident to (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Parent and
Buyer contained in _Article 5_ hereof, (ii) any breach of any covenant or
agreement of Parent or Buyer contained herein, including under _Section 2.5_
and/or _Section 6.7_ hereof, (iii) any Assumed Liabilities, and (iv) any
Liabilities or express obligations of Parent or Buyer arising under
arrangements made by the parties with respect to Non-Assignable Rights or
otherwise pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ so long as Seller is not in breach of
its obligations thereunder.

 



 

(c) _Claims Procedure_. If a claim for Losses (a " _Claim_ ") is to be made by
either a Buyer Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party pursuant to
this _Section 8.2_ or _Section 6.6(h)_ (the " _Indemnified Party_ "), such
Indemnified Party shall give written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the
indemnifying party or parties (collectively, the " _Indemnifying Party_ "),
promptly after such Indemnified Party becomes aware of any fact, condition or
event which may give rise to Losses for which indemnification may be sought
under this _Section 8.2_ or _Section 6.6(h)_. The Claim Notice shall
describe in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to the claim for
indemnification hereunder and including (if then known) the amount or the
method of computation of the amount of such claim, and a reference to the
provision of this Agreement or any document executed pursuant hereto upon
which such claim is based (to the extent then known); _provided_ , that a
Third Party Notice in respect of any third-party Claim as to which
indemnification will be sought shall be given promptly after such Indemnified
Party has been notified that an Action or investigation has commenced (and in
any event within thirty (30) calendar days after the service of the citation
or summons); _provided_ , _however_ , that any failure or delay in giving such
notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder,
except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been materially
prejudiced by such failure or delay.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Third-Party Claims_.

 



 

(i) If a claim by a third party is made against an Indemnified Party, and if
such Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity with respect thereto under
this _Section 8.2_ or _Section 6.6(h)_, such Indemnified Party shall
promptly send a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party, describing the nature
and amount of the third-party claim (if then known) in reasonable detail. The
Indemnifying Party shall, subject to the terms and conditions of this _Section
8.2(d)(i)_, be entitled at any time after the Indemnified Party delivers a
Claim Notice with respect to a specific third-party claim, (A) to agree to
indemnify the Indemnified Party for the costs of defense or (B) so long as (v)
the claim involves primarily monetary damages, (w) as between the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party, the claim made, if proven, would reasonably
cause the Indemnifying Party to satisfy and discharge more than fifty percent
(50%) of the claim, (x) it is reasonable to believe that the Indemnifying
Party can satisfy its indemnification obligations hereunder and (y) the claim
does not relate to the Taxes of the Indemnified Party (other than any Claims
for which a Seller Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant
to _Section 6.6(h)_), to undertake, conduct and control the settlement or
defense of the third-party claim at the Indemnifying Partys own expense and
through counsel of the Indemnifying Partys choosing that is reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party so elects to
pursue such course of action, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate to the
extent reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in connection therewith;
_provided_ , that the Indemnified Party may participate in such settlement or
defense through counsel chosen by it and paid for at its own expense;
_provided_ , _further_ , that any cooperation by the Indemnified Party shall
not require it to incur any material out-of-pocket expenses unless the
Indemnifying Party agrees to pay such expenses. So long as the Indemnifying
Party is reasonably contesting any such third-party claim in good faith, or
has agreed to pay and is paying the reasonable expenses associated with the
defense of such third-party claim, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or
settle any such claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, if the Indemnifying
Party does not (i) notify the Indemnified Party in writing within fifteen (15)
Business Days after the Indemnified Party delivers a Claim Notice with respect
to a specific third-party claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to
undertake the defense thereof or pay the expenses associated with the defense
of such third party claim as provided above, or (ii) notify the Indemnified
Party in writing within thirty (30) Business Days after the Indemnified Party
delivers a Claim Notice with respect to a specific third-party claim that the
Indemnifying Party agrees that it is obligated to indemnify the Indemnified
Party for such claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
undertake, at the Indemnifying Partys cost, risk and expense, the defense,
compromise or settlement of the claim, but shall not thereby waive any right
to indemnity therefore pursuant to this Agreement. The assumption by the
Indemnified Party of the defense of a third-party claim pursuant to this
_Section 8.2_ shall not preclude the Indemnifying Party from participating in
(but not directing) the defense of the third-party claim with counsel of its
own choice and at its own expense. In addition, if the Indemnified Party has
assumed the defense of a third-party claim as provided herein, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of the claim
from the Indemnified Party at any time prior to settlement, provided that the
Indemnifying Party agrees that it is obligated to indemnify the Indemnified
Party for such claim and otherwise satisfies the requirements of the second
sentence of _Section 8.2(d)(i)_. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume
control of a claim as permitted in _Section 8.2(d)_, the obligation of the
Indemnifying Party to indemnify the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim
shall terminate if the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnified Party settles such claim without the consent of the Indemnifying
Party; _provided_ , that such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for
the reasonable fees and expenses of separate counsel for the Indemnified Party
(not to exceed one law firm plus, if applicable, local counsel for any Action
or related Actions) if representation of the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party by the same counsel would, in the reasonable opinion of
counsel to the Indemnified Party, constitute a conflict of interest on a
material issue between Indemnifying Partys position and the Indemnified
Partys position.

 



 

(iii) The Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement of any third-
party claim without the consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except for a settlement
that includes as an unconditional term thereof that the Person(s) asserting
the third-party claim give to all Indemnified Parties an unconditional release
from all damages and Liabilities with respect to such claim and provided that
such settlement does not result in an Encumbrance on the Assets of any
Indemnified Party or result in any restriction or condition that would apply
to or adversely affect any Indemnified Party or the conduct of the Business
(other than the execution and delivery by the Indemnified Party of a customary
release that does not acknowledge Liability or fault).

 



 

(e) _Limitations on Seller Indemnification_. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
but subject to _Section 6.6(a)_, (i) no Buyer Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ for any Losses
unless and until the amount of all Losses for which all Buyer Indemnified
Parties are entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_
exceeds $925,000 (the " _Seller Threshold Amount_ "), at which time Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification for such Losses
sustained by such Buyer Indemnified Parties that exceed the Seller Threshold
Amount; (ii) in no event shall the aggregate amount of Losses sustained by the
Buyer Indemnified Parties be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section
8.2(a)(i)_ exceed $20,000,000 (the " _Seller Indemnification Cap_ "); and
(iii) Seller shall not be liable under this _Article 8_ for any special,
indirect, incidental, consequential (in each case, to the extent not
reasonably foreseeable), punitive or aggravated damages or damages for lost
profits on the investment represented by the transactions contemplated hereby
or lost prospective business opportunities. Notwithstanding this _Section
8.2(e)_, the Seller Threshold Amount and the Seller Indemnification Cap shall
not apply to any Losses arising out of, resulting from, relating to, incurred
in connection with or incident to any breach of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 4.1_ (Organization and Qualification), _4.2_
(Authorization), _4.3_ _(a)_ and _4.3_ _(b)_ (No Conflict), _4.14(a)_
(Title to Purchased Assets), _4.15_ (Questionable Payments), _4.21_ (Tax
Matters), _4.27_ (Brokers), _4.31_ (Anti-Corruption Matters) or any claim
involving Fraud.

 



 

(f) _Limitations on Buyer Indemnification_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i)
no Seller Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
_Section 8.2(b)_ _(i)_ for any Losses unless and until the amount of all
Losses for which all Seller Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)(i)_ exceeds $925,000 (the "
_Buyer Threshold Amount_ "), at which time the Seller Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to indemnification for such Losses sustained by such Seller
Indemnified Parties that exceed the Buyer Threshold Amount, (ii) in no event
shall the aggregate amount of Losses for which the

 



       
 

 



 

Seller Indemnified Parties be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section
8.2(b)(i)_ exceed $20,000,000 (the " _Buyer Indemnification Cap_ "); and (iii)
neither Parent nor Buyer shall be liable for any special, indirect,
incidental, consequential (in each case, to the extent not reasonably
foreseeable), punitive or aggravated damages, including damages for lost
profits (except as may result in a diminution of value) and lost business
opportunities. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Buyer
Indemnification Cap shall not apply to any Losses arising out of, resulting
from, relating to, incurred in connection with or incident to any breach of
the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 5.1_ (Incorporation
and Authority), _5.2_ (No Conflict), _5.5_ (Brokers) or any claim involving
Fraud.

 



 

(g) _Materiality Disregarded_. For purposes of calculating Losses under this
_Article 8_, the representations and warranties in this Agreement shall be
deemed to have been made without any qualifications as to materiality and,
accordingly, all references in this Agreement to "material," "in all material
respects," "Material Adverse Effect" and similar qualifications as to
materiality shall be deemed to be deleted therefrom (except where any such
provision requires disclosure of lists of items of a material nature or above
a specified threshold).

 



 

(h) _Effect of Investigation_. An Indemnified Partys right to indemnification
or other remedies based upon the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the Indemnifying Party will not be affected by any investigation
or knowledge of the Indemnified Party or any waiver by the Indemnified Party
of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or
compliance with any covenant or agreement. Such representations and warranties
and covenants and agreements shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason
of the fact that the Indemnified Party knew or should have known that any
representation or warranty might be inaccurate or that the Indemnifying Party
failed to comply with any agreement or covenant. Any investigation by an
Indemnified Party shall be for its own protection only and shall not affect or
impair any right or remedy hereunder.

 



 

(i) _Reductions; Subrogation_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the amount of any and all Losses under this Agreement **** shall
be determined net of (A) any Tax benefits actually realized by the Indemnified
Party by way of reduction in the amount of Taxes payable by such Indemnified
Party with respect to the taxable year in which such Losses are sustained,
which reduction is directly attributable to sustaining such Losses and (B) any
amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under or pursuant to any:
(i) insurance coverage; (ii) manufacturer warranty; or (iii) any claim,
recovery, settlement or payment by or against any other Person, in each case,
net of any costs, expenses (including Taxes) or premiums incurred in
connection therewith. If the amount of any Claim incurred by a party at any
time subsequent to the making of an indemnity payment is reduced by any such
Tax benefits, insurance proceeds, manufacturer warranty or other such amounts,
the amount of such reduction, shall promptly be repaid by that party to the
other party. Upon making a full indemnity payment, a party shall, to the
extent of such indemnity payment, be subrogated to all rights of the other
party against any third party in respect of the Claim to which the indemnity
payment relates.

 



 

(j) _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the
remedies set forth in this _Section 8.2_, in the absence of Fraud, wilful
misconduct or intentional breach, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any and all claims asserted

 



      
 

 



 

following Closing relating, directly or indirectly, to the subject matter of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Accordingly, the
parties waive, from and after the Closing, any and all rights, remedies and
claims that one party may have against the other, whether at law, under any
statute or in equity (including but not limited to claims for contribution or
other rights of recovery arising under any Laws, claims for breach of
contract, breach of representation and warranty, negligent misrepresentation
and all claims for breach of duty), or otherwise, directly or indirectly,
relating to the provisions of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement other than as expressly provided for in this _Article 8_
and other than those arising with respect to any Fraud, wilful misconduct or
intentional breach.

 



 

(k) _One Recovery_. A party shall not be entitled to double recovery for any
claims even though they may have resulted from the breach of more than one of
the representations, warranties, agreements and covenants made by the other
party in this Agreement.

 



 

(l) _Duty to Mitigate_. Nothing in this Agreement shall in any way restrict or
limit the general obligation at law of a party to mitigate any loss which it
may suffer or incur by reason of the breach by the other party of any
representation, warranty or covenant of that other party under this Agreement.
If any claim can be reduced by any recovery, settlement or otherwise under or
pursuant to any insurance coverage, manufacturer warranty, or any claim,
recovery, settlement or payment by or against any other Person, a party shall
take all appropriate steps to enforce such recovery, settlement or payment. If
the Indemnified Party fails to make all commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any loss then the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to
indemnify any Indemnified Party for the loss that could have been avoided if
the Indemnified Party had made such efforts.

 



 

(m) _Wind-Up of the JV Entity_. The parties acknowledge that the Excluded JV
Assets are excluded from the purchase and sale transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The parties further acknowledge that: (a) Seller and Interfast
Asia intend, following the execution of this Agreement, to take all necessary
action, in their sole and absolute discretion, to terminate the JV Agreement
and to dissolve and wind-up Interfast Asia; and (b) Sellers decision to
terminate the JV Agreement and to dissolve and wind-up Interfast Asia has been
made by Seller without any influence, inducement, incentive or encouragement
from or by Parent, Buyers or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives. Parent and Buyer acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including the indemnification
rights of the Buyer Indemnified Parties under _Articles 6_ and _8_ , none of
Seller, the Excluded Entities or their direct or indirect shareholders or
their respective directors, officers, employees or other Representatives
(collectively, the " _Seller Group_ ") shall be liable or responsible in any
way, including under this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement, at law or in
equity, to Parent, Buyer or any other Buyer Indemnified Party for any loss of
profits, prospects or reputation (collectively, " _Business Losses_ ") arising
directly or indirectly from: (i) the inability of Interfast Asia and Seller to
perform their respective obligations under the JV Agreement and the
Cooperation Agreement to the extent resulting from the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) the termination of the JV Agreement;
(iii) the dissolution and wind-up of Interfast Asia; and/or (iv) any actions
taken in good faith by the Seller Group in furtherance any of the foregoing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not affect any of the
Liabilities, responsibilities or obligations of any member of the Seller Group
under this Agreement,

 



      
 

 



 

including the indemnification rights of the Buyer Indemnified Parties under
_Article 6_ or this _Article 8_, with respect to any Liabilities (as
contrasted with Business Losses), other than Permitted Losses. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Permitted Losses_ " shall mean Losses, not to exceed
$1,000,000 in the aggregate, of the Buyer Indemnified Parties arising out of,
resulting from, relating to, or incurred in connection with or incident to
investigating, defending, responding to or settling, any Action brought
against any Buyer Indemnified Parties by AVIC Zhuhai or any of its Affiliates
as a result of any actions taken by any member of the Seller Group or its
Affiliates as described in clauses (i) through (iv) of this _Section 8.2(m)_,
other than Actions alleging interference with contractual relations,
inducement of breach of contract, aiding and abetting, unlawful interference,
interference with prospective advantage or opportunity, infringement upon
creditors rights or property interests, or any claim of a type similar to any
of the foregoing, whether or not based on a legal theory cognizable under the
Laws of the Province of Ontario.

this Agreement, (a) Parent and Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller (and any of
Sellers Affiliates), on the other hand, shall, to the extent practicable,
consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making
any public statements (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include
communications between Parent, Buyer and any of their respective Affiliates
and Representatives) and (b) no party nor any Affiliate of any party hereto
shall, without obtaining prior written approval of Parent (in the case of
Seller and its Affiliates) and Seller (in the case of Parent, Buyer and their
Affiliates), which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, (i) issue any press release or make any public statement with respect
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) make any

Representatives shall be permitted (other than with respect to the initial
press release regarding this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby) to publicly disclose, including through press releases, public filings

with Law, stock exchange compliance and investor relation purposes.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.5 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the essential economic
and legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated
to the greatest extent possible.

 



 

Section 9.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Ancillary
Agreements, the Disclosure Schedule and the Confidentiality Agreement,
constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the

undertakings, both written and oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof, except as otherwise expressly provided herein.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by contract,
operation of Law or otherwise without the consent of Parent and Seller;
_provided_ , _however_ , that without the consent of Seller, Parent or Buyer
(or any permitted assignee of Parent or Buyer) may, by providing written
