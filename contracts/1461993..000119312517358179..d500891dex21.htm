2.5. _Procedures for Assignments_. (a) Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, this Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement to assign or transfer any Transferred Asset if an assignment or
transfer thereof, without the Consent of a Person, would constitute a breach
or violation thereof and such Consent is not obtained at or prior to the
Closing. Sellers will use reasonable best efforts to obtain any Consent
necessary to the assignment or transfer of any Transferred Asset prior to the
Closing and, if the Parties are not successful in obtaining any such Consent
at or prior to the Closing, then the Parties agree that on and after the
Closing, Sellers will continue to use reasonable best efforts to obtain such
Consent; _provided_ , ___however_ , that, except to the extent that Buyer
agrees to reimburse such Seller, in no event shall any Seller be required to
pay any monies to obtain such Consent prior to or after the Closing. Subject
to compliance with the immediately preceding sentence and the terms
and provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, the fact of a failure to obtain any
such Consent shall not result in a breach of this Agreement in any manner
except to the extent inconsistent with the representations and warranties of
Seller Parent contained in _Section_ __ _ 4.4_ and Section 4.4 of the Seller
Disclosure Letter.

 



-31- (b) If the Parties are not successful in transferring or assigning any
Transferred Asset or right, benefit or obligation thereunder or resulting
therefrom at or prior to the Closing in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.5(a)
_and the Closing proceeds without such transfer or assignment, then following
the Closing and pending the receipt of such Consent, the Parties shall
cooperate with each other in any mutually agreeable, reasonable and lawful
arrangements designed to provide Buyer with the benefits and burdens of any
such Transferred Assets and any right, benefit or obligation thereunder or
resulting therefrom as if the appropriate Consent had been obtained, including
provision of the consideration and other economic benefits to be received by
Buyer in and under every Transferred Asset and right, benefit or obligation
thereunder or resulting therefrom, which consideration shall be held for the
benefit of, and shall be promptly delivered to, Buyer and refrain from
agreeing to any amendment, supplement, waiver or other modification of
any Transferred Asset, right, benefit or obligation thereunder or resulting
therefrom, as applicable, without Buyers prior written consent. Once the
applicable Consent for the assignment or transfer of any such Transferred
Asset not assigned or transferred at the Closing is obtained, Sellers shall
assign and transfer such Transferred Asset to Buyer at no additional cost. To
the extent that any such Transferred Asset cannot be transferred or the full
benefits and burdens of use of any such Transferred Asset cannot be provided
to Buyer following the Closing pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, then
Buyer and Seller Parent shall enter into such arrangements (including
subleasing, sublicensing or subcontracting) to provide to the Parties the
economic (taking into account Tax costs and benefits) and operational
equivalent, to the extent permitted, of obtaining such Consent ( _provided_
that, with respect to any such asset that is a Contract, such
obligation shall continue for only so long as the applicable Contract is in
effect). Seller Parent shall hold in trust for and pay to Buyer promptly upon
receipt thereof, all income, proceeds and other monies received by Sellers or
any of their Affiliates in connection with the use of any asset in connection
with the arrangements under this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_. To the extent that
Buyer is provided the benefits of any Transferred Asset or right, benefit or
obligation thereunder or resulting therefrom referred to herein (whether from
Sellers or otherwise) as if the appropriate Consent had been obtained, Buyer
shall arrange to discharge and perform the Liabilities of Sellers thereunder
or in connection therewith, as applicable, to the same extent as if the
appropriate Consent had been obtained.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Party nor any of its respective
Affiliates shall have any obligation to (i) pay sums of money or provide any
guarantee or other consideration, or agree to any undertaking, in connection
with obtaining the Consents referred to in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ or
otherwise agree to any action that would adversely affect any Party or its
Affiliates, or any Partys or its Affiliates businesses or operations, or any
right or obligation of such Party or any of its Affiliates under any Contract
related to such Consents, (ii) waive or discharge any liabilities or
obligations owing to either Party or its Affiliates by any counterparty under
any such Contract, (iii) waive any rights of any Party or its Affiliates
under any such Contracts or (iv) amend, modify, supplement or otherwise change
in any material respect (including any change that adversely affects pricing)
the terms of any such Contract.

 

2.6. _Purchase Price_. (a) In consideration for the sale and transfer of the
Acquired Assets, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Buyer shall assume the Assumed Liabilities at the Closing, as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 2.3_, and shall pay to Seller Parent the following amounts
(collectively, as adjusted pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.3_, the "Purchase

Parent hereunder will reflect the restrictive legends set forth in _Exhibit
F_ at the Closing) (the "Closing Stock Consideration" and, together with the
Closing Cash Consideration, the "Base Consideration").

 

(The Amounts described in clauses (A) and (B) above (as adjusted pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(ii))_, shall constitute the "Closing Payment").

(ii) Not less than three (3) Business Days nor more than five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller Parent shall deliver to Buyer a written
statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement") setting forth, in reasonable
detail, Seller Parents good faith estimate of the Closing Adjustment Amount
(the "Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount"). The Estimated Closing Statement
shall be prepared in the format of _Exhibit_ __ _ E_ (the "Form of Closing
Statement") using GAAP applied in a manner consistent with the Accounting
Principles. If the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount is positive, then the
Closing Payment shall be increased by the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount.
If the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount is negative, then the Closing
Payment shall be reduced by the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount. If the
Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount is zero (0), then the Closing Payment
shall not be adjusted pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(ii)_.

(iii) On the first Business Day following the twelve (12) month anniversary
of the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay to Seller Parent an amount equal to
Twenty Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000) (the "First Deferred Payment").

reduced to an amount equal to twenty five percent (25%) of their original
amounts as of the first day of the calendar quarter following a calendar
quarter for which the Net Sales of such Product during such calendar quarter

conditions set forth below. Seller Parent will provide written notice to Buyer
within ten (10) days of any such sale, assignment, pledge, contribution,

securitization, which written notice will include the name, contact, address
and telephone number of any such purchaser, assignee, pledgee, contributee,
conveyee, grantee or other transferee or party to any financing, monetization

Statements, and other documentation material to a potential transaction with a
Financing Assignee; _provided_ that in advance of, and as a condition to,

in this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ are material conditions of Seller Parents
willingness to enter into this Agreement and consummate the Transactions, and
Seller Parent shall be entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive
relief against any breach or threatened breach of any such covenants. This
_Section_ __ _ 2.7_ shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, Buyer
and its successors and permitted assigns.

 

2.8. _Net Sales Reporting; Royalty Payment Mechanics_.

 

(a) Within ten (10) days following the end of each calendar quarter during the
period during which Royalty Payments may be payable hereunder, Buyer will
provide Seller Parent with a report (the "Net Sales Statement") containing the
following information with respect to any Net Sales of any applicable Product
during such calendar quarter: (i) the number of units of such Product sold in
the applicable territory, (ii) gross sales in the applicable territory, (iii)
the deductions therefrom, (iv) any consideration received by Buyer or any of
its Controlled Affiliates in respect of any Product Transfer (whether upfront
payments, royalty payments, milestone payments or otherwise), (v) the
resulting calculation of Net Sales and (vi) in the case of any Net Sales
Statement in respect of a calendar year end, the resulting calculation of the
Royalty Payments owed to Seller Parent. With respect to each calendar quarter
(or portion thereof), the relevant Royalty Payments for such calendar quarter
shall be paid on the tenth (10th) Business Day after such calendar quarter
(i.e. the tenth (10th) Business Day of the following calendar quarter), with
such payment to be calculated based on gross cash receipts for such calendar
quarter; _provided_ that all payments in respect of any calendar quarter (or
portion thereof) shall be subject to reconciliation based on the final Net
Sales for the applicable calendar quarter (or portion thereof) on the payment
date for the subsequent calendar quarter, with such reconciliation being
prepared by Buyer and delivered to Seller Parent in the form of an updated and
revised Net Sales Statement on such payment date, and thereafter subject to
final reconciliation based on the final Net Sales for the applicable calendar
year in which such calendar quarter occurs based on the audited financial
statements for such calendar year, with such final reconciliation to
be prepared by Buyer and delivered to Seller Parent no later than one hundred
fifty (150) days after the end of such fiscal year. With respect to each
reconciliation, any overpayments shall be credited against, and any
underpayments shall be added to, the subsequent payments in respect of any
Royalty Payments.

(b) Upon Seller Parents reasonable request, Buyer shall provide to Seller
Parent back-up information used to prepare any Net Sales Statement. Buyer
shall keep such records (and shall require its Controlled Affiliates,
licensees, sublicensees, assignees and other transferees to keep such
records) as shall be reasonably necessary to support the calculations of Net
Sales as set forth in each Net Sales Statement. Such records shall be
available for inspection and audit by Seller Parent or its authorized
Representatives, at reasonable times and on reasonable advance notice, for a
period of three (3) years after Seller Parents receipt of any Net Sales
Statement to which such records relate. Each Net Sales Statement and all
records of Buyer, its Controlled Affiliates, licensees, sublicensees,
assignees and other transferees subject to inspection pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.8(b)_ shall be deemed to be Buyer Information subject to the
confidentiality obligations of  _Section_ __ _ 13.3_.

 



-37- (c) If, as a result of any such audit or inspection, Seller Parent reasonably
concludes that Buyer has underreported the Net Sales for any audited period,
Seller Parent shall inform Buyer of the Net Sales for such audited period as
calculated by Seller Parent in a written notice setting forth Seller Parents
calculation of such Net Sales in reasonable detail. In the event Buyer
disputes Seller Parents calculation of Net Sales as set forth in such notice
within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice, Buyer will so notify
Seller Parent in writing within such thirty (30) day period and the Parties
will attempt thereafter to resolve such dispute amicably and, if they cannot
do so by the end of such thirty (30) day period, they will (unless the Parties
mutually agree in writing to continue their efforts to resolve such dispute)
submit the dispute for resolution by the Transaction Arbitrator, with the
procedures set forth in _Sections_ __ _ 3.3(c)-(h)_ relating to the selection
and payment of the Transaction Arbitrator and the resolution of Unresolved
Items applying _mutatis mutandis_ to disputes over Net Sales Statements and
Royalty Payments. If Buyer does not dispute Seller Parents calculation of Net
Sales set forth in such notice within the thirty (30) day period set forth
above, Net Sales for such audited period shall be deemed to be the amount set
forth in such notice and if, based upon such calculation, any additional
amounts are due to Seller Parent in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.6_,
Buyer shall pay such amounts to Seller Parent in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds into an account designated by Seller Parent within
five (5) Business Days after the expiration of the thirty (30) day period set
forth above.

(d) Each Royalty Payment shall be made by electronic transfer in immediately
available funds via either a bank wire transfer, an ACH (automated clearing
house) mechanism, or any other means of electronic funds transfer, at Buyers
election, to such bank account as Seller Parent or, if applicable, the
Financing Assignee shall designate in a notice at least five (5) Business
Days before the payment is due.

(e) All Royalty Payments due under this Agreement shall be made in United
States dollars. Whenever, for the purposes of calculating Royalty Payments,
conversion from any foreign currency will be required, all amounts will first
be calculated in the currency of sale or other compensation and then
converted into United States dollars by applying the monthly average rate of
exchange calculated by using the foreign exchange rates published in Bloomberg
during the applicable month starting two (2) Business Days before the
beginning of such month and ending two (2) Business Days before the end of
such month, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
fairly applied and as employed on a consistent basis throughout Buyers
operations. For the avoidance of doubt, for all purposes in this Agreement,
any hedging or derivatives transaction engaged in by Buyer with respect to
sales of Products shall be disregarded.

 

(f) If any Royalty Payment owed to Seller Parent under this Agreement is not
paid by Buyer within a reasonable amount of time, in any event not to exceed
thirty (30) days, following the due date of such payment, then Buyer shall pay
interest on the undisputed and unpaid portion thereof at the Prime Rate as
published in the Wall Street Journal (New York edition), or if lower,
the maximum interest rate permitted under applicable Law, such interest to
run from the date upon which payment of such undisputed amount became due
until payment in full of the undisputed and unpaid portion thereof.

 



-38- 2.9. _Commercialization Efforts; Royalty Covenants_. (a) From and after the
Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) use
commercially reasonable efforts to develop, promote, market, sell, distribute
and commercialize Vabomere, Orbactiv and Minocin IV in the United States with
a view towards maximizing Net Sales of such Products in the United States
and, with respect to Products sold outside the United States, use commercially
reasonable efforts to pursue agreements with third parties with a view towards
maximizing Net Sales of such Products outside the United States and (ii) not
take any action, or omit to take any action, a primary purpose of which is to
reduce the amount of Royalty Payments otherwise due to Seller Parent. It is
understood and agreed that a Product Transfer (as defined below) will not
relieve Buyer of its obligation under this _Section_ __ _ 2.9(a)_; _provided_
, that, for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 2.9(a)_, the activities of Buyer
and each transferee in a Product Transfer shall be attributed to Buyer for
the purposes of determining Buyers satisfaction of the foregoing obligations.

(b) Buyer and its Affiliates may not, directly or indirectly, by a sale or
swap of assets, merger, reorganization, joint venture, lease, license,
sublicense or any other transaction or arrangement, sell, transfer, license,
sublicense, convey or otherwise dispose of all or a portion of their
respective rights in and to Vabomere, Orbactiv or Minocin IV to a third party
(other than Buyer or its Affiliates) (collectively, a "Product Transfer"),
unless the contract for such sale, transfer, license, conveyance or other
disposition (which Buyer shall take all commercially reasonable actions
necessary to enforce in all material respects) shall require the transferee to
comply with the covenants in _Sections 2.7_ ,  _2.8_ , _2.9(a)_ and _2.9(b)_
, and to provide Buyer with all information necessary to calculate Net Sales
with respect to such Product.

 

(c) Buyer shall give Seller Parent written notice of any Product Transfer or
distribution arrangement within ten (10) Business Days after consummation
thereof, which notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of such
Product Transfer or distribution arrangement, including the products and
countries or territories subject to such Product Transfer or distribution
arrangement and all consideration, whether guaranteed or contingent, paid or
payable to or on behalf of Buyer and its Affiliates in connection therewith.

 

(d) Buyer (and its Controlled Affiliates and permitted successors and assigns)
shall not engage in any Product Transfer that would result in the sale,
conveyance, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of
Buyers and its Affiliates rights covering Vabomere, Orbactiv or Minocin IV
to an unaffiliated third party, through one or more transactions or a series
of transactions (including by merger or consolidation or otherwise by
operation of law), unless, and as a condition thereto, the transferee or
successor assumes and succeeds to all of the obligations of Buyer set forth in
this  _Section_ __ _ 2.9_, _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(v)_ and _Section_ __ _
2.8_ and prior to or simultaneously with such transaction delivers to Seller
Parent an instrument of assumption for the benefit of Seller Parent and its
Affiliates, and in form reasonably acceptable to Seller Parent, effecting such
assumption and succession. Any such Product Transfer will not release Buyer
from its obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 2.9_, _Section_ __ _
2.6(a)(v)_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.8_.

 



-39- (e) For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 2.9_,  _Section_ __ _ 2.7_,
_Section_ __ _ 2.8_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ (and any definition used
therein), "Products", "Vabomere", "Orbactiv" and "Minocin IV" mean,
collectively, the Products, Vabomere, Orbactiv or Minocin IV, as the case may
be, and any alternate forms or formulations thereof developed after the
Closing Date by Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective
licensees, sublicensees or other transferees based on or derived in any
material respect from the Transferred Intellectual Property or Intellectual
Property of the Transferred Group.

 

2.10. _Ticking Fee_. If the conditions set forth in _Section10.3_ (other than
those conditions which are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been
satisfied or waived and the Closing Date does not occur on or prior to the
date which is sixty (60) days following the date that Seller Parent delivers
the Required Financial Information to Buyer (the "Ticking Fee Start Date"),
on the first (1st) Business Day following such Ticking Fee Start Date, Buyer
shall pay to Seller Parent the Weekly Ticking Fee. Buyer shall continue to pay
the Weekly Ticking Fee every seventh (7th) calendar day following the Ticking
Fee Start Date (unless such date is not a Business Day, in which case the
relevant Weekly Ticking Fee will be paid on the first Business Day following
the date upon which the Weekly Ticking Fee becomes due and payable) until the
earlier of (i) the Closing Date or (ii) the date upon which this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to ARTICLE XI (such earlier date, the "Ticking Fee End
Date"). If the Ticking Fee End Date is the Closing Date, at the Closing,
Buyer shall pay the Final Ticking Fee in accordance with _Section_ __ _
3.2(b)(iii)_. If the Ticking Fee End Date is not the Closing Date, Buyer shall
pay the Final Ticking Fee on the second (2nd) Business Day following the
Ticking Fee End Date. If the Closing Date occurs fewer than seven (7) calendar
days following the Ticking Fee Start Date, the Closing Payment shall be
reduced by an amount equal to one seventh (1/7th) of the Weekly Ticking Fee
_multiplied_ by the number obtained by _subtracting_ (A) the number of days
which have elapsed between the Ticking Fee Start Date and the Closing Date
(inclusive) from (B) seven (7). All Ticking Fees shall be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller
Parent not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the date upon which the
relevant Ticking Fee becomes due and payable.

 

2.11. _Purchase Price Allocation_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that the Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities
(plus other relevant items) will be allocated to the Acquired Assets in a
manner consistent with the Allocation Laws. Seller Parent will complete a
draft schedule (the "Allocation Schedule") (A) that allocates the Purchase
Price and Assumed Liabilities (plus other relevant items) consistent
with Section 1060 of the Code (i) to the Acquired Assets (other than the
Transferred Entities) and (ii) to each of the Transferred Entities, and (B)
that further allocates the amount allocated to each Transferred Entity among
the assets of the Transferred Group consistent with Sections 338 and 1060 of
the Code, if applicable. Seller Parent shall provide a copy of the Allocation
Schedule to Buyer at least sixty (60) days prior to the due date for filing
any form with respect to the Allocation Schedule.

(b) Unless Buyer notifies Seller Parent in writing within thirty (30) days
after the receipt of the draft Allocation Schedule, Buyer shall be deemed to
have agreed to the Allocation Schedule as prepared by Seller Parent. If Buyer
disputes any portion of the Allocation Schedule, Buyer shall provide an
alternative draft Allocation Schedule together with reasons for the
deviations from the draft Allocation Schedule prepared by Seller Parent. The
Parties shall attempt to resolve any disagreement in good faith. If Seller
Parent and Buyer fail to reach agreement as to an alternative allocation in
the ten (10) days following such notice, the

 



-40-  dispute with respect to the Allocation Schedule shall be presented on the
next Business Day to the Independent Accountant. The Independent Accountants
review shall be final and binding on all parties. Buyer and Seller Parent, in
respect of Sellers, shall each bear the respective fees and costs incurred by
the Parties in connection with the matters set forth in this _Section_ __ _
2.11(b)_, except that the fees and disbursements of the Independent
Accountant shall be paid by Buyer or Seller Parent in proportion to those
matters submitted to the Independent Accountant that are resolved against
Buyer or Seller Parent, as applicable, as such fees and disbursements are
allocated by the Independent Accountant pursuant to the foregoing.

(c) Buyer and Seller Parent each shall report all Taxes and file all Tax
Returns (including amended Tax Returns and claims for refund) consistent with
the Allocation Schedule and shall take no position inconsistent therewith
(including in any audits or examinations by any Taxing Authority),
unless, and then only to the extent, required by a Final Determination. Buyer
and Seller Parent shall exchange completed and executed forms required by
applicable Law with respect to the allocation (including IRS Form 8594) at
least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such forms and shall
cooperate in the filing of any such forms, including any amendments to such
forms required as a result of any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to
this Agreement.

 

(d) With respect to any payments made hereunder after the Allocation Schedule
shall have become final (including, without limitation, payments of the
Deferred Payments and any Royalty Payment), Buyer and Seller Parent shall
cooperate to prepare additional schedules setting forth adjustments to the
Allocation Schedule. The same procedures and obligations that are imposed
hereunder with respect to the Allocation Schedule shall apply to such
additional schedules.

2.12. _Withholding_. Buyer and any other applicable withholding agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to or as
contemplated by this Agreement any withholding Taxes or other amounts required
under the Code or any applicable Law to be deducted or withheld. To the
extent that any such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

3.3. _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 

(a) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to Seller Parent a statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth
in reasonable detail Buyers calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital

(b) If Seller Parent disputes the Closing Statement prepared by Buyer, Seller

Closing Statement a notice setting forth Seller Parents calculation of the
Closing Date Working Capital and its resulting calculation of the Closing
Adjustment Amount (which shall be calculated in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 3.3(a)_) and describing in detail the basis for the determination of such
different amount (such notice, the "Dispute Notice", and each item in
dispute, a "Disputed Item"). Buyer and Seller Parent shall use reasonable
efforts to resolve the Disputed Items for a period of thirty (30) days after
Seller Parent has given the Dispute Notice.

 

(c) If Buyer and Seller Parent have not resolved all of the Disputed Items

days after the expiration of such period, Buyer and Seller Parent shall submit
the Unresolved Items to a jointly appointed independent and impartial
certified public accountant who is a partner at a neutral nationally
recognized accounting firm in the United States that is not the auditor or
independent accounting firm of, and is otherwise independent of, the Parties
and any of their respective Affiliates (the "Transaction Arbitrator") for
final and binding arbitration. If the Parties are unable to timely appoint a
Transaction Arbitrator within fifteen (15) days of the expiration of the
thirty (30) day resolution period described above, either Buyer or Seller
Parent may request that the American Arbitration Association appoint the
Transaction Arbitrator. Buyer and Seller Parent shall each bear the respective
fees and costs incurred by it and its respective Affiliates in connection
with the matters set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 3.3(c)_, except that the

(d) The Transaction Arbitrator shall review and determine the Unresolved
Items, and only the Unresolved Items, in a manner consistent with this 
_Section_ __ _ 3.3(d)_ and the Accounting Principles. The review and
determination shall be based solely on the grounds presented by Buyer and
Seller Parent. In no event shall the Transaction Arbitrators determination of
an Unresolved Item be for an amount outside the ranges proposed by Buyer and
Seller Parent in the Closing Statement and the Dispute Notice, respectively.

 



-43- (e) Within ten (10) days after the appointment of the Transaction Arbitrator,
Buyer and Seller Parent shall provide to the Transaction Arbitrator a copy of
the Closing Statement and Dispute Notice, and shall each provide to the
Transaction Arbitrator, with a copy to the other Party, a written report that
states for each Unresolved Item the dollar amount in dispute, a narrative
description of how the dollar amount was calculated or derived by such Party,
if applicable, and an explanation of the rationale for such Partys position;
_provided_ that each such report shall be consistent with the Closing
Statement (in the case of Buyer) and the Dispute Notice (in the case of Seller
Parent). Buyer and Seller Parent shall reasonably cooperate with the
Transaction Arbitrator and shall provide to the Transaction Arbitrator and to
each other, upon the request of the Transaction Arbitrator and in each case to
the extent required to complete its review of the Unresolved Items, any non-
privileged information and documentation, including any accountants work
papers or internal accounting records, and make reasonably available to the
Transaction Arbitrator employees of Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller Parent,
on the other hand, in each case that have been involved in the preparation or
review of the Closing Statement and Dispute Notice; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the __ independent accountants of Seller Parent or Buyer shall not be
obligated to make any working papers available to the Transaction Arbitrator
unless and until the Transaction Arbitrator has signed a customary
confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such access to working
papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such
independent accountants. Neither Buyer, on the one hand, nor Seller Parent,
on the other hand, shall disclose to the Transaction Arbitrator, and the
Transaction Arbitrator shall not consider for any purpose, any settlement
discussions or settlement offer made by Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller
Parent, on the other hand, with respect to any objection under this _Section_
__ _ 3.3_, unless otherwise agreed in writing by Buyer and Seller Parent.

 

(f) The place of arbitration shall be New York, New York.

 

(g) Buyer and Seller Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause
the Transaction Arbitrator to issue its final written award regarding the
Unresolved Items within thirty (30) days after such items are submitted for
review, and otherwise as soon as practicable. The award shall include a
reasonably detailed explanation of the changes, if any, required to be made to
the Closing Statement. The award shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration
Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1\. The award shall be final and binding upon the Parties and
may be enforced in any court having jurisdiction; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that within seven (7) days after transmittal by the Transaction Arbitrator of
the award, either Party may request in writing with a copy to the other Party,
that the Transaction Arbitrator correct any clerical, typographical
or computational errors in the award. The other Party shall have seven (7)
days to respond and the Transaction Arbitrator shall dispose of the request
within five (5) days after such seven (7) day period, after which the
Closing Statement shall be revised.

(h) Each Party shall provide promptly to the other Party all non-privileged
information and reasonable access to employees as such other Party shall
reasonably request to the extent required to complete its review of the
Closing Statement or the Dispute Notice, as the case may be, including all
work papers of the accountants who audited, compiled or reviewed such
statements or notices, and shall otherwise cooperate in good faith with such
other Party to arrive at a final determination of the Closing Statement; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the independent accountants of the non-
requesting Party shall not be obligated to make any working papers available
to the requesting Party unless and until such requesting Party has signed a
customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such access
to working papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such
independent accountants.

 



-44- (i) The Parties agree that the procedures set forth in this _Section_ __ _
3.3_ for resolving disputes with respect to the Closing Statement shall be
the sole and exclusive method for resolving any such disputes, _provided_ that
this provision shall not prohibit any Party from instituting litigation to
enforce the ruling of the Transaction Arbitrator.

(j) If Buyer and Seller Parent resolve the Disputed Items during the thirty
(30) day period referred to in _Section_ __ _ 3.3(b)_, the Closing
Adjustment Amount agreed to by the Parties shall be deemed to be the "Final
Closing Adjustment Amount" and the Closing Statement agreed to by the Parties
shall be deemed to be the "Final Closing Statement." If Buyer and Seller
Parent do not so resolve the Disputed Items and the Unresolved Items are
submitted to the Transaction Arbitrator, the Closing Adjustment Amount
determined by the Transaction Arbitrator pursuant to the terms of this
_Section_ __ _ 3.3_ shall be deemed to be the "Final Closing Adjustment
Amount" and the Closing Statement so determined by the Transaction Arbitrator
shall be deemed to be the "Final Closing Statement." If Seller Parent does
not timely deliver a Dispute Notice to Buyer, then the Closing Adjustment
Amount proposed by Buyer in its Closing Statement shall be deemed to be the
"Final Closing Adjustment Amount" and shall be conclusive and binding on the
Parties, absent fraud or manifest error.

(k) If the Final Closing Adjustment Amount is less than the Estimated Closing
Adjustment Amount, then Seller Parent shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to
the difference between the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount and the Final
Closing Adjustment Amount. If the Final Closing Adjustment Amount is greater
than the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount, then Buyer shall pay to Seller
Parent an amount equal to the difference between the Final Closing Adjustment
Amount and the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount. If the Final Closing
Adjustment Amount is equal to the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount, then no
payment shall be due under this _Section_ __ _ 3.3(k)_. Any amounts due
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.3(k)_ shall be paid promptly by the
relevant party (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) after the
final determination thereof in cash in U.S. Dollars by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller Parent or
Buyer (as applicable) at least two (2) Business Days in advance.

ARTICLE IV.

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER PARENT

 

Except as disclosed in the disclosure letter delivered by Seller Parent to
Buyer immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Seller

is (i) a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing

and each such Ancillary Agreement, the performance by Seller Parent of its
obligations hereunder and thereunder and the consummation by Seller Parent of

each case enforceable against Seller Parent or the applicable other Seller in
accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or similar laws
affecting creditors rights generally or by general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or

the date hereof, among Deerfield Private Design Fund IV, L.P. (together with
its officers, employees, directors, affiliates, partners, controlling
parties, advisors, agents and representatives, the "Debt Financing Sources"
and, together with the Equity Financing Sources, the "Financing Sources") and
Buyer, together with each related fee letter (with customary redactions only
with respect to fee amounts and the economic terms of the "market flex"
provisions and nothing which would affect the amount or availability of the
Debt Financing) (collectively, the "Debt Commitment Letter" and, together
with the Equity Commitment Letters, the "Commitment Letters"), and (iii) all
registration rights agreements and other agreements entered into by the Equity
Financing Sources in connection with the Transactions. The Commitment Letters
will provide financing in an aggregate amount set forth therein, and subject
to the terms and conditions set forth therein (the "Financing"). The
Equity Commitment Letters provide that Seller Parent is a third-party
beneficiary thereof. As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letters
have not been amended or modified in any manner, and, to Buyers Knowledge, no
amendment or modification of the Commitment Letters is contemplated. As of
the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letters have not been terminated,
reduced, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect and, to Buyers Knowledge, as
of the date of this Agreement, no such termination, reduction, withdrawal or
rescission is contemplated. Buyer has paid in full any all fees, expenses and
other amounts in connection with the Commitment Letters that are payable on or
prior to the date of this Agreement and, as of the date of this Agreement,
the Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and are the valid,

 



-67-  binding and enforceable (in accordance with their terms) obligations of
Buyer and, to Buyers Knowledge, as of the date hereof, the other parties
thereto, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and similar Laws affecting creditors rights and remedies generally.
Buyer is unaware of any fact or occurrence existing on the date of this
Agreement that would reasonably be expected to make any of the assumptions or
any of the statements set forth in the Commitment Letters to be incorrect or
ineffective. Assuming compliance by Sellers of their obligations under this
Agreement (including cooperation and assistance by Sellers with respect to
the Debt Financing) and based upon facts and events known by Buyer as of the
date of this Agreement, Buyer believes that the conditions to the funding
contemplated by the Commitment Letters will be satisfied, and Buyer is not
aware of the existence of any fact or event as of the date of this Agreement
that would reasonably be expected to cause such conditions to funding not to
be satisfied. There are no conditions precedent to the funding of the full
amount of the Financing, other than as set forth in the Commitment Letters.
The net proceeds contemplated by the Commitment Letters, together with
available cash on hand at Buyer and its Controlled Affiliates, will, in the
aggregate, be sufficient for Buyer to pay all of the Guaranteed Payments and
all related fees and expenses required to be paid as of the Closing by Buyer.
As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters, understandings or
other agreements, contracts or arrangements of any kind relating to
the Commitment Letters that could affect the amount or availability of the
Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters. There are no conditions
precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount (or
any portion) of the Financing (including any condition relating to the
availability of the Debt Financing relating to any "flex" provision), other
than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters delivered to Seller
Parent pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.12_. As of the date of this
Agreement and assuming the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by
Law) of the conditions to Buyers obligation to consummate the Transactions,
(a) no event has occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of time or
both) could constitute a default or breach or failure to satisfy a condition
by Buyer under the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letters and (b)
Buyer does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Financing will not be satisfied by Buyer on a timely basis or that the
Financing will not be available to Buyer on the date of the Closing. For the
avoidance of doubt, it is not a condition to Closing under this Agreement for
Buyer to obtain the Financing or any Alternative Financing.

5.13. _Brokers_. No broker, investment banker, agent, finder or other
intermediary acting on behalf of Buyer or under the authority of Buyer is or
shall be entitled to any brokers or finders fee or any other commission or
similar fee directly or indirectly in connection with any of
the Transactions.

5.14. _Condition of the Business_. Buyer acknowledges that it is a
sophisticated purchaser and, together with its Controlled Affiliates and
Representatives, has made its own investigation, review and analysis regarding
the Business, the Transferred Group, the Acquired Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities and the Transactions. Buyer acknowledges that none of
Seller Parent, its Affiliates or Representatives is making, and Buyer is not
relying on, any statement, representation or warranty, oral or written,
express or implied, regarding the Business, the Transferred Group, the
Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, except as expressly set forth in
_Article IV_. Buyer is not relying on, and none of Seller Parent or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives shall have any liability to Buyer or any of its
Controlled Affiliates or Representatives pursuant to this Agreement in
connection with the use of, any information,

 



-68-  documents or materials made available to Buyer or its Controlled Affiliates
or Representatives, whether orally or in writing, in any confidential
information memoranda, "virtual data rooms," management presentations,
projections, due diligence discussions, or in any other form in expectation of
the Transactions, except to the extent representations with respect to such
information, documents or materials are expressly made in _ARTICLE IV_.

-71- 6.2. _Antitrust Filings and Actions_.

 

(a) _Filings and Other Actions_. Subject to the other terms of this Agreement,
Seller Parent and Buyer shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall
cause their respective Controlled Affiliates to cooperate and use) their
respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all reasonable
actions, and to do or cause to be done all reasonable things necessary, proper
or advisable on its part under this Agreement and applicable Law to
consummate and make effective the Transactions as soon as reasonably
practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as reasonably
practicable and advisable all documentation to effect all necessary notices,
reports and other filings and to obtain as promptly as reasonably practicable
all Consents necessary or advisable to be obtained from any Person, including
any Governmental Authority, and to lift any injunction or other legal bar in
order to consummate the Transactions. Without limiting the foregoing, each of
Seller Parent and Buyer undertakes and agrees to file (or cause their
respective Controlled Affiliates to file, as applicable) as soon as
reasonably practicable and advisable, and in any event not later than five
(5) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, a Notification and Report
Form regarding the Transactions as and to the extent required by the HSR Act
(the "HSR Filing") with each of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC")
and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the "Antitrust
Division") and to as soon as reasonably practicable and advisable submit any
other filings required to be made under any Foreign Antitrust Laws. Each of
Seller Parent and Buyer shall (and shall cause their respective Controlled
Affiliates to) (i) respond as promptly as reasonably practicable
and advisable to any inquiries received from any Governmental Authority for
additional information or documentation and to all inquiries and requests
received from any Governmental Authority in connection with antitrust matters
and (ii) not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or any Foreign
Antitrust Laws or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Authority to
delay the Transactions, except with the prior written consent of the other
Party. Buyer and Seller Parent shall (and shall cause each of their
respective Controlled Affiliates to) to take all steps requested by the FTC,
the Antitrust Division or other Governmental Authority to avoid or eliminate
impediments under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by a Governmental
Authority with respect to the Transactions so as to enable the Closing to
occur as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event prior to the Outside
Date, and shall defend through litigation on the merits any Claim in respect
of Antitrust Laws asserted in any court by any Governmental Authority,
including appeals. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall (and shall
cause each of its Controlled Affiliates to) propose, negotiate and offer to
commit and effect (and, if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect) by

of Buyer (or such Controlled Affiliates) or of any of the Acquired Assets,
terminate any existing relationships or contractual rights of Buyer or the
Acquired Assets, amend or terminate any licenses or other intellectual
property agreements of Buyer or the Acquired Assets, or otherwise offer to
take or offer to commit to take any action and, if the offer is accepted,
commit to take and take such action that limits its freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, services or
assets of Buyer (or such Controlled Affiliates) or any of the Acquired
Assets, in each case, to the extent necessary so as to permit and cause the
condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 10.1(b)_ to be satisfied as soon as
reasonably practicable, 

 



-72-  and in any event prior to the Outside Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in no event shall Buyer or any of its Controlled Affiliates be required to
take or agree to take any such action that is not conditioned on the
occurrence of the Closing or that, individually or together with any other
such actions, would reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse
Effect, it being understood and agreed that, for purposes of this
sentence, the reference to Buyer and its Subsidiaries in clause (x) of the
definition of "Buyer Material Adverse Effect" shall be deemed to include
Buyer, its Subsidiaries and the Acquired Assets, taken as a whole. Each of
Buyer and Seller Parent shall promptly notify the other of any written
communication to that Party from a Governmental Authority or any other Person
(whether or not a Governmental Authority) in connection with antitrust matters
relating to the Transactions and, subject to applicable Law, and the
instructions of any Governmental Authority, permit the other to review in
advance any material proposed written communication to any of the foregoing.

 

(b) _Cooperation_. Buyer shall control all communications with any
Governmental Authority relating to Antitrust Laws, and determine and direct
the strategy and process by which the Parties will seek required approvals
relating to Antitrust Laws, strategy or process. Each of Buyer and Seller
Parent shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other (or its outside
counsel, where appropriate) with all information concerning itself, its
Controlled Affiliates and their respective directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any statement, filing, notice or application
made by or on behalf of a Party or any of their respective Controlled
Affiliates to any Person, including any Governmental Authority, in connection
with the Transactions insofar as they pertain to antitrust matters. Buyer
shall consult with Seller Parent in connection with any communication,
statement, filing, notice or application contemplated by this Section 6.2(b)
and take into consideration in good faith any comments that Seller Parent may
provide with respect thereto.

(c) _Notification_. Subject to applicable Law and the instructions of any
Governmental Authority, and except as necessary to preserve any applicable
legal privilege, each of Buyer and Seller Parent shall keep the other apprised
of the status of matters in connection with Antitrust Laws relating to
consummation of the Transactions, including promptly furnishing the
other with copies of notices or other communications received by it, or by
any of its Controlled Affiliates, from any Person, including any Governmental
Authority, with respect to the Transactions insofar as they pertain to
antitrust matters.

 

(d) _Meetings_. Subject to applicable Law, neither Seller Parent nor Buyer
(nor any of their respective Controlled Affiliates) shall, nor shall they
permit any of their respective Representatives to, participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority with
jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable Antitrust Law ("Government
Antitrust Authority") in respect of any filings, investigation or other
inquiry unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Government Antitrust Authority, gives the other Party the
opportunity to attend and participate.

(e) _Other Actions_. Without limiting the generality of the undertakings
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, each Party agrees to take or cause to
be taken the following actions: (i) the prompt provision to each and every
foreign, federal, state or local court or any other Governmental Authority of
non-privileged information and documents reasonably requested by

 



-73-  any of them or that are necessary, proper or advisable to permit
consummation of the Transactions; and (ii) the use of its reasonable best
efforts to avoid the entry of any permanent, preliminary or temporary
injunction or other Order, decree, decision, determination or judgment that
would restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
Transactions by the Outside Date. The Parties obligations under this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_ shall include the obligation to use its reasonable best
efforts to defend against any lawsuits or other legal Proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging the consummation of the
Transactions, including seeking to have any stay or other injunctive relief
which would prevent or impair the consummation of the Transactions by the
Outside Date entered by any court or other Governmental Authority reversed on
appeal or vacated. The Parties agree that, if advisable to facilitate
obtaining the Consent of any Governmental Authority that is a condition to
Closing, the Parties shall promptly meet and use their good faith efforts to
agree to a modification or modifications to the terms of this Agreement
and/or any Ancillary Agreement that the Parties agree will facilitate
obtaining such Consent, _provided_ such modifications in the aggregate shall
not alter the economic value of the Transactions other than in
immaterial respects.

(f) _No Adverse Actions_. Buyer and Seller Parent shall not, and each shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, acquire, purchase,
lease or license (or agree to acquire, purchase, lease or license), by merging
with or into or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of
the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any business or any
corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or
division or part thereof, or any securities or collection of assets, if doing
so would reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any material delay in
the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any
Consent, approval or exemption of any Governmental Authority necessary to
consummate the Transactions or the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period under applicable Law; (ii) materially increase the risk of any
Governmental Authority entering any judgment, decree, injunction or other
Order prohibiting the Transactions; (iii) materially increase the risk of not
being able to remove any such judgment, decree, injunction or other Order on
appeal or otherwise; or (iv) restrict, prevent, prohibit, impede or delay the
consummation of the Transactions.

 

(g) _Fees and Expenses_. Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of all
filing fees in connection with the filings made pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 6.2_.

6.3. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and without limiting the express obligations hereunder, each
of the Parties agrees to cooperate fully with each other and to use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
and make effective, at the time and in the manner contemplated by this
Agreement, and the Transactions, including to (i) make and obtain all Consents
required under applicable Laws, and (ii) execute and deliver such documents
and other papers and any other agreements, in each case as may be necessary
to, as soon as practicable, carry out the provisions of this Agreement and
consummate and make effective the Transactions. At the Closing, Buyer shall,
and shall cause each of its applicable Subsidiaries to, execute and deliver
each Ancillary Agreement, and Seller Parent shall, and shall cause each of its
applicable Subsidiaries to, execute and deliver each Ancillary Agreement, in
each case to which it is a party.

 



-74- (b) From time to time following the Closing, as and when requested by a Party,
the other Party shall, and shall cause its Controlled Affiliates to, at the
requesting Partys expense (except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement), execute such Transfer Documents (including such instruments of
assignment as may be necessary in order to have the assignment of the
Transferred Intellectual Property recorded in the name of Buyer or a
Controlled Affiliate of Buyer at the relevant patent and trademark offices)
and take such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the
provisions hereof and consummate and evidence the Transactions, including
executing and delivering or causing to be executed and delivered to such Party
such Transfer Documents as such Party or its counsel may reasonably request as
necessary for such purpose and using reasonable best efforts remove any
Permitted Liens described in clause (a) or (b) of such definition on any
Transferred Assets.

 

6.4. _Access; Confidentiality_. During the Pre-Closing Period, Seller Parent
and its Subsidiaries shall and shall cause their Representatives to, upon
reasonable prior notice, free of charge, give Buyer and its authorized
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the
Contracts, Books and Records, analysis, projections, plans, systems,
management and other personnel, Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries
Representatives, offices and other facilities and properties, in each case to
the extent related to the Business (including the Business Employees),
the Transferred Group, the Transferred Group Assets, the Acquired Assets or
the Assumed Liabilities; _provided_ __ that Buyer and its Representatives
shall not interfere unreasonably with the business and operations of Sellers
and the Transferred Group. The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
apply to any information provided to Buyer and its Representatives pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, no Seller shall be required to provide access to, or to disclose
information, where such access or disclosure would (a) jeopardize the
attorney-client or other legal privilege of such Seller, (b) contravene any
applicable Law (including any applicable law related to the confidentiality
of individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other
personnel-related information), or (c) give a third party the right to
terminate or accelerate the rights under a Contract to which Seller Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound; _provided_ __ that in
each case, Seller Parent shall: (i) give reasonable notice to Buyer of the
fact that it is restricting or otherwise prohibiting access to any documents
or information pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_, (ii) inform Buyer with
sufficient detail of the reason for such restriction or prohibition, and (iii)
cause the applicable Seller to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
documents or information that are subject to such restriction or prohibition
to be provided in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to violate
such restriction or prohibition, including using reasonable best efforts to
obtain a waiver of any such Liability or third party right.

6.5. _Shared Contracts_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b) _below, for a period of ninety (90) days
following the Closing Date, Seller Parent shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with Buyer to the extent reasonably
requested by Buyer to cause the counterparty to any Shared Contract material
to the Business to enter into a new agreement with Buyer (or, at Buyers
option, the Transferred Group, as appropriate) with respect to the matters
addressed by such Shared Contract that are related to the Business; _provided_
, that neither Seller Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required
to compromise any right, asset or benefit or expend any amount or incur any
liabilities or provide any other consideration in connection therewith.

period of one (1) year following the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller Parent
shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate

provisions of such contract that are related to Vabomere; _provided_ , that
neither Seller Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
compromise any right, asset or benefit or expend any amount or incur any

are related to Vabomere, any remaining obligation to make the Milestone
Payment in respect of Milestone #6 (as defined in the Rempex Merger Agreement
as defined in _Schedule 1.1(d)_ ) shall, from and after the date of such
agreement, be deemed an Assumed Liability hereunder.

 

6.6. _Financing_.

(a) Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Commitment Letters and shall not permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, any replacement of all or a portion of any
facilities (or commitments thereof) described in, or any waiver of any
provisions under, the Commitment Letters without the prior written consent of
Seller Parent, if such amendment, modification, replacement or waiver (i)
reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing to an amount below the amount
required, to consummate the Transactions, including the payment of all fees,
premiums and expenses associated therewith, (ii) imposes additional conditions
or any contingencies or otherwise expands upon, amends or otherwise modifies
any of the conditions to the receipt of any portion of the Financing in a
manner that would or would reasonably be expected to make any portion of the
funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
Financing) less likely to be obtained, (iii) prevents, impedes or delays the
occurrence of Closing, (iv) adversely impacts the ability of Buyer to enforce
its rights against any other party to any Commitment Letter or the Definitive
Agreements or (v) adversely impacts the ability of Buyer to consummate the
Transactions. For purposes of this Agreement, (1) the term "Financing" shall
be deemed to include the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters as
amended, modified or replaced pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_
(including any Alternative Financing used to satisfy the obligations under
this Agreement), and (2) the term "Commitment Letters" shall be deemed to
include the Commitment Letters as may be amended or modified pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ and any commitment letters with respect to the
Alternative Financing. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that neither the
obtaining of the Financing or any Alternative Financing is a condition to
Buyers obligations to consummate the Transactions and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



-76- (b) Buyer shall comply with the interim operating covenants described in
Section 3 of the Debt Commitment Letter and use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing
on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letters, including
using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letters
pursuant to their terms (except for amendments not prohibited by _Section_ __
_ 6.6(a))_ until the Transactions are consummated or this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms, (ii) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to the Financing on the terms and
conditions contained in the Commitment Letters (including any "flex"
provisions) or on other terms not materially less favorable, in the aggregate,
to Buyer (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Buyer) than the terms
and conditions contained in the Commitment Letters (such definitive
agreements, the "Definitive Agreements"), and do not expand upon the
conditions precedent set forth in the Commitment Letters in a manner that
would reasonably be expected to make any portion of the funding of
the Financing less likely to be obtained or prevent, impede or delay the
funding of the Financing and, upon execution thereof, deliver a copy thereof
to Seller Parent, (iii) satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by Buyer, seek a
waiver on a timely basis of) all covenants, other obligations and conditions
to funding in the Commitment Letters that are required to be satisfied by it
and, in the event that all conditions to funding in the Commitment Letters and
the Definitive Agreements are satisfied at or prior to the Closing,
consummate the Financing at the Closing in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Commitment Letters as in effect at or prior to the Closing
and (iv) enforce its rights, including through litigation, under the
Commitment Letters and the Definitive Agreements in the event of a failure to

Buyer shall provide the funding notice specified in Section 12 of Annex I to
Annex A of the Debt Commitment Letter not later than the Mailing Date.

(c) In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letters or Buyer
becomes aware of any event or circumstance that makes any portion of the
Financing unavailable, in each case, on the terms and conditions contemplated
in the Commitment Letters and such portion is reasonably required to
consummate the Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller Parent and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange alternative financing as promptly as
practicable from the same or alternative sources in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated under this Agreement (the
"Alternative Financing") and all references to Financing shall be deemed
to include such Alternative Financing and all references to the Commitment
Letters and Definitive Agreements shall include the applicable documents for
the Alternative Financing; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) Buyer shall not
be required to obtain financing which includes terms and conditions less
favorable (taking into account any "market flex" provision) to Buyer, taken as
a whole, relative to those in the Financing being replaced and (y) such
Alternative Financing shall comply with the provisions of _Section_ __ _
6.6(a)_. Buyer shall give Seller Parent prompt oral and written notice of any
material breach or default by any party to any Commitment Letter or Definitive
Agreement of which Buyer becomes aware or any termination or waiver,
amendment or other modification of any Commitment Letter or Definitive
Agreement. Buyer shall keep Seller Parent reasonably informed of the status of
its effort to arrange the Financing and shall provide to Seller Parent copies
of all material, final definitive documents related to the Financing
(excluding fee letters, except to the extent that such documents contain any
conditions to funding or other substantive provisions regarding the terms and
conditions of the Financing). In the event that Buyer commences an enforcement
action to enforce its rights under any Commitment Letter or Definitive
Agreement and/or cause any Financing Source to fund the Financing, Buyer shall
keep Seller Parent reasonably informed of the status of such enforcement
action.

 



-77- (d) During the Pre-Closing Period, Seller Parent will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide, and cause its Affiliates to provide, to Buyer

precedent to the Financing or set forth in any Definitive Agreement, to the
extent within the control of Seller Parent or its Affiliates, and taking all

business and operations of Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates, (2) none
of Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates or any of its and its respective
Affiliates respective officers, directors, employees, accountants,
consultants, legal counsel, agents, investment bankers and
other representatives shall be required to bear any cost or expense, pay any
commitment or other fee or incur any other liability or obligation or agree to
provide any indemnity in connection with the Financing (except to the extent
Buyer promptly reimburses (in the case of ordinary course out-of-pocket costs
and expenses) or provides the funding (in all other cases) to Seller Parent or
such Affiliate therefor), (3) none of Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates
or any of its and its respective Affiliates respective officers, directors or
employees shall be required to execute or enter into or perform any agreement,
document or instrument, deliver any certificate or opinion or take any
corporate or other organizational action (including the adoption of any
resolutions) to authorize the execution, entering into or performance of any
such agreement, document or instrument, in either case, with respect to the
Financing, (4) such assistance shall not include any actions that cause any
representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation in this Agreement to be
breached by Seller Parent, or any condition to the Closing hereunder to fail
to be satisfied by such parties, (5) such assistance shall not cause any
director, officer or employee of Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates to
incur any personal liability, (6) such assistance shall not conflict with or
violate any Laws or require Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates to
disclose information subject to any attorney-client, attorney work product or
other legal privilege, and (7) such assistance shall not conflict with or
violate Seller Parents or any of its Affiliates Organizational Documents or
result in the contravention of, or that would reasonably be expected to result

confidentiality agreement) to which Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates is
a party.

(e) Buyer shall promptly (i) upon request by Seller Parent, reimburse
Seller Parent for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable
attorneys fees) incurred by Seller Parent, any of Seller Parents Affiliates
or their respective Representatives in connection with the cooperation of
Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries and their Representatives contemplated by
this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless Seller Parent,

"Indemnifiable Liabilities") suffered or incurred by any of them in
connection with any claims asserted by the Financing Sources in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing (other

 



-78-  than to the extent such Indemnifiable Liabilities arise from the willful
misconduct of or breach of this Agreement by Seller Parent, any of Seller
Parents Affiliates or their respective Representatives) and any information
used in connection therewith. All non-public or other confidential information
provided by Seller Parent to Buyer, its Representatives or its Financing
Sources pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall be kept confidential in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. The obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.6(e)_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

eliminated, and (b) any and all cash and cash equivalents may be extracted by
Seller Parent from the Transferred Group, in each case in such a manner as

thereto. Intercompany accounts between and among members of the Transferred
Group shall not be affected by this provision.

substance to Buyer.

Affiliates (other than the Transferred Group), on the one hand, and any member
of the Transferred Group, on the other hand, including any and all such
arrangements set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 4.21_ of the Seller Disclosure

obligations or liability to the other, except for this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements.

Statement).

(c) Neither Buyer nor the Board of Directors of Buyer shall (i) fail to (A)
call, notice or hold the Special Meeting, (B) prepare and file with the SEC

commercially reasonable efforts to make available to Buyer (or to Buyers
authorized attorneys, agents or representatives) the employees, agents
or consultants of such Seller or its Affiliates to the extent reasonably
necessary to enable Buyer to prepare, file, prosecute and maintain all
Transferred Intellectual Property. In addition, if requested by Buyer, each
Seller shall perform, and shall cause its Affiliates to perform, such
commercially reasonable acts (including signing or causing to have signed all
documents necessary) for Buyer and its Affiliates to prepare, file, prosecute
and maintain all such Transferred Intellectual Property.

 



-80- (b) _Cooperation in Litigation_. From and after the Closing Date, Sellers and
Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with each other in the defense or
prosecution of any Proceedings, examination or audit instituted prior to the
Closing or that may be instituted thereafter against or by either Party
relating to or arising out of the conduct of the Business, the Products, or
the Transferred Intellectual Property prior to or after the Closing (other
than Actions between a Seller and Buyer or their respective Affiliates arising
out of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, with respect to which
applicable rules of discovery shall apply). In connection therewith, from and
after the Closing Date, each of Sellers and Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Controlled Affiliates to, make available to the other during normal business
hours and upon reasonable prior written notice, but without unreasonably
disrupting its business, all records to the extent relating to the Business,
Acquired Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the Excluded Assets (to the extent
related to the Business), and the Excluded Liabilities (to the extent related
to the Business) held by it and reasonably necessary to permit the defense or
investigation of any such Proceedings, examination or audit (other than
Actions between a Seller and Buyer or their respective Affiliates arising out
of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, with respect to which
applicable rules of discovery shall apply), and shall, and shall cause its
Controlled Affiliates to, preserve and retain all such records for the length
of time contemplated by its standard record retention policies and schedules;
_provided_ that neither Sellers nor Buyer shall be obligated pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.13_ to disclose any document or information, the disclosure
of which would violate the terms of any binding confidentiality agreements the
disclosing Party is subject to or violate the attorney-client privilege of the
disclosing Party. In addition, with respect to Proceedings relating to
the Transferred Intellectual Property, including Proceedings related to the
filing of ANDAs or Section 505(b)(2) NDAs related to the Products or any
similar actions before any Governmental Authority or Regulatory Authority,
Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer by (i) providing reasonable
access to Buyer (and its Affiliates and counsel) to the records and
information of Sellers and their Affiliates that are reasonably relevant to
such Proceedings, (ii) providing reasonable access to the employees and
contractors of Sellers and their Affiliates for providing information that is
reasonably relevant to such Proceedings, including making a reasonable number
of employees and/or contractors available to appear at depositions and/or
trial in such Proceedings, and (iii) to execute all necessary and proper
papers and instruments, and to make all rightful oaths and declarations, as
may be necessary in such Proceedings, in each of cases (i), (ii) and (iii) to
the extent within Sellers control and at Buyers expense.

(c) The Party requesting cooperation pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.13_
shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of providing such
cooperation (including reasonable legal fees and disbursements and reasonably
necessary costs of any redactions required in the event requested materials
are mixed with other sensitive information of the disclosing party) incurred
by the Party providing such cooperation and by its Representatives. 

6.14. _Intellectual Property License_.

 



-81- (a) To the extent that the Transferred Intellectual Property includes Patent
Rights and Trade Secrets which are necessary for the Excluded Business
("Excluded Business IP"), Buyer hereby grants to Seller Parent and its
Affiliates (such grant to become effective at the Closing) a perpetual,
royalty-free, fully paid up, non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-
sublicensable (except as provided in sub-paragraph (c) below) license to use
and otherwise exploit the Excluded Business IP solely in connection with the
operation of the Excluded Business.

 

(b) Seller Parent agrees not to disclose to any third party any Trade Secrets
or other confidential information included in the Excluded Business IP,
treating such Excluded Business IP in the same manner (but in no event using
less than a commercially reasonable degree of care) as Seller Parent treats
other similarly sensitive Intellectual Property owned by Seller Parent; 
_provided_ , _however_ that Seller Parent may make such information available
(i) to potential acquirors, licensees or transferees in connection with the
proposed sale, license or other transfer of all or any part of the
Excluded Business or (ii) to any third party vendor, in each case provided
that such information is made available to such Person pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement and provided that Seller Parent remains liable to
Buyer for any breach of such confidentiality agreements.

(c) The license granted to Seller Parent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.14_ may not be assigned, sublicensed or otherwise transferred by Seller
Parent without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , that without such
consent, Seller Parent may assign, sublicense or otherwise transfer its
rights and obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.14_ to an Affiliate or to
a third party in connection with a sale or transfer of substantially all of
the assets related to the Excluded Business (whether by sale of assets,
stock, merger or otherwise) and the license may be sublicensed to third party
vendors performing research, development, supply or similar activities for the
Excluded Business as are customary in the industry. The license granted
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.14_ shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and
permitted assigns. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this
license granted pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.14_ shall be void _ab
initio_.

 

ARTICLE VII.

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

7.1. _Transfer of Employees_. Prior to the Closing, but effective as of the
Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Controlled Affiliates to,
make an offer of employment to each Business Employee that is identified by
Buyer in a notice delivered to Sellers not more than thirty (30) days after
the date hereof and in any event at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
Closing, conditioned on such Business Employee satisfactorily completing
Buyers standard hiring procedures (as determined in good faith), including
any pre-employment background checks or other onboarding requirements, for a
position consistent with such Business Employees position as of immediately
prior to the Closing and on terms consistent with those set forth in this
_ARTICLE VII_ , effective immediately following the Closing; _provided_ that,
unless required by applicable Law, any such offer of employment to a Business
Employee who is not actively at work as of the Closing due to an approved
leave of absence will be effective on 

 



-82-  the date after the Closing on which such Business Employee returns to active
employment (the "Transfer Date"), so long as such date is within six (6)
months following the Closing Date. Effective as of the Closing or the
Transfer Date, as applicable, Sellers and their Affiliates, as applicable,
shall (i) treat each Business Employee who accepts an offer of employment from
Buyer or any of its Controlled Affiliates as having resigned his or her
employment and (ii) transfer the employment of each employee of any member of
the Transferred Group who is not a Business Employee and of any Business
Employee who is employed by any member of the Transferred Group who is not
listed on the notice delivered to Seller as contemplated in the immediately
preceding sentence, in each case, to Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates,
other than any member of the Transferred Group. Buyer shall provide Seller
Parent with a form of offer letter to be used to make such offers of
employment a reasonable time prior to the distribution of offer letters, and
Buyer shall consider Seller Parents reasonable comments to such form in good
faith. None of Buyer or its Affiliates (including, on or following the
Closing, any entity within the Transferred Group) shall have any Liability for
severance pay or benefits with respect to any Business Employee who does not
become a Continuing Employee hereunder (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any Business Employee who does not receive or rejects an offer of
employment with Buyer or its Affiliates) and each employee of any member of
the Transferred Group who is not a Business Employee. Sellers shall
cooperate with Buyer with respect to the offer process described in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.1_. For the purposes of this Agreement, each Business
Employee who accepts employment with Buyer or its Controlled Affiliates or
otherwise becomes employed by Buyer or its Controlled Affiliates as of the
Closing or the Transfer Date, as applicable (including, on or following the
Closing, any entity within the Transferred Group), shall be a "Continuing
Employee". As of the Closing, the Transferred Group shall employ no Non-
Business Employees. Immediately as of the Closing or the Transfer Date, as
applicable, the Continuing Employees shall cease to participate in or
accrue further benefits under any Seller Benefit Plan and none of Buyer or
its Affiliates (including, on or following the Closing, any entity within the
Transferred Group) shall assume or be transferred the sponsorship of any
Seller Benefit Plan or any Liability with respect thereto in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise. To the extent
necessary for any Continuing Employee to perform services in connection with
such Continuing Employees employment with Buyer, Seller Parent or its
Affiliates shall release each Continuing Employee from any existing non-
competition, non-solicitation or confidentiality obligation solely with
respect to any confidential information of the Business owed to Seller Parent
or any of its Affiliates.

7.2. _Compensation and Benefits_. Effective as of the Closing or the Transfer
Date, as applicable, and through the first anniversary of the Closing, Buyer
shall provide, or shall cause its Controlled Affiliates to provide, to each
Continuing Employee who remains employed by Buyer or one of its Controlled
Affiliates, (a) a base salary or wage rate that is not less than the base
salary or wage rate in effect for such Continuing Employee immediately prior
to the Closing, (b) annual cash bonus opportunities (excluding change-in-
control, transaction and retention-related bonus opportunities) that, in the
aggregate, are no less favorable than those provided to similarly-situated
employees of Buyer or its Controlled Affiliates, (c) severance pay and
benefits that would have been applicable to such Continuing Employee under the
Seller Benefit Plan in effect as of immediately prior to the Closing
and disclosed on _Schedule 7.2_ and (d) employee benefits (excluding
severance, bonus, change in control, transaction, equity or equity-based,
deferred compensation arrangements, retiree health and welfare benefits,
defined benefit pension plans and retention-related benefits) that are, in
the aggregate, substantially comparable to those provided to such Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the Closing or consistent with those provided
to similarly situated employees of Buyer. 

 



-83- 7.3. _Service Credit_. Effective as of the Closing or the Transfer Date, as
applicable, and thereafter, Buyer shall, or shall cause a Controlled
Affiliate to, use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize for each
Continuing Employee those periods of employment with a Seller or any Affiliate
of a Seller to the same extent such service was recognized by Sellers or
their Affiliates for vesting and eligibility and level of benefits purposes
under all Benefit Plans maintained by Buyer or its Controlled Affiliates,
including vacation or other paid-time-off plans or arrangements, 401(k),
pension or other retirement plans and any severance or health or welfare plans
(other than for purposes of determining any accrued benefit under any defined
benefit pension plan, or for purposes of vesting for equity-based awards);
_provided_ , _however_ , that such service will not be credited: (a) to the
extent such service credit would result in a duplication of benefits; (b)
where such service was not recognized under a comparable Benefit Plan
maintained by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller immediately prior to the
Closing; or (c) to the extent employees of Buyer and its Controlled Affiliates
(other than any member of the Transferred Group) who are similarly situated
to the Continuing Employees are not provided such credit for service;
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , clauses (b) and (c) of this sentence
shall not apply to the severance pay and benefits contemplated by _Section_
__ _ 7.2(c)_.

7.4. _Welfare Plans_. Effective as of the Closing or the Transfer Date, as
applicable, and thereafter, Buyer shall, or shall cause a Controlled Affiliate
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) ensure that no eligibility
waiting periods, actively-at-work requirements or pre-existing condition
limitations or exclusions shall apply with respect to the
Continuing Employees under the applicable health and welfare benefits plan of
Buyer or any of its Controlled Affiliates (except to the extent such terms are
applicable under the Seller Benefit Plans that such Continuing Employees
participated in immediately prior to the Closing), (b) waive any and all
evidence of insurability requirements with respect to the Continuing Employees
to the extent such evidence of insurability requirements were not applicable
to the Continuing Employees under the Seller Benefit Plans that such
Continuing Employees participated in immediately prior to the Closing, and (c)
credit each Continuing Employee with all deductible payments, out-of-pocket
or other co-payments paid by such Continuing Employee under the Seller Benefit
Plans that each such Continuing Employee participated in prior to the Closing
during the year in which the Closing occurs for the purpose of determining the
extent to which any such employee has satisfied his or her deductible and
whether he or she has reached the out-of-pocket maximum under any health
benefit plan of Buyer or any of its Controlled Affiliates for such year. As
soon as practicable, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
following, the Closing Date, Seller or Sellers applicable insurance carrier
shall provide Buyer or Buyers group health plan (in a format useable by
Buyers insurance carrier) with a report or other documentation setting forth
as of the Closing Date all deductible payments, out-of-pocket or other
copayments toward out-of-pocket maximums paid by Continuing Employees for the
plan year in which the Closing occurs under the Benefit Plans that are
employee welfare benefit plans.

 

7.5. _Paid Time Off_. Seller or one of its Affiliates shall make a payment to
each Continuing Employee in respect of his or her accrued but unused paid
time off immediately prior to the Closing without any Liability to Buyer and
Buyer shall not be required to credit such Continuing Employee with accrued
but unused paid time off.

 



-84- 7.6. _Defined Contribution Plans_. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each Continuing Employee who is a participant in a Seller
Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code that
includes a cash or deferred arrangement intended to satisfy the provisions of
Section 401(k) of the Code (the "Seller 401(k) Plan") to be allowed to
participate, effective as of the Closing or the Transfer Date, as applicable,
in a tax qualified plan which includes a cash or deferred arrangement intended
to satisfy the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Code that is sponsored and
maintained by Buyer or an Affiliate thereof (the "Buyer 401(k) Plan"). In
addition, to the extent permitted by the terms of the Buyer 401(k) Plan, Buyer
shall cause the Buyer 401(k) Plan to accept rollover contributions of
"eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of
the Code, inclusive of loans) from the Seller 401(k) Plan.

 

7.7. _Flexible Spending Accounts_. To the extent any Continuing Employee is
participating in a Seller Benefit Plan that provides for qualified flexible
spending accounts for medical or dependent care expenses as of the Closing,
Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to permit each such Continuing
Employee, effective as of the Closing Date or the Transfer Date,
as applicable, and to the extent there exist a similar Buyer Benefit Plan, to
be eligible to participate in an employee benefit plan maintained by Buyer or
its Controlled Affiliates that provides for qualified flexible spending
accounts for medical or dependent care expenses, as applicable. Buyer shall
credit such accounts with the amount (positive or negative) credited as of the
Closing Date or the Transfer Date, as applicable, under comparable accounts
maintained under Seller Benefit Plans from the beginning of the applicable
plan year to the Closing Date or the Transfer Date, as applicable. As soon as
practicable after the Closing Date or the Transfer Date, as applicable, (a)
Seller Parent shall pay to Buyer in cash the amount, if any, by which
aggregate contributions made by Continuing Employees to flexible spending
accounts under Seller Benefit Plans exceeded the aggregate benefits provided
to Continuing Employees as of the Closing or the Transfer Date, as applicable,
or (b) Buyer shall pay to Seller Parent in cash the amount, if any, by which
aggregate benefits provided to Continuing Employees under flexible spending
accounts under Seller Benefit Plans exceeded the aggregate contributions made
by Continuing Employees as of the Closing or the Transfer Date, as
applicable.

7.8. _WARN Act_. At or prior to the Closing, Seller Parent agrees to provide
any required notice to Business Employees under the U.S. Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act or any other similar displaced worker notification
Laws ("WARN"). Seller Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its
Affiliates with respect to any Liability under WARN arising from the actions
(or inactions) of Seller Parent or its Affiliates prior to or at the Closing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Liability under WARN with respect
to any Business Employee who does not become a Continuing Employee hereunder
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Business Employee who does not
receive or rejects an offer of employment with Buyer or its Affiliates) and
each employee of any member of the Transferred Group who is not a Business
Employee). At the Closing, Seller Parent will provide to Buyer a list of the
name and site of employment of any employees of Sellers or their Affiliates
who have experienced or will experience an employment loss or layoff (as
defined in "WARN") within ninety (90) days prior to the Closing and who are
located at a site of employment where Continuing Employees will be located
following the Closing, along with the date of the employment loss or layoff.
Following the Closing, Buyer or its Controlled Affiliates, as

 



-85-  applicable, will be responsible for providing any required notice to
Business Employees under WARN. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers
and their Affiliates with respect to any Liability under WARN arising from
the actions (or inactions) of Buyer or its Affiliates after the Closing,
except to the extent resulting from any error or omission in the list provided
by Sellers pursuant to the second sentence of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.8_.

7.9. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing contained in this Agreement,
whether express or implied, shall: (a) be treated as an amendment or
modification of any Benefit Plan; (b) without limiting the generality of
_Section_ __ _ 13.7_, give any Person (including, without limitation, any
current or former employee, any Business Employee or any other individual
associated therewith or any Benefit Plan or trustee thereof) other than a
Party, any right to enforce the provisions of this _ARTICLE VII_ ; (c) modify
the at-will nature of any employees employment; or (d) obligate any Seller or
Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates to (i) maintain any particular
Benefit Plan, (ii) refrain from amending or terminating any particular
Benefit Plan, (iii) retain the employment of any particular employee or (iv)
refrain from changing the terms and conditions of employment.

 

ARTICLE VIII.

by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by Seller. Seller Parent and Buyer shall
cooperate to timely prepare any Tax Returns relating to such Transfer Taxes,
including any claim for exemption or exclusion from the imposition of any
Transfer Taxes. The party responsible under applicable Law will file any Tax
Returns with respect to Transfer Taxes, and promptly following the filing
thereof, any such party will furnish to the other party a copy of such Tax
Return and a copy of a receipt showing payment of any such Transfer Tax. The
non-filing party shall pay to the filing party, not later than five (5)
Business Days before the due date for payment of such Transfer Taxes, an

(other than the Transferred Group) and the Business (other than any
Tax Return relating to Transfer Taxes governed by _Section_ __ _ 8.1_) that
are required to be filed (taking into account any applicable extensions) after
the Closing Date and (i) are Consolidated Tax Returns, or (ii) are required
to be filed by or with respect to any member of the Transferred Group on a
separate Tax Return basis for any taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date (the Tax Returns referenced in clause (ii), the "Pre-Closing
Separate Tax Returns"), except that, to the extent Buyer is required by
applicable Law to file such Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return, Sellers shall
deliver a draft of such Tax Return to Buyer for Buyers review and comment at
least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return
(taking into account any applicable extensions). Sellers shall reflect on such
Tax return any reasonable comments submitted by Buyer at least five (5) days
before the due date of such Tax Return, and

 



-86-  Buyer shall timely file such Tax Return as revised. All Tax Returns with
respect to the Transferred Group, Acquired Assets (other than the Transferred
Entities) or the Business that are required to be filed on a separate Tax
Return basis for any Straddle Period shall be filed on the basis that the
relevant taxable period ended as of the close of the Closing Date ("Closing
Date Tax Return"), unless the relevant Taxing Authority will not accept a
Closing Date Tax Return. Sellers will prepare and timely file all Closing Date
Tax Returns with the relevant Taxing Authority. In accordance with past
practice (except as otherwise required by applicable Law, the Section
338(h)(10) Election, and the Allocation Schedule), Buyer will prepare and
timely file all other such Tax Returns for a Straddle Period on a basis
consistent with past practice, and Buyer will deliver to Sellers at least
fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for the filing of any such Tax Return
(taking into account any applicable extensions) a statement setting forth the
amount of Tax for which Sellers are responsible consistent with  _Section_ __
_ 8.2_ and a copy of such Tax Return. Buyer will reflect on such Tax Return
any reasonable comments submitted by Sellers at least five (5) days prior to
the due date of such Tax Return.

 

(b) _Sellers will pay all Pre-Closing Taxes_. At least three (3) days prior to
the due date for a Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return prepared by Sellers and
filed by Buyer pursuant to Section 8.2(a), Sellers will pay Buyer an amount
equal to the Taxes that are Pre-Closing Taxes shown on such Tax Return. At
least three (3) days prior to the due date for a Tax Return for a Straddle
Period prepared and filed by Buyer, Sellers will pay their portion of the
Taxes that are Pre-Closing Taxes due with respect to such Tax Return to
Buyer, as determined under _Section_ __ _ 8.2_.

 

8.3. _Straddle Period Taxes_. In any case where the relevant Taxing Authority
will not accept a Closing Date Tax Return, the Taxes of Sellers and Buyer
shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax
Period as follows: (i) in the case of any Property Taxes, Taxes attributable
to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall equal the Property Taxes for such Straddle
Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period; and (ii)
all other Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed
as if the Straddle Period ended as of the close of the Closing Date.

8.4. _Tax Cooperation and Contests_. (a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.1_,
Buyer and Sellers agree to furnish or cause their Affiliates to furnish, to
each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and
assistance relating to the Acquired Assets, the Business, or the Transferred
Group as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns and other
Tax filings, the preparation for any audit by any Taxing Authority and the
defense of any Claim or Proceeding relating to Taxes of the Acquired Assets,
the Business, or the Transferred Group; _provided_ that Buyer will not be
permitted to inspect or otherwise review any Consolidated Tax Return and that
Seller Parent and its Affiliates will not be permitted to inspect
or otherwise review any Tax Return reflecting the activities or operations of
any Person other than the members of the Transferred Group.

 



-87- (b) Buyer shall promptly notify Seller Parent in writing of the commencement
of any audit or examination of any Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return and any
other proposed change, adjustment, claim, dispute, arbitration or litigation
that, if sustained, would reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim for
indemnification in respect of Taxes under this Agreement (each, a "Tax
Claim"); _provided_ , _however_ , that any failure by Buyer to so notify
Seller Parent shall not relieve Seller Parent of any of its
indemnification obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent that
Seller Parent is actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. Such notice
shall describe the asserted Tax Claim in reasonable detail and shall include
copies of any notices and other documents received from any Taxing Authority
in respect of any such asserted Tax Claim. Seller Parent shall have the right
to control any audit, examination, or other proceeding relating to a Tax Claim
that arises in connection with a Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) Seller Parent shall inform Buyer of the status and
progress of such proceedings, (ii) Buyer shall have the opportunity
to participate in such proceedings at its expense, and (iii) Seller Parent
shall not settle any Tax Claim (either at the audit or examination stage or
thereafter) without first obtaining Buyers consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Buyer and Seller Parent
shall have the right to control jointly any audit, examination, or other
proceeding relating to a Tax Claim that arises in connection with a Straddle
Period Tax Return. In the event that Seller Parent does not exercise its
control rights set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.4(b)_, Buyer shall have the
right to control such Tax Claim.

 

8.5. _Tax Refund_. Any Tax refunds and credits related to the Acquired Assets,
the Business or Transferred Group (including any interest paid or credited
with respect thereto) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be the property of
Seller Parent. Buyer shall cause the amount of such refund or credit (net of
any Tax or reasonable third-party costs of Buyer or its Affiliates solely
attributable to obtaining and receiving such benefit) to be paid to Seller
Parent within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof. To the extent such
refund or credit is subsequently disallowed or required to be returned to the
applicable Governmental Authority, Seller Parent agrees to promptly repay the
amount of such refund, together with any interest, penalties or other
additional amounts imposed by such Governmental Authority, to Buyer or
its Affiliates, as applicable.

8.6. _Section 338(h)(10) Election_. At the request of Buyer, Seller Parent or
its Affiliates shall join with Buyer in making an election under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code (and any corresponding elections under state or local
Tax law) (collectively, a "Section 338(h)(10) Election") with respect to
the transfer of the interests in the members of the Transferred Group that
are taxable as domestic corporations (such members, the "Subject Entities")
under the Code pursuant to this Agreement. In the event that a Section
338(h)(10) Election is made, (a) Seller Parent and Buyer agree to take all
actions necessary or appropriate, including properly completing and executing
IRS Form 8023 and all other forms and documents required by applicable Law,
to make the Section 338(h)(10) Election with respect to the sale of the
interests of each Subject Entity with respect to which a Section 338(h)(10)
Election is made pursuant to this Agreement, (b) Seller Parent and Buyer will
exchange completed and executed copies of IRS Forms 8023 and all other
relevant forms and documents, not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due
date, and (c) Seller Parent and Buyer will report the sale of the interests of
each Subject Entity with respect to which a Section 338(h)(10) Election is
made pursuant to this Agreement consistent with such Section 338(h)(10)
Election and shall take no position contrary thereto unless, and then only to
the extent, required by a Final Determination.

 



-88- 8.7. _Miscellaneous_. After the Closing, except as required under applicable
Law, Buyer shall not, and shall not cause or permit any of its Affiliates to
(a) make, change or revoke any Tax election with respect to any member of the
Transferred Group, the Acquired Assets or the Business that could increase the
amount of Pre-Closing Taxes, or (b) grant an extension of any applicable
statute of limitations that relates to Taxes with respect to any member of the
Transferred Group, the Acquired Assets or the Business that relates to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period, without the prior written consent of Seller Parent, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Buyer shall
not, and shall not cause or permit any Affiliate (including any Transferred
Entity) to, take any action on the Closing Date other than in the ordinary
course of business. Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of
Seller Parent, make or file an election under Section 338(g) of the Code (and
any corresponding elections under state or local Tax law) with respect to any
member of the Transferred Group.

 

8.8. _Tax Provision Priority_. To the extent that this _Article VIII_
conflicts with any other provision in this Agreement, this  _Article VIII_
shall govern.

ARTICLE IX.

 

OTHER AGREEMENTS

9.1.  _Books and Records; Access; Assistance_. (a) Subject to any limitations
imposed by Law, including limitations that are required to preserve any
applicable attorney-client privilege, and subject to _Section_ __ _
13.3_, after the Closing, as applicable, Buyer and Sellers shall, at no cost
to the other, make reasonably available (x) to each other and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives, as reasonably requested and, in the case of
Sellers, only in connection with the preparation of Tax Returns, the
preparation of financial statements, or any investigations or litigation
brought by a Governmental Authority, and (y) to any Taxing Authority or any
other Governmental Authority, in each case all books and records to the
extent related to the Business, the Transferred Group, the Transferred Group
Assets, the Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities for all periods prior
to the Closing Date (other than any Consolidated Tax Returns) and shall use
reasonable best efforts to preserve, for at least six (6) years after the
Closing Date or, if applicable and later, the expiration of the applicable
statutes of limitations or extensions thereof: (i) all such books and
records, (ii) Tax Returns solely pertaining to the Business, the Transferred
Group, the Transferred Group Assets, the Acquired Assets or the Products
(other than any Consolidated Tax Returns) and (iii) government Contract
information, records or documents, to the extent relating to the Business,
the Transferred Group, the Transferred Group Assets, the Acquired Assets or
the Assumed Liabilities, for the required retention period. Buyer and Sellers
shall also make available to each other for such period, during normal
business hours when reasonably requested and, in the case of Sellers, only in
connection with the preparation of Tax Returns, the preparation of financial
statements, or any investigations or litigation brought by a Governmental
Authority, personnel responsible for preparing or maintaining such
information, records and documents, in each case as it relates to the
Business, including product Liability and general insurance Liability. Sellers
shall have the right to retain copies of all information and documents
provided by Sellers to Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_, subject to
_Section_ __ _ 13.3_. The right to access provided by this  _Section_ __ _
9.1_ shall include the right to make copies of accessed documents, _provided_
that all such copies shall be at the sole cost and expense of the requesting
Party. The Party providing access under this  _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ shall have
the right to reasonably redact all such documents.

 



-89- (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ shall not
provide Buyer or any Seller (or Representatives of any thereof) any access
rights to documents or information of the other Party (i) which access would
violate any Laws or obligations regarding the confidentiality thereof (unless
any such violation could be and is avoided by the recipients execution and
delivery of an appropriate confidentiality agreement), (ii) with respect to
individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other
personnel-related information, the disclosure of which would, in a Partys
good faith opinion, subject the Party or any of its Affiliates to risk of
Liability, (iii) which access would waive any attorney-client, work product,
or like privilege, or (iv) for the purpose of use in connection with
potential or actual litigation, arbitration or mediation between Buyer or any
Affiliate of Buyer, on the one hand, and any Seller or any Affiliate of any
Seller, on the other hand (nor, for the avoidance of doubt, shall Buyer or
any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates have any right to use any
document or information obtained from the other pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 9.1_ in any such Proceeding).

 

9.2. _Privileged Matters_. (a) Each Party acknowledges that: (i) each Party
and its Affiliates has or may obtain Privileged Information; (ii) there are
and/or may be a number of Litigation Matters affecting both of Buyer and
Seller Parent; (iii) both Buyer and Seller Parent have a common legal interest
in Litigation Matters, in the Privileged Information and in the preservation
of the confidential status of the Privileged Information, in each case
relating to the Business; and (iv) both Buyer and Seller Parent intend that
the Transactions and any transfer of Privileged Information in
connection therewith shall not operate as a waiver of any potentially
applicable privilege.

(b) Following the Closing, each of Buyer and Seller Parent agrees, on behalf
of itself and each of its Subsidiaries, not to disclose or otherwise waive any
privilege attaching to any Privileged Information relating to the Business,
the Transferred Group, the Transferred Group Assets or the Transferred Assets
without providing prompt written notice to and obtaining the prior written
consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed and shall not be withheld, conditioned or delayed
if the other Party certifies that such disclosure is to be made in response
to a likely threat of suspension or debarment or similar action; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer shall not be required to give such notice or obtain any
such consent and may make such disclosure or waiver with respect to
Privileged Information if such Privileged Information relates solely to the
Business, the Transferred Group, the Transferred Group Assets or the
Transferred Assets (unless such information relates to matters for which
Sellers may have indemnification obligations under this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements). In the event of a disagreement concerning the
reasonableness of withholding such consent, no disclosure shall be made prior
to a resolution of such disagreement by a court of competent jurisdiction,
_provided_ that the limitations in this sentence shall not apply in the case
of disclosure required by Law and so certified as provided in the first
sentence of this paragraph.

 



-90- (c) After the Closing, upon receipt of any subpoena or other compulsory
disclosure notice from a court, other Governmental Authority or otherwise
which requests disclosure of Privileged Information relating to the Business,
the Transferred Group, the Transferred Group Assets or the Transferred Assets,
to the extent permitted by Law, Seller Parent or Buyer (only in the case of
information relating to matters for which Seller Parent may have
indemnification obligations under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements,
or in the case of Privileged Information not primarily related to
the Business, the Transferred Group, the Transferred Group Assets or the
Transferred Assets and in which a Seller may have an interest), as applicable,
shall as promptly as practicable provide to the other Party (in accordance
with the notice provisions set forth herein) a copy of such notice, the
intended response, and all materials or information that might be disclosed
and the proposed date of disclosure. In the event of a disagreement as to the
intended response or disclosure, unless and until the disagreement is
resolved as provided in _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_, the disclosing party shall,
at the other partys expense, cooperate to the extent such other party seeks
to limit such disclosure and take all reasonable steps to resist or avoid
such disclosure, except as otherwise required by a court Order requiring such
disclosure.

(d) Buyer (on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates) further agrees
that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, as to all
communications between Cadwalader and any of Sellers or the Transferred Group
(including any of their respective directors, officers or employees) that
occur prior to the Closing that relate exclusively to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Transactions (including the
preceding sale process by Seller Parent), the attorney-client privilege and
the expectation of client confidence belongs to Sellers and shall be
controlled by Sellers and shall not pass to or be claimed by Buyer, the
Transferred Group or any of their respective Affiliates. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Buyer, the
Transferred Group or any of their respective Affiliates and a third party,
other than a party to this Agreement, after the Closing, Buyer and/or a member
of the Transferred Group may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications by Cadwalader to such third party.

9.3. _Wrong Pocket Assets_. (a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, if any
Transferred Asset remains vested in any Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates following Closing, such Seller shall (or shall cause its applicable
Affiliate to) transfer such Transferred Asset, at Seller Parents sole
expense, as soon as reasonably practicable to Buyer or its designee for no
additional consideration with any necessary prior third party consent or
approval (it being acknowledged and agreed that Buyer shall have already paid
good consideration for all Transferred Assets by paying the Purchase Price),
and such Seller and Buyer shall (or shall cause the applicable Affiliate or
designee to) as soon as reasonably practicable execute such documents or
instruments of conveyance or assumption and take such further acts which are
reasonably necessary or desirable to effect the transfer of such asset to
Buyer. Seller Parent shall notify Buyer as soon as reasonably practicable
upon becoming aware that that there are any Transferred Assets in its
possession or control or that of any Affiliate of any Seller.

(b) If any Excluded Asset is vested in Buyer or any of its Controlled
Affiliates following Closing, Buyer shall (or shall cause its applicable
Controlled Affiliate to) transfer such Excluded Asset, at Seller Parents sole
expense, as soon as reasonably practicable to Seller Parent or its designee
for no consideration with any necessary prior third party consent or approval
(it being acknowledged and agreed that the Parties have not agreed to sell
such Excluded Asset), and Buyer and Seller Parent shall (or shall cause the
applicable Affiliate or

 



-91-  designee to) as soon as reasonably practicable execute such documents or
instruments of conveyance or assumption and take such further acts which are
reasonably necessary or desirable to effect the transfer of such asset back
to Seller Parent. Buyer shall notify Seller Parent as soon as reasonably
practicable upon becoming aware that that there are any Excluded Assets in its
possession or control.

 

9.4. _Products Received by Sellers_. If Products are received by any Seller
after the Closing, such Seller shall ship those products to Buyer, or to
Buyers stated Representative, at Buyers cost. Within fifteen (15) days after
notification from a Seller, Buyer shall reimburse such Seller for all customer
claims made against such Seller in the form of invoice deductions for amounts
associated with such returned products which are received by such Seller or
such Sellers Representative after the Closing.

 

9.5. _Guarantees; Commitments_. (a) From and after the Closing until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, Buyer and the
Transferred Group, jointly and severally, shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Seller Parent and any of its Affiliates against any Liabilities that
Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates suffer, incur or are liable for that
accrue or arise after the Closing by reason of or arising out of or in
consequence of (i) Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates issuing, making
payment under, being required to pay or reimburse the issuer of, or being a
party to, any guarantee, indemnity, surety bond, letter of credit, letter of
comfort or other similar obligation relating to the Business or the
Transferred Group that was obtained or given by Seller Parent or any of its
Affiliates prior to the date hereof or, with the prior written consent of
Buyer, after the date hereof (collectively, the "Seller Guarantees"), (ii) any
claim or demand for payment made on Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates
with respect to any of the Seller Guarantees that result from post-Closing
facts or circumstances or (iii) any Proceeding by any Person who is or claims
to be entitled to the benefit of or claims to be entitled to payment,
reimbursement or indemnity with respect to any Seller Guarantees as a result
of post-Closing facts or circumstances, and shall reimburse Seller Parent for
any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with any of the foregoing.

 

(b) Without limiting _Section_ __ _ 9.5(a)_ in any respect, Buyer shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause itself or one of its Controlled
Affiliates to be substituted in all respects for Seller Parent and any of its
Affiliates, and for Seller Parent and its Affiliates to be released, effective
as of the Closing, in respect of, or otherwise terminate (and cause Seller
Parent and its Affiliates to be released in respect of), all obligations of
Seller Parent and any of its Affiliates under each of the Seller Guarantees.
For any of the Seller Guarantees for which Buyer or an Affiliate thereof
is not substituted in all respects for Seller Parent and its Affiliates (or
for which Seller Parent and its Affiliates are not released) effective as of
the Closing and that cannot otherwise be terminated effective as of the
Closing (with Seller Parent and its Affiliates to be released in respect
thereof), Buyer shall continue to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
effect such substitution or termination and release after the Closing. Without
limiting the foregoing, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall extend
or renew any Contract containing or underlying a Seller Guarantee unless,
prior to or concurrently with such extension or renewal, Buyer or an Affiliate
thereof is substituted in all respects for Seller Parent and any of its
Affiliates, and Seller Parent and its Affiliates are released, in respect of
all obligations of Seller Parent and any of its Affiliates under such Seller
Guarantee.

 



-92- 9.6. _Retained Marks_. (a) From and after the Closing, except in accordance
with the license to Retained Marks granted to Buyer in _Section_ __ _
9.6(b)_, neither Buyer nor any of its Controlled Affiliates shall have any
right to use any Retained Mark and Buyer shall (and shall cause each of its
Controlled Affiliates to) cease all use of each Retained Mark and not hold
itself out as having any affiliations with Seller Parent or any of its
Affiliates other than the Transferred Group. Without limitation of the
foregoing, Buyer shall cause each of the Transferred Entities to specify on
their websites that the Business is not affiliated with Seller Parent.
"Retained Marks" means all business names, trade names, trademarks, trade
dress and domain names of Seller Parent or any Affiliate of Seller Parent
other than the Transferred Group, any derivative thereof, or any word that is
confusingly similar thereto and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include all
business names, trade names, trademarks and domain names consisting of, or
that include, the name "MEDICINES COMPANY" or "MEDCO"; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Retained Marks shall not include the business names, trade names,
trademarks and domain names that are included in the Acquired Assets.

(b) Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to convert Labeling
for the Products (other than as permitted pursuant to the license set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 9.6(b)_) to Labeling that does not include Retained Marks
promptly following the Closing and to use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any third party manufacturers of such Products under any Contract
included in the Transferred Assets or Transferred Group Assets to implement
such changes as promptly as is commercially reasonable. Seller Parent
hereby grants to Buyer a royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide,
nontransferable, non-sublicensable license under the Retained Marks to (i) use
such Retained Marks in connection with distributing, selling and offering to
sell existing inventories of Products included in the Transferred Assets or
Transferred Group Assets that bear the Retained Marks and (ii) use such
Retained Marks in connection with manufacturing or having manufactured such
quantities of the Products that bear Retained Marks that Buyer, in its
reasonable discretion, deems reasonably necessary to prevent a stock-out or
shortage of any such Products or otherwise reasonably transition from the use
of Retained Marks, and to use such Retained Marks in connection with
distributing, marketing, selling and offering to sell any such Product
manufactured pursuant to this clause (ii). With respect to any such
quantities of the Products that Buyer manufactures or has manufactured after
the Closing, such Products shall be of a quality that is at least equal to the
quality of such Products sold by Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries
under such marks prior to the Closing Date. If Seller Parent at any time
reasonably determines that any of such Products are not being provided in
accordance with such standards of quality, Seller Parent may notify Buyer in
writing of such deficiencies, and if Buyer fails to correct such deficiencies
within forty-five (45) days after receipt of such notice, Seller Parent may,
at its reasonable discretion, terminate the license set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 9.6(b)_ effective immediately.

9.7. _Employee Non-Solicit_. (a) Beginning on the Closing Date, neither
Seller Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, prior to the end of the first
(1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, directly or indirectly, solicit for
purposes of employment, offer to hire, hire or enter into any employment
agreement with any Continuing Employee, or otherwise solicit, induce or
otherwise encourage any Continuing Employee to discontinue, or refrain from
entering into any employment relationship (contractual or otherwise) with
Buyer or its Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, for purposes of this Agreement, Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries
shall not be prohibited from (i) placing general advertisements or conducting

 



-93-  general employment solicitations (including via a search firm inquiry) that
are not targeted at any Continuing Employee, or (ii) soliciting or employing
any Continuing Employee who has ceased to serve due to termination other than
for cause, and, for a period of at least six (6) continuous months prior to
the date of such solicitation or employment, has not served, as a director,
officer or employee of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) Beginning on the Closing Date, neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall, prior to the end of the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date,
directly or indirectly, solicit for purposes of employment, offer to hire,
hire or enter into any employment agreement with any (i) Non-Business
Employee or (ii) Business Employee who rejects an offer of employment from
Buyer or any of its Affiliates or who does not receive an offer of employment
prior to the Closing Date from Buyer or any of its Affiliates (each, a
"Restricted Person"), or otherwise solicit, induce or otherwise encourage any
such Non-Business Employee or Restricted Person to discontinue or refrain
from entering into any employment relationship (contractual or otherwise) with
Seller Parent or any Subsidiary of Seller Parent; _provided_ , ___however_ ,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this Agreement, Buyer and
its Subsidiaries shall not be prohibited from (i) placing general
advertisements or conducting general employment solicitations (including via a
search firm inquiry) that are not targeted at any Non-Business Employee or
Restricted Person, or (ii) soliciting or employing any Non-Business Employee
or Restricted Person who has ceased to serve due to termination other than
for cause, and, for a period of at least six (6) continuous months prior to
the date of such solicitation or employment, has not served, as a director,
officer or employee of Seller Parent or any Subsidiary of Seller Parent.

9.8. _Financial Information_. Following the Closing, Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Sellers (and their respective
auditors, attorneys, financial advisors, bankers and other consultants and
advisors) any information reasonably requested and relating to the Business
reasonably required by Sellers in (a) preparing and resolving
disputes arising out of the Closing Statement and (b) connection with Seller
Parent preparing financial statements of Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries
for all fiscal periods that precede or include the Closing Date.

 

9.9. _Insurance_. From and after the Closing, the Business shall cease to be
insured by Seller Parent or its Affiliates current and historical insurance
policies or programs (other than any third-party insurance policies of the
Transferred Group, the sole beneficiaries of which are members of the
Transferred Group ("Transferred Entity Insurance Policies")) or by any of the
current and historical self-insured programs of Seller Parent or its
Affiliates, and neither Buyer nor its Controlled Affiliates (including the
Transferred Group) shall have any access, right, title or interest to or in
any insurance policies or programs or self-insured programs of Seller Parent
and its Affiliates (other than Transferred Entity Insurance Policies)
(including to any claims or rights to make claims or any rights to proceeds).
Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates may, to be effective at the Closing,
amend any insurance policies and ancillary arrangements in the manner they
deem appropriate to give effect to this _Section_ __ _ 9.9_. From and after
the Closing, Buyer shall be responsible for securing all insurance it
considers appropriate for its operation of the Business and the Transferred
Group. Buyer further covenants and agrees not to seek to assert or to exercise
any rights or claims of the Business or the Transferred Group under or in
respect of any past or current insurance policy, program or self-insurance
program under which the Business, any member of the Transferred Group or
Affiliate thereof is a named insured, other than under or in respect of any
Transferred Entity Insurance Policy.

 



-94- 9.10. _Director and Officer Indemnification_. For a period of six (6) years
after the Closing, Buyer shall not take or cause, or permit to be taken or
caused by any Subsidiary or any of Buyers or its Subsidiaries
Representatives, any action to alter or impair any exculpatory or
indemnification provisions now existing in the Organizational Documents of
any member of the Transferred Group for the benefit of any individual who
served as a director or officer of any member of the Transferred Group at any
time prior to the Closing Date, except for any changes that may be required
to conform with changes in applicable Law and any changes that do not affect
the application of such provisions to acts or omissions of such individuals
prior to the Closing Date.

 

9.11. _Resignations_. Effective upon the Closing, unless otherwise requested
by Buyer in writing, Seller Parent shall cause all of its own employees,
directors and attorneys and all of its Subsidiaries employees, directors and
attorneys to resign from the boards of directors of the entities comprising
the Transferred Group and from all positions as executive officers of
the entities comprising the Transferred Group.

9.12. _Contingent Payment Contracts_. Effective upon the Closing, Buyer shall

the matters described in clause (a) below), including, without limitation:
(a) the Rempex Merger Agreement as defined in _Schedule 1.1(d)_ (it being

Business), (b) the Targanta Merger Agreement and Targanta Contingent Payment

into an amendment to the Targanta Contingent Payment Rights Agreement
evidencing Buyers succession to, and assumption of, the covenants of Seller
Parent in the Targanta Contingent Payment Rights Agreement), (c) the Lilly

case as defined in _Schedule 1.1(d)_ (it being understood that Buyer shall

ARTICLE XII.

 

INDEMNIFICATION

12.1.  _Survival; Effect of Materiality Qualifiers; Losses_. (a) The
representations and warranties of Seller Parent and Buyer contained in this
Agreement and the certificates delivered at Closing pursuant to  _Section_ __
_ 10.2(e)(ii)_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.3(d)(ii)_ shall survive the Closing for
the period set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 12.1_. All representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement (except for the Seller Fundamental
Representations and the Buyer Fundamental Representations) and all claims with
respect thereto under this _Article XII_ shall terminate on the date that is
fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date. All Seller Fundamental
Representations and the representations and warranties set forth in Section
4.16 (Tax Matters), and all Buyer Fundamental Representations, and all claims
with respect thereto under this _Article XII_ shall terminate on the date
that is thirty (30) days after the expiration of the relevant statutory period
of limitations applicable to the underlying claim. All claims with respect to
the covenants of Sellers and Buyer which by their terms do not contemplate
performance after the Closing or more than fifteen (15) months after the
Closing Date shall terminate on the date that is fifteen (15) months after the
Closing Date. All claims with respect to the covenants of Sellers and
Buyer which by their terms contemplate performance beyond fifteen (15) months
after the Closing Date shall survive until expiring on the six (6) month
anniversary of the date such covenant is performed or observed in accordance
with its terms. In the event that notice of any claim for indemnification
under this _ARTICLE XII_ has been given pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.4_ or
_Section_ __ _ 12.5_, as the case may be, within the applicable
survival period, the representations and warranties or covenants that are the
subject of such indemnification claim (and the right to pursue such claim)
shall survive with respect to such claim until such time as such claim is
finally resolved, and no Proceeding shall be required to be commenced in
connection therewith in order for such claim to so survive. It is the
intention of the Parties that the survival periods and termination date set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 12.1_ supersede any statute of limitations
applicable to such representations and warranties and covenants or claim with
respect thereof.

(b) The term "Losses" means damages, Liabilities, losses, claims, payments,
fines, fees, penalties, charges, judgments, settlements, assessments and costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys, accountants and
other experts fees and reasonable out-of-pocket disbursements); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Losses shall not include consequential or punitive damages or
lost profits, except to the extent required to be paid to a third party not
affiliated with the applicable Indemnified Party in connection with a Third
Party Claim, or solely in the case of consequential damages and lost profits,
except to the extent reasonably foreseeable, it being understood and agreed
that consequential damages and lost profits shall not be deemed "reasonably
foreseeable" to the extent they are based on the conduct of the Business in
geographies or with respect to indications not currently contemplated by the
Parties.

 



-99- (c) Solely for purposes of determining the amount of any Losses in respect of
any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement, any express qualifications or limitations set forth in such
representation or warranty as to materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other
words of similar import contained therein shall be disregarded.

12.2. _Indemnification by Seller Parent_. (a) From and after the Closing and
subject to the provisions of this _ARTICLE XII_ , Seller Parent shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer, Buyers Affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the members of the Transferred Group) and the respective
officers, directors, managers, general partners, employees, agents,
successors and permitted assigns of each of the foregoing (collectively, the
"Buyer Indemnified Parties") from, against and in respect of any and all
Losses imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by any of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties arising out of or resulting from:

(i) the breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by
Seller Parent in this Agreement or the certificate delivered by Seller Parent
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.3(d)(ii)_ of this Agreement;

 

(ii) the breach in any material respect of any covenant or agreement made by
Sellers in this Agreement; or

of doubt, any Pre-Closing Taxes).

(i) Seller Parent shall have no Liability for any claim for indemnification
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 12.2(a)(i)_ unless (A) the Losses for which
Seller Parent would be responsible for such claim and all related claims
exceed the De Minimis Amount and (B) the aggregate amount of Losses in respect
of breaches of or inaccuracies in Sellers representations and warranties
(excluding all Losses associated with claims less than the De Minimis Amount)
exceeds the Deductible, in which event Seller Parent shall be liable solely
for Losses in excess of the Deductible up to the Cap; _provided_ that the
limitations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 12.2(b)(i)_ shall not apply to
any Losses in respect of breaches of or inaccuracies in any Seller
Fundamental Representations;

(ii) Seller Parents aggregate liability for indemnification under  _Section_
__ _ 12.2(a)(i)_ shall in no event exceed the Cap; _provided_ that the
limitations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 12.2(b)(ii)_ shall not apply to
any Losses in respect of breaches of or inaccuracies in any Seller
Fundamental Representations;

(iii) The cumulative indemnification obligations of Seller Parent under
_Section_ __ _ 12.2(a)(i)_ shall in no event exceed, in the aggregate, the
Purchase Price; _provided_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that the limitations
set forth in this _Section_ _12.2(b)(iii)_ shall not apply to any Losses in
respect of _Section_ __ _ 12.2(a)(ii)_ or _Section_ __ _ 12.2(a)(iii)_; and

 



-100- (iv) The limitations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 12.2(b)_ shall not
apply to any Losses in the case of fraud (as construed in accordance with
Delaware law) with respect to the representations and warranties made by
Sellers in this Agreement.

 

(c) In the event that a Buyer Indemnified Party wishes to seek indemnity under
this _Article XII_ , Buyer shall have the sole and exclusive power to do all
acts or things on behalf of such Buyer Indemnified Party that such Buyer
Indemnified Party is obligated to do or has the right to do under this
_Article XII_ with respect to seeking such indemnity.

 

12.3. _Indemnification by Buyer_. (a) From and after the Closing and subject
to the provisions of this _ARTICLE XII_ , Buyer shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Sellers, their respective Affiliates and their and their
Affiliates respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and
permitted assigns (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties", and each
of the Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties, an
"Indemnified Party") from, against and in respect of any and all Losses
imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by any of the Seller Indemnified
Parties arising out of or resulting from:

(i) the breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by
Buyer in this Agreement or the certificate delivered by Buyer pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 10.2(e)(ii)_ of this Agreement;

 

(ii) the breach in any material respect of any covenant or agreement made by

(i) Buyer shall have no Liability for any claim for indemnification pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 12.3(a)(i)_ unless (A) the Losses for which Buyer would be
responsible for such claim and all related claims exceed the De Minimis Amount
and (B) the aggregate amount of Losses in respect of breaches of Buyers
representations and warranties (excluding all Losses associated with claims
less than the De Minimis Amount) exceeds the Deductible, in which event Buyer
shall be liable solely for Losses in excess of the Deductible up to the Cap;
_provided_ that the limitations set forth in this Section 12.2(b)(i) shall
not apply to any Losses in respect of breaches of or inaccuracies in any Buyer
Fundamental Representations; and

 

(ii) Buyers aggregate liability for indemnification under _Section_ __ _

forth in this _Section_ _12.3(b)(ii)_ shall not apply to any Losses in respect
of _Section_ __ _ 12.3(a)(ii)_ or _Section_ __ _ 12.3(a)(iii)_.

 



-101- (iii) The limitations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 12.3(b)_ shall not
apply to any Losses in the case of fraud (as construed in accordance with
Delaware law) with respect to the representations and warranties made by Buyer
in this Agreement.

 

12.4. _Third Party Claims_. (a) In the event that an Indemnified Party seeks
indemnity under this _Article XII_ with respect to any claim or demand for
which an indemnifying party (an "Indemnifying Party") may have Liability to
any Indemnified Party hereunder that is asserted against or sought to be
collected from any Indemnified Party by a third party (a "Third Party
Claim"), such Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no event more than ten
(10) days following such Indemnified Partys receipt of a Third Party Claim,
notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such Third Party Claim, the
specific section(s) of this Agreement that form the basis of the claim for
indemnification, the amount or the estimated amount of damages sought under
such Third Party Claim to the extent then ascertainable, any other remedy
sought thereunder, any relevant time constraints relating thereto and, to the
extent practicable, any other material details pertaining thereto, in each
case if such information is known and reasonably available (a "Claim
Notice");  _provided_ , ___however_ , that the failure to timely give a Claim
Notice or to include the foregoing information shall affect the rights of an
Indemnified Party hereunder only to the extent that such failure has an actual
and material prejudicial effect on the defenses available to the Indemnifying
Party with respect to such Third Party Claim.

(b) Within thirty (30) days after receipt of any Claim Notice, the
Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party,
assume control of the defense of the Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying
Partys sole cost and expense with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party, so long as (a) such Third Party Claim does not seek an
injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party, (b) such
Third Party Claim does not relate to or otherwise arise in connection with
Taxes or any criminal enforcement action, (c) such Third Party Claim, together
with any other pending Direct Claims and Third Party Claims, would not
reasonably be expected to, if successful, result in Seller Parents aggregate
liability for indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 12.2(a)(i)_ exceeding the
then-remaining Cap, and (d) the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of
such Third Party Claim with reasonable diligence. If the Indemnifying Party
does not so assume control of the defense of such claim, the Indemnified Party
shall have the sole power to direct and control such defense with counsel
selected by the Indemnified Party. The Party not controlling the defense of
such claim shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in any
such defense and to employ separate counsel of its choosing at its own cost
and expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the Indemnifying Party assumes
control of the defense of such claim and the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party have materially conflicting interests or different defenses
with respect to such claim that cause the Indemnified Party to hire its own
separate counsel with respect to such proceeding, the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party shall be considered "Losses" for
purposes of this Agreement. Neither Party shall, without the prior written
consent of the other Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), settle, compromise or agree to the settlement or
compromise of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party
Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the consent of the

 



-102-  Indemnified Party shall not be required with respect to any settlement or
judgment if (i) the Indemnifying Party agrees in writing to pay or cause to be
paid any amounts payable pursuant to such settlement or judgment (net of any
applicable Deductible), (ii) such settlement or judgement would not restrict
the future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates, (iii) such settlement or judgment involves no finding or
admission of a violation of Law or violation of the rights of any Person or
admission of Liability by or other obligations on the part of the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates, and (iv) such settlement or judgment includes
a complete release of the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates from further
Liability.

(c) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall reasonably
cooperate in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third Party
Claim, including by providing access to each others relevant business records
and other documents and employees, it being understood that the reasonable
costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party relating thereto shall be
considered Losses. The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall keep
each other fully informed with respect to the status of such Third Party
Claim.

 

(d) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use reasonable best
efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent with
applicable Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel and
others representing any party to a Third Party Claim to be made so as to
preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges.

 

12.5. _Direct Claims_. If an Indemnified Party wishes to make a claim for
indemnification hereunder for a Loss that does not result from a Third Party
Claim (a "Direct Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying
Party in writing of such Direct Claim (a "Direct Claim Notice"), the specific
section(s) of this Agreement that form the basis of the claim for
indemnification, the amount or the estimated amount of damages sought with
respect to such Direct Claim to the extent then ascertainable, any other
remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time constraints relating thereto and,
to the extent practicable, any other material details pertaining thereto. The
Indemnifying Party shall have a period of thirty (30) days within which to
respond to such Direct Claim by either delivering to the Indemnified Party in
writing a response in which the Indemnifying Party will either: (i) agree
that the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification for all of the
Losses at issue in the Direct Claim or (ii) dispute the Indemnified Partys
entitlement to indemnification by delivering to the Indemnified Party a
written notice. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such
thirty (30) day period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have
irrevocably accepted the Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party rejects all
or any part of the Direct Claim, the Indemnified Party shall be free to seek
enforcement of its rights to indemnification under this Agreement with respect
to such Direct Claim.

 

12.6. _Adjustments to Losses_.

 

(a) _Insurance_. In calculating the amount of any Loss, the proceeds actually
received by the Indemnified Party under any insurance policy or pursuant to
any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against any other Person
(after deducting therefrom the full amount of the reasonable fees, costs and
expenses incurred by it in procuring such recovery and any Taxes payable
thereon), in each case relating to a Third Party Claim or a Direct Claim for
which such Indemnified Party is then being indemnified pursuant to this
_Article XII_ , shall be deducted before such Loss is paid pursuant to this
_Article XII_.

 



-103- (b) _Taxes_. In calculating the amount of any Loss, there shall be deducted an
amount equal to any net Tax benefit actually realized as a result of such
Loss by the Party claiming such Loss, solely for the taxable year of the
incurrence, accrual or payment of any such Loss.

 

(c) _Reimbursement_. If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount from a third
party in respect of a Loss that is the subject of indemnification hereunder
after all or a portion of such Loss has been paid by an Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this _ARTICLE XII_ , the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to
the Indemnifying Party the excess (if any) of (i) the amount paid by the
Indemnifying Party in respect of such Loss, _plus_ the amount received from
the third party in respect thereof (after deducting therefrom the full amount
of the reasonable fees, costs and expenses incurred by it in procuring
such recovery and any Taxes payable thereon), _less_ (ii) the full amount of
the Loss.

(d) _Other Recovery_. The provisions of this _ARTICLE XII_ are not intended
to permit duplicate recoveries on the same matters. To the extent that any
payment is made with respect to any particular Loss under _ARTICLE VIII_ or
such Loss is reflected on the Final Closing Statement and resulted in a
reduction to Final Closing Adjustment Amount, no recovery in respect of the
same Claim will be available under this _ARTICLE XII_.

 

(e) _Right of Offset_. If a Buyer Indemnified Party incurs or suffers Losses
for which Buyer (subject to the limitations set forth elsewhere in this
_ARTICLE XII_ ) is otherwise entitled to indemnification under _Section_ __ _
12.2(a)(ii)_ or _Section_ __ _ 12.2(a)(iii)_, Buyer may set off against
Deferred Payments otherwise payable under  _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(iii)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(iv)_ Buyers good faith estimate of the amount of such
indemnifiable Losses (the "Setoff Amount"). If Buyer exercises its setoff
right under this _Section_ __ _ 12.6(e)_, Buyer will provide Seller Parent
with a written certificate, signed by Buyers Chief Financial Officer,
certifying that the amount set off by Buyer represents Buyers good
faith estimate of such Losses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if within
fifteen (15) days following receipt of such certificate Seller Parent notifies
Buyer in writing that it disputes Buyers assertion that Seller Parent is
obligated to indemnify Buyer for such Losses under _Section_ __ _
12.2(a)(ii)_ or _Section_ __ _ 12.2(a)(iii)_ or the amount set off by Buyer,
then pending the Parties agreement regarding the appropriate setoff (if
any) or a determination by a court of competent jurisdiction of the proper
amount that Buyer may set off (if any) in accordance with _Section_ __ _
13.10_, Buyer will pay the Setoff Amount into an interest-bearing escrow
account established for the purpose at a mutually acceptable bank or trust
company pending a decision of such court. If it is finally determined by such
court that Buyer has set off an amount that exceeds the amount of Losses for
which Seller Parent is obligated to indemnify Buyer under _Section_ __ _
12.2(a)(ii)_ or _Section_ __ _ 12.2(a)(iii)_, then Buyer will cause the
amount of such excess, plus interest earned on such amount in such escrow
account, to be released from the escrow account and paid to Seller Parent.
Subject to Buyers compliance with its obligations in this _Section_ __ _
12.6(e)_, the exercise of such right of setoff by Buyer in good faith, whether
or not ultimately determined to be justified, will not constitute an event of
default hereunder. Neither the exercise of nor the failure to exercise such
right of setoff will constitute an election of remedies or limit Buyer in any
manner in the enforcement of any other remedies that may be available to it.
For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Buyer be entitled to set off
against any Royalty Payments payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)(v)_.

 



-104- 12.7. _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. Except as otherwise
required by applicable Law, all payments made by an Indemnifying Party to an
Indemnified Party in respect of any claim pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.2_ or
_Section_ __ _ 12.3_ shall be treated as adjustments to the purchase price
for all applicable Tax purposes.

12.8. _Exclusive Remedy_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 13.12_, from and
after the Closing, except in the event of fraud (as construed in accordance
with Delaware law) with respect to the representations and warranties made by
Seller Parent or Buyer in this Agreement, the exclusive remedy for any
Indemnified Party for Losses or other monetary damages arising from a breach
of this Agreement shall be the indemnification provided in this _ARTICLE XII_.

12.9.  _Duty to Mitigate_. Nothing herein shall relieve any Indemnified Party
of its common law duty to mitigate Losses. Without limiting the foregoing,
each Indemnified Party shall take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate
all Losses after becoming aware of any event that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder, in each
case to the extent such mitigation is required by Law.

 

12.10. _Investigation_. The right to indemnification or any other remedy based
on representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of a Party in this
Agreement, or in any Ancillary Agreement, shall not be affected by any
investigation conducted by any Indemnified Party or any other Person at any
time, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by any
Indemnified Party or any other Person at any time, whether before or after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing, with
respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of, or compliance with, any such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

ARTICLE XIII.

 

MISCELLANEOUS

13.1.  _Assignment_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 1.3_, this Agreement may not
be assigned or otherwise transferred by either Party without the prior written
consent of the other Party; provided, however, that (1) Buyer shall have the
right to assign all or certain provisions of this Agreement or any interest
herein, without the consent of Sellers, as collateral security to any
Financing Sources, but no such collateral assignment shall release Buyer of
its obligations under this Agreement and (2) Seller Parent shall have the
right to assign all or any part of its rights to receive the Royalty Payments
and its rights set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.9_,
and delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement related thereto
(including pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.8 _and _Section_ __ _ 2.9_), to any
third party without the consent of Buyer, subject to the conditions set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 2.7_. Any purported assignment in violation of this
_Section_ __ _ 13.1_ shall be void _ab initio_.

 

13.2. _Public Announcements_. Neither Party nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall issue any press release or make any public announcement
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Party and any of 

 



-105-  their respective Affiliates may make any public disclosure (a) it believes
in good faith, upon advice of counsel, is required by applicable Law or any
listing or trading agreement concerning its publicly traded securities (in
which case the disclosing Party or Affiliate will provide reasonable advance
notice, to the extent reasonably practicable, to the other Party prior to
making the disclosure and will in good faith consider the reasonable comments
of the other Party on such disclosure) or (b) that is substantially consistent
with a prior press release or public announcement made with the consent of the
other Party; _provided further_ , _however_ , that the Parties shall mutually
agree on any press release(s) made with respect to the execution of this
Agreement and the Transactions.

13.3.  _Confidentiality_. Buyer and Seller Parent agree that the
Confidentiality Agreement, as it relates to Information, shall, as of the
Closing Date, be terminated and of no further force and effect.

 

(a) Seller Parent agrees that, for a period of five (5) years after the
Closing, Sellers and their Representatives shall keep confidential and
exercise the same degree of care with respect to maintaining the
confidentiality of any Buyer Information in any of their possession that
Sellers exercise with respect to similar types of their own proprietary
information, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care, except
that, if any Buyer Information is required by Law or legal or administrative
process to be disclosed, Seller Parent shall promptly (and in any event prior
to making such disclosure, to the extent permitted by Law) notify Buyer of
such disclosure requirement so that Buyer or its Affiliates may seek a
protective Order or other appropriate remedy. In the event that no such
protective Order or other remedy is obtained, or Buyer does not waive
compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 13.3(b)_, and the applicable Seller or
its Representatives are nonetheless legally compelled to disclose such Buyer
Information, such Seller or its Representatives, as the case may be, will
furnish only that portion of the Buyer Information which such Seller or
Representative is advised by counsel is legally required to be furnished and
will give Buyer written notice of the Buyer Information to be disclosed as far
in advance as reasonably practicable and exercise all reasonable efforts to
obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the
Buyer Information. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 13.3(b)_, the term
"Buyer Information" means (i) all information, knowledge and data of Seller
Parent and its Affiliates as of immediately prior to the Closing to the extent
related to the Business, the Acquired Assets, the Products and/or the Assumed
Liabilities, (ii) all information, knowledge and data provided by Buyer or
any of its Affiliates to any Seller in connection with the Transactions, other
than any information contemplated by clause (i), and (iii) all analyses,
compilations, forecasts, studies, interpretations, summaries, notes, data and
other documents and materials (in any form or medium of communication, whether
written, oral, electronic or magnetic), whether prepared by any Seller, such
Sellers Representatives or others, which contain, reflect or are generated
from or based upon, in whole or in part, the information referred to in
clauses (i) and (ii) of this sentence, other than any such information that
(A) only with respect to (ii) above, is known to any Seller prior to receipt
thereof from Buyer or any of its Affiliates, (B) is disclosed to a Seller by a
third party which has, or is reasonably believed by such Seller to have, a
legal right to make such disclosure without requiring such Seller to maintain
the confidentiality thereof, (C) is or becomes part of the public domain
through no fault of any Seller, or (D) is independently developed by or for
any Seller, without reliance on or reference to any information
contemplated by clauses (i) or (ii) of this sentence.

 



-106- (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller Parent shall be permitted to
disclose the reports and information delivered by Buyer pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.8_ or otherwise related to the Royalty Payments and Net Sales (the
"Disclosure Information") in Seller Parents periodic filings with the
SEC, earnings press releases and investor and analyst conference calls and
presentations, as, and to the extent, required, in the reasonable advice of
Seller Parents legal counsel, to comply with applicable laws, including the
rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and applicable stock exchange
regulations and requirements. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller Parent shall
be permitted to disclose the Disclosure Information in its periodic filings
with the SEC, earnings press releases and investor and analyst conference
calls notwithstanding whether Buyer has publicly disclosed such Disclosure
Information but only as, and to the extent, required, in the reasonable advice
of Seller Parents legal counsel, to comply with applicable laws, including
the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and applicable stock exchange
regulations and requirements; provided, that, Seller Parent shall provide
prior written notice to Buyer of its public disclosure of any Disclosure
Information so as to enable Buyer to determine, to the extent possible,
whether to make public disclosure of such Disclosure Information at or about
the same time.

 

13.4. _Expenses_. Whether or not the Transactions are consummated, and except
as otherwise specified herein, including  _Section_ __ _ 6.2(g)_, each Party
shall bear its own costs and expenses in connection with this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements and with respect to the Transactions.

 

13.5. _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof becomes or is declared by a Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. Further, to the extent
necessary, the Parties agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision
of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to
the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void
or unenforceable provision.

13.6. _Entire Agreement; Amendment_. This Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (including the Transfer Documents after
their execution and delivery hereunder) contain the entire agreement of the
Parties with respect to the Transactions, superseding all negotiations, prior
discussions and preliminary agreements made prior to the date hereof with
respect to the Transactions. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented
or otherwise modified except by an instrument in writing signed by all of
the Parties. No such supplement, amendment or addition shall be evidence, in
and of itself, that the representations and warranties in the corresponding
section are no longer true and correct in all material respects.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment of _Section_ __ _ 13.1_, this
_Section_ __ _ 13.6_, _Section_ __ _ 13.7_, _Section_ __ _ 13.10_ and the
definition of "Financing Source" and the capitalized terms used therein (or
any amendment to any other Section of this Agreement that modifies the terms
of _Section_ __ _ 13.1_, this _Section_ __ _ 13.6_, _Section_ __ _ 13.7_, 
_Section_ __ _ 13.10_ and the definition of "Financing Source" and the
capitalized terms used therein) shall not be enforceable against the Financing
Sources without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources and any
purported amendment by any party in a manner which does not comply with this
_Section_ __ _ 13.6_ shall be void.

 



-107- 13.7. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is solely for the benefit
of the Parties and, to the extent set forth herein, their respective
Affiliates and the Indemnified Parties, and no provision of this Agreement
shall be deemed to otherwise confer upon any other third parties any remedy,
Claim, Liability, reimbursement or other right in excess of those existing
without reference to this Agreement, _provided_ that the Financing Sources and
their respective successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns shall
each be a third party beneficiary with respect to their respective rights
under _Section_ __ _ 13.1_, _Section_ __ _ 13.6_, _Section_ __ _ 13.10_ and
this _Section_ __ _ 13.7_. None of the Debt Financing Sources will have any
liability to Seller Parent or its Affiliates relating to or arising out of
this Agreement, the Debt Financing or otherwise, whether at law, or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither Seller Parent nor any of its
Affiliates will have any rights or claims against any of the Financing
Sources hereunder or thereunder.

13.8. _Waiver_. The waiver by a Party of any breach of any of the terms,
covenants or conditions of this Agreement or of any right or privilege
conferred by this Agreement shall not be construed as a subsequent waiver of
any such terms, covenants, conditions, rights or privileges or as a waiver of
any other terms, covenants, conditions, rights or privileges. No waiver shall
be effective unless it is in writing and signed by an authorized
Representative of the waiving Party.

 

13.9. _Governing Law_. This Agreement (and any Claim or controversy arising
out of or relating to this Agreement) shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any
choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the application
of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 

13.10. _Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. (a) Subject to
_Section_ __ _ 2.8_ (Net Sales Reporting),  _Section_ __ _ 2.11(b)_
(Purchase Price Allocation) and _Section_ __ _ 3.3_ (Post-Closing
Adjustment), each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware state
court, or federal court of the United States of America, in each case sitting
in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, State of Delaware, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action, suit or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement delivered in
connection herewith or the Transactions or for recognition or enforcement of
any judgment relating thereto, and each Party hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally: (i) agrees not to commence any such action, suit or
proceeding except in such courts; (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any
such action, suit or proceeding may be heard and determined in such Delaware
state court or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, in such federal
court; (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do
so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any such action, suit or proceeding in any such Delaware state or federal
court; and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action, suit or
proceeding in any such Delaware state or federal court. Each Party agrees
that a final judgment in any such action, suit or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. Each Party irrevocably
consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in _Section_
__ _ 13.15_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any Party to
serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable
Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Parties agrees that it will
not bring or support any action, cause of action,

 



-108-  claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether
in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the
Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not limited to,
any dispute arising out of or reliant in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter
or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the Commercial Division,
New York State Supreme Court and the federal courts, in each case, sitting in
the City of New York, borough of Manhattan (and, in each case, the applicable
state and federal appeals courts sitting in the City of New York or, if not
available or applicable, the State of New York).

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH
OR THE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING ANY CLAIM, CONTROVERSY, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE
OF ACTION AGAINST OR INVOLVING ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH
WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH
WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION_ __ _ 13.10(b)_.

 

13.11. _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached
or threatened to be breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall
be entitled (without proof of actual damages or otherwise or posting
or securing any bond) to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, these being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. The right to specific performance shall include
the right of Seller Parent to cause Buyer to cause the Transactions to be
consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions and obligations set
forth in this Agreement. The Parties further agree not to assert that a
remedy of specific performance is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or
inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages
would provide adequate remedy. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees
that the right to specific performance and the other relief contemplated
herein is an integral part of the Transactions and without such right, none of
the Parties would have entered into this Agreement.

 



-109- 13.12. _Representation by Counsel_. Each Party represents and agrees with each
other that it has been represented by or had the opportunity to be
represented by independent counsel of its own choosing, and that it has had
the full right and opportunity to consult with its respective attorney(s),
that to the extent, if any, that it desired, it availed itself of this right
and opportunity, that it or its authorized officers (as the case may be) have
carefully read and fully understand this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements in their entirety and have had them fully explained to them by
such Partys respective counsel, that each is fully aware of the contents
thereof and their meaning, intent and legal effect, and that it or its
authorized officer (as the case may be) is competent to execute this Agreement
and has executed this Agreement free from coercion, duress or undue
influence.

13.13. _Bulk Transfers_. Buyer waives compliance with the provisions of all
applicable Laws relating to bulk transfers in connection with the transfer of
the Acquired Assets.

13.14. _Counterparts; Signature Pages_. The Parties may execute this
Agreement in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an
original and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement. Any signature page hereto delivered by facsimile
machine or by e-mail (including in portable document format (.pdf), as a joint
photographic experts group (.jpg) file, or otherwise) shall be binding to the
same extent as an original signature page, with regard to any agreement
subject to the terms hereof or any amendment thereto and may be used in lieu
of the original signatures for all purposes. Any Party that delivers such a
signature page agrees to later deliver an original counterpart to any Party
that requests it.

13.15. _Notices_. All notices or other communications required or permitted to
be given hereunder shall be in writing and may be delivered by hand, by
nationally recognized private courier (for delivery in no fewer than two (2)
Business Days with return receipt requested), by facsimile or by email. Except
as provided otherwise herein, notices delivered by hand shall be deemed given
upon receipt; notices delivered by nationally recognized private courier shall
be deemed given upon receipt; notices delivered by facsimile shall be deemed

transmission; and notices delivered by email shall be deemed given on the date

deemed given upon receipt is given after 5:00 p.m. in the place of receipt

_W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_   _E_ _T_ _H_ :

WHEREAS, Seller Parent and Buyer have entered into a Purchase and Sale
Agreement, dated as of November 28, 2017 (the "Purchase Agreement");

subject to the conditions set forth herein.

 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and

shall provide (or cause to be provided) to Buyer or its Affiliates the
services described on _Annex_ __ _ A_, solely with respect to the Products
and the Business (collectively, the "Services"). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) Buyer may determine from
time to time that it does not require all of the Services or that it does not
require such Services for the entire Service Period and (ii) nothing herein
is intended to relieve Buyer of its responsibilities under the Purchase
Agreement or applicable legal requirements.

 

2.2 _Standards_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that Seller Parent shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct the Services substantially as
Seller Parent and/or its Affiliates has customarily conducted such activities
with respect to the Products and the Business and in compliance in all
material respects with applicable Law. Seller Parent agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to assign sufficient resources and qualified
personnel as are reasonably required to perform the Services in accordance
with the standards set forth in the preceding sentence. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, (i) neither Seller Parent nor any of its
Affiliates will be required to perform or to cause to be performed any of the
Services for the benefit of any third party (other than Buyer or its
Affiliates) or in a manner (including in terms of volume and scope) that is
inconsistent with the past practices of Seller Parent or its Affiliates, as
applicable, and (ii) neither Seller Parent nor any of its Affiliates makes any
representations or warranties, expressed or implied, with respect to the
Services.

2.3 _Performance by Affiliates and Third Parties_. Seller Parent may discharge
its obligations hereunder through any of its Affiliates or through any third
party. Seller Parent hereby guarantees the performance by such Affiliates and
third parties of its obligations under this Agreement and shall cause such
Affiliates and third parties to comply with the provisions of this Agreement
in connection with such performance.

2.4 _Systems Access, Security, and Integrity_. Each Party shall (and
shall cause each Person acting on its behalf to): (i) not attempt to obtain
access to, use or interfere with any information technology systems of the
other Party or any data owned, used or processed by the other Party, except to
the extent required to do so to receive or provide, as the case may be, the
Services or as expressly permitted herein; and (ii) maintain reasonable
security measures designed to protect the systems of the other Party to which
it has access pursuant to this 

 



-2-  Agreement from access by unauthorized third parties, and any "back door",
"time bomb", "Trojan Horse", "worm", "drop dead device", "virus" or other
computer software routine intended or designed to (1) permit access or use of
information technology systems by a third party other than as authorized by
the other Party, or (2) disable, damage or erase or disrupt or impair the
normal operation of the information technology systems of the other Party or
its Affiliates.

2.5 _Service Fees; Invoicing_. Buyer shall pay to Seller Parent, for each
Service provided hereunder, a fee (with respect to each Service, a "Service
Fee") equal to (i) the Compensation Expense with respect to such Service and
(ii) any reasonable additional out-of-pocket costs and expenses of Seller
Parent to provide the Service; _provided_ that in the event any individual
expenditure of out-of-pocket costs exceeds $10,000, Buyer shall have consented
to such expenditure. For purposes of calculating the Service Fee for any
Service, the allocable Compensation Expense with respect to any employee or
consultant of Seller Parent or any Affiliate thereof for performance of such
Service during any period shall be equal to 100% of such persons Compensation
Expense _multiplied by_ the proportion of such persons time that is required
to be devoted to the performance of such Service during such period on the
basis of a 40-hour work week. Service Fees shall be invoiced by Seller Parent
to and payable by Buyer. Amounts payable pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement shall be paid by Buyer to Seller Parent within thirty (30) days
after the date of invoice. Service Fees not paid when due shall bear interest
at the rate of 1.50% per month from the date payment is due until the date

including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, incurred by or on behalf of
Seller Parent in collecting any such invoice shall be recoverable by Seller
Parent from Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6_.

2.6 _Taxes_. The Service Fees payable by Buyer to Seller Parent hereunder
shall, in each case, be taken to be exclusive of any sales Taxes
(collectively, "Sales Tax") properly chargeable in respect of the transactions
hereunder, and an amount equal to such Taxes so chargeable shall, subject to
receipt of a valid Sales Tax receipt or invoice, be paid by Buyer to Seller
Parent in addition to the fees otherwise payable under this Agreement. In the
event that applicable Laws require that any amount in respect of Taxes be
withheld from any payment by Buyer under this Agreement, Buyer shall withhold
the required amounts and pay such withheld amounts over to the applicable
Governmental Authority in accordance with the requirements of applicable Laws,
and, except in the case of any Sales Tax (which amount shall continue to be
due and payable to Seller Parent), any amount so withheld and paid over shall
be treated as having been paid to Seller Parent, and Buyer shall not be
required to pay any additional amount as a result of or in respect of such
withholding.

3\. _Cooperation_. Buyer shall cause its employees to, and Seller Parent
shall cause its and its Affiliates employees to, cooperate with the employees
of the other Party to enable the provision of Services to Buyer hereunder.
Each of Seller Parent and Buyer shall designate a point of contact who shall
be responsible for the day-to-day implementation of this Agreement, including
attempted resolution of any disputes that may arise during the performance of
the Parties respective obligations hereunder. The initial point of contact
designated by Seller Parent shall be [], and the initial point of contact
designated by Buyer shall be []. Each of Seller Parent and Buyer may change
its point of contact by written notice to the other Party.

 



-3- 4\. _Confidentiality Obligations_. The Parties acknowledge that the
information provided to them and their representatives in connection with

under Section 13.3 of the Purchase Agreement.

Service for a period equal to the shorter of (i)(A) the number of days set
forth on _Annex A_ for such Service _multiplied by_ (B) two (2) and (ii) 30
days, in each case by written notice to Seller Parent no less than five (5)
Business Days prior to the then scheduled termination of such Service (the
"Service Period").

5.2  _Termination for Breach_. A Party may terminate this Agreement

individual Service provided hereunder at any time;  _provided_ that at least

Agreement shall not affect in any way the survival of any rights, duties or
obligations of the Parties set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.5_,  _Section_ __ _

in this Agreement, Buyer shall remain obligated to pay Seller Parent for (i)
any invoice for any Service rendered prior to the effectiveness of such
termination or expiration, (ii) subject to the provision by Seller Parent to
Buyer of reasonable supporting documentation, any non-refundable or non-
cancellable out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred by or on behalf of Seller

date hereof. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified, except by an instrument in writing signed by both Seller Parent

agrees to later deliver an original counterpart to any Party that requests

be effective unless it is in writing and signed by an authorized
Representative of the waiving Party.

 

7.7 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. Further, the Parties agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

7.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement (and any Claim or controversy arising out
of or relating to this Agreement) shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any
choice or conflict of Law provision or rule that would cause the application

7.9.1 Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself
and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware State court,

by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.
Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided
for notices in Section 13.15 of the Purchase Agreement. Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any Party to serve process in any other
manner permitted by applicable Law.

 

7.9.2 EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT

INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS.
EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR

OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF
SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH
WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO

REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT

 

This REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT, dated as of [], 2017 (this "Agreement"),
is made between Melinta Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company") and The Medicines Company, a Delaware Corporation (the
"Shareholder").

 

A. On November 28, 2017, the Company and the Shareholder entered into a
Purchase and Sale Agreement (as may be further amended from time to time, the
"Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to which the Shareholder and certain of its
subsidiaries sold certain assets and the capital stock of certain subsidiaries
to the Company (the "Purchase").

 

B. In connection with the Purchase and pursuant to the Purchase Agreement the
Shareholder acquired Buyer Common Stock (as defined in the Purchase
Agreement) ("Company Common Stock").

C. In order to induce the Shareholder to adopt and approve the
Purchase Agreement and approve the Purchase and other transactions
contemplated in the Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed to provide the
registration rights set forth in this Agreement.

 

D. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, capitalized terms used in
this Agreement and set forth in Section 9 are used as defined in Section 9\.

Now, therefore, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

 _1._ Mandatory Shelf Registration.

 

(a) The Company agrees to (i) file with the SEC on the date hereof, but in no
event later than two business days following the date hereof, a shelf
Registration Statement on Form S-3 or such other form under the Securities Act
then available to the Company that covers all Registrable Securities then
outstanding for an offering to be made on a delayed or continuous basis
pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act or any successor rule thereto
(the "Mandatory Shelf Registration Statement") and (ii) use its best efforts
to cause the Mandatory Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective
by the SEC as soon as reasonably practical thereafter, but in no event later
than 90 calendar days after the initial date of filing thereof; provided,
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if, during the period beginning on
February 14, 2018 and ending on March 16, 2018 (the "Effectiveness Grace
Period"), the Mandatory Shelf Registration Statement has otherwise satisfied
all requirements for the declaration of its effectiveness under applicable
SEC regulations and the Company has not filed its Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2017 (the "2017 Form 10-K"), the Company shall not be
in breach of its obligations under this clause (ii) for so long as the Company
qualifies as a "Loss Corporation" within the meaning of Section 382 of the IRC
and uses commercially reasonable efforts to file the 2017 Form 10-K by
February 28, 2018, but in no event later than the end of the Effectiveness
Grace Period. The Company shall consult with the Shareholder if it intends to
include in the Mandatory Shelf Registration Statement securities held by
other securityholders of the Company and, if requested by the Shareholder, the
Mandatory Shelf Registration Statement will not include such other securities.

 

 (b) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Mandatory Shelf Registration Statement to remain continuously effective until
the earliest of (A) the sale pursuant to a registration statement of all of
the Registrable Securities covered by the Mandatory Shelf Registration
Statement, (B) the sale, transfer or other disposition pursuant to Rule 144
of all of the Registrable Securities covered by the Mandatory Shelf
Registration Statement, (C) such time as all of the Registrable Securities
covered by the Mandatory Shelf Registration Statement have been sold to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or (D) the fifth anniversary of the
effective date of the Mandatory Shelf Registration Statement. The Mandatory
Shelf Registration Statement shall provide for the resale of Registrable
Securities from time to time, and pursuant to any method or combination of
methods legally available to, and requested by, the Shareholder, including an
underwritten offering. The Company will pay all Registration Expenses incurred
in connection with any registration pursuant to this Section 1\.

(c) If the Shareholder intends to distribute Registrable Securities under the
Mandatory Shelf Registration Statement by means of an underwritten resale
offering (an "Offering"), the Shareholder will so advise the Company by
written notice (the "Offering Notice"). In such event, the Shareholder will
have the right to select one managing underwriter for the Offering, provided
that such managing underwriter is reasonably satisfactory to the Company and
the Company shall cause there to be Full Cooperation. The Offering
Notice shall specify the amount of Registrable Securities to be included in
the Offering and the intended method or methods of disposition. If at the time
the Shareholder provides an Offering Notice it is reasonably expected that
other securityholders of the Company intend to effect an underwritten resale
offering of Company securities and the underwriter for the Offering or an
underwriter for the offerings to be conducted by other securityholders of the
Company advise the Company that, in its reasonable opinion, the number of
Registrable Securities to be sold by all securityholders of the Company is
greater than the amount that can be offered without adversely affecting the
marketability of the Offering (taking into consideration any intended
distribution by the Prior Holders or Deerfield Holders in a concurrent
underwritten resale offering), including the price at which such securities
can be sold, the Company will include in such Offering the maximum number of
securities that in the opinion of such underwriters can be sold without
adversely affecting the marketability of the Offering, including the price at
which such securities can be sold, and shall be allocated among the
Registrable Securities, Prior Holder Securities and Deerfield Holder
Securities, as applicable, pro rata among the holders thereof on the basis of
the number of securities so requested to be included in such Offering owned by
each such holder or in such other manner as they agree. The Shareholder shall
be entitled to no more than four (4) Offerings pursuant to an Offering Notice
under the Mandatory Shelf Registration Statement.

 

 _2._ Piggyback Registrations.

 

(a) _Right to Piggyback_. At any time after the date hereof, whenever the
Company proposes to register shares of Company Common Stock ("Common Shares")
(other than pursuant to (i) registrations on Form S-8 or any similar form(s)
solely for registration of securities in connection with an employee benefit
plan or dividend reinvestment plan, (ii) registrations on Form S-4 or any
similar form(s) solely for registration of securities in connection with a
business combination, (iii) a Mandatory Shelf Registration Statement, or (iv)
a shelf registration statement filed for Vatera Healthcare Partners LLC
pursuant to the Prior Registration Rights Agreements or for affiliates of
Deerfield Management Company L.P. (the "Deerfield  

 



\- 2 -  Holders") pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter (as defined in the Purchase
Agreement)), whether for its own account or for the account of one or more
securityholders of the Company, and the registration form to be filed may be
used for the registration or qualification for distribution of Registrable
Securities, the Company will give prompt written notice to the Shareholder of
its intention to effect such a registration and will include in such
registration all Registrable Securities with respect to which the Company has
received a written request for inclusion therein within 15 days after the date
of the Companys notice (a "Piggyback Registration"). Once the Shareholder
has made such a written request, it may withdraw its Registrable Securities
from such Piggyback Registration by giving written notice to the Company and
the managing underwriter, if any, on or before the fifth (5th) day prior to
the anticipated effective date of such Piggyback Registration. The Company may
terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it and covered by this
Section 2 prior to the effectiveness of such registration, whether or not the
Shareholder has elected to include Registrable Securities in such
registration, and except for the obligation to pay Registration Expenses
pursuant to Section 2(c) the Company will have no liability to the Shareholder
in connection with such termination or withdrawal.

(b) _Underwritten Registration_. If the registration referred to in Section
2(a) is proposed to be underwritten, the Company will so advise the
Shareholder in the written notice given pursuant to Section 2(a). In such
event, the right of the Shareholder to registration pursuant to this Section 2
will be conditioned upon the Shareholders participation in such underwriting
and the inclusion of the Shareholders Registrable Securities in the
underwriting, and the Shareholder will (together with the Company and the
other holders distributing their securities through such underwriting) enter
into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter or
underwriters selected for such underwriting by the Company. If the Shareholder
disapproves of the terms of the underwriting, it may elect to withdraw
therefrom by written notice to the Company and the managing underwriter.

(c) _Piggyback Registration Expenses_. Except to the extent prohibited by
applicable law, the Company will pay all Registration Expenses in connection
with any Piggyback Registration, whether or not any registration or prospectus
becomes effective or final.

 

(d) _Priority on Primary Registrations_. If a Piggyback Registration relates
to an underwritten primary offering on behalf of the Company, and the
managing underwriters advise the Company that in their opinion the number of
securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the number
which can be sold without adversely affecting the marketability of the
offering, including the price at which such securities can be sold, the
Company will include in such registration the maximum number of securities
that in the opinion of such underwriters can be sold without adversely
affecting the marketability of the offering, including the price at which
such securities can be sold, which securities will be so included in the
following order of priority: (i) first, the securities the Company proposes to
sell, (ii) second, the Registrable Securities and Prior Holder Securities
requested to be included in such registration, pro rata among the Shareholder
and the Prior Holders of such securities on the basis of the number of
Registrable Securities and Prior Holder Securities so requested to
be included therein owned by each such holder or in such other manner as they
may agree, and (iii) third, other securities requested to be included in such
registration.

 



\- 3 - (e) _Priority on Secondary Registrations_. If a Piggyback Registration relates
solely to an underwritten secondary registration on behalf of other holders
of the Companys securities, and the managing underwriters advise the Company
that in their opinion the number of securities requested to be included in
such registration exceeds the number which can be sold without adversely
affecting the marketability of the offering, including the price at which such
securities can be sold, the Company will include in such registration the
maximum number of securities that in the opinion of such underwriters can be
sold without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering, including
the price at which such securities can be sold, which securities will be so
included in the following order of priority: (i) first, the securities
requested to be included therein by the holders requesting such registration,
(ii) second, (A) to the extent none of the securities in subsection (i) above
are Registrable Securities, Deerfield Holder Securities or Prior
Holder Securities then Registrable Securities, Deerfield Holder Securities
and Prior Holder Securities pro rata among the holders thereof on the basis of
the number of securities so requested to be included therein owned by each
such holder or in such other manner as they agree, (B) to the extent the
securities requested in subsection (i) are Registrable Securities then Prior
Holder Securities and Deerfield Holder Securities pro rata among the holders
thereof on the basis of the number of securities so requested to be included
therein owned by each such holder or in such other manner as they may agree or
(C) to the extent the securities requested in subsection (i) are Prior Holder
Securities then Registrable Securities and Deerfield Holder Securities pro
rata among the holders thereof on the basis of the number of securities so
requested to be included therein owned by each such holder or in such other
manner as they may agree so requested to be included therein and (iii) third,
other securities requested to be included in such registration.

_3._ _Registration Procedures_. Whenever the Shareholder has requested that
any Registrable Securities be registered pursuant to this Agreement (or in
connection with the Mandatory Shelf Registration Statement), the Company will
use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect the registration and sale
of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method of
disposition thereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company will, as expeditiously as commercially reasonable:

 

(a) prepare and (except with respect to the Mandatory Shelf Registration
Statement) file with the SEC a Registration Statement with respect to such
Registrable Securities, make all required filings with FINRA and thereafter
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement
to become effective; provided, that before filing a Registration Statement or
any amendments or supplements thereto, the Company will furnish to one firm
of counsel selected by the Shareholder copies of all such documents proposed
to be filed. The Company will not file any Registration Statement or
amendments or post-effective amendments or supplement to such Registration
Statement to which such counsel will have reasonably objected in writing on
the grounds that such amendment or supplement does not comply in all material
respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act or of the rules and
regulations thereunder.

(b) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such
Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep such Registration
Statement effective for a period of either (i) not less than six months or, if
such Registration Statement relates to an underwritten offering, such longer
period as in the opinion of counsel for the underwriters a prospectus is
required by law to be delivered in connection with sales of Registrable
Securities

 



\- 4 -  by an underwriter or dealer or (ii) such shorter period as will terminate
when all of the securities covered by such Registration Statement have been
disposed of in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the
Shareholder set forth in such Registration Statement (but in any event not
before the expiration of any longer period required under the 1933 Act), and
to comply with the provisions of the 1933 Act with respect to the disposition
of all securities covered by such Registration Statement until such time as
all of such securities have been disposed of in accordance with the intended
methods of disposition by the Shareholder set forth in such
Registration Statement;

(c) furnish to the Shareholder such number of copies, without charge, of such
Registration Statement, each amendment and supplement thereto, including each
preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, all exhibits and other documents
filed therewith and such other documents as the Shareholder may reasonably
request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities
owned by the Shareholder;

(d) use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify such
Registrable Securities under such other securities or blue sky laws of such
jurisdictions as the Shareholder reasonably requests and do any and all other
acts and things that may be necessary or reasonably advisable to enable the
Shareholder to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the
Registrable Securities owned by the Shareholder (provided, that the Company
will not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any
jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this
subsection, (ii) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (iii)
consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction);

 

(e) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Registrable
Securities covered by such Registration Statement to be registered with
or approved by such other governmental agencies, authorities or self-
regulatory bodies as may be necessary or reasonably advisable in light of the
business and operations of the Company to enable the Shareholder to consummate
the disposition of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the
intended method or methods of disposition thereof;

(f) immediately notify the Shareholder and any underwriter(s), at any time
when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the 1933
Act, of the occurrence of any event which will have the result that, the
prospectus contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state
any fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made;

 

(g) notify the Shareholder (i) when the prospectus or any prospectus
supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed and, with respect to
such Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has
become effective, (ii) of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements
to such registration statement or to amend or to supplement such
prospectus or for additional information and (iii) of the issuance by the SEC
of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement
or the initiation of any proceedings for any of such purposes;

 

(h) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all such Registrable
Securities to be listed on each securities exchange on which Common Shares
are then listed;

 



\- 5 - (i) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all such Registrable Securities
not later than the effective date of such Registration Statement;

(j) enter into such customary agreements (including underwriting agreements
with customary provisions) and take all such other actions as the Shareholder
or the underwriters, if any, reasonably requests in order to expedite or
facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities;

 

(k) otherwise use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, and make available to
its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings
statement covering the period of at least twelve months beginning with the
first day of the Companys first full calendar quarter after the effective
date of the Registration Statement, which earnings statement will satisfy the
provisions of Section 12(a) of the 1933 Act and Rule 158 thereunder;

(l) make available for inspection by the Shareholder, any underwriter
participating in any disposition pursuant to such Registration Statement and
any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by the Shareholder or
underwriter, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents
and documents relating to the business of the Company, and cause the Companys
officers, directors, employees and independent accountants to supply all
information reasonably requested by the Shareholder or any such underwriter,
attorney, accountant or agent in connection with such Registration Statement;
provided, that the Shareholder will, and will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each such underwriter, accountant or other agent to enter
into a customary confidentiality agreement in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company; provided further, that such confidentiality
agreement will not contain terms that would prohibit any such Person from
complying with its obligations under applicable law or Nasdaq rules;

(m) in the event of the issuance of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of a Registration Statement, or of any order suspending or
preventing the use of any related prospectus or ceasing trading of any
securities included in such Registration Statement for sale in any
jurisdiction, use its commercially reasonable efforts promptly to obtain the
withdrawal of such order;

(n) enter into such agreements and take such other actions as the Shareholder
or the underwriters reasonably request in order to expedite or facilitate the
disposition of such Registrable Securities, including, without limitation,
preparing for and participating in such number of "road shows" and all such
other customary selling efforts as the underwriters reasonably request in
order to expedite or facilitate such disposition;

(o) prepare and deliver for inclusion in the prospectus pro forma financial
statements with respect to the Purchase in compliance with Regulation S-X of
the 1933 Act and, if such registration relates to an underwritten offering,
obtain a comfort letter, addressed to the Shareholder (and, if such
registration includes an underwritten public offering to the underwriters of
such offering), signed by the Companys independent public accountants in
customary form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by
comfort letters;

 



\- 6 - (p) if such registration relates to an underwritten offering, provide a legal
opinion of the Companys outside counsel, addressed to the underwriters of
any underwritten public offering, with respect to the Registration Statement
and prospectus in customary form and covering such matters of the type
customarily covered by legal opinions of such nature;

(q) if such registration relates to an underwritten offering, furnish to the
Shareholder such information and assistance as the Shareholder may reasonably
request in connection with any "due diligence" effort which the Shareholder
deems appropriate; and

 

(r) use its commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all
other actions, and do and cause to be done all other things, necessary or
reasonably advisable to effect the registration of such Registrable Securities
contemplated hereby.

The Company agrees not to file or make any amendment to any Registration
Statement with respect to any Registrable Securities, or any amendment of or
supplement to the prospectus used in connection therewith, that refers to the
Shareholder by name, or otherwise identifies the Shareholder as the holder of
any securities of the Company, without the consent of the Shareholder, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; unless such disclosure is
required by law.

 

The Company may require the Shareholder to furnish the Company with such
information regarding the Shareholder and pertinent to the
disclosure requirements relating to the registration and the distribution of
such securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request in
writing.

 

 _4._ Registration Expenses.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided for herein, all expenses incidental to the
Companys performance of or compliance with this Agreement, including,
without limitation, all registration and filing fees (including SEC
registration and FINRA filing fees), fees and expenses of compliance with
securities or blue sky laws, word processing, duplicating and printing
expenses, messenger and delivery expenses, transfer agents and registrars
fees, cost of distributing prospectuses in preliminary and final form, as well
as any supplements thereto, and fees and disbursements of counsel for the
Company and all independent certified public accountants, underwriters and
other Persons retained by the Company (all such expenses, "Registration
Expenses"), will be borne by the Company. In addition, the Company will, in
any event, pay its internal expenses (including, without limitation, all
salaries and expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or
accounting duties), the expenses of any annual audit or quarterly review, the
expenses of any liability insurance and the expenses and fees for listing the
securities to be registered on each securities exchange or automatic quotation
system on which similar securities issued by the Company are then listed
(including Nasdaq). Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to Section
4(b), all Selling Expenses in connection with the sale of Registrable
Securities will be borne by the Shareholders.

(b) In connection with the Mandatory Shelf Registration Statement and each
Piggyback Registration, the Company will reimburse the Shareholder for
reasonable fees and disbursements, in an amount not to exceed $25,000, of one
law firm, chosen by the Shareholder.

 



\- 7 - _5._ Indemnification.

 

(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, and hereby does
indemnify and hold harmless, the Shareholder, its affiliates and
their respective officers, directors and partners and each Person who
controls the Shareholder (within the meaning of the 1933 Act) against, and pay
and reimburse such holder, affiliate, director, officer or partner or
controlling person for any losses, claims, damages, expenses, liabilities,
joint or several, to which such holder or any such affiliate, director,
officer or partner or controlling person may become subject under the 1933 Act
or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof)
arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of
material fact contained in any Registration Statement, prospectus
or preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or
any "issuer free writing prospectus" (as defined in 1933 Act Rule 433), (ii)
any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (iii) any
violation or alleged violation by the Company of any rule or regulation
promulgated under the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, FINRA or any state securities
laws applicable to the Company and relating to action or inaction required of
the Company in connection with any such registration, and the Company will pay
and reimburse the Shareholder and each such affiliate, director, officer,
partner and controlling person for the legal fees and expenses of one
counsel, and any other nonlegal expenses, actually and reasonably incurred by
them in connection with investigating, defending or settling any such loss,
claim, liability, action or proceeding or (iv) the failure to include, at the
time of pricing any offering, the information required by Sections 12(a)(2)
and 17(a)(2) of the 1933 Act; provided, that the Company will not be liable in
any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage,
expense, liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense
arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement, or omission or alleged omission, made in such Registration
Statement, any such prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment or
supplement thereto, or in any application, in reliance upon, and in conformity
with, written information prepared and furnished to the Company by the
Shareholder expressly for use therein or by the Shareholders failure to
deliver, to the extent required by law and except to the extent such failure
results from a failure by the Company to comply with Section 3(f), a copy of
the Registration Statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements
thereto after the Company has furnished the Shareholder with a sufficient
number of copies of the same. In connection with an underwritten offering, the
Company, if requested, will indemnify such underwriters, their officers
and directors and each Person who controls such underwriters (within the
meaning of the 1933 Act) to at least the same extent as provided above with
respect to the indemnification of the Shareholder.

 

(b) In connection with any Registration Statement in which the Shareholder is
participating, the Shareholder will furnish to the Company in writing such
information as required by law for use in connection with any such
Registration Statement or prospectus and will indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its directors and officers, each other Person who controls the
Company (within the meaning of the 1933 Act) and each underwriter (to the
extent required by such underwriter) against any losses, claims, damages,
expenses, liabilities (or actions or proceedings, whether commenced or
threatened, in respect thereof), joint or several, to which the Company or
any such director or officer, any such underwriter or controlling person may
become subject under the 1933 Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses,
claims, damages,

 



\- 8 -  liabilities, actions or proceedings arise out of or are based upon (i) any
untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in the
Registration Statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto or in any application or (ii) any omission or
alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading, and the Shareholder will
reimburse the Company and each such director, officer, underwriter and
controlling Person for any legal or any other expenses actually and reasonably
incurred by them in connection with investigating, defending or settling any
such loss, claim, liability, action or proceeding, but in each case only to
the extent, that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or
omission (or alleged omission) is made in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished to the Company by the Shareholder and stated to
be specifically for use therein; provided, that the obligation to indemnify
and hold harmless will be individual and several to the Shareholder and will
be limited to the amount of net proceeds (after giving effect to
underwriters discounts and commissions) received by the Shareholder from the
sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement.

 

(c) Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder will (i) give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which
it seeks indemnification and (ii) unless in such indemnified partys
reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and
indemnifying parties exists with respect to such claim, permit such
indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such defense is assumed,
the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement
made by the indemnified party without its prior written consent (but such
consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). An indemnifying party
who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim will
not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for
all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim,
unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of
interest exists between such indemnified party and any other of such
indemnified parties with respect to such claim. Failure to give prompt
written notice shall not release the indemnifying party from its obligations
hereunder except to the extent that such indemnifying party is materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure to give notice.

(d) The indemnification provided for under this Agreement will remain in full
force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the
indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling Person of such
indemnified party and will survive the registration and sale of any securities
by any Person entitled to any indemnification hereunder and the expiration or
termination of this Agreement.

(e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 5 is held by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with
respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense referred to herein,
then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party
hereunder, will contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified
party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying
party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other hand in
connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss,
liability, claim, damage or expense as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relevant fault of the indemnifying party and
the indemnified party

 



\- 9 -  will be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by
the indemnified party and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount the Shareholder will be obligated
to contribute pursuant to this Section 5(e) will be limited to an amount equal
to the net proceeds to the Shareholder of the Registrable Securities sold
pursuant to the registration statement which gives rise to such obligation to
contribute (less the aggregate amount of any damages which the Shareholder has
otherwise been required to pay in respect of such loss, claim, damage,
expense, liability or action or any substantially similar loss, claim,
damage, expense, liability or action arising from the sale of such
Registrable Securities).

_6._ Participation in Underwritten Registrations. 

(a) The Shareholder may not participate in any registration hereunder that is
underwritten unless it (i) agrees to sell its Registrable Securities on the
basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Person or
Persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements (including, without
limitation, pursuant to the terms of any over-allotment or "green shoe"
option requested by the managing underwriter(s); provided, that the
Shareholder will not be required to sell more than the number of Registrable
Securities that it has requested the Company to include in any
registration), (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of
attorney, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required
under the terms of such underwriting arrangements, and (iii) cooperates with
the Companys reasonable requests in connection with such registration or
qualification (it being understood that the Companys failure to perform its
obligations hereunder, which failure is caused by the Shareholders failure to
cooperate, will not constitute a breach by the Company of this Agreement,
provided that the Company delivers a certificate by the Chief Executive
Officer or Chief Financial Officer of the Company to the Shareholder that, in
its opinion, the Shareholders failure to cooperate has frustrated the
Companys ability to comply with this Agreement). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Shareholder will not be required to agree to any
indemnification obligations on the part of the Shareholder that are materially
greater than its obligations pursuant to Section 6(b).

(b) The Shareholder agrees that, if it is participating in any registration
hereunder, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of
any event of the kind described in subsection 3(f) above, the Shareholder will
forthwith discontinue the disposition of its Registrable Securities pursuant
to the Registration Statement until it receives copies of a supplemented or
amended prospectus as contemplated by such Section 3(f). In the event the
Company gives any such notice, the applicable time period during which a
Registration Statement is to remain effective will be extended by the number
of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such
notice pursuant to this Section 6(b) to and including the date when the
Shareholder will have received the copies of the supplemented or amended
prospectus contemplated by Section 3(f).

 



\- 10 - _7._ Rule 144; Legend Removal.

 

(a) _Facilitation of Sales Pursuant to Rule 144_. The Company covenants to the
Shareholder, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
timely file the reports required to be filed by it under the 1934 Act or the
1933 Act (including the reports under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the 1934 Act
referred to in subparagraph (c)(1) of Rule 144), and (ii) make and keep
public information available as those terms are understood and defined in Rule
144 under the 1933 Act, all to the extent required from time to time to enable
the Shareholder to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the
Securities Act within the limitations of the exemption provided by Rule 144.
Upon the request of the Shareholder in connection with its sale pursuant to
Rule 144, the Company shall deliver to the Shareholder a written statement as
to whether it has complied with such requirements.

(b) _Availability of Rule 144 Not Excuse for Obligations_. The fact that
the Shareholder may become eligible to sell its Registrable Securities
pursuant to Rule 144 shall not (i) cause such Securities to cease to be
Registrable Securities or (ii) excuse the Companys obligations set forth in
this Agreement. 

(c) Upon request of the Shareholder, upon receipt by the Company of an opinion
of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company to the effect that such
legend is no longer required under the 1933 Act and applicable state laws, the
Company shall promptly cause any legend affixed to any Registrable Securities
to be removed from any certificate for any Registrable Securities, including
by providing any opinion of counsel to the Company that may be reasonably
required by the transfer agent to effect such removal.

 

 _8._ Term. This Agreement will be effective as of the date hereof and will
continue in effect thereafter until the earliest of (a) its termination by
the consent of the Shareholder or its successor(s) in interest, (b) the fifth
anniversary of the effective date of the Mandatory Shelf Registration
Statement and (c) the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company.

_9._ Lock-Up Restrictions. During the Lock-Up Period, the Shareholder agrees
not to Transfer any of the Lock-Up Shares except (i) as a _bona fide_ gift;
(ii) to any wholly-owned subsidiary thereof; (iii) pursuant to any take-over
bid, acquisition, sale or merger involving the Company or the Shareholder;
(iv) transactions relating to shares of Common Stock or other securities
acquired in open market transactions after the completion of the Purchase;
(v) sale of Lock-Up Shares to satisfy any tax liability associated with the
Registrable Securities; (vi) any forward sale, hedging or similar transaction,
including but not limited to any transaction by which any economic risks
and/or rewards or ownership of, or voting rights with respect to, any such
Lock-Up Shares are affected; or (vii) with the prior written consent of the
Company provided that in each case to the extent practicable such transferees
agree to be bound by the restrictions set forth in Section 9\. Any Transfer or
attempted Transfer in violation of this _Section_ __ _ 9_ shall, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be null and void _ab initio_.

 



\- 11 - _10._ Additional Covenants of the Company; Certain Restrictions.

 

(a) The Company covenants to do all that is necessary to comply with its
obligations hereunder including, but not limited to, obtaining the requisite
consents of the Prior Holders in accordance with the Prior Registration Rights
Agreements.

(b) _Suspension_.

 

i. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith that it is in the
best interests of the Company to suspend the use of any or all registration
statements covering shares of common stock held by any securityholder of the
Company, the Company, by written notice to the Shareholder, may direct the
Shareholder to suspend sales of the Registrable Shares pursuant to the
Mandatory Shelf Registration Statement for such time as the Company reasonably
may determine is necessary and advisable, but in no event for more than thirty
(30) consecutive days (the " _Suspension Period_ "), but only if either of
the following events will occur: (A) there is material non-public information
regarding the Company that (1) the Board of Directors of the Company
determines not to be in the Companys best interest to disclose, (2) would, in
the good faith determination of the Board of Directors of the Company, require
any revision to the Mandatory Shelf Registration Statement so that it will
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading and (3) the Company is not otherwise required to disclose such
material nonpublic information pursuant to SEC reporting obligations at the
time a Suspension Notice (as defined below) is delivered to the Shareholder;
or (B) the distribution of Registrable Securities would materially impede,
delay or interfere with, or require premature disclosure of, (1) a proposed
acquisition or disposition of assets by the Company (other than in the
ordinary course of business) or any proposed material merger, consolidation,
tender offer or other similar transaction or (2) a proposed material debt or
equity financing of the Company and, upon consummation of any such transaction
set forth in subclause (B)(1) would require the Company to disclose pro forma
financial information pursuant to Article 11 of Regulation S-X; provided,
however, that (x) the Company may only cause two (2) Suspension Periods to
occur in any 12-month period; provided, however, that if the Effectiveness
Grace Period is used by the Company then the Company may only cause one (1)
Suspension Period to occur in the first 12-month period beginning on the
effective date of the Mandatory Shelf Registration Statement, (y) at least 90
calendar days shall have elapsed between any two Suspension Periods and (z)
no Suspension Period shall begin for at least 30 calendar days after the
effective date of the Mandatory Shelf Registration Statement or, to the extent
applicable, at least 30 calendar days after the end of the Effectiveness Grace
Period.

 

ii. The Company will use its best efforts to promptly amend or supplement the
Mandatory Shelf Registration Statement on a post-effective basis, if
necessary, or to take such action as is necessary to make resumed use of the
Mandatory Shelf Registration Statement so as to permit the Shareholder to
resume sales of the Registrable Shares promptly upon the earlier to occur of
(i) the Company delivering to the Shareholder an End of Suspension Notice (as
defined below), and (ii) the end of the Suspension Period.

 



\- 12 - iii. In the case of an event described in Section 10(b)(i) that causes the
Company to suspend the use of the Mandatory Shelf Registration Statement (a
"Suspension Event"), the Company will give written notice (a "Suspension
Notice") to the Shareholder to suspend sales of the Registrable Shares,
and such notice will state generally the basis for such suspension and that
such suspension will continue only for so long as the Suspension Event or its
effect is continuing and the Company is making its best efforts to terminate
suspension of the effectiveness of the Mandatory Shelf Registration Statement
as promptly as possible. The Shareholder will not effect any sales of the
Registrable Shares pursuant to the Mandatory Shelf Registration Statement (or
such filings) at any time after it has received a Suspension Notice from the
Company and prior to receipt of an End of Suspension Notice (as defined below)
and the Company will not permit any securityholder of the Company to effect
any such sales pursuant to any shelf registration statement filed by the
Company. The Shareholder may recommence effecting sales of the Registrable
Shares pursuant to the Mandatory Shelf Registration Statement on the earlier
of (i) the date that notice to such effect (an "End of Suspension Notice") is
delivered by the Company to the Shareholder, which End of Suspension Notice
will be given by the Company to the Shareholder in the manner described above
reasonably promptly following the conclusion of any Suspension Event and its
effect and (ii) the end of the Suspension Period.

(c) _Offering Lock-Up_. In connection with any underwritten public offering
of equity securities by the Company pursuant to which the Shareholder has the
ability to include at least 50% of its Registrable Securities in such offering
pursuant to Section 2(a) after giving effect to any "cut-back" in Section
2(e) (a "Specified Offering"), the Shareholder agrees to execute a lock-up
agreement in favor of the Companys underwriters covering the Registrable
Securities not included in the Specified Offering on the terms and conditions
required by the underwriters in a lock-up agreement (subject to customary
exceptions and exclusions) for such Specified Offering, including with respect
to the duration of the lock-up. The provisions of this Section 10(c) will no
longer apply to the Shareholder once the Shareholder ceases to hold
Registrable Securities or 5% or less of the outstanding equity securities of
the Company.
