irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor.

Chosen Courts, this being in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity, and the parties to this Agreement shall not be required to prove actual damages and hereby waive any requirement for the posting of any bond or similar collateral in
connection therewith. Each party hereto agrees that it will not assert that a remedy of specific performance is unenforceable or invalid or otherwise oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis
that (a)&nbsp;the other party has an adequate remedy at law or (b)&nbsp;an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><B><U>IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION </U></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Under U.S. federal income tax law, a Holder who surrenders Units for a portion of the Merger Consideration and Aggregate
Earnout Consideration is required to provide the Exchange Agent with the Holder&#146;s correct taxpayer identification number (&#147;<U>TIN</U>&#148;) on the enclosed Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">W-9</FONT> or the appropriate Form <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">W-8</FONT> or otherwise establish a basis for exemption from backup withholding. Generally, if the Holder is an individual, the TIN is the Holder&#146;s social security number. If the Exchange Agent is not provided with
the correct TIN, the Holder may be subject to a $50 penalty, as well as various other penalties, imposed by the IRS. In addition, payments made to the Holder with respect to the Units may be subject to backup withholding. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Certain Holders (including, among others, certain corporations and foreign individuals) are not subject to these backup
withholding and reporting requirements. A foreign individual may qualify as an exempt recipient or other payee by submitting to the Exchange Agent a properly completed IRS Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">W-8,</FONT> Certificate of Foreign
Status, signed under penalty of perjury, attesting to such Holder&#146;s exempt status. The appropriate IRS Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">W-8</FONT> may be downloaded from the IRS website at the following address: <U>http://www.irs.gov</U>.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">If backup withholding applies, the Exchange Agent, BNL or BNL OP, as applicable, will be required to withhold 24% of any
payment made to the Holder or other payee. Backup withholding is not an additional federal income tax. Rather, the amount withheld will be credited against the federal income tax liability of persons subject to backup withholding. If withholding
results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained from the IRS provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify"><U>Purpose of Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">W-9</FONT></U>. To prevent backup withholding on payments that are made to
a Holder with respect to the Units, the Holder is required to provide the Exchange Agent with the Holder&#146;s current TIN by completing the Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">W-9</FONT> herein, certifying that the TIN provided on Form <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">W-9</FONT> is correct (or that such Holder is awaiting a TIN), that the Holder is a U.S. Person, and that (i)&nbsp;the Holder has not been notified by the IRS that the Holder is subject to backup withholding as a result of
failure to report all interest or dividends or (ii)&nbsp;the IRS has notified the Holder that the Holder is no longer subject to backup withholding. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify"><U>What Number to Give the Representative</U>. The Holder is required to give the Exchange Agent the TIN (<U>e.g.</U>, social
security number, individual taxpayer identification number or employer identification number) of the record owner of the Units. If the Units are held in more than one name or are not held in the name of the actual owner, consult the &#147;What Name
and Number to give the Requester&#148; section in the attached Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">W-9</FONT> or your tax advisor for additional guidance on which number to report. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Under U.S. federal income tax law, a Holder who surrenders Units for a portion of the Merger Consideration and Aggregate
Earnout Consideration is required to provide the Exchange Agent with the Holder&#146;s correct taxpayer identification number (&#147;<U>TIN</U>&#148;) on the enclosed Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">W-9</FONT> or the appropriate Form <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">W-8</FONT> or otherwise establish a basis for exemption from backup withholding. Generally, if the Holder is an individual, the TIN is the Holder&#146;s social security number. If the Exchange Agent is not provided with
the correct TIN, the Holder may be subject to a $50 penalty, as well as various other penalties, imposed by the IRS. In addition, payments made to the Holder with respect to the Units may be subject to backup withholding. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Certain Holders (including, among others, certain corporations and foreign individuals) are not subject to these backup
withholding and reporting requirements. A foreign individual may qualify as an exempt recipient or other payee by submitting to the Exchange Agent a properly completed IRS Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">W-8,</FONT> Certificate of Foreign
Status, signed under penalty of perjury, attesting to such Holder&#146;s exempt status. The appropriate IRS Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">W-8</FONT> may be downloaded from the IRS website at the following address: <U>http://www.irs.gov</U>.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">If backup withholding applies, the Exchange Agent, BNL or BNL OP, as applicable, will be required to withhold 24% of any
payment made to the Holder or other payee. Backup withholding is not an additional federal income tax. Rather, the amount withheld will be credited against the federal income tax liability of persons subject to backup withholding. If withholding
results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained from the IRS provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. </P>

a Holder with respect to the Units, the Holder is required to provide the Exchange Agent with the Holder&#146;s current TIN by completing the Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">W-9</FONT> herein, certifying that the TIN provided on Form <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">W-9</FONT> is correct (or that such Holder is awaiting a TIN), that the Holder is a U.S. Person, and that (i)&nbsp;the Holder has not been notified by the IRS that the Holder is subject to backup withholding as a result of
failure to report all interest or dividends or (ii)&nbsp;the IRS has notified the Holder that the Holder is no longer subject to backup withholding. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify"><U>What Number to Give the Representative</U>. The Holder is required to give the Exchange Agent the TIN (<U>e.g.</U>, social
security number, individual taxpayer identification number or employer identification number) of the record owner of the Units. If the Units are held in more than one name or are not held in the name of the actual owner, consult the &#147;What Name
