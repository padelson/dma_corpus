amounts pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_, such party shall provide to
the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding will be made at
least three (3) Business Days advance notice of its intent to withhold such
amounts. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or paid over to or
deposited with the relevant Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made. For the avoidance of
doubt, Holders of BRE Exchange Units shall be subject to withholding under
Sections 1445 and/or 1446(f) of the Code

Units_ ") an election form, in substantially the form of _Exhibit G_  hereto
(the " _Election Form_ "), pursuant to which a holder of BRE Election Units
may make an Election as specified in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(c)_. The Election
Form shall set forth instructions for making an Election and effecting the
Surrender of BRE Election Units in connection with the making of an Election,
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the BRE Election Units shall pass, and an Election shall be properly made
in respect of BRE Election Units, only upon proper adherence to the
procedures set forth in the Election Form, and shall otherwise be in such
customary form and have such other provisions as BNL OP and BRE may reasonably
agree.

 

(b) BNL OP shall make available one or more Election Forms as
may reasonably be requested from time to time by all Persons who become
Holders of BRE Election Units prior to the Election Deadline. BRE shall
provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to
perform the obligations specified in this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ and as
specified in any agreement among the parties and the Exchange Agent.

 

(c) Each Holder of BRE Election Units shall be entitled,
with respect to all of the BRE Election Units held by such Person, to make,
prior to the Election Deadline, an election (an " _Election_ ") specifying
whether such Holder makes a REIT Share Election or a BNL OP Membership Unit
Election, or a combination of any of the foregoing, as applicable, as such
holder may be entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(h)(i)_. Any BRE
Election Units with respect to which no Election shall have properly been made
(or, if an Election shall have been made, shall have been revoked and not
properly remade) prior to the Election Deadline shall be deemed for purposes
of _Section_ __ _ 2.1(h)(i)_ to have been made as a BNL OP Membership Unit
Election with respect to such BRE Exchange Units, if applicable.

(d) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, an Election shall
be effective only if the Exchange Agent shall have received, no later than

(i) an Election Form covering the BRE Election Units to which such Election
applies, executed and completed in accordance with the instructions set forth
therein, and (ii) the Surrender to the Exchange Agent of the BRE Election
Units to which such Election Form applies. An Election may be revoked only by
delivering to the Exchange Agent, prior to the Election Deadline, a written
notice of revocation or a properly completed revised Election Form that
identifies the BRE Election Units to which such revised Election Form applies.
The proper delivery to the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline of a
revised Election Form with 

 



37

    

 respect to any BRE Election Units shall result in the revocation of all
prior Election Forms with respect to all such BRE Election Units. Subject to
the terms of this Agreement, and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent, in
consultation with both BNL OP and BRE, shall have reasonable discretion to
determine whether any Election, revocation or change has been properly or
timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and
any good faith decision of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be
binding and conclusive. None of BNL OP, BRE or the Exchange Agent shall be
under any obligations to notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form.
BNL OP shall use reasonable efforts to announce the Election Deadline at least
five (5) Business Days prior to the Election Deadline.

of the Blocker Corps shall cause each Person to whom any BRE Transaction
Expense or Blocker Corp Transaction Expense is payable to provide written
confirmation, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to BNL OP, that,
upon payment of the amount specified in such confirmation, neither BRE nor
any Blocker Corp. will have any further Liability to such Person in respect of
any BRE Transaction Expense or Blocker Corp Transaction Expense, and BRE and
each Blocker Corp shall provide evidence, in the form of an email
confirmation from each payee thereof, that they have paid and discharged the
BRE Transaction Expenses and Blocker Corp Transaction Expenses.

 

SECTION 2.5 _Earnout_ _._

 

(a) If:

 

(i) following the closing of an Initial Public Offering, (A) at any
time during the First Earnout Period, the VWAP of a REIT Share is greater than
or equal to $90.00, (B) at any time during the Second Earnout Period, the VWAP
of a REIT Share is greater than or equal to $95.00, (C) at any time during
the Third Earnout Period, the VWAP of a REIT Share is greater than or equal to
$97.50, and/or (D) at any time during the Fourth Earnout Period, the VWAP of a
REIT Share is greater than or equal to $100.00; or

 

(ii) prior to the closing of an Initial Public Offering or during
the calendar year in which an Initial Public Offering is closed, (A) for any
calendar year included in the First Earnout Period, the AFFO is greater than

38

    

 any calendar year included in the Second Earnout Period, the AFFO is greater

Earnout Period, the AFFO is greater than or equal to $6.30, and/or (D) for
any calendar year included in the Fourth Earnout Period, the AFFO is greater

then in each case, (x) BNL and BNL OP shall promptly (but in any event, within
five (5) Business Days) deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange
Agent, cash, REIT Shares and BNL OP Membership Units, as applicable,
sufficient to pay the applicable portion of the Aggregate Earnout
Consideration payable upon such Earnout Trigger; _provided_ , in no event
shall the Earnout Amount with respect to any Earnout Period be payable on
more than one occasion; and (y) BNL and BNL OP shall cause the Exchange Agent
to promptly (but in any event, within five (5) Business Days) deliver to each
Holder, the Blocker Corp 1 Sole Stockholder and the Blocker Corp 2 Sole
Stockholder, as applicable, that amount and type of Aggregate Earnout
Consideration payable upon such Earnout Trigger to which such Person is
entitled. For the avoidance of doubt, in the case of OP Earnout
Consideration, the consideration for which a Holder is entitled shall be the
same type of consideration such Holder received pursuant to such Holders
Election.

 

(b) The AFFO and REIT Share price targets set forth in  _Section_ __
_ 2.5(a)_, the REIT Share price in connection with a REIT Sale set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 2.5(d)_, and the number of REIT Shares or BNL OP Membership

subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or
exchange of shares, or any similar event affecting the REIT Shares after the
date of this Agreement.

(c) In the event there is any dispute regarding the composition of
AFFO in respect of any calendar year, such dispute shall be submitted for
resolution by a nationally recognized accounting firm selected by BNL that
does not then perform services for BNL and has not performed such services in
the past 12 months. Such accounting firm shall be entitled to review the
relevant books and records of BNL, including BNLs working papers and the
working papers of its independent accountants, if any, relating to the
preparation of the AFFO; _provided_ , that such accounting firm shall agree to
treat all such information as confidential; _provided_ , _further_ , that
BNLs independent accountants shall not be obligated to make any working
papers available to such accounting firm unless and until such accounting firm
has signed a confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such
access to working papers in form and substance acceptable to BNLs
independent accountants. Any resolution by such nationally recognized
accounting firm shall be binding on BNL and all Persons entitled to receive
any portion of the Aggregate Earnout Consideration associated with such
dispute.

 

(d) In the event that there is a definitive agreement with
respect to a REIT Sale entered into after the Closing and prior to the
conclusion of an Earnout Period, then (if the Earnout Amount in respect of
such Earnout Period has not already been paid pursuant to this Agreement) the
Earnout Amount in respect of such Earnout Period shall be deemed to be due
and payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ on the day prior to the
closing of such REIT Sale if the consideration (including any contingent
consideration such as earnouts or amounts held in escrow thereunder) or
proceeds to be paid or distributed in such REIT Sale (before giving effect to
this _Section_ __ _ 2.5(d)_) exceeds $85.00 per REIT Share, and after the
closing of such REIT Sale (and the payment of the 

 



39

    

 Earnout Amount in respect of such Earnout Period) the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 2.5_ shall have no further force and effect.

 

SECTION 2.6 _Intended Tax Treatment._ __

 

(a) For U.S. federal income tax purposes (and, where
applicable, state and local income tax purposes), all parties agree to treat
(i) the Blocker Mergers as taxable sales of all of the stock of Blocker Corp 1
and Blocker Corp 2, and qualified stock purchases under Section 338 of the
Code, followed by liquidations of Blocker Corp 1 and Blocker Corp 2 into BNL
under Section 332 of the Code (when Blocker Corp 1 and Blocker Corp 2 become
qualified REIT subsidiaries of BNL under Section 856(i) of the Code) and (ii)
the Blocker Corp 1 Earnout Consideration and the Blocker Corp 2 Earnout
Consideration as deferred payments subject to Section 483 of the Code and a
portion of the Blocker Corp 1 Earnout Consideration and the Blocker Corp 2
Earnout Consideration as unstated interest.

(b) For U.S. federal income tax purposes (and, where applicable,
state and local income tax purposes), all parties agree to treat (i) the OP
Merger as an "assets-over" form of merger governed by Treasury
Regulations Section 1.708-1(c)(3)(i) pursuant to which BRE contributes all of
its assets and liabilities to BNL OP in exchange for the OP Merger
Consideration and the OP Earnout Consideration in a transaction qualifying
under Section 721(a) of the Code and, immediately thereafter, BRE distributes
such OP Merger Consideration and OP Earnout Consideration to the Holders of
the BRE Exchange Units with BNL OP being a continuation of BNL OP pursuant
to Treasury Regulations Section 1.708-1(c)(1), (ii) the BRE Existing Credit
Facilities as a "qualified liability" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.707-5(a)(6)(i)(E) (i.e., a liability that was not
incurred in anticipation of the OP Merger, but that was incurred in connection
with a trade or business in which property transferred to BNL OP was used or
held, and all the assets related to that trade or business are transferred to
BNL OP (other than assets that are not material to a continuation of the trade
or business)), which may be subject to certain disclosures pursuant to
Treasury Regulations Section 1.707-8, and (iii) the OP Earnout Consideration
as deferred payments subject to Section 483 of the Code and a portion of the
OP Earnout Consideration as unstated interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the receipt by the Holders of BRE Exchange Units of REIT Shares or cash
pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as a sale by such Holders of their
BRE Exchange Units and a purchase by BNL OP of such BRE Exchange Units for
U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
1.708-1(c)(4) (the " _Sale Treatment_ "), and BREs transfer of its assets
and liabilities to BNL OP, to the extent attributable to the Sale Treatment,
shall be treated as occurring pursuant to Sections 731 and 732(b) of the Code.
BRE shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the written
consent of the Holders of BRE Exchange Units with respect to the Sale
Treatment and such written consent shall be a condition to an election by any
such Holder to receive REIT Shares and/or cash pursuant to the OP Merger.

SECTION 3.11 _Insurance_. _Section_ __ _ 3.11_ of the BRE Disclosure
Schedules sets forth a correct and complete list of all insurance policies

SECTION 3.12 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

true and complete list of all Benefit Plans maintained or sponsored or
contributed to or required to be contributed to by a BRE Group Entity or with
respect to which a BRE Group Entity has any Liability or that are for the
benefit of employees, officers, directors or managers or terminated

 



47

    

 employees, officers, directors or managers of the BRE Group Entities or
their beneficiaries, dependents or spouses (each, a " _BRE Benefit Plan_ " and
collectively, the " _BRE Benefit Plans_ "). Correct and complete copies of
the following documents, with respect to each of the BRE Benefit Plans, have
been made available or delivered to BNL by the BRE Group Entities, to the
extent applicable: (i) all plan documents and related trust documents,
insurance contracts or other funding arrangements, and all amendments thereto;
(ii) the three (3) most recent Forms 5500 or other forms required to be filed
annually with the U.S. Department of Labor (the " _DOL_ ") and all schedules
thereto; (iii) data and results of non-discrimination testing for the three
(3) most recently completed years; (iv) the most recent Internal Revenue
Service (" _IRS_ ") determination or opinion letter; (v) all rulings or

(b) With respect to any BRE Benefit Plan, (i) no lawsuits, actions,
claims, administrative or other proceedings (other than routine claims for
benefits in the ordinary course) are pending or, to the knowledge of BRE,
threatened; and (ii) to the knowledge of BRE, no facts or circumstances exist
that would give rise to any such lawsuits, actions, claims, administrative or
other proceedings. Each BRE Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified
within the meaning of Code Section 401(a) is so qualified and has received, or
is entitled to rely upon, a favorable determination, advisory or opinion
letter as to its qualification, and to the knowledge of BRE nothing has
occurred, whether by action or failure to act, that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect such qualification. No BRE Benefit Plan is under
audit or investigation by the DOL, IRS or other Governmental Entity and, to
the knowledge of BRE, no such audit or investigation is threatened. Each BRE
Benefit Plan has been maintained, operated and administered in accordance
with its terms and in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "),
the Code and all other applicable Laws. Each individual eligible to
participate in each BRE Benefit Plan subject to ERISA is a common-law employee
of a BRE Group Entity. Each BRE Benefit Plan can be amended or terminated at
any time without any additional Liability.

(c) At no time during the past six (6) years has BRE or any member
of its "Controlled Group" (defined as any organization which is considered a
single employer within the meaning of Code Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o))
currently (nor at any time) maintained, sponsored or contributed to, or been
obligated to contribute to, any Benefit Plan which is subject to Title IV of
ERISA or Section 412, 430 or 431 of the Code or to any "multiemployer plan"
(within the meaning of Section 3(37) or Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA), a
"multiple employer welfare arrangement" (as defined in Section 3(40)(A) of
ERISA), or a "multiple employer plan" (as described in Section 413(c) of the
Code). No withdrawal liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by
BRE or any member of the Controlled Group, and to the knowledge of BRE, no
condition exists that presents any risk to BRE or any member of its Controlled
Group of incurring or being subject (whether primarily, jointly or
secondarily) to any withdrawal liability under Title IV of ERISA. None of the
BRE Group Entities maintains retiree life or retiree health insurance plans or
any other employee welfare benefit plans that provides for
continuing benefits or coverage for any participant or any beneficiary of a
participant after termination of employment or retirement except as may be
required under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as
amended, or at the sole expense of the participant or any participants
beneficiary.

 



48

    

(d) All contributions required to be made to any BRE Benefit Plan,
by applicable Law or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking,
and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any
such BRE Benefit Plan, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the
extent not required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been
fully reflected on the BRE Financial Statements to the extent required by
GAAP.

 

(e) Except as set forth on  _Section_ __ _ 3.12(e)_ of the BRE
Disclosure Schedules, no Benefit Plan exists that, as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, either alone or in combination
with any other event or the passage of time, would (i) result in the payment
to any current or former employee, director or limited partner of a BRE Group
Entity of any money, benefit or other property or would result in the
acceleration of, provision of or increase in the amount of any other rights
or benefits to any current or former employee, officer, director or manager of
a BRE Group Entity; or (ii) result in any payment or benefit that would,
individually or in combination with any other such payment, be characterized
as an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of
the Code.

 

(f) No BRE Benefit Plans are subject to the Laws of any jurisdiction
outside of the United States.

(g) Each BRE Benefit Plan that is a non-qualified deferred
compensation plan or arrangement within the meaning of Section 409A of the
Code, and any underlying award or benefit, is in compliance in all
material respects with Section 409A of the Code and no payment or award that
has been made to any participant under a BRE Benefit Plan is subject to the
interest and penalties specified in Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code. No BRE
Group Entity (i) has any obligation to reimburse or indemnify any participant
in a BRE Benefit Plan for any of the interest or penalties specified in
Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code that may be currently due or triggered in
the future, or (ii) has been required to report to any Governmental Entity
any correction or taxes due as a result of a failure to comply with Section
409A of the Code.

 

(h) No BRE Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of
any Taxes imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or otherwise, and no BRE Group

and there are no representation or certification proceedings or petitions
seeking a representation proceeding presently pending or threatened in writing
to be brought or filed with the National Labor Relations Board or any other

current union organization activities or representation questions involving
employees, of any BRE Group Entity. No labor strike or organized work

no, pending, or to the knowledge of BRE, threatened Proceedings by any
employee, independent contractor, former employee, or former independent
contractor of any of the BRE Group Entities before any Governmental Entity
relating to any Employment Matters, except as would otherwise not

Form I-9 has since

 



50

correct and complete. For each employee of a BRE Group Entity employed in the
United States, an authorized official of a BRE Group Entity has reviewed the
original documentation relating to the identity and employment authorization
of such employee in compliance with applicable law and such documentation
appeared, to such official, to be genuine on its face and to relate to the
employee presenting such documentation and, where required by applicable law,
each BRE Group Entity utilizes E-Verify pursuant to the terms of the
E-Verify Memorandum of Understanding.

(f) To the knowledge of BRE, none of the BRE Group Entities has any
material Liability with respect to any misclassification of any person as an
independent contractor, temporary employee, leased employee or any other

allegations of sexual harassment or misconduct have been made against any
executive officer of any BRE Group Entity, and (ii) BRE has not entered into

disposed of, arranged for or permitted the disposal of, transported, handled,
or released any Hazardous Materials, in each case, in a manner that has given

Entity of any material Liability arising under common law or under any local,
state or federal Environmental Law pending or, to the knowledge of BRE,
threatened against any BRE Group Entity. None of the BRE Group Entities are
subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or
with any Governmental Entity or third party imposing any Liability with
respect to the foregoing that would have, individually or in the aggregate, a
BRE Material Adverse Effect.

financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are
reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be
disclosed by BNL in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act are
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material
information is accumulated and communicated to its management as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. BNLs principal

material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in BNLs internal controls.

principal financial officer of BNL have made all certifications (without
qualification or exceptions to the matters certified, except as to knowledge)
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the statements contained in any such
certifications are complete and correct, and none of such entities or its
officers have received notice from any Governmental Entity questioning or
challenging the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing or submission

BNL SEC Report filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof, none of such
entities has any knowledge of any material weakness in the design or operation
of such internal controls over financial reporting.

three years ended December 31, 2018, including the notes thereto, and BNLs
Report on Form 10-Q (" _Latest BNL Quarter 10-Q_") filed with the SEC on

deduction of loss from, any period ending after the Closing Date as a result
of any installment sale or open transaction made on or prior to the Closing
Date or prepaid amount received prior to the Closing Date.

 respective Representatives not to), directly or indirectly, take, or direct
any other Person to take, any action to solicit, knowingly encourage, or enter

their Affiliates or its or their Representatives related to or in connection

having terms not less favorable to BNL than the confidentiality agreement
between BNL and BRE, and (ii) engage or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any Person or Persons who has made such a bona fide written
Takeover Proposal, if and only to the extent that, in each such case referred
to in clause (i) or (ii) above, the BNL Board or the Independent Directors
Committee of the BNL Board (the " _BNL IDC_ ") has determined in good faith
after consultation with outside legal counsel and outside financial advisors
that such Takeover Proposal is or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal and, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
failure to take the actions described in clauses (i) and (ii) above would be
inconsistent with the BNL directors duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
that BNL shall give written notice to BRE after any such determination by the
BNL Board or the BNL IDC and before taking any of the actions described in

thereof) notify BRE in writing if (A) any Takeover Proposal is received by
BNL, (B) any request for information relating to BNL or any BNL Subsidiary is

such Takeover Proposal (and shall include with such notice copies of any
written Takeover Proposal, including any proposed transaction agreement), and

hours after the occurrence of such developments, discussions or negotiations
or receipt of materials) (x) keep BRE informed of all material developments,
discussions and negotiations concerning any such Takeover Proposal and (y)
provide BRE with any written supplements or written additions to any written
Takeover Proposal, including any revisions to any proposed transaction
agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_, in no event may the BNL Parties or any of their
Representatives directly or indirectly reimburse or pay, or agree to reimburse
or pay, the

 



69

    

 fees, costs or expenses of, or provide or agree to provide compensation to,
any Person or Persons (or any of its or their Representatives or potential
financing sources) who makes a Takeover Proposal.

(c) Subject to compliance with the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
6.2(c)_ in all material respects, if (i) prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on
the forty-fifth (45th) day after the date hereof BNL receives a Takeover
Proposal that did not result from a breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ and
(ii) after taking into consideration any adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as are proposed in writing by BRE prior to 5:00
p.m. Eastern Time on the last day of the Notice Period, the BNL Board or the
BNL IDC determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel
and outside financial advisors that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
that failure to terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement
providing for such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with the BNL
directors duties under applicable Law, then BNL may terminate this Agreement
in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 8.4(b)_; _provided_ , that BNL may not
take such action unless: (1) BNL has provided written notice to BRE of its
intention to take such action prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the forty-
fifth (45th) day after the date hereof, and at least five (5) Business Days
in advance of terminating this Agreement (the five (5) Business Day period
inclusive of all such days, the " _Notice Period_ ")), which notice shall
specify in reasonable detail the reasons for such action and shall include a
description of the material terms of such Superior Proposal and a copy of the
then existing draft of the definitive agreement providing for such Superior
Proposal and any then-existing drafts of the other relevant transaction
agreements (it being understood and agreed that any amendment, supplement or
modification to the terms of any Superior Proposal shall be deemed a new
Superior Proposal and BNL may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.4(b)_ unless BNL has provided a new notice pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.2(c)_, except that such new Notice Period in connection with
any such amendment, supplement or modification shall be for three (3)
Business Days from the time BRE receives such notice; and (2) during the
Notice Period, BNL has negotiated (and directed its outside financial advisors
and outside legal counsel to negotiate) with BRE in good faith (to the extent
BRE desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions
of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute (in the
good faith determination of the BNL Board or the BNL IDC, after consultation
with outside legal counsel and outside financial advisors) a Superior
Proposal.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent BNL or the BNL
Board or the BNL IDC from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) under
the Exchange Act or otherwise complying with its disclosure obligations under
applicable Law with regard to a Takeover Proposal if the BNL Board or the BNL
IDC determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel
that failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with the
BNL directors duties under applicable Law.

SECTION 6.3 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_ _; Further Assurances_ _._

restriction on its operations or other condition in order to obtain any
consent or approval or other clearance required by this Agreement.

SECTION 6.4 _Public Announcement_ _._ On the date hereof, BNL and BRE

may permit their respective Affiliates to, provide ordinary course
communications regarding this Agreement and the Mergers to existing or
prospective general or limited partners, equity holders, members, managers and
investors of such Person, and to Representatives of such Persons, in each
case, subject to customary confidentiality obligations. Furthermore, BNL may
make any public announcements or disclosures that it determines in good faith
are required to be made by applicable Law or any filing made under the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act (whether in connection with an
Initial Public Offering or otherwise) or in connection with its ongoing
private placement; _provided_ , that before making any such public
announcement or disclosure it provides BRE with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such public announcement or disclosure.

SECTION 6.5 _Access and Reports_ _._

 

(a) Subject to applicable Law, from and after the date hereof to the
OP Merger Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement, upon

reasonable access, during normal business hours, to its officers, employees,

Agreement or proposals from other third parties relating to any competing or
alternative transactions and the actions of the Board of Managers of BRE (or
any committee thereof) with respect to any of the foregoing, whether prior to
or after execution of this Agreement, and (2) any such investigation shall be
conducted in such a manner as not to interfere with the normal business or
operations of BRE or its Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any undue burden
with respect to the prompt and timely discharge by employees of BRE or its
Subsidiaries of their normal duties and BNL shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to minimize to the extent reasonably practicable any
disruption to the businesses of BRE that may result from any such requests for
access. Each of BNL and BRE, as it deems advisable and necessary, may
reasonably designate commercially sensitive material provided to the other as
"Outside Counsel Only Material" or with similar restrictions, and such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside counsel of the recipient, or otherwise as the restriction indicates,

insurance requirements.

or their respective Representatives or Affiliates in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of June 20, 2019, by and between BNL and
BRE (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), as if all such documents and
information were Proprietary Information (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement), which Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms and shall also apply to BNL OP, its
Subsidiaries and their and BNLs Representatives as if they were direct
parties thereto.

SECTION 6.6 _Expenses_ _. _ Whether or not the Mergers are consummated,

receive credit for such Continuing Employees years of service with BRE and/or
its Subsidiaries before the OP Merger Effective Time (including predecessor

assigned by BRE to a third party prior to Closing or has otherwise been
terminated by BRE or him prior to Closing); _provided_ , that nothing

faith, any such comments.

(i) This _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ is solely for the benefit of the

74

    

 their respective Affiliates or any beneficiary or dependent thereof, any

that any claim or claims for indemnification or advancement set forth in this

claims shall continue until disposition of all such claims.

matter in a manner it considers appropriate including settling such contest.

 

(d) With respect to any audit of a Pre-Closing Tax Period of BRE or
any of its Subsidiaries to which Subchapter C of Chapter 63 of the Code

Blocker Corp 1 Merger Effective Time, this Agreement may be terminated by BRE
or BNL if:

 

(a) the Mergers shall not have occurred on or before March 31, 2020

Agreement has been the principal cause of, or principally resulted in, the
failure of the Blocker Corp 1 Merger Effective Time to occur by such date; or

or ruling or taken any other action (including the enactment of any statute,

SECTION 8.3 _Termination by BRE_ _._ This Agreement may be terminated by
BRE at any time prior to the OP Merger Effective Time if there has been a
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the BNL
Parties in this Agreement, which breach would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ and
(a) is not capable of being cured prior to the Outside Date, or (b) if capable
of being cured, shall not have been cured before the earlier of (1) twenty
(20) Business Days following receipt of written notice from BRE of such breach
or (2) the Outside Date; _provided_ , that BRE is not then in material breach

condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_.

 

SECTION 8.4 _Termination by BNL_ _._ This Agreement may be terminated by
BNL (a) at any time prior to the OP Merger Effective Time if there has been a
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of BRE in this
Agreement, which breach would give rise to the failure of a condition set

capable of being cured prior to the Outside Date, or (ii) if capable of being

Business Days following receipt of written notice from BNL of such breach or
(2) the Outside Date; _provided_ , that BNL is not then in material breach of

(b) in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal; _provided_ , that BNL shall have complied with _Section_ __ _ 6.2_

84

    

SECTION 8.5 _Notice of Termination_. The party desiring to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Article VIII_ (other than pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 8.1_) shall give written notice of such termination to the other party in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, specifying the provision or provisions
hereof pursuant to which such termination is effected.

 

SECTION 8.6 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to this _Article_ _VIII_ , except for the provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement and _Section_ __ _ 6.4_, _Section_ __ _
6.5(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 6.6_,  _Section_ __ _ 8.6_ through _Section_ __ _
8.8_ and _Article_ __ _ IX_, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and
void and there shall be no Liability on the part of any party to
this Agreement and all rights and obligations of the parties hereto under
this Agreement shall terminate, except for the provisions of _Section_ __ _
6.4_, _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 6.6_,  _Section_ __ _ 8.6_
through _Section_ __ _ 8.8_ and _Article_ __ _ IX_, which shall survive such
termination; _provided_ , that subject to the following sentence, the parties
hereby acknowledge that in the event that the Termination Fee becomes payable
and is paid by BNL pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.4(b)_, the Termination Fee
shall be BREs sole and exclusive remedy for monetary damages under
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall relieve
any party hereto from any Liability for any Willful and Material Breach by
such party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
set forth in this Agreement and all rights and remedies of a non-breaching
party under this Agreement in the case of such Willful and Material Breach, at
law or in equity, shall be preserved.

 

SECTION 8.7 _Enforcement of this Agreement_ _._ The parties to this
Agreement agree that irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached and that monetary damages, even if available, would
not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the parties
to this Agreement shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Chosen Courts, this being
in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity, and the parties to this
Agreement shall not be required to prove actual damages and hereby waive any
requirement for the posting of any bond or similar collateral in connection
therewith. Each party hereto agrees that it will not assert that a remedy of
specific performance is unenforceable or invalid or otherwise oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that (a) the other party has an adequate remedy at law or (b) an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or equity.

 

SECTION 8.8 _No Waiver Relating to Claims for Fraud/Willful Misconduct_
_._ The Liability of any party under this _Article_ _VIII_ shall be in
addition to, and not exclusive of, any other Liability that such party may
have at law or in equity based on such partys (a) fraudulent acts or
omissions or (b) willful misconduct or Willful and Material Breach. None of
the provisions set forth in this Agreement shall be deemed to be a waiver by
or release of any party of any right or remedy that such party may have at law
or equity based on any other partys fraudulent acts or omissions or willful
misconduct nor shall any such provisions limit, or be deemed to limit, (i) the
amounts of recovery sought or awarded in any such claim for fraud or willful
misconduct or Willful and Material Breach, (ii) the time period during which
a claim for fraud or willful misconduct or Willful and Material Breach may be
brought, or (iii) the recourse that any such party may seek against another
party with respect to a claim for fraud or willful misconduct or Willful and
Material Breach.

the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof, shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without
regard to principles of conflicts of law. Each party hereto agrees that it
shall bring any Proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contained in or contemplated by this Agreement exclusively in
the Delaware Court of Chancery sitting in New Castle County (or, only if the
Delaware Court of Chancery lacks or declines to accept jurisdiction over a

any such Proceeding (A) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Chosen Courts, (B) waives any objection to laying venue in any such
Proceeding in the Chosen Courts and (C) waives any objection that the Chosen
Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party

9.2_ shall constitute valid and enforceable service of legal process in any
such Proceeding; _provided_ , that nothing herein shall limit such partys
ability to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law.

 

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY
WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.3(B)_.

 

SECTION 9.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the exhibits and schedules
hereto, and any other documents or certificates delivered pursuant hereto
constitute the entire agreement between and among the parties hereto
pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements,
understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the
parties, and there are no warranties, representations or other agreements
between or among the parties in connection with the subject matter hereof
except as set forth specifically herein or contemplated hereby. Except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement (including the representations and
warranties set forth in _Articles_ _III_ , _IV_ , and _V_ ), (a) the parties
acknowledge and agree that neither the BRE Group Entities, the Blocker Corps
nor any other Person has made, and the BNL Group Entities are not relying

the BRE Group Entities or the Blocker Corps or as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding any BRE Group Entity or any Blocker
Corp furnished or made available to any BNL Group Entity, (b) the parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that, except as

 



88

    

 set forth in this Agreement, neither the BNL Group Entities nor any other
Person has made, and the BRE Group Entities and the Blocker Corps are not
relying upon, any covenant, representation or warranty, expressed or implied,
as to the BNL Group Entities or as to the accuracy or completeness of any
information regarding any BNL Group Entity furnished or made available to any
BRE Group Entity or any Blocker Corp, and (c) BRE, the Blocker Corps and the
BNL Parties shall not have or be subject to any Liability to any BNL Group
Entity or any other Person or any BRE Group Entity or any other Person or any
Blocker Corp or any other Person, as applicable, or any other remedy
in connection herewith, based upon the distribution to any BNL Group Entity,
any BRE Group Entity or any Blocker Corp of, or any BNL Group Entitys, any
Blocker Corps or any BRE Group Entitys use of or reliance on, any such
information or any information, documents or material made available to the

the transactions contemplated hereby.

SECTION 9.5 _Amendments, Consents and Waivers_. Subject to compliance
with applicable Law, prior to the Closing, any provision of this Agreement may
be (a) consented to or waived in writing by the party benefited by
the provision or (b) amended or modified at any time by an agreement in
writing by the parties hereto. No amendment, supplement, modification or
waiver of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the
parties hereto. The failure of a party to exercise any right or remedy shall
not be deemed or constitute a waiver of such right or remedy in the future. No
waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall
constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (regardless of whether
similar), nor shall any such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless
otherwise expressly provided.

 

SECTION 9.6 _Binding Effect; No Third-Party Beneficiaries; and Assignment_
_._ This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns. Nothing

and (ii) for the right of the Holders of BRE Exchange Units to receive the
Merger Consideration. No party hereto may assign, transfer, dispose of or
otherwise alienate this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement (whether by operation of law or otherwise).
Any attempted assignment, transfer, disposition or alienation in violation of
this Agreement shall be null, void and ineffective.

 

SECTION 9.7 _Severability_ _._ If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
applicable Law, or public policy, all other conditions or provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are not affected in any matter materially adverse to any party
hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties hereto as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in
order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated
as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



89

    

SECTION 9.8 _Counterparts_ _._ This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall
constitute one instrument.

 

SECTION 9.9 _Legal Representation_.

 

(a) Each of the parties to this Agreement acknowledges that
Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson LLP (" _Fried Frank_ ") currently
serves as counsel to the BRE Group Entities and the holders of Equity
Securities of BRE prior to the Closing (" _Pre-Closing Holders_"), including
in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. In connection with the foregoing, the BNL
Group Entities on behalf of themselves and their Affiliates hereby irrevocably
waive and agree not to assert any conflict of interest arising from or in
connection with (i) Fried Franks representation of the BRE Group Entities
(or any Pre-Closing Holder), and (ii) Fried Franks representation of the BNL
Group Entities after the Closing. The BNL Group Entities on behalf of
themselves and their Affiliates further consent and agree to the communication
or transfer by Fried Frank to the BRE Group Entities (or any Pre-Closing
Holder) in connection with any representation of any fact, document or other
information known to Fried Frank or in Fried Franks possession arising by
reason of Fried Franks representation of the BRE Group Entities and the Pre-
Closing Holders prior to the Closing.

(b) Each of the parties hereto further agrees that all
communications and documents exchanged in any form or format whatsoever
between or among Fried Frank and/or the BRE Group Entities or the Pre-Closing
Holders, or any of their respective Affiliates, that relate in any way to the
consideration, negotiation, documentation and consummation of the Agreement,
any of the Ancillary Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or any
dispute arising under or relating to any of the foregoing (collectively, the
" _Deal Communications_ ") shall be deemed to be retained and owned solely by
the Pre-Closing Holders, shall be controlled solely by the Pre-Closing
Holders, and shall not pass to or be claimed by the BNL Group Entities or any
of their Affiliates. All Deal Communications that are subject to the attorney-
client privilege, the attorney work product doctrine or any other privilege
or protection (collectively, the " _Privileged Deal Communications_ ") shall
remain privileged after the Closing and the privilege and the expectation of
client confidence relating thereto shall belong solely to the Pre-Closing
Holders, shall be controlled solely by the Pre-Closing Holders, and shall not
pass to or be claimed by the BNL Group Entities or any of their Affiliates.
Neither Fried Frank nor any Pre-Closing Holder shall have any duty whatsoever
to reveal or disclose any Deal Communications, Privileged Deal Communications
or files to the BNL Group Entities by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between Fried Frank and the BNL Group Entities or otherwise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises after the
Closing between BNL, on the one hand, and a third party other than BRE, any
other Pre-Closing Holder, or any of their Affiliates, on the other hand, BNL
may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent the disclosure of the
Privileged Deal Communications to such third party; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that BNL may not waive such privilege.

 

(c) To the extent that files or other materials maintained by Fried
Frank constitute property of its clients, only the Pre-Closing Holders shall
hold such property rights with respect to any representation prior to the
Closing, and Fried Frank shall have no duty to reveal or

 



90

    

 disclose any such files or other materials by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between Fried Frank, on the one hand, and the BRE Group Entities,
on the other hand.

 

(d) The BNL Group Entities on behalf of themselves and
their Affiliates further consent and agree that they will not (i)
intentionally access or use the Deal Communications or the Privileged Deal
Communications, including by way of review of any electronic data,
communications or other information, or by seeking to have BRE release such
materials or waive the attorney-client or other privilege, or (ii) seek to
obtain the Deal Communications or the Privileged Deal Communications, directly
or indirectly, from Fried Frank or any other Person.

 

(e) This _Section_ __ _ 9.9_ is for the benefit of the Pre-Closing
Holders and Fried Frank, and Fried Frank is an express third party beneficiary
of this _Section_ __ _ 9.9_. This _Section_ __ _ 9.9_ shall be
irrevocable, and no term of this _Section_ __ _ 9.9_ may be amended, waived
or modified, without the prior written consent of the Pre-Closing Holders of a
majority of the BRE Exchange Units (if after the Closing, as of immediately
prior to the OP Merger Effective Time) and Fried Frank.

SECTION 9.10 _Non-Recourse of Other Persons_. This Agreement may only be
enforced against, and any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of,
or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may only
be brought against, the entities that are expressly named as parties and then
only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to
such party. Except to the extent a Person is a named party to this Agreement,
no past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or
Affiliate of any of the foregoing shall have any Liability (whether in
contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or
liabilities of any one or more of BRE, BNL or the Blocker Corps under this
Agreement or for any claim based on, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

Partys Group) pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, such
Party shall promptly transfer, or cause to be transferred, such Asset to the
Party so entitled thereto (or to any member of such Partys Group), and such
Party (or member of such Partys Group) shall accept such Asset. Prior to any
such transfer, the Person receiving or possessing such Asset shall hold such
Asset in trust for any such other Person. In the event that at any time or

receives any mail or packages addressed to another Party and such mail is not
relating solely to the Assets or

any Approvals or Notifications, the Parties shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain or make such Approvals or Notifications as soon
as reasonably practicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except to the extent
expressly provided in this Agreement, any of the Ancillary Agreements or the
Merger Agreement, as otherwise agreed in writing between the applicable
Parties, or to the extent otherwise required to be made by the applicable
Party or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of any then-existing
contract, no Party shall be obligated to contribute capital or pay
any consideration in any form (including providing any letter of credit,
guaranty or other financial accommodation) to any Person in order to obtain or

such lease prior to the Separation Effective Time, BRE and BAM shall negotiate
a sublease arrangement between BRE and BAM with respect to the Headquarters,
reasonably acceptable to BRE and BAM. 

2.9 _Ancillary Agreements_. On or prior to the Separation Effective Time,

reference its former name for any legitimate business purpose that is
relevant to its historical operations.

Estate Access REIT, Inc.) may continue to use the name "Broadstone" and
associated marks following the Separation Effective Time.

BEHALF OF ITSELF AND EACH MEMBER OF THE BRE GROUP) AND BAM (ON BEHALF OF

signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties.

 

(b) This Agreement, the Merger Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the
Exhibits, Schedules and Appendices hereto and thereto contain the entire
agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof,

understandings, commitments and conversations with respect to such subject
matter, and there are no agreements or understandings between the Parties
other than those set forth or referred to herein or therein.

 

(c) BRE represents on behalf of itself and each other member of the BRE

(i) each such Person has the requisite power and authority and has taken
all action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement
and each Ancillary Agreement to which it is a party and to consummate the

agreement of it enforceable in accordance with the terms thereof.

Each Party expressly adopts and confirms each such facsimile, stamp or
mechanical signature (regardless of whether delivered in person, by mail, by
courier, by facsimile or by email in portable document format (PDF)) made in
its respective name as if it were a manual signature delivered in person,
agrees that it will not assert that any such signature or delivery is not
adequate to bind such Party to the same extent as if it were signed manually
and delivered in person and agrees that, at the reasonable request of the
other Parties at any time, it will as promptly as is reasonably practicable
cause each such Ancillary Agreement to be manually executed (any such
execution to be as of the date of the initial date thereof) and delivered in
person, by mail or by courier.

 

7.2 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of actions (whether at Law, in
contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or related to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement,
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State

judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided
for notices in _Section_ __ _ 7.7_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the

7.8 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement or the application thereof to any Person or circumstance is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, the remaining provisions hereof or thereof, or

 



18

    

 the application of such provision to Persons or circumstances or in
jurisdictions other than those as to which it has been held invalid or
unenforceable, shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated thereby. Upon such determination, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon such a
suitable and equitable provision to effect the original intent of the Parties.

 

7.9 _Force Majeure_. No Party shall be deemed in default of this Agreement
or, unless otherwise expressly provided therein, any Ancillary Agreement for
any delay or failure to fulfill any obligation (other than a payment
obligation) hereunder or thereunder so long as and to the extent to which any
delay or failure in the fulfillment of such obligation is prevented,
frustrated, hindered or delayed as a consequence of circumstances of Force
Majeure. In the event of any such excused delay, the time for performance of
such obligations (other than a payment obligation) shall be extended for a
period equal to the time lost by reason of the delay. A Party claiming the
benefit of this provision shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
occurrence of any such event, (a) provide written notice to the other Party of
the nature and extent of any such Force Majeure condition; and (b) use
commercially reasonable efforts to remove any such causes and resume
performance under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, as applicable,
as soon as reasonably practicable.

otherwise mutually agreed to in writing by the Parties, neither any Party nor
any member of such Partys Group shall have any right of set-off or other
similar rights with respect to (a) any amounts received pursuant to this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; or (b) any other amounts claimed to be
owed to such Party or any member of its Group arising out of this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement.

 

7.11 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this
Agreement, the Merger Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, or as otherwise

connection with the preparation, execution, delivery and implementation of
this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement and/or the Contemplated Transactions
shall be borne by the Party or its applicable Subsidiary incurring such fees,
costs or expenses; _provided_ that any expenses of Trident BRE, the Blocker
Corps or the New Blocker Corps incurred in connection with the implementation
of this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement and/or the Contemplated Transaction
after the Separation Effective Time shall be borne by BAM.

 

7.12 _Headings_. The article, section and paragraph headings contained in
this Agreement and in the Ancillary Agreements are for reference purposes

7.13 _Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements_. The
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement shall
terminate at the earlier of the Closing (as defined in the Merger Agreement)
and such time as this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms,
as the case may be; _provided_ that this _Section_ __ _ 7.13_ shall not limit
any covenant or agreement of the Parties which by its terms contemplates
performance as of or after the Closing (as defined in the Merger Agreement)
or after termination of this Agreement, as the case may be. Following the
Closing (as defined in the Merger Agreement), no

 



19

    

 party shall have any Liability for any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.13_ shall limit any claim for
fraud or Willful and Material Breach (as defined in the Merger Agreement).

 

7.14 _Waivers of Default_. Waiver by a Party of any default by another
Party of any provision of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement shall not
be deemed a waiver by the waiving Party of any subsequent or other default,
nor shall it prejudice the rights of any other Party. No failure or delay by a
Party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or
partial exercise thereof prejudice any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

 

7.15 _Specific Performance_. In the event of any actual or threatened
default in, or breach of, any of the terms, conditions and provisions of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, the Party or Parties who are, or are to
be, thereby aggrieved shall have the right to specific performance and
injunctive or other equitable relief in respect of its or their rights under
this Agreement or such Ancillary Agreement, in addition to any and all other
rights and remedies at Law or in equity, and all such rights and remedies
shall be cumulative. The Parties agree that the remedies at law for any
breach or threatened breach, including monetary damages, are inadequate
compensation for any loss and that any defense in any Action for specific
performance that a remedy at law would be adequate is waived. Any requirements
for the securing or posting of any bond with such remedy are waived by each
of the Parties.

7.16 _Amendments_. No provisions of this Agreement, including any
Exhibit, Schedule or Appendices hereto, or any Ancillary Agreement shall be
deemed waived, amended, supplemented or modified by a Party, unless such
waiver, amendment, supplement or modification is in writing and signed by the
authorized representative of the Party against whom it is sought to enforce
such waiver, amendment, supplement or modification. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement may be amended by
BRE without the consent of any other Party in order to reflect an Earlier
Sale and any such Earlier Sale shall not be prohibited or limited by this
Agreement.

20

    

 which banking institutions are generally authorized or required by Law to

refer to this Agreement or such other agreement as of the date on which it is
executed and as it may be amended, modified or supplemented thereafter, unless
otherwise specified; and (j) unless expressly stated to the contrary in this
Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement, all references to "the date hereof,"
"the date of this Agreement," "hereby" and "hereupon" and words of similar

7.18 _Mutual Drafting_. This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements shall
be deemed to be the joint work product of the Parties and any rule of

7.19 _No Admission of Liability_. The allocation of Assets and Liabilities
herein (including on the Schedules hereto) is solely for the purpose of
allocation such Assets and Liabilities between BRE and BAM and is not intended
as an admission of liability or responsibility for any alleged Liabilities
vis-a-vis any Third Party, including with respect to the Liabilities of any
non-wholly owned Subsidiary of BRE or BAM.

 

7.20 _Non-Recourse of Other Persons_. This Agreement may only be enforced
against, and any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may only be
brought against, the entities that are expressly named as parties and then
only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect
to such party. Except to the extent a Person is a named party to this
Agreement, no past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, affiliate, agent, attorney,
advisor or representative or affiliate of any of the foregoing shall have any
Liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more
of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other
obligations or liabilities of any one or more of Parties under this Agreement

transfer of BRE Sales and Distribution Business described in _Section_ __ _
2.2_, together with BREs disposal of its Equity Interests in BAM described
in _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)(i)_, are intended to qualify as a partnership
division taking the "assets over form" (as described by U.S.
Treasury Regulations Section 1.708-1(d)) in which no gain or loss is
recognized by BRE, BAM, or BRE Record Members under Sections 721(a), 731(a)
and 731(b) of the Code, (ii) the Trident BRE Redemption described in
_Section_ __ _ 3.2_ is intended to be treated as a property distribution in

and (iii) the redemption distributions under  _Section_ __ _ 3.3_ and the

F.2d 914 (6th Cir. 1954) and Revenue Ruling 54-458, 1954-2 C.B. 167, and all
of the Parties of this Agreement shall file all Tax Returns and reports
consistent with such treatment, and shall not treat any portion of the
distributions described in _Section_ __ _ 3.3_ as a dividend for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes, and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith
in any such Tax Return or report or in any proceeding in respect of Taxes.

WHEREAS, in accordance with the Merger Agreement, it is intended for federal

exchange for the OP Merger Consideration and rights with respect to the OP
Earnout Consideration (as such terms are defined in the Merger Agreement) in
a transaction qualifying under Section 721(a) of the Code and, immediately

respect to the OP Earnout Consideration to its members, with the Operating
Company being a continuation of the Operating Company pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 1.708-1(c)(1);

 

WHEREAS, in partial consideration for the Merger, each Contributor has elected
to receive the limited liability company membership units (" _Membership

ARTICLE 2

PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS 

AND MINIMUM DEBT THRESHOLDS

 

2.1 _Prohibited Transactions_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Article 2, the Operating Company
agrees for the benefit of each Protected Member and each Indirect Owner, for
the term of the Tax Protection Period, not to directly or indirectly
consummate (i) a sale, transfer, exchange, or other disposition of any
Protected Property or any interest therein held directly or indirectly by the
Operating Company, in a transaction that results in the recognition of any
Protected Gain by any Protected Member, or (ii) any Fundamental Transaction
that would result in the recognition of any Protected Gain by any Protected
Member (any such disposition under clause (i) or Fundamental Transaction under
clause (ii) taking place during the Protected Period, a " _Prohibited
Transaction_ "), without regard to whether such Prohibited Transaction is
voluntary or involuntary.

(b) If the Operating Company or the REIT consummates a Fundamental
Transaction with any entity that is a publicly traded real estate investment
trust (within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code) or any entity that is
controlled by such a publicly traded real estate investment trust (a "
_Public REIT_ "), the Operating Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to structure such transaction such that (i) in consideration for such
transaction, the Protected Members may elect to receive interests in
a partnership or limited liability company without recognition of gain for
federal income tax purposes by the Protected Members; (ii) the consideration
that is offered to the Protected Members is economically equivalent to the
consideration that is offered to the owners of the common stock of the REIT;
and (iii) the successor-in-interest of the Operating Company or of the REIT
agrees to assume the obligations of the REIT or the Operating Company under
this Agreement.

(c) If the Operating Company or the REIT consummates a Fundamental
Transaction with any entity other than a Public REIT, the Operating Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to structure such transaction such
that (i) in consideration for such transaction, the Protected Members may
elect to receive interests in a partnership or limited liability company
without recognition of gain for federal income tax purposes by the Protected
Members; (ii) the consideration that is offered to the Protected Members is
economically equivalent to the consideration that is offered to the owners of
the common stock of the REIT; (iii) such transaction provides an opportunity
for liquidity to the Protected Members; and (iv) the successor-in-interest of
the Operating Company or of the REIT agrees to assume the obligations of the
REIT or the Operating Company under this Agreement.

 

2.2 _Allocation of Indebtedness_.

 

(a) _Maintenance of Indebtedness_. The Operating Company agrees to
maintain, or caused to be maintained, sufficient indebtedness as will enable
the Operating Company to meet the requirements set forth below in this Section
2.2.

 

(b) _Special Allocation of Liabilities_.

 



Page 4

    

(i) The parties acknowledge that, at the closing of the Merger, the BRE
Existing Credit Facilities (as defined in the Merger Agreement) will become
the debt of the Operating Company and that, in connection with the Merger,
each Protected Member will provide a personal guarantee of a portion of the
BRE Existing Credit Facilities corresponding to such Protected Members
Minimum Liability Amount.

 

(ii) Subject to any pre-existing obligations to any of the other
Members of the Operating Company, at any time after the maturity or repayment
of the BRE Existing Credit Facilities, the Operating Company shall allocate
Non-Recourse Indebtedness to Protected Members by applying Treasury
Regulation Section 1.752-3(a)(3) to allocate Non-Recourse Indebtedness
attributable to the Protected Property (for purposes of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.752-3) to such Protected Member up to the amount by which the
"built-in Section 704(c) gain" with respect to the Protected Property exceeds
the amount of the Non-Recourse Indebtedness considered secured by the
Protected Property and allocated to such Protected Member under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.752-3(a)(2).

 

(iii) If the amount of Non-Recourse Indebtedness allocated to a
Protected Member pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(ii) hereof would be less than such
Protected Members Minimum Liability Amount, the Operating Company shall
offer to such Protected Member the opportunity to enter into a guarantee,
reimbursement, indemnification, or capital contribution obligation agreement
pursuant to which such Protected Member would enter into a written obligation
to guarantee, reimburse, indemnify, or contribute capital upon the occurrence
of certain events in such an amount that, when combined with any allocation of
Non-Recourse Indebtedness of the Operating Company pursuant to Section
2.2(b)(ii) hereof, is sufficient, in the reasonable judgment of the Protected
Member, to cause such Protected Member to be allocated indebtedness of the
Operating Company equal to such Protected Members Minimum Liability
Amount; provided, however, that the Operating Company shall not be required
to allocate any amount of indebtedness to a Protected Member unless an
Accounting Firm is of the view that such allocation is more likely than not
permissible under Section 752 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder. If the Operating Company satisfies its obligations under Sections
2.2(b)(ii) and (iii) hereof and such Protected Member elects not to enter into
such a guarantee, reimbursement, indemnification, or capital contribution
obligation agreement, then the Operating Company shall have no liability for
monetary damages under Article 3 or otherwise for any taxes incurred by such
Protected Member as a result of such election.

 

(c) _Minimum Liability Amount Notification Requirement_. In the event
that, at any time after the date hereof, a Protected Member engages or
proposes to engage in a transaction that will result in an decrease in its
Minimum Liability Amount, including, without limitation, a conversion of
Membership Units into shares of the REITs common stock or the sale,
transfer, or other disposition of Membership Units in a taxable transaction,
such Protected Member shall provide written notice to the Operating Company
setting forth the terms or proposed terms of such transaction and the
information reasonably requested by the Operating Company so that the
Operating Company can determine the Minimum Liability Amount following the
completion of such transaction for purposes of complying with Section 2.2.

 

2.3 _Section 704(c) Method_. The Operating Company shall report
allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction (as computed for tax
purposes) with respect to the Merger and the contribution of the Contributed
Property so as to take account of the Section 704(c) built-in gain of
such property under Code Section 704(c) or the principles set forth in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(a), as the case may be, using the
"traditional method" under Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(b), subject to
applicable law.

 



Page 5

    

2.4 _No Representation With Regard to Tax Treatment_. The Contributors
hereby acknowledge and agree that neither the REIT nor the Operating Company
gave the Contributors any tax advice in connection with the transactions
contemplated herein and that the Contributors have relied on their own
independent tax advisors and professionals.

2.5 _Cooperation_. If at any time the Operating Company does not have
sufficient Non-Recourse Indebtedness to comply with Section 2.2 solely as a
result of any amendments, changes, or modifications to the Code or the
Treasury Regulations, then the Operating Company and such Protected Member
shall cooperate with each other to discuss, evaluate, and (in each partys
sole and absolute discretion) take such further acts as may be reasonably
necessary in order to ensure that such Protected Member does not recognize
any Protected Gain; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, if
the Operating Company satisfies its obligations under Section 2.2 and either
(a) such Protected Member elects not to enter into a guarantee,
reimbursement, indemnification, or capital contribution obligation agreement
after such discussion and evaluation or (b) there is a Final Determination
that such guarantee, reimbursement, indemnification, or capital contribution
obligation agreement did not cause a special allocation of liabilities for
federal income tax purposes to such Protected Member in the full amount
intended, then the Operating Company shall have no liability for monetary
damages under Article 3 or otherwise for any taxes incurred by such Protected
Member as a result of such election or Final Determination.

ARTICLE 3

 

REMEDIES FOR BREACH

 

3.1 _Monetary Damages_. Subject to the terms and conditions of Article
2, in the event that either the Operating Company breaches its obligations
set forth in Article 2 (other than Section 2.2), and any Protected Member or
Indirect Owner recognizes Protected Gain, such Protected Members sole right
shall be to receive from the Operating Company, and the Operating Company
shall pay to such Protected Member as damages, an amount equal to the excess
of (a) the aggregate federal, state, and local tax on income and Medicare
taxes (including Section 1411 of the Code) incurred by such Protected Member
or an Indirect Owner of such Protected Member with respect to the Protected
Gain that is allocable to (or borne by) such Protected Member or Indirect
Owner as a result of such breach (computed in accordance with Section 3.2)
over (b) the product of the Per Unit Threshold and the number of outstanding
Membership Units held by such Protected Member to which such breach relates.
Subject to the terms and conditions of Article 2, in the event that the
Operating Company breaches its obligations set forth in Section 2.2 and any
Protected Member or Indirect Owner recognizes Protected Gain, such Protected
Members sole right shall be to receive from the Operating Company, and
the Operating Company shall pay to such Protected Member as damages, an
amount equal to the aggregate federal, state, and local tax on income and
Medicare taxes (including Section 1411 of the Code) incurred by such Protected
Member or an Indirect Owner of such Protected Member with respect to the
Protected Gain that is allocable to (or borne by) such Protected Member or
Indirect Owner as a result of such breach (computed in accordance with Section
3.2). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.1, the
Operating Companys total liability under this Agreement shall not exceed the
Maximum Indemnification Amount. If, but for the previous sentence, as part of
a single transaction or series of related transactions, the Operating
Companys liability to the Protected Members pursuant to this Section 3.1
would exceed the Maximum Indemnification Amount, any payments by the Operating
Company to the Protected Members pursuant to this Section 3.1 as a result of
such transaction or series of transactions shall be made first to the
Protected Members who are Arlene Z. Leenhouts or trusts of which Arlene Z.
Leenhouts is treated as the owner for federal income tax purposes,
in proportion to their respective outstanding Membership Units as of the time
of the breach, and the balance, if any, to the other Protected Members in
proportion to their respective outstanding Membership Units as of the time of
the breach.

 



Page 6

    

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the sole and
exclusive rights and remedies of any Protected Member or Indirect Owner for a
breach or violation of the covenants or obligations of the REIT or the
Operating Company under this Agreement shall be a claim for damages against
the Operating Company as specified in Section 3.1 of this Agreement, and no
Protected Member or Indirect Owner shall be entitled to pursue a claim for
specific performance or for any other damages.

 

3.2 _Computation_. For purposes of computing the amount of federal,
state, and local income taxes required to be paid by any Protected Member (or
Indirect Owner), (i) any deduction for state income taxes payable as a result
thereof actually allowed in computing federal income taxes shall be taken into
account (but assuming limitation on full deductibility due to adjusted gross
income levels), and (ii) such Protected Members (or Indirect Owners) tax
liability shall be computed using the highest federal, state and local
marginal income tax rates (including any surtaxes and Medicare taxes under
Section 1411 of the Code) that would be applicable to such Protected Members
(or Indirect Owners) taxable income (taking into account the character and
type of such income or gain) for the year with respect to which the taxes
must be paid, without regard to any deductions, losses or credits that may be
available to such Protected Member (or Indirect Owner).

 

3.3 _Required Notices; Time for Payment_. In the event that there has
been a breach of Article 2 during the Tax Protection Period, the Operating
Company shall provide to each Protected Member written notice of the
transaction, event or other circumstance giving rise to such breach not later
than thirty (30) days after occurrence of a breach. As soon as reasonably
practicable after giving notice of breach, but in no event more than sixty
(60) days after occurrence of a breach, the Operating Company shall be
obligated to (i) provide each Protected Member with a detailed calculation of
the amount of each Protected Members damage payment as determined under this
Article 3, and (ii) provide each Protected Member with such evidence or
verification as such Protected Member may reasonably require as to the items
necessary to confirm the calculation of such amount. Subject to the
negotiation and final resolution of any disagreements in accordance with
Section 3.4, all payments required under this Article 3 to a Protected
Members shall be made in immediately available funds to such Protected Member
on or before April 10 of the year following the year in which the gain
recognition event giving rise to such payment took place.

 

3.4 _Process for Determining Damages_. If the Operating Company has
breached or violated any of the covenants set forth in Article 2 (or any
Protected Member asserts that the Operating Company has breached or violated
any of the covenants set forth in Article 2), the Operating Company and such
Protected Member agree to negotiate to resolve any disagreements regarding
any such breach or violation and the amount of damages, if any, payable to
such Protected Member under Section 3.1. If any such disagreement cannot be
resolved by the Operating Company and such Protected Member within sixty (60)
days after the receipt of notice from the Operating Company of such breach and
the amount of income to be recognized by reason thereof (or, if applicable,
receipt by the Operating Company of an assertion by such Protected Member
that the Operating Company has breached or violated Article 2), then the
Operating Company and such Protected Member shall jointly retain a nationally
or regionally recognized independent public accounting firm that is
mutually acceptable to the Company and such Protected Member (an "
_Accounting Firm_ ") to act as an arbitrator to resolve as expeditiously as
possible all points of any such disagreement. All determinations made by the
Accounting Firm with respect to the resolution of any breach or violation of
any of the covenants set forth in Article 2 and the amount of damages payable
to such Protected Member under Section 3.1 shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the Operating Company and such Protected Member. The fees and
expenses of any Accounting Firm incurred in connection with any such
determination shall be shared equally by the Operating Company and such
Protected Member.

2

 the Trident Holders are requesting a number of shares of Common Stock to
be registered that, at such time of notice to BNL, have an aggregate value of
not less than $50 million or includes all of the Registrable Shares held by
the Trident Holders;

 



 

 the Trident Holders, in the aggregate, shall be entitled to request the
filing of two (2) Demand Registration Statements, subject to certain
customary exceptions whereby a Demand Registration Statement does not count
toward such limitation, including (i) the failure of a Demand Registration
Statement and the prospectus relating thereto to become effective and (ii) in

Registration Statement to include at least 80% of the Demand Registrable

Shelf Registration Statement:

 |  |

BNL shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) prepare and file, on or

Statement to be declared effective by the SEC as soon as reasonably

Common Stock for its own account or for the account of other security holders
of BNL (other than (a) on a registration statement on Form S-4, Form S-8 or
comparable form or (b) in the event of a "bought deal" or "block trade" by
the Trident Holders) that permits the inclusion of the Registrable Shares,
then each of the Trident Holders and any Tait Family Member who holds
Registrable Shares will be entitled to participate, directly or indirectly,
(or "piggyback") in a sale of such Registrable Shares (a " _Piggyback
Registration_ "); _provided_ , that:

 



 

 BNL shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the managing
underwriter or underwriters of a proposed underwritten offering to permit the
Registrable Shares requested to be included in a Piggyback Registration to be
included on the same terms and conditions as any similar securities of BNL
included therein; and

 



 

 The Registration Rights Agreement shall contain customary provisions
relating to such piggyback rights, including the cutback restrictions below. 

   | 
  

Cutbacks:

 |  |

In the case of an underwritten offering (other than a "bought deal" or "block
trade" by the Trident Holders), if the managing underwriter(s) advise BNL,
the Trident Holders and any Tait Family Member that, in the reasonable opinion
of the managing underwriter(s), the number of shares of Common Stock proposed
to be included in such registration exceeds the number of shares of Common
Stock that can be sold in such underwritten offering without materially
delaying or jeopardizing the success of the offering (including the offering
price per share), then BNL will include in such registration, unless
otherwise agreed by the parties, as follows:



 

 where such registration is initiated by BNL, shares of Common Stock will
be included according to the following priority: first, those of BNL that it
proposed to issue and sell for its own account; second, those of the Trident
Holders; and third, those of any Tait Family Member and others with 

  



4

            |  | 
---|---|--- 
     |  |

registration rights, pro rata on the basis of the number of shares of Common
Stock owned;

 



 

 where such registration is initiated by the Trident Holders, shares of
Common Stock will be included according to the following priority: first,
those of the Trident Holders; second, those of any Tait Family Member; and
third, any securities proposed to be registered for the account of BNL or any
securities proposed to be registered for the account of any other persons;
and



 

 The Registration Rights Agreement shall contain customary provisions
effectuating the cutback limitations. 

   | 
  

Expenses:

 |  |

BNL will pay all customary registration expenses in connection with any and
all Demand Registration Statements, Shelf Registration Statements, as well as
any Piggyback Registrations, as well as the reasonable fees and expenses of
one counsel for the Trident Holders. The Trident Holders and any Tait Family
Member will pay any underwriting discount and/or commission. 

   | 
  

Other Provisions:

 |  |

The Registration Rights Agreement shall include:

 



 

 a provision that holders of a majority of the securities to be included in
a Demand Registration Statement or a Shelf Registration Statement shall have
the right to select the investment banker(s) and manager(s) and to determine
the plan of distribution, subject in each case to the approval of BNL, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;



 

 customary provisions permitting BNL under certain circumstances to postpone
the filing or effectiveness of any registration statement for a Demand
Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to a shelf registration
statement for a Shelf Registration Statement for up to 60 days ( _provided_ ,
that BNL may not postpone more than 2 times during any 12-month period or
within 120 days of any prior postponement); and



 

 such other provisions that are reasonable and customary for registration
rights agreements for a company in the business and of the size and valuation

ARTICLE XI

 

 _INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING; REPURCHASES_

 

11.1 _Repurchases of Covered OP Units_. If an IPO Closing Date does not occur
on or before December 31, 2020, then, during the Repurchase Period, each
Member (each an " _Eligible Holder_ ") who received Membership Units as OP
Merger Consideration (the " _Covered OP Units_ ") shall have the right to
require the Operating Company to repurchase any or all of such Eligible
Holders Covered OP Units by giving written notice (a " _Repurchase Notice_ ")
thereof, which notice will specify the number of Covered OP Units to be
repurchased (" _Repurchase Units_ "). The date on which a Repurchase Notice
is given by an Eligible Holder is the " _Repurchase Notice Date_ " for such
Repurchase Notice. " _Repurchase Period_ " means the period from January 1,
2021 until the earlier of twelve (12) months thereafter or an IPO Closing
Date; _provided_ that the Repurchase Period shall not begin on January 1, 2021
if the Managing Member, in connection with an Initial Public Offering, shall
have filed a registration statement with the SEC that has not been withdrawn
as of January 1, 2021 (but the Repurchase Period shall begin immediately upon
any such withdrawal and then continue until the earlier of twelve (12) months
thereafter or an IPO Closing Date); _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Repurchase Period shall begin no later than July 1, 2021 (even if such
registration statement shall not have been withdrawn as of July 1, 2021) and
in such event shall continue until the earlier of twelve (12) months
thereafter or an IPO Closing Date. If the Managing Member makes an initial
confidential submission of a draft registration statement or a public filing

 



2

    

 of a registration statement during the Repurchase Period, then the right of
Eligible Holders to deliver a Repurchase Notice shall be suspended for a
period not to exceed six (6) months (the " _Blackout Period_ ") and the
Repurchase Period shall be extended automatically without further action of
any Person by a period of time equal to the Blackout Period (but, in any
event, not past the IPO Closing Date). The Blackout Period shall end on the
earlier to occur of (i) the IPO Closing Date or (ii) the Managing Members
decision to abandon such Initial Public Offering. After any Eligible Holder
sends a Repurchase Notice, but before the Operating Company repurchases such
Eligible Holders Covered OP Units, such Eligible Holder shall have the right
to revoke its Repurchase Notice, in whole or in part, by giving written notice
(a " _Revocation Notice_ ") thereof; _provided_ that the right of an Eligible
Holder to deliver a Revocation Notice shall be suspended during the Blackout
Period.

11.2  _Repurchase Price_. The Operating Company shall be obligated to
repurchase for cash any Repurchase Units in respect of which a valid
Repurchase Notice has been delivered on a timely basis (and no Revocation
Notice has been delivered), at a per unit price equal to (i) the greater of
the OP Unit Value or the "Determined Share Value" of a Share in effect as of
the Repurchase Notice Date, _plus_ (ii) interest thereon at a rate of the
greater of 6.21% per annum and the then current dividend rate paid by the
Manager Member with respect to the Shares as of the Repurchase Notice Date,
calculated on the basis of a 365-day year, accruing from the Repurchase Notice
Date through the date of repurchase, _minus_ (iii) the aggregate amount of
any distributions declared and payable thereon from the Repurchase Notice Date
through the date of repurchase (to the extent actually paid). The repurchase
of such Repurchase Units shall occur within one year of the Repurchase Notice
Date, on one or more dates determined by the Operating Company, taking into
account restrictions under Applicable Law or any indebtedness and available
liquidity and target leverage objectives. Until the repurchase of a
Repurchase Unit occurs, such Repurchase Unit shall remain issued and
outstanding for all purposes, including the right to receive distributions in
respect thereof, when and if declared.

 

11.3 _Repurchases of Earnout Units_. If an IPO Closing Date does not occur on
or before the satisfaction of any Earnout Trigger, then each Eligible Holder
who receives Membership Units as OP Earnout Consideration (" _Earnout Units_
") shall have the right to require the Operating Company to repurchase any or
all of such Earnout Units on the same terms and conditions (including the
Blackout Period) set forth in _Sections 11.1_ and _11.2_ ; _provided_ that the
"Repurchase Period" for any Earnout Units shall be the period from the date of
issuance of such Earnout Units until the earlier of twelve (12) months
thereafter or an IPO Closing Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that such
Repurchase Period shall not begin on such date of issuance if the Managing
Member, in connection with an Initial Public Offering, shall have filed a
registration statement with the SEC that has not been withdrawn as of such
date of issuance (but such Repurchase Period shall begin immediately upon any
such withdrawal and then continue until the earlier of twelve (12) months
thereafter or an IPO Closing Date); _provided_ , _further_ , that such
Repurchase Period shall begin no later than six (6) months after such date of
issuance (even if such registration statement shall not have been withdrawn
as of such date) and in such event shall continue until the earlier of twelve
(12) months thereafter or an IPO Closing Date.

MISCELLANEOUS

 

3.1 _Binding_ _Effect; No Third-Party Beneficiaries; Assignment_. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other
than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors
and assigns, any rights, benefits or obligations hereunder. No party hereto
may assign, transfer, dispose of or otherwise alienate this Agreement or any
of its rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement (whether by
operation of law or otherwise); _provided_ that (a) in the event BNL (or any
of its successors or assigns) (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then in either such case, BNL shall cause
its successors and assigns, as the case may be, to assume BNLs obligations
under this Agreement, and (b) in the event any Eligible Holder transfers any
Covered REIT Shares or Earnout Shares in accordance with the Articles of
Incorporation of BNL, then any transferee that acquires such Covered REIT
Shares or Earnout Shares shall succeed to the rights, interests and
obligations of the transferring Eligible Holder hereunder and shall execute
and deliver a joinder to this Agreement as an "Eligible Holder". Any attempted
assignment, transfer, disposition or alienation in violation of
this Agreement shall be null, void and ineffective.

3.2 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of applicable
law, or public policy, all other conditions or provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not
affected in any matter materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
hereto as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

3.3 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all actions (whether at law, in
contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof, shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the 

 



4

    

 laws of the State of Delaware without regard to principles of conflicts of
law. Each party hereto agrees that it shall bring any proceeding arising out
of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contained in or
contemplated by this Agreement exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery
sitting in New Castle County (or, only if the Delaware Court of Chancery lacks
or declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or
federal court sitting in New Castle County within the State of Delaware) (the
" _Chosen Courts_ "), and with respect to any such proceeding (a) irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (b) waives any
objection to laying venue in any such proceeding in the Chosen Courts and (c)
waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do
not have jurisdiction over any party hereto and agrees that delivery of
notice shall constitute valid and enforceable service of legal process in any
such proceeding; _provided_ , that nothing herein shall limit such partys
ability to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law. EACH
PARTY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY, TO THE EXTENT LAWFUL, AND AGREES
THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN
EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT AMONG THE
PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION
WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

3.4 _Amendment; Waiver_. No amendment, supplement or modification of this
Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the parties hereto.
Any provision of this Agreement may be waived in writing by the party
benefited by the provision. The failure of a party to exercise any right or
remedy shall not be deemed or constitute a waiver of such right or remedy in
the future. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be
deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (regardless
of whether similar), nor shall any such waiver constitute a continuing waiver
unless otherwise expressly provided.

3.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts
each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall constitute
one instrument.

_INSTRUCTIONS FOR LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL_

 

 _General_

This Letter of Transmittal is being provided for the purpose of assisting
Holders with converting their Units, at the OP Merger Effective Time, into the
right to receive, upon delivery of a duly executed and completed copy of this
Letter of Transmittal, the applicable Merger Consideration and Aggregate
Earnout Consideration set forth in, and determined in accordance with, the
Merger Agreement at the times specified therein.

 

The applicable portion of the Merger Consideration and the applicable portion
of the Aggregate Earnout Consideration, in each case, minus any Tax
deductions, withholdings and any other amounts that BNL, BNL OP or the
Exchange Agent (as applicable) are required to deduct or withhold under the
Code or any applicable provision of Tax Law, to which a Holder is entitled
under the Merger Agreement will be delivered in accordance with the Merger
Agreement.

This Letter of Transmittal, including the Form W-9 or appropriate Form W-8,
should be properly filled in, dated and signed by the registered Holder(s) of
the Unit(s) and delivered to the Exchange Agent at the following address as
soon as possible: [ _Exchange Agent mailing address_ ] or [ _Exchange Agent
email address_ ]. The execution and delivery of the Letter of Transmittal will
evidence your surrender of your Units for cancellation in accordance with the
terms set forth herein and in the Merger Agreement.

_Signatures_

 

Signatures on this Letter of Transmittal must correspond in every particular
with the name(s) of such Holder as set forth below in the Section entitled
"Units." In case this Letter of Transmittal is executed by an attorney,
executor, administrator, guardian or other fiduciary, or by an officer of a
corporation or other entity, partner of a limited or general partnership or
manager of a limited liability company, the person executing this Letter of
Transmittal must give his full title in such capacity.

 

 _Taxpayer Identification Number Certification_

 

Under U.S. federal income tax law, you must report and certify your correct
taxpayer identification number and further certify that you are not subject
to backup withholding due to notified underreporting of income on Internal
Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") Form W-9 or an appropriate IRS Form W-8. This
Letter of Transmittal includes a Form W-9, which you should complete (if
appropriate) and return with this Letter of Transmittal. If you are a non-
resident alien individual or foreign entity, you should obtain the appropriate
Form W-8 based on your status under U.S. federal income tax law pursuant to
the instructions provided below, and complete and return such Form W-8 with
this Letter of Transmittal. Failure to provide the information requested on
the Form W-9 could result in certain penalties as well as backup withholding
on payments due to you. If you have been notified by the IRS that you are
subject to backup withholding and the IRS has not subsequently notified you
that backup withholding has terminated, you must strike out the language in
paragraph 2 of Part II on the Form W-9. Certain Holders are not subject to
backup withholding. For further information concerning backup withholding and
instructions for completing the Form W-9, see the "Important Tax Information"
section. If you are a non-resident alien individual or foreign entity, please
obtain the appropriate IRS Form W-8 from the IRS website, http://www.irs.gov.

_Payment Instructions_

 

If applicable, please complete the information for the payment instructions by
providing applicable wire transfer information in the space provided. This
will be the account to which your applicable cash portion (if any) of the
Merger Consideration and Aggregate Earnout Consideration will be wired. Please
also provide the contact information where the Exchange Agent may contact you
if there are any questions or issues regarding the wire transfer information
provided.

_Questions_

 

If you have questions regarding this Letter of Transmittal, please contact [
_Exchange Agent contact name, mailing address, telephone number and email
address_ ].

_IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION_

 

Under U.S. federal income tax law, a Holder who surrenders Units for a portion
of the Merger Consideration and Aggregate Earnout Consideration is required
to provide the Exchange Agent with the Holders correct taxpayer
identification number (" _TIN_ ") on the enclosed Form W-9 or the appropriate
Form W-8 or otherwise establish a basis for exemption from backup withholding.
Generally, if the Holder is an individual, the TIN is the Holders social
security number. If the Exchange Agent is not provided with the correct TIN,
the Holder may be subject to a $50 penalty, as well as various other
penalties, imposed by the IRS. In addition, payments made to the Holder with
respect to the Units may be subject to backup withholding.

 

Certain Holders (including, among others, certain corporations and foreign
individuals) are not subject to these backup withholding and reporting
requirements. A foreign individual may qualify as an exempt recipient or other
payee by submitting to the Exchange Agent a properly completed IRS Form W-8,
Certificate of Foreign Status, signed under penalty of perjury, attesting to
such Holders exempt status. The appropriate IRS Form W-8 may be downloaded
from the IRS website at the following address: _http://www.irs.gov_. 

If backup withholding applies, the Exchange Agent, BNL or BNL OP, as
applicable, will be required to withhold 24% of any payment made to the
Holder or other payee. Backup withholding is not an additional federal income
tax. Rather, the amount withheld will be credited against the federal income
tax liability of persons subject to backup withholding. If
withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained from
the IRS provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

 

 _Purpose of Form W-9_. To prevent backup withholding on payments that are
made to a Holder with respect to the Units, the Holder is required to provide
the Exchange Agent with the Holders current TIN by completing the Form W-9
herein, certifying that the TIN provided on Form W-9 is correct (or that such
Holder is awaiting a TIN), that the Holder is a U.S. Person, and that (i) the
Holder has not been notified by the IRS that the Holder is subject to backup
withholding as a result of failure to report all interest or dividends or
(ii) the IRS has notified the Holder that the Holder is no longer subject to
backup withholding.

 

 _What Number to Give the Representative_. The Holder is required to give the
Exchange Agent the TIN ( _e.g._ , social security number, individual taxpayer
identification number or employer identification number) of the record owner
of the Units. If the Units are held in more than one name or are not held in
the name of the actual owner, consult the "What Name and Number to give the
Requester" section in the attached Form W-9 or your tax advisor for additional
guidance on which number to report.

 

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, CONTACT YOUR OWN

 

TAX ADVISOR OR THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE.

_INSTRUCTIONS FOR ELECTION FORM AND LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL_

 

 _General_

This Election Form is being provided for the purpose of assisting Holders
with making elections in respect of, and converting, their Units, at the OP
Merger Effective Time, into the right to receive, upon delivery of a duly
executed and completed copy of this Election Form, the applicable Merger
Consideration and Aggregate Earnout Consideration set forth in, and determined
in accordance with, the Merger Agreement at the times specified therein.

 

The applicable portion of the Merger Consideration and the applicable portion
of the Aggregate Earnout Consideration, in each case, minus any Tax
deductions, withholdings and any other amounts that BNL, BNL OP or the
Exchange Agent (as applicable) are required to deduct or withhold under the
Code or any applicable provision of Tax Law, to which a Holder is entitled
under the Merger Agreement will be delivered in accordance with the Merger
Agreement and any valid election made in this Election Form (or, absent a
valid election, as deemed to have been made pursuant to the Merger Agreement).

 

This Election Form, including the Form W-9 or appropriate Form W-8, should be
properly filled in, dated and signed by the registered Holder(s) of the
Unit(s) and delivered to the Exchange Agent at the following address as soon
as possible: [ _Exchange Agent mailing address_ ] or [ _Exchange Agent email
address_ ]. The execution and delivery of the Election Form will evidence both
your election in respect of your Units, and your surrender of your Units for
cancellation, in each case in accordance with the terms set forth herein and
in the Merger Agreement.

_Elections_

 

The Merger Agreement permits holders of certain Units (" _BRE Election Units_
") to make an election to receive their portion of the applicable Merger
Consideration and Aggregate Earnout Consideration set forth in, and determined
in accordance with, the Merger Agreement in either the form of REIT Shares (a
" _REIT Share Election_ ") or BNL OP Membership Units (a " _BNL OP Membership
Unit Election_ ") or a combination thereof. You may make elections on a Unit-
by-Unit basis, so that, for example, if you own 100 BRE Election Units you
may make a REIT Share Election for any number of those Units, and
correspondingly receive BNL OP Membership Units for your remaining BRE
Election Units.

 

To make an election in respect of your BRE Election Units, you must complete
the "Election" section of this Election Form and return this completed
Election Form by no later than 5:00 p.m. New York time five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date (as provided in the Merger Agreement) (the "
_Election Deadline_ "). It is currently anticipated that the Closing Date
will be January [2], 2020; accordingly, the Election Deadline will be 5:00
p.m. New York time on December [24], 2019. If the anticipated Closing Date is
delayed beyond January [2], 2020, we will use reasonable efforts to announce
the new Election Deadline at least five (5) Business Days before the new
Election Deadline.

Your election may be revoked only by delivering to the Exchange Agent, prior
to the Election Deadline, a written notice of revocation or a properly
completed revised Election Form that identifies the BRE Election Units to
which such revised Election Form applies. The proper delivery to the Exchange
Agent prior to the Election Deadline of a revised Election Form with respect
to any BRE Election Units will result in the revocation of all prior Election
Forms with respect to all such BRE Election Units. Subject to the terms of
the Merger Agreement, and of this Election Form, the Exchange Agent, in
consultation with both BNL OP and BRE, shall have reasonable discretion to
determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or
timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in this Election Form, and
any good faith decision of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be
binding and conclusive. None of BNL OP, BRE or the Exchange Agent shall be
under any obligations to notify you of any defect in an Election Form.

If you fail to make a valid election with respect to any (or all) of your
BRE Election Units by the Election Deadline (or, if a valid election has been
made, has been revoked and not properly remade), you will be deemed to have
made a BNL OP Membership Unit Election with respect to all BRE Election Units
for which you have not made a valid and timely election.

_Signatures_

 

Signatures on this Election Form must correspond in every particular with the
name(s) of such Holder as set forth below in the Section entitled "Units." In
case this Election Form is executed by an attorney, executor, administrator,
guardian or other fiduciary, or by an officer of a corporation or other
entity, partner of a limited or 

 



6

    

 general partnership or manager of a limited liability company, the person
executing this Election Form must give his full title in such capacity.

 

 _Taxpayer Identification Number Certification_

 

Under U.S. federal income tax law, you must report and certify your correct
taxpayer identification number and further certify that you are not subject
to backup withholding due to notified underreporting of income on Internal
Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") Form W-9 or an appropriate IRS Form W-8. This
Election Form includes a Form W-9, which you should complete (if appropriate)
and return with this Election Form. If you are a non-resident alien
individual or foreign entity, you should obtain the appropriate Form W-8 based
on your status under U.S. federal income tax law pursuant to the instructions
provided below, and complete and return such Form W-8 with this Election Form.
Failure to provide the information requested on the Form W-9 could result
in certain penalties as well as backup withholding on payments due to you. If
you have been notified by the IRS that you are subject to backup withholding
and the IRS has not subsequently notified you that backup withholding has
terminated, you must strike out the language in paragraph 2 of Part II on the
Form W-9. Certain Holders are not subject to backup withholding. For further
information concerning backup withholding and instructions for completing the
Form W-9, see the "Important Tax Information" section. If you are a non-
resident alien individual or foreign entity, please obtain the appropriate IRS
Form W-8 from the IRS website, http://www.irs.gov.

_Payment Instructions_

 

If applicable, please complete the information for the payment instructions by
providing applicable wire transfer information in the space provided. This
will be the account to which your applicable cash portion (if any) of the
Merger Consideration and Aggregate Earnout Consideration will be wired. Please
also provide the contact information where the Exchange Agent may contact you
if there are any questions or issues regarding the wire transfer information
provided.

_Questions_

 

If you have questions regarding this Election Form, please contact [ _Exchange
Agent contact name, mailing address, telephone number and email address_ ].

_IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION_

 

Under U.S. federal income tax law, a Holder who surrenders Units for a portion
of the Merger Consideration and Aggregate Earnout Consideration is required
to provide the Exchange Agent with the Holders correct taxpayer
identification number (" _TIN_ ") on the enclosed Form W-9 or the appropriate
Form W-8 or otherwise establish a basis for exemption from backup withholding.
Generally, if the Holder is an individual, the TIN is the Holders social
security number. If the Exchange Agent is not provided with the correct TIN,
the Holder may be subject to a $50 penalty, as well as various other
penalties, imposed by the IRS. In addition, payments made to the Holder with
respect to the Units may be subject to backup withholding.

 

Certain Holders (including, among others, certain corporations and foreign
individuals) are not subject to these backup withholding and reporting
requirements. A foreign individual may qualify as an exempt recipient or other
payee by submitting to the Exchange Agent a properly completed IRS Form W-8,
Certificate of Foreign Status, signed under penalty of perjury, attesting to
such Holders exempt status. The appropriate IRS Form W-8 may be downloaded
from the IRS website at the following address: _http://www.irs.gov_. 

If backup withholding applies, the Exchange Agent, BNL or BNL OP, as
applicable, will be required to withhold 24% of any payment made to the
Holder or other payee. Backup withholding is not an additional federal income
tax. Rather, the amount withheld will be credited against the federal income
tax liability of persons subject to backup withholding. If
withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained from
the IRS provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

 

 _Purpose of Form W-9_. To prevent backup withholding on payments that are
made to a Holder with respect to the Units, the Holder is required to provide
the Exchange Agent with the Holders current TIN by completing the Form W-9
herein, certifying that the TIN provided on Form W-9 is correct (or that such
Holder is awaiting a TIN), that the Holder is a U.S. Person, and that (i) the
Holder has not been notified by the IRS that the Holder is subject to backup
withholding as a result of failure to report all interest or dividends or
(ii) the IRS has notified the Holder that the Holder is no longer subject to
backup withholding.

 

 _What Number to Give the Representative_. The Holder is required to give the
Exchange Agent the TIN ( _e.g._ , social security number, individual taxpayer
identification number or employer identification number) of the record owner
of the Units. If the Units are held in more than one name or are not held in
the name of the actual owner, consult the "What Name and Number to give the
Requester" section in the attached Form W-9 or your tax advisor for additional
guidance on which number to report.

TAX ADVISOR OR THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE.

consulting agreement with any person who is or was a BNL Employee, unless such
person ceased to be a BNL Employee at least six months prior to such action by
[a][the] Restricted Party or its subsidiary. As used herein, " _BNL Employee_
" means any person who is an officer or employee of BNL, BNL OP or any of
their respective subsidiaries, including, without limitation, any persons

(b) Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in _Section_ __ _
2(a)_, the [applicable] Restricted Party shall not be deemed to have violated

employment placed by the Restricted Party or its subsidiary and not
specifically targeted at any BNL Employee.

_Confidentiality_. 

---|--- 
 

(a) For a period of three (3) years after the date hereof, [each][the]
Restricted Party will, and will cause [her][their respective] subsidiaries
to, directly or indirectly, not use, distribute, disseminate, share or
otherwise make public, and will, and will cause [her][their respective]
subsidiaries and [her][their] and [her][their] subsidiaries Representatives
to, otherwise keep confidential, all Business Confidential Information;
_provided_ , that [a][the] Restricted Party and its subsidiaries and
Representatives may use Business Confidential Information (i) for good faith
business purposes that do not violate the terms of _Section_ __ _ 1_ or
_Section_ __ _ 2_ hereof or otherwise compete with BNL, BNL OP or their
respective subsidiaries or (ii) as required by applicable Law, including
without limitation in connection with the preparation of Tax returns or in
connection with any administrative or judicial proceedings relating to Taxes.
If [a][the] Restricted Party discloses any Business Confidential Information
to any of its or its subsidiaries Representatives, the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 3_ shall apply to such Representatives and the Restricted
Party shall notify such Representatives of the provisions of this _Section_
__ _ 3_ and shall be responsible for any breach of the provisions hereof by
such Representatives.

 

(b) As used herein, " _Business Confidential Information_ " shall mean
all non-public, confidential, or proprietary information regarding the
business or affairs of BNL, BNL OP or BRE obtained by or disclosed to [a][the]
Restricted Party or its employees, officers, representatives or agents ("
_Representatives_ ") prior to the Closing Date, whether such information is
disclosed orally or disclosed or accessed in written, electronic, or other
form or media, and whether or not marked, designated, or otherwise identified
as "confidential," including all information concerning customers, suppliers,
finances, services, organizational structure, internal practices, forecasts,
financial results, records, budgets, marketing and commercial
strategies. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the term
"Business Confidential Information," with respect to [any][the] Restricted
Party, shall not include information that: (i) is or hereafter becomes
generally available to and known by the public other than as a result of,
directly or indirectly, any violation of this Agreement by the Restricted
Party or any of its Representatives, (ii) was acquired by such Restricted
Party on a non-confidential basis from a third-party source, provided that
such third party is not and was not legally prohibited from disclosing such
Business Confidential Information to the Restricted Party or
its Representatives, and (iii) was or is independently developed by the
Restricted Party, as established by documentary evidence, without reference to
or use of, in whole or in part, any Business Confidential Information.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, [a][the] Restricted Party and each of its
subsidiaries and Representatives is permitted to disclose Business
Confidential Information to the extent required by law (in the reasonable
opinion of counsel) or requested by a governmental authority, in which event
[such][the] Restricted Party shall use [her][its] commercially
reasonable efforts to notify and allow BNL and BNL OP reasonable time to
review, comment on (or seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy
regarding) such disclosure in advance of its disclosure, and such disclosure
will only contain such information that [such][the] Restricted Party or its
subsidiary or Representative was required by law or requested by a
governmental authority to disclose; _provided_ , that [a][the] Restricted
Party shall not be required to provide notice to BNL or BNL OP where
disclosure is in connection with a routine audit or examination by, or a
blanket document request from, a governmental authority or self-regulatory
authority in the ordinary course of its supervisory or regulatory authority
that does not specifically target BNL or BNL OP.

_Acknowledgements_. 

---|--- 
 

(a) [Each][The] Restricted Party hereby acknowledges and agrees that
BNL, BNL OP and their respective subsidiaries could be irreparably damaged if
[such][the] Restricted Party were to, directly or indirectly, engage in
conduct violative of the terms of this Agreement, and that doing so could
result in a significant loss of goodwill and value by BNL, BNL OP and their
respective subsidiaries.

(b) The Parties agree that the terms set forth in _Section_ __ _ 1,_
_Section_ __ _ 2_ and _Section_ __ _ 3_ are, taken as a whole, reasonable
and necessary to protect the interests of BNL, BNL OP and their
respective subsidiaries and no Party shall raise any issue with or objection
to the reasonableness of such terms in any proceeding to enforce the terms of
this Agreement _; provided, however_ , that if the terms set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 1_, _Section_ __ _ 2_ or _Section_ __ _ 3_ hereof should
ever be deemed to exceed the limitations permitted by applicable Law in any
jurisdiction, then such terms shall be deemed reformed in such jurisdiction
to the minimum extent required by applicable Law to cure such problem and such
terms shall be enforced with such reforms.

 

(c) The Parties acknowledge and agree that a breach or threatened breach
of  _Section_ __ _ 1_, _Section_ __ _ 2_ or _Section_ __ _ 3_ of this
Agreement would cause irreparable injury to BNL and BNL OP and that in such
circumstances monetary damages shall not constitute a sufficient remedy for
BNL or BNL OP. Consequently, in the event of any such breach or threatened
breach, BNL and BNL OP shall have the right and remedy to have the terms of
this Agreement specifically enforced by a court of competent
jurisdiction without the requirement of posting a bond or proving actual
damages, each of which rights and remedies shall be independent of the others
and severally enforceable, and each of which is in addition to, and not in
lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to BNL or BNL OP at law or
in equity (including, without limitation, awards of monetary damages).



   5. |

matter.

which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
