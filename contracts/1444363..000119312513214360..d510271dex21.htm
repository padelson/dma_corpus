(B) the Closing Date Cash Advance Payment, _plus_ (C) the amount, if any, by
which Estimated Working Capital exceeds the Base Working Capital, _minus_ (D)
the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Working Capital is less than the

Date and without giving effect to the transactions contemplated herein and
Estimated Transaction Expenses determined as of the Closing, giving effect to
the transactions contemplated herein) and (iii) on the basis of the foregoing,
a calculation of the Estimated Working Capital and Estimated Cash estimated in
good faith in accordance with the Accounting Policies, to the extent
applicable. Estimated Working Capital, Estimated Cash and Estimated
Transaction Expenses shall be calculated in accordance with this Agreement.
The calculations of Estimated Working Capital, Estimated Cash and Estimated
Transaction Expenses shall be accompanied by a certificate of a duly
authorized officer of the Company certifying that such estimates have been
calculated in good faith in accordance with this Agreement and the Accounting
Policies, to the extent applicable.

 

Section 2.04 _. Closing Balance Sheet._

(a) As promptly as practicable, but no later than ninety (90) days, after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Seller a
written statement (the "Final Closing Statement") that shall include and set
forth (i) a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the Subsidiaries,
which shall present the consolidated financial position of the Company and the
Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the day prior to the Closing Date
in accordance with the Accounting Policies (the "Closing Balance Sheet") and
shall include line items consistent with those in the Company Balance Sheet
and (ii) a calculation of the actual (A) Working Capital (the "Closing
Working Capital"), (B) Cash (the "Closing Cash"), and (C) Transaction Expenses
(the "Closing Transaction Expenses") (with each of Closing Working Capital
and Closing Cash determined as of the close of business on the day prior to
the Closing Date and without giving effect to the transactions contemplated
herein and Closing Transaction Expenses 

 



13  determined as of the Closing, giving effect to the transactions contemplated
herein. All calculations of Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash and Closing
Transaction Expenses shall be accompanied by a certificate of a duly
authorized officer of Buyer certifying that such estimates have been
calculated in accordance with this Agreement and the Accounting Policies, to
the extent applicable.

 

(b) The Final Closing Statement shall become final and binding on the
thirtieth (30th) day following delivery thereof, unless prior to the end of
such period, Seller delivers to the Buyer written notice of its disagreement
(a "Notice of Disagreement") specifying the nature and amount of any dispute
as to the Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash and/or Closing Transaction
Expenses, as set forth in the Final Closing Statement. Seller shall be deemed
to have agreed with all items and amounts of Closing Working Capital, Closing
Cash and/or Closing Transaction Expenses not specifically referenced in
the Notice of Disagreement, and such items and amounts shall not be subject
to review in accordance with Section 2.04(c).

 

(c) During the fifteen (15) day period following delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement by Seller to Buyer, the parties shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items with respect to
the computation of the Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash and/or Closing
Transaction Expenses as specified therein. Any disputed items resolved
in writing between Seller and Buyer within such fifteen (15) day period shall
be final and binding with respect to such items, and if Seller and Buyer agree
in writing on the resolution of each disputed item specified by Seller in the
Notice of Disagreement and the amount of the Closing Working Capital, Closing
Cash and Closing Transaction Expenses, the amounts so determined shall be
final and binding on the parties for all purposes hereunder. If Seller and
Buyer have not resolved all such differences by the end of such fifteen (15)
day period, no later than ten (10) days following the end of such fifteen (15)
day period, Seller and Buyer shall submit, in writing, to an independent
public accounting firm (the "Independent Accounting Firm"), their briefs
detailing their views as to the correct nature and amount of each item
remaining in dispute and the amounts of the Closing Working Capital, Closing
Cash and Closing Transaction Expenses, and the Independent Accounting Firm
shall make a written determination as to each such disputed item and the
amount of the Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash and Closing Transaction
Expenses, which determination shall be final and binding on the parties for
all purposes hereunder. In making such calculations, the Independent
Accounting Firm shall consider only those items and amounts in Sellers and
Buyers respective calculations of the Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash
and Closing Transaction Expenses that are identified as being items and
amounts to which Seller and Buyer have been unable to agree. In resolving any
disputed item, the Independent Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any
item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or
less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall be Ernst and Young LLP or, if such firm is 

 



14  unable or unwilling to act, such other independent public accounting firm as
shall be agreed in writing between Seller and Buyer. Seller and Buyer shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accounting
Firm to render a written decision resolving the matters submitted to it within
thirty (30) days following the submission thereof. In acting under this
Agreement, the Independent Accounting Firm will be entitled to the privileges
and immunities of an arbitrator.

(d) The costs of any dispute resolution pursuant to Section 2.04(c),
including the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm and of any
enforcement of the determination thereof, shall be borne by Seller and Buyer
in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved by
the Independent Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocation shall be
calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values of the
amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the Independent Accounting Firm
at the time the determination of such firm is rendered on the merits of the
matters submitted. The fees and disbursements of the representatives of each
party incurred in connection with the preparation or review of the Final
Closing Statement and preparation or review of any Notice of Disagreement, as
applicable, shall be borne by such party or parties.

(e) Buyer will cause the Company to afford Seller and its representatives
(including Deloitte and Touche LLP), reasonable access, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable prior notice, to the personnel, properties, books
and records of the Company and the Subsidiaries and their representatives and
to any other information reasonably requested for purposes of preparing and
reviewing the calculations contemplated by this Section 2.04. Each party shall
authorize its accountants to disclose work papers generated by such
accountants in connection with preparing and reviewing the calculations of the
Working Capital and Cash as specified in this Section 2.04; _provided_ that
such accountants shall not be obligated to make any work papers available
except in accordance with such accountants disclosure procedures and then
only after the non-client party has signed a customary agreement relating to
access to such work papers in form and substance acceptable to
such accountants.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties acknowledge
and agree that each item required to be reflected in any of the Closing
Working Capital, Closing Cash or Closing Transaction Expenses is intended to,
and shall, be accounted for only once, without duplication, in determining the
adjustments to be made to the Purchase Price in accordance with this
Agreement, including pursuant to this Section 2.04, Section 2.05, Article 11
and Article 13.

 

Section 2.05 _. Adjustment of Purchase Price._ The Purchase Price shall be
adjusted, upwards or downwards, as follows: 

(a) For the purposes of this Agreement, the "Net Adjustment Amount" means an
amount, which may be positive or negative, equal to (i) the amount of the
Working Capital Adjustment, _plus_ (ii) the Closing Cash as finally determined
pursuant to Section 2.04 _minus_ the Closing Date Cash Advance Payment, _plus_
(iii) the Estimated Transaction Expenses _minus_ the Closing Transaction
Expenses as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.04.

 



15 (b) If the Net Adjustment Amount is positive, the Purchase Price shall be
adjusted upwards in an amount equal to the Net Adjustment Amount. In such
event, within ten (10) Business Days after the Working Capital Adjustment, the
Closing Cash and the Closing Transaction Expenses have been determined
pursuant to Section 2.04 Seller and Buyer shall amend the Loan Agreement to
provide that the principal amount of the Term Loan be equal to the original
amount of the Term Loan prior to such amendment _plus_ the Net Adjustment
Amount. Interest on the Term Loan shall accrue from the Closing Date on the
principal amount determined pursuant to this Section.

(c) If the Net Adjustment Amount is negative (in which case the "Net
Adjustment Amount" for purposes of this clause (c) shall be deemed to be equal
to the absolute value of such amount), the Purchase Price shall be adjusted
downwards in an amount equal to the Net Adjustment Amount. In such event,
within ten (10) Business Days after the Working Capital Adjustment, the
Closing Cash and the Closing Transaction Expenses have been determined
pursuant to Section 2.04 Seller and Buyer shall amend the Loan Agreement to
provide that the principal amount of the Term Loan be equal to the original
amount of the Term Loan prior to such amendment _minus_ the Net Adjustment
Amount. Interest on the Term Loan shall accrue from the Closing Date on
the principal amount determined pursuant to this Section.

Section 2.06 _. Certificates for Buyer Stock._ Each certificate for Buyer
Stock issued to Seller as part of the Purchase Price shall bear the following
legend:

The securities represented hereby have not been registered under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered, sold, transferred
or otherwise disposed of except in accordance with the terms of the Stock
Purchase Agreement dated April 24, 2013 between Buyer and Seller and the
Stockholder Agreement dated April 24, 2013 between Buyer and Seller unless
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States
and the securities regulatory authorities of applicable states or unless an
exemption from such registration is available.

Section 2.07 _. Withholding._ Buyer, its Affiliates and, effective upon the
Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amount otherwise payable to Seller pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making

 



16  of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign law.
If any amount is so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to Seller.

Rights that are used or held for use in the conduct of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as conducted on the date hereof and are

_however_ , that the foregoing shall not be construed as a warranty of non-
infringement. There exist no restrictions on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries on the disclosure, use, license or transfer of the Owned
Intellectual Property Rights. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not alter, encumber, impair or extinguish
any Owned Intellectual Property Rights or Licensed Intellectual Property

of, or to bring any action for the infringement of, any Intellectual Property
Right of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries in any material respect.

(c) None of the Company and the Subsidiaries has infringed, misappropriated
or otherwise violated any Intellectual Property Right of any third party in
any material respect. There is no claim, action, suit, investigation or

or challenging or seeking to deny or restrict, the rights of the Company or
any Subsidiary in any of the Owned Intellectual Property Rights and the
Licensed Intellectual Property Rights, (ii) alleging that the use of the Owned

of any third party or (iii) alleging that the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated any

Schedule 3.17(c), neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received from
any third party an offer to license any Intellectual Property Rights of such
third party in connection with a claim of infringement of Intellectual
Property Rights.

 

(d) None of the Owned Intellectual Property Rights and, to the knowledge of

and Licensed Intellectual Property Rights are valid and enforceable.

(e) The Company and the Subsidiaries hold all right, title and interest in
and to all Owned Intellectual Property Rights and all of the Companys and the
Subsidiaries rights under the Licensed Intellectual Property Rights, free and
clear of any Lien, other than Permitted Liens; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
nothing in this sentence shall be construed as a warranty of non-infringement.

(f) To the knowledge of Seller, no Person has infringed, misappropriated or
otherwise violated in any material respect any Owned Intellectual Property
Right. The Company and the Subsidiaries have taken reasonable steps to
maintain the confidentiality of all confidential Intellectual Property
Rights. To the knowledge of Seller, none of the Intellectual Property Rights
of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries that are material to the business or
operation of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, as currently conducted,
and the value of which to the Company or any Subsidiary is contingent upon
maintaining the confidentiality thereof, has been disclosed other than to
employees, representatives and agents of the Company or any Subsidiary, all of
whom are bound by written confidentiality agreements substantially in the
form previously disclosed to Buyer.

(g) To the actual knowledge of Seller, Mark Schreiber, Simon Mansell and
Keith Van Eck, without inquiry, there are no viruses, worms, Trojan horses or
similar programs in any of the Company Owned Software. None of the Software
included in the Company Owned Software or distributed by the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries contains any Software code that is licensed under any
terms or

 



25  conditions that require that any of the Company Owned Software be (i) made
available or distributed in source code form, (ii) licensed for the purpose of
making derivative works, (iii) licensed under terms that allow reverse
engineering, reverse assembly or disassembly of any kind or (iv)
redistributable at no charge.

(h) The IT Assets operate and perform in a manner that permits the Company and
the Subsidiaries to conduct their respective businesses as currently
conducted. The Company and each Subsidiary take commercially reasonable
actions to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of the IT
Assets (and the information and transactions stored or contained therein or
transmitted thereby) against any unauthorized use, access,
interruption, modification or corruption, including the implementation of (i)
data backup, (ii) disaster avoidance and recovery procedures, (iii) business
continuity procedures, each of which have been shared with Buyer and (iv)
virus detection.

Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company and the Subsidiaries have
complied at all times since December 31, 2009 in all material respects with
all rules, policies and procedures established by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries from time to time with respect to the foregoing. No claims have
been asserted or threatened in writing, or to the knowledge of the Company
otherwise asserted or threatened, against the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries by any Person alleging a violation of such Persons privacy,
personal or confidentiality rights under any such laws, regulations, rules,
policies or procedures.

(j) With respect to all personal and user information referred to in Section
3.16(i), the Company and the Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable
steps (including implementing and monitoring compliance with measures
regarding technical and physical security) designed to ensure that such
information is protected against loss and against unauthorized access, use,
modification or disclosure. To the knowledge of Seller, there has been no
unauthorized access, use, modification or disclosure of such information. 

Section 3.17 _. Insurance Coverage._ Seller has furnished to Buyer a list of,
and true and complete copies of, all material insurance policies and fidelity
bonds relating to the assets, business, operations, employees, officers or
directors of the Company and the Subsidiaries. There is no claim by the
Company or any Subsidiary pending under any of such policies or bonds as to
which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of
such policies or bonds or in respect of which such underwriters have reserved
their rights. All premiums payable under all such policies and bonds have
been timely paid and the Company and the Subsidiaries have otherwise complied
in all material respects with the terms and conditions of all such policies
and bonds. Such policies of

 



26  insurance and bonds (or other policies and bonds providing substantially
similar insurance coverage) have been in effect since December 31, 2007 and
remain in full force and effect. Such policies and bonds are of the type and
in amounts customarily carried by Persons conducting businesses similar to
those of the Company or any Subsidiary. Seller does not know of any threatened
termination of, premium increase with respect to, or material alteration of
coverage under, any of such policies or bonds. Except as disclosed in Schedule
3.17, the Company and the Subsidiaries shall after the Closing continue to
have coverage under such policies and bonds with respect to events occurring
prior to the Closing.

each license, franchise, permit, certificate, approval or other similar
authorization affecting, or relating in any way to, the assets or business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries other than immaterial licenses, franchises,
permits, certificates, approvals or authorizations that would be readily
obtainable in the ordinary course without undue burden, (the "Permits")
together with the name of the Governmental Authority issuing such Permit.
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.18, (i) the Permits are valid and in full
force and effect except for such violations that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, be material to the Company and the Subsidiaries taken as a
whole, (ii) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default under, and
no condition exists that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute
a default under, the Permits except for such violations that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be material to the Company and the
Subsidiaries taken as a whole and (iii) none of the Permits will be terminated
or impaired or become terminable, in whole or in part, as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 3.19. _Sufficiency of Assets_. Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.19,
the properties and assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries comprise, in
all material respects, all of the assets and properties of the Company and the
Subsidiaries that are used in the conduct of their business as conducted on
the date hereof and are sufficient to conduct their business as currently
conducted.

Section 3.20. _Finders  Fees_. There is no investment banker, broker, finder
or other intermediary which has been retained by or is authorized to act on
behalf of Seller, the Company or any Subsidiary who might be entitled to any
fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

Section 3.21. _Employees_. Schedule 3.21 sets forth, for each Company Employee
(to the extent permitted by Applicable Law), such employees name, title,
hire date, location, annual salary or wage rate, most recent annual bonus
received, current annual bonus opportunity, whether full-time or part-time,
whether active or on leave (and, if on leave, the nature of the leave and the
expected return date) and whether exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act. To
the knowledge of Seller as of the date of this Agreement, no current Company
Employee with a base annual compensation of more than $50,000 has indicated
to 

 



27  Seller, the Company or any of the Subsidiaries that he or she intends to
resign or retire as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise within one year after the Closing Date.

Section 3.22. _Labor Matters_. The Company and the Subsidiaries are, and have
been since January 1, 2011, in material compliance with all Applicable Laws
relating to labor and employment, including those relating to labor management
relations, wages, hours, overtime, employee classification, discrimination,
sexual harassment, civil rights, affirmative action, work authorization,
immigration, safety and health, information privacy and security, workers
compensation, continuation coverage under group health plans, wage payment and
the payment and withholding of taxes. Neither the Company nor any of the
Subsidiaries is or has been a party to or subject to, or is currently
negotiating in connection with entering into, any Collective Bargaining
Agreement, and there has not been any organizational campaign, petition or
other unionization activity seeking recognition of a collective bargaining
unit relating to any Company Employee. There are no unfair labor practice
complaints pending or, to the knowledge of Seller, threatened against the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries before the National Labor Relations Board
or any other Governmental Authority. There is no labor strike, slowdown,
stoppage, picketing, interruption of work or lockout pending or, to the
knowledge of Seller, threatened against the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries. The consent or consultation of, or the rendering of formal
advice by, any labor or trade union, works council or other employee
representative body is not required for the Company to enter into this
Agreement or to consummate any of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has taken any action that
would reasonably be expected to cause Buyer or any of its Affiliates, in the
absence of any contributing action by Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary
following the Closing, to have any liability or other obligation following the
Closing Date under the WARN Act.

Section 3.23 _. Employee Benefit Plans._

(a) Schedule 3.23(a) lists each Company Employee Plan and specifies whether
such plan is a US Plan or an International Plan. For each US Plan, the Company
has furnished to Buyer a copy of such plan (or a description, if such plan is
not written) and all amendments thereto and, as applicable: (i) all trust
agreements, insurance contracts or other funding arrangements and amendments
thereto; (ii) the current prospectus or summary plan description and all
summaries of material modifications relating thereto; (iii) the most recent
favorable determination or opinion letter from the IRS; (iv) the annual
returns/reports (Form 5500) and accompanying schedules and attachments thereto
for the most recently completed plan year; (v) the most recently prepared
financial statements; (vi) all material documents and correspondence relating
thereto received from or provided to the IRS, the Department of Labor or any
other Governmental Authority during the past three (3) years regarding any
controversy, plan compliance issue or governmental audit; (vii) all current
administrative and other

 



28  service contracts and amendments thereto with third-party services
providers; and (viii) all current employee handbooks, manuals and policies.
For each International Plan, the Company has furnished to Buyer a copy of
such plan. Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, to the extent
not already provided, the Company shall furnish to Buyer for each
International Plan such documents that are substantially comparable to
the documents required to be provided in clauses (i) through (viii) above
(after taking into account differences in Applicable Law and practices).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be responsible for furnishing
such documents for an International Plan if, as of the date hereof, no
applicable documents exist that are substantially comparable to the documents
required to be provided in clauses (i) through (viii) above.

 

(b) None of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate sponsors, maintains or
contributes to (or has any obligation to contribute to), or has in the past
sponsored, maintained or contributed to (or had any obligation to contribute
to), or has any obligation with respect to any Company Employee Plan subject
to Title IV of ERISA, including any "multiemployer plan," as defined
in Section 3(37) of ERISA.

(c) Each Company Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable IRS determination letter or is
based on a prototype plan which has received a favorable IRS opinion letter,
or has pending or has time remaining in which to file, an application for such
letter from the IRS, and the Company is not aware of any reason why any such
determination or opinion letter should be revoked or not be reissued. Each US
Plan has been maintained in material compliance with its terms and Applicable
Law, including ERISA and the Code. No action, suit, investigation, audit,
proceeding or claim is pending against or involves or, to the knowledge of
Seller, is threatened against or, to involve, any Company Employee Plan before
any court or arbitrator or any Governmental Authority. To Sellers knowledge,
no events have occurred with respect to any Company Employee Plan that could
result in payment or assessment by or against the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries of any excise taxes.

 

(d) Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has any material liability
in respect of, and no Company Employee Plan provides or promises, any post-
employment or post-retirement medical, dental, disability, hospitalization,
life or similar benefits (whether insured or self-insured) to any current or
former Service Provider, except as required (i) to avoid excise tax under
Section 4980B of the Code or (ii) under similar Applicable Law. No condition
exists that would prevent the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from amending
or terminating any US Plan providing medical, dental,
disability, hospitalization, life or similar benefits (whether insured or
self-insured) to any active Service Provider.

(e) All contributions, premiums and payments that are due have been made for
each Company Employee Plan within the time periods prescribed by the terms of
such plan and Applicable Law, and all contributions, premiums and 

 



29  payments for any period ending on or before the Closing Date that are not
due are or will be properly accrued to the extent required to be accrued under
applicable accounting principles. There has been no amendment to, written
interpretation of or announcement (whether or not written) by Seller, the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee
participation or coverage under, any Company Employee Plan that would impose
a material increase in the expense of maintaining such Company Employee Plan
above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2012.

 

(f) No Company Employee Plan, individually or collectively, would give rise to
the payment of any amount in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby that would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of Section 280G of
the Code. Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has any obligation
to gross-up, indemnify or otherwise reimburse any current or former Service
Provider for any tax incurred by such Service Provider, including under
Sections 409A or 4999 of the Code.

(g) Each International Plan (i) has been maintained in material compliance
with its terms and Applicable Law, (ii) if intended to qualify for special tax
treatment, is in material compliance with all the requirements for such
treatment, and (iii) if required, to any extent, to be fully funded, book-
reserved or secured by an insurance policy, is fully funded, book-reserved or
secured by an insurance policy, as applicable, based on reasonable actuarial
assumptions in accordance with applicable accounting principles.

(h) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or together with any other
event) will (i) entitle any current or former Service Provider to any payment
or benefit, including any bonus, retention, severance, retirement or job
security payment or benefit from the Company or any of its Affiliates, (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, or
increase the amount payable or trigger any other obligation under, any
Company Employee Plan or (iii) limit or restrict the right of the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries or, after the Closing, Buyer, to merge, amend or
terminate any Company Employee Plan.

 

(i) Neither Seller nor any of his Affiliates, other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries, has granted or promised to grant any current Service Provider
any payments or benefits, including any bonus, retention, severance,
retirement or job security payment or benefit (and, for the avoidance of
doubt, there have been no such promises to grant any such payments or
benefits). 

Section 3.24 _. Environmental Matters._ (a)(i) No written notice,
notification, demand, request for information, citation, summons or order has
been received by Seller, the Company or any Subsidiary, no complaint has been
filed, no penalty has been assessed and no action, claim, suit or proceeding,
or to the knowledge of Seller, investigation, is pending, or to Sellers
knowledge,

 



30  threatened by any Governmental Authority or other Person against the Company
or any Subsidiary, in each case alleging a violation by or asserting liability
on the part of the Company or any Subsidiary under any Environmental Law.

(ii) There are no facts or conditions in respect of the operations of the
Company or any Subsidiary, or any of their ownership or lease of any real
property, which could reasonably be expected to result in or be the basis for
any material claim or liability under Environmental Laws against or on the

Subject to Section 13.03, except as set forth in the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule, Buyer represents and warrants to Seller as of the date hereof and as
of the Closing Date that:

 

Section 4.01 _. Corporate Existence and Power._ Buyer is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation and has all corporate powers required to carry
on its business as now conducted. Buyer is duly qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation, is in good standing in each jurisdiction where
such qualification is necessary and has all governmental Permits required to
carry on its business as now conducted, except where the failure to effect or
maintain such licensure or qualification would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be material to Buyer and its subsidiaries taken as a whole. Buyer
has heretofore delivered to Seller true and complete copies of the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of Buyer as currently in effect.

 

Section 4.02 _. Authorization._ Buyer has the legal capacity to enter into
this Agreement, the Loan Agreement Documents, the Stockholder Agreement and
the Employment Agreement (the "Buyer Agreements"). Assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties hereto, the Buyer
Agreements constitute the valid and binding agreements of Buyer, enforceable
against Buyer in accordance with their terms, except as such may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or
other Applicable Laws affecting creditors rights generally and by general
equitable principles.

Section 4.03 _. Governmental Authorization._ The execution, delivery and
performance by Buyer of the Buyer Agreements and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Buyer Agreements require no action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority other than (i) those
listed on Schedule 4.03, (ii) immaterial, routine filings with or notices to
Governmental Authorities that do not require approval and (iii) filings that
are required on behalf of Seller, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates.

 

Section 4.04 _. Noncontravention._ The execution, delivery and performance by
Buyer of the Buyer Agreements and the consummation of the transactions

certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Buyer or any of its subsidiaries,
(ii) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Schedule 4.04,
violate any Applicable Law, (iii) require any consent or other action by any
Person under, constitute a default or an event that, with or without notice or
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default under, or give rise to any
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any right or obligation
of Buyer or any of its subsidiaries or to a loss of any benefit to which Buyer
or any of its subsidiaries is

 



35  entitled under, any provision of any agreement or other instrument binding
upon Buyer or any of its subsidiaries, except for such violations, conflicts,
defaults, terminations or accelerations that would not, individually or in

taken as a whole, or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on
the assets of Buyer or its subsidiaries.

 

Section 4.05 _. Capitalization._

liability or reducing any Tax Asset of the Company, any of the Subsidiaries,
Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period,
take or omit to take any other action outside of the ordinary course of
business;

 

(xv) take any action that would make any representation or warranty of the
Company hereunder, or omit to take any action necessary to prevent any
representation or warranty of the Company hereunder from being, inaccurate in
any material respect at, or as of any time before, the Closing Date, in each
case other than in the ordinary course of business or pursuant to
its obligations under Section 5.01(a); or

(xvi) agree, resolve or commit to do any of the foregoing. 

Section 5.02 _. Access to Information; Confidentiality._

 

(a) Except for (x) information that, if provided, would, in the judgment of
Sellers legal counsel, adversely affect the ability of Seller or any of its
Affiliates to assert attorney-client or attorney work product privilege or a
similar privilege, (y) for information relating to communications regarding
the divestiture of the Company, any Subsidiary and/or their business
(including information relating to the identity of other Persons expressing an
interest in acquiring the Company, any Subsidiary and/or their business and
the terms of such proposals) or (z) information that, in the reasonable
opinion of Sellers legal counsel, the disclosure of which may result in a
violation of any Applicable Law or order, from the date hereof until the
Closing Date, Seller will, at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, (i)
give, and will cause the Company and each Subsidiary to give, Buyer, its
counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives
full access to the offices, properties, books and records of the Company and
the Subsidiaries and to the books and records of Seller relating to the
Company and the Subsidiaries, (ii) furnish, and will cause the Company and
each Subsidiary to furnish, to Buyer, its counsel, financial advisors,
auditors and other authorized representatives such financial and operating
data and other information relating to the Company or any Subsidiary as such
Persons may reasonably request and (iii) instruct the employees, counsel and
financial advisors of Seller or the Company or any Subsidiary to cooperate
with Buyer in its investigation of the Company or any Subsidiary. None of
Buyer, any Affiliate of

 



43  Buyer or any representative of the foregoing shall, directly or indirectly,
contact or communicate with any employees or consultants of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any third party that has business dealings with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including customers, suppliers and
lessors) with respect or relating to the transactions contemplated hereby,
except with the prior written consent of Seller or the Company in each
instance (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and
with a representative of Seller jointly participating in any such
communication. No investigation by Buyer or other information received by
Buyer shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation,
warranty or agreement given or made by Seller hereunder. Buyer and its
Affiliates and representatives shall treat all information obtained from or on
behalf of Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as "Confidential
Information" under the Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement dated December 5, 2012
by and between Global Futures and Forex Ltd. and GAIN Capital Holdings, Inc.
(the "Confidentiality Agreement") and Buyer shall continue to honor, and
cause its representatives to honor, the obligations thereunder for such time
and under such conditions as are required under the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(b) After the Closing, Seller and his Affiliates, will hold, and will use
their best efforts to cause their respective officers, directors, employees,
accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and agents to hold, in confidence,
unless compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process or by other
requirements of law, all confidential documents and information concerning
the Company and the Subsidiaries, except to the extent that such information
can be shown to have been (i) previously known on a nonconfidential basis by
Seller, (ii) in the public domain through no fault of Seller or
his Affiliates, or (iii) later lawfully acquired by Seller from sources other
than those related to its prior ownership of the Company and the Subsidiaries.
The obligation of Seller and his Affiliates to hold any such information in
confidence shall be satisfied if Seller shall exercise the same care with
respect to such information as they would take to preserve the confidentiality
of his own similar information.

(c) On and after the Closing Date, Seller will afford promptly to Buyer and
its agents reasonable access, at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice,
to its books of account, financial and other records (including accountants
work papers), information, employees and auditors to the extent necessary or
useful for Buyer in connection with any audit, investigation, dispute or
litigation or any other reasonable business purpose relating to the Company
or any Subsidiary; _provided_ that any such access by Buyer shall not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of Seller.

Section 5.03 _. Notices of Certain Events._ Seller shall promptly notify Buyer
of:

(a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



44 (b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(c) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or,
to its knowledge threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting Seller or the Company or any Subsidiary that, if pending on the date
of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to
Section 3.13 or that relate to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

(d) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement at any time during the term hereof that, to the actual knowledge of
Gary Tilkin, Mark Schreiber, Simon Mansell and, with respect to the specific
representations and warranties set forth opposite their names, the
individuals set forth in Schedule 5.03(d) without inquiry, would reasonably be
expected to cause the conditions set forth in Section 10.02(a) and Section
10.02(d) not to be satisfied; and

 

(e) any failure of Seller to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;

_provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 5.03 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving that notice.

Section 5.04 _. Noncompetition._

(a) Seller agrees that neither he nor any Affiliate, other than an Excluded
Affiliate, shall (i) for a period of 5 years after the Closing Date, engage,
either directly or indirectly, as a principal or for his or its own account or
solely or jointly with others, or as a stockholder in any corporation or joint
stock association in any business that competes with the business of the
Company as conducted on the date hereof or at the Closing Date; _provided_
that Sellers passive ownership of less than 10% of the outstanding equity
securities of any corporation, joint stock organization or other business
organization shall not be deemed to be a violation of this Section 5.04; or
(ii) for a period of 3 years after the Closing Date, employ or solicit, or
receive or accept the performance of services by any current employee of the
Company or any Subsidiary, _provided_ that Seller or any such Affiliate shall
not be deemed to have made a solicitation in violation of the foregoing (1)
merely because he or such Affiliate made a general solicitation by
newspaper or Internet or a similar advertisement not specifically targeted at
any such persons or via an executive search firm that was not encouraged or
instructed by Seller or such Affiliate to undertake a solicitation of any such
person so long as such solicitation does not result in a breach of the
restriction on hiring such person or (2) if such solicitation is for a
position with Buyer or any of its subsidiaries. In addition, the restrictions
set forth in Section 5.04(a)(ii) shall not apply to any person whose
employment or other relationship with Buyer, the

 



45  Company or any Subsidiary was terminated by Buyer, the Company or any such
Subsidiary more than 6 months prior to the date of solicitation or employment
by Seller.

 

(b) If any provision contained in this Section 5.04 shall for any reason be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Section, but this Section 5.04 shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal
or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. It is
the intention of the parties that if any of the restrictions or covenants
contained herein is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of
time which is not permitted by Applicable Law, or in any way construed to be
too broad or to any extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to
be null, void and of no effect, but to the extent such provision would be
valid or enforceable under Applicable Law, a court of competent jurisdiction
shall construe and interpret or reform this Section 5.04 to provide for a
covenant having the maximum enforceable geographic area, time period and other
provisions (not greater than those contained herein) as shall be valid and
enforceable under such Applicable Law. Seller acknowledges that Buyer would
be irreparably harmed by any breach of this Section 5.04 and that there would
be no adequate remedy at law or in damages to compensate Buyer for any such
breach. Seller agrees that Buyer shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief
requiring specific performance by Seller of this Section 5.04, and Seller
consents to the entry thereof.

privilege unless Seller shall also have rights with respect to any such
privilege pursuant to Section 13.13, or (y) information that, in the
reasonable opinion of Buyers legal counsel, the disclosure of which may

46  and his agents reasonable access to the properties, books, records,
employees and auditors of the Company, its Subsidiaries and Buyer to the
extent necessary to permit Seller to determine any matter relating to his
rights and obligations hereunder or to any period ending on or before the

employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and agents to hold, in
confidence, unless compelled to disclose by Applicable Law, all confidential
documents and information concerning the Company or any Subsidiary provided

entering into any settlement, undertaking, consent decree, stipulation or
agreement with any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby or (ii) divesting or otherwise holding separate
(including by establishing a trust or otherwise), or taking any other action
(or otherwise agreeing to do any of the foregoing) with respect to any of its

Seller, prior to the Closing, and Buyer, after the Closing, agree to cause the
Company and each Subsidiary, to execute and deliver such other documents,
certificates, agreements and other writings and to take such other actions as
may be necessary or desirable in order to consummate or implement
expeditiously the transactions contemplated by this

 



47  Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that such action shall not include any
requirement of Buyer, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates (including
the Company and the Subsidiaries) to expend money (other than incidental fees
and expenses), commence or participate in any litigation or offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third Person.

 

Section 7.02 _. Certain Filings._ Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with one
another (i) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) in taking such actions
or making any such filings, furnishing information required in connection
therewith and seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals
or waivers.

 

Section 7.03 _. Public Announcements._ The parties agree that no public
release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be issued or made by or on behalf of any party without the prior written
consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except (a) as such release or announcement may, in
the reasonable judgment of the releasing party, be required by Applicable Law
or any rule or regulation of any national securities exchange on which
securities of the releasing party are listed, in which case the party required
to make the release or announcement shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance, and (b) that Buyer, Seller and their
respective Affiliates may make such announcements to their respective
employees. The parties agree to keep the terms of this Agreement confidential,
except to the extent required by Applicable Law or any rule or regulation of
any national securities exchange on which securities of the releasing party
are listed or for financial reporting purposes and except that the parties may
disclose such terms to their respective accountants and other representatives
as necessary in connection with the ordinary conduct of their respective
businesses.

TAX MATTERS

Section 8.01 _. Taxes._

(a) At the sole option of Buyer which shall be exercised by providing written
notice to Seller, within thirty (30) days after the Closing, a valid election
under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and/or any comparable elections under
state or local Tax law (each, a "Section 338(h)(10) Election") shall be made
with respect to the purchase and sale of the Company stock hereunder. The ADSP
(as such term is defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.338-4) of the
assets of the Company shall be allocated in accordance with the allocation
statement attached hereto as Exhibit D (the "Allocation Statement") and the
Treasury regulations promulgated under Section 338(h)(10). To the extent an
adjustment is made pursuant to Article 2 with respect to the Purchase Price
shown on the Allocation Statement, the Allocation Statement shall be adjusted
in accordance with the Treasury regulations under Section 338(h)(10) and as
mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller. In the event that an agreement as to
such adjustment is not reached within twenty (20) days after the final
determination of the Final Closing Statement, any disputed items shall be
resolved by a nationally recognized accounting firm, jointly retained by
Buyer and Seller. The cost, fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall
be borne equally by Buyer and Seller.

(b)

 

(i) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
all Tax Returns for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that do not
include any Post-Closing Tax Period. Seller shall permit Buyer to review and
comment on each such material Tax Return prior to filing it and shall
reasonably and in good faith consider such revisions to such Tax Returns as
are requested by Buyer. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Seller
shall include any income, gain, loss, deduction or other Tax items for such
periods on his Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Schedule K-1s
furnished by the Company to Seller for such periods. Any Covered Taxes shown
as due and payable on any such Tax Returns shall be paid by Seller.

 



49 (ii) Except as set forth in Section 8.01(b)(i) and Section 8.01(c), Buyer
shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax
Returns for the Company and each of its Subsidiaries. Unless there is not a
more likely than not position with respect to an item on such Tax Return, all
Tax Returns that Buyer is required to file or cause to be filed in accordance
with this Section 8.01(b)(ii) that relate to any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall
be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with past practice. With respect
to any such material Tax Return to be filed by Buyer, not less than thirty
(30) days prior to the due date for such Tax Return, taking into account
extensions (or, if such due date is within thirty (30) days following the
Closing Date, as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date), Buyer
shall provide Seller with a draft copy of such Tax Return for Sellers review
and approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any Covered
Taxes for any Tax period with respect to which such Tax Returns were filed
shall be promptly paid to Buyer or, at Buyers request, to the applicable
Taxing Authority.

(c) All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be borne one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller when
due, and both parties shall, at their own expense, file all necessary Tax
Returns with respect to all such Taxes, and, if required by Applicable Law,
both parties shall cause their respective affiliates to, join in the execution
of any such Tax Returns.

 

(d) None of Buyer and any Affiliate of Buyer shall (or shall cause or permit
the Company or any Subsidiary to) make or change any Tax election or amend,
re-file or otherwise modify (or grant an extension of any statute of
limitations with respect to) any Tax Return of the Company or any Subsidiary
with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior written consent
of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Section 8.02 _. Cooperation on Tax Matters._

 

(a) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with the preparation and filing
of any Tax Return (including any report required pursuant to Section 6043A of
the Code and all Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder), any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes, in each case
in connection with the Company or any Subsidiary. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder.

 



50 (b) Buyer and Seller further agree, upon request, to use all commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
governmental authority or customer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any
Tax that could be imposed (including but not limited to with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby).

Section 8.03 _. Tax Indemnification._  

(a) Seller hereby indemnifies each Buyer Indemnified Party against and agrees
to hold each Buyer Indemnified Party harmless from any Covered Tax and any
Damages arising out of or incident to the imposition, assessment or assertion
of any Covered Tax (together, a "Tax Loss").

(b) For purposes of the determination of the Covered Tax described in Clause
(A) of the definition thereof in respect of a Straddle Tax Period, (x) in the
case of any Taxes other than gross receipts, sales or use Taxes and Taxes
based upon or related to income, the definition of Covered Tax shall be deemed
to include the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period
ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the entire Tax period, and (y) in the case of any Tax based
upon or related to income (which, for the avoidance of doubt,
includes capital gains) and any gross receipts, sales or use Tax, the
definition of Covered Tax shall be deemed to include the amount that would be
payable if the relevant Tax period ended on and included the Closing Date. All
determinations necessary to give effect to the allocation set forth in the
foregoing clause (y) shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice
of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(c) Buyer agrees to give prompt notice to Seller of any Tax Loss or the
assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding
in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder that Buyer deems to be
within the ambit of this Section 8.03 (specifying with reasonable
particularity the basis therefor) and will give Seller such information with
respect thereto as Seller may reasonably request. Seller may, at its
own expense, (i) participate in and (ii) with respect to any suits, actions
or proceedings (including Tax audits) that relate solely to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods, assume the defense of any such suit, action or proceeding (including
any Tax audit); _provided_ that (A) Seller shall have furnished Buyer with
evidence that Seller has adequate resources to defend such suit, action or
proceeding and fulfill its indemnity obligations hereunder, (B) Seller shall
thereafter consult with Buyer upon Buyers reasonable request for such
consultation from time to time with respect to such suit, action or proceeding
(including any Tax audit) and (C) Seller shall not, without Buyers consent,
which consent shall not be withheld unreasonably, agree to any settlement
with respect to any Tax if such settlement could adversely affect the Tax
liability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates. Buyer shall have the right (but
not the duty) to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at
its own expense, separate from the

 



51  counsel employed by Seller and Seller shall not assert that the Tax Loss, or
any portion thereof, with respect to which Buyer seeks indemnification is not
subject to indemnification. Buyer shall not settle any suit, action or
proceeding in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder without the
consent of Seller, which consent shall not be withheld unreasonably. Seller
shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel employed by Buyer for any period
during which Seller has not assumed the defense of a suit, action or
proceeding (including any Tax audits) that relate solely to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods or covered Taxes. Whether or not Seller chooses to defend or prosecute
any claim, each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates
to cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.

(d) Seller shall not be liable under this Section 8.03 with respect to any
Tax resulting from a claim or demand the defense of which Seller was not
offered the opportunity to assume as provided under Section 8.03(c) to the
extent Sellers liability under this Section 8.03 is adversely affected as a
result thereof. No investigation by Buyer or any of its Affiliates at or prior
to the Closing Date shall relieve Seller of any liability hereunder.

 

(e) Any claim of any Buyer Indemnified Party under this Section 8.03 may be
made and enforced by Buyer on behalf of such Buyer Indemnified Party.

(f) Except to the extent resulting from the carryback of any Tax Asset arising
in Post-Closing Tax Period, if Buyer, the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries receives any refund of, or any amount credited against, any Tax
that relates to a Pre Closing Tax Period, Buyer shall (A) in the case of a
refund, pay Seller the amount of any such refund, reduced by any net Tax
required under Applicable Law to be paid by Buyer, the Company, any of the
Companys Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates with respect
thereto and net of any Tax effect on Buyer, the Company, any of the Companys
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates attributable to the
reduction in any Tax Asset as a result of the receipt of such refund (other
than any Tax Asset of the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries
that arose in a Pre-Closing Tax Period), and (B) in the case of a credit, pay
to Seller at such time or times as such credit is actually utilized, the
excess of (I) the amount of Taxes that would have been payable (or the amount
of the Tax refund, offset or other reduction in Tax liability actually
receivable) by Buyer, the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries in the
absence of such credit over (II) the amount of Taxes actually payable (or the
amount of the Tax refund, offset or other reduction in Tax liability that
would have been receivable) by Buyer, the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries. Buyer shall take such steps as may be reasonably available to
secure any refund or credit (i) set forth on Schedule 8.03(f) or (ii) if
Seller has notified Buyer of the availability of such refund or credit and
Buyer reasonably determines that such refund or credit is allowable.

 

(g) Any indemnification obligation pursuant to this Article 8 shall be
satisfied as follows: (i) _first_ , by a reduction in the outstanding amount
of the Term Loan by the full amount of such indemnification obligation and
(ii) _second_ , by

 



52  recourse directly against the Seller to the extent such indemnification
obligation cannot be satisfied by the outstanding amount of the Term Loan
(giving effect to all other indemnification obligations of Seller outstanding
at such time).

Section 8.04 _. Certain Disputes._ Disputes that arise under this Article 8
and are not resolved by mutual agreement within thirty (30) days shall be
resolved by a nationally recognized expert in the relevant area with no
material relationship with Buyer, Seller or their Affiliates (the "Referee"),
chosen and mutually acceptable to both Buyer and Seller within five (5) days
of the date on which the need to choose the Referee arises. The Referee shall
resolve any disputed items within thirty (30) days of having the item
referred to it pursuant to such procedures as it may require. The costs, fees
and expenses of the Referee shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller.

Section 8.05 _. Purchase Price Adjustment and Interest._ Any amount paid by
Seller or Buyer under Article 8 or Article 11 will be treated as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price.

 

ARTICLE 9

 

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Section 9.01 _. Employee Benefits._

(a) Following the Closing Date, subject to Applicable Law, for purposes of
vesting, eligibility to participate and levels of benefits under the employee
benefit plans of Buyer and its subsidiaries (other than under defined benefit
retirement plans, postretirement plans providing medical or dental benefits
and any equity compensation plans), each Continuing Employee shall be credited
with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective predecessors before the Closing Date, to the same extent as
such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit for
such service under any similar Company Employee Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to
the Closing Date; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent
that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to
the same period of service. In addition, Buyer shall waive, or cause to be
waived, any preexisting conditions, limitations, exclusions, actively at work
requirements and waiting periods to the same extent such preexisting
conditions, limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting
periods are waived under any comparable Company Employee Plan prior to the
Closing Date and use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize for purposes
of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental
plans, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by Continuing Employees in
the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs.

 



53 (b) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Company and its Subsidiaries) shall have responsibility and liability for all
Company Employee Plans. On and after the Closing Date, Buyer and its
Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall be responsible
for providing any Continuing Employee (and such employees "qualified
beneficiaries" within the meaning of Section 4980B(f) of the Code) who has a
"qualifying event," within the meaning of Section 4980B(f) of the Code, under
any Company Employee Plan on or after the Closing Date with the continuation
of group health coverage required by Section 4980B(f) of the Code to the
extent required by Applicable Law.

(c) Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Company and the Subsidiaries)
shall be responsible for all liabilities or obligations under the WARN Act
resulting from the Closing or from the actions of Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Company and the Subsidiaries) following the Closing.

(d) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate and coordinate with respect to employee
communications in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and their impact on the Company Employees.

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 9.01, expressed or implied, is intended
to confer upon any Company Employee any right to employment or continued
employment with Buyer or any of its subsidiaries for any period by reason of
this Agreement. Regardless of anything else contained herein, the parties do
not intend for this Agreement to amend any employee benefit plans or
arrangements or create any rights or obligations except between the parties.
In addition, and without limiting the generality of Section 13.09, the
provisions of this Agreement, in particular this Section 9.01, are solely for
the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former
Service Provider or any other individual associated therewith shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 10

ARTICLE 11

SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

 

Section 11.01 _. Survival._ The representations and warranties of the parties
hereto contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant
to Section 10.02(a) or 10.03(a) shall survive the Closing until the 18th month
anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ that the representations and
warranties in (x) Section 3.01 (Corporate Existence and Power), Section 3.02
(Authorization), Section 3.03 (Governmental Authorization), Section 3.04
(Noncontravention), Section 3.20 (Finders Fees), Section 3.23
(Employee Benefit Plans), Section 3.25 (Taxes) (collectively, the "Seller
Fundamental Representations") and (y) Section 4.01 (Corporate Existence and
Power), Section 4.02 (Authorization), Section 4.03
(Governmental Authorization), Section 4.04 (Noncontravention) and Section
4.12 (Finders Fees) (collectively, the "Buyer Fundamental Representations"),
shall survive indefinitely or in the case of the representations and
warranties in Sections 3.23 or 3.25, thirty (30) days after the expiration of
any applicable statute of limitations with respect to matters addressed by
such sections and; _provided_ further that the representations and warranties
in Section 3.24 (Environmental Matters) shall survive the Closing until the
6th year anniversary of the Closing Date. The covenants and agreements of the
parties hereto contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and be
effective indefinitely or for such shorter period explicitly specified
therein, _provided_ that a party may bring a claim for a breach prior to the
expiration of a covenant or agreements with such a shorter period of
effectiveness at any time after the expiration of such shorter period
of effectiveness until the latest date permitted by law. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentences, any breach of representation or warranty, covenant or
agreement in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement
shall survive the time at which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to the
preceding sentences, if notice of the inaccuracy or breach thereof giving rise
to such right of indemnity setting forth in reasonable detail the specific
facts and circumstances relating to the claim for indemnity and the Section
of this Agreement upon which the claim for indemnification is based, shall
have been given to the party against whom such indemnity may be sought prior
to such time.

 



57 Section 11.02 _. Indemnification._

 

(a) Effective at and after the Closing, Seller hereby indemnifies Buyer, its
Affiliates and their respective successors and assignees and, effective at
the Closing, without duplication, the Company, each Subsidiary and their
respective successors and assignees (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified
Parties") against and agrees to hold each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties
harmless from any and all Damages whether involving a Third Party Claim or a
claim solely between the parties hereto, incurred or suffered by any Buyer
Indemnified Party arising out of (x) any misrepresentation or breach of
warranty contained in this Agreement (determined without regard to any
qualification or exception contained therein relating to materiality or
Material Adverse Effect or any similar qualification or standard) (each such
misrepresentation and breach of warranty a "Warranty Breach") or breach of
covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Seller or the Company
pursuant to this Agreement (other than a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made or to be performed pursuant to Section 3.25 or Article 8);
_provided_ that with respect to indemnification by Seller for Warranty
Breaches pursuant to this Section 11.02(a), (i) except in respect of Warranty
Breaches of Seller Fundamental Representations and Section 3.24, Seller shall
only be liable for any Damages incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties to
the extent that (A) the amount of Damages suffered by Buyer Indemnified
Parties related to each individual claim or group of related claims exceeds
$25,000 (it being understood that such amount shall be a deductible for which
Seller shall bear no indemnification responsibility) and (B) the aggregate
amount of such Damages exceeds $750,000 (it being understood that such amount
shall be a deductible for which Seller shall bear no indemnification
responsibility), and (ii) except in respect of Warranty Breaches of Seller
Fundamental Representations (other than Section 3.23), Sellers maximum
liability shall not exceed $12,500,000, and (y) those matters set forth on
Schedule 11.02 (the "Specified Matters"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event of a final determination that Seller is obligated to indemnify any
Buyer Indemnified Party, Sellers liability with respect to any such
indemnification obligation (x) that is based upon any representation or
warranty (other than a Seller Fundamental Representation) shall be satisfied
solely by a reduction in the outstanding amount of the Term Loan by the full
amount of such indemnification obligation, with such reduction in the amount
of the Term Loan being the exclusive remedy of the Buyer Indemnified Parties
with respect to such obligation (except as described in the _proviso_ below)
and (y) that is based upon a Seller Fundamental Representation shall be
satisfied as follows: (i) _first_ , by a reduction in the outstanding amount
of the Term Loan by the full amount of such indemnification obligation and
(ii) _second_ , by recourse directly against the Seller to the extent any
indemnification obligation subject to this clause (y) cannot be satisfied by
the outstanding amount of the Term Loan (giving effect to all other
indemnification obligations of Seller outstanding under this Agreement at such
time); _provided_ that to the extent any indemnification obligation subject to
this clause (y) or Article 8 is satisfied by a reduction in the amount of the
Term Loan pursuant to clause (y)(i) above or

 



58  Section 8.03(g)(ii) and the remaining outstanding amount of the Term Loan is
less than the amount of any indemnification obligations subject to clause (x),
then Buyer shall have a right of direct recourse against Seller in respect of
such indemnification obligations subject to clause (x) but solely with respect
to the amount of the deficiency created by the reduction of the Term Loan
principal in respect of indemnification obligations subject to Article 8 and
clause (y).

(b) Effective at and after the Closing, Buyer hereby indemnifies Seller,
his Affiliates and their respective successors and assignees (collectively,
the "Seller Indemnified Parties") against and agrees to hold each of the
Seller Indemnified Parties harmless from any and all Damages, incurred or
suffered by any Seller Indemnified Party arising out of (x) any Warranty
Breach or breach of covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement (other than a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made or to be performed pursuant to Article 8); _provided_ that
with respect to indemnification by Buyer for Warranty Breaches pursuant to
this Section 11.02(b), (i) except in respect of Warranty Breaches of Buyer
Fundamental Representations, Buyer shall only be liable for any Damages
incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties to the extent that (A) the amount
of Damages suffered by Seller Indemnified Parties related to each individual
claim or group of related claims exceeds $25,000 (it being understood that
such amount shall be a deductible for which Buyer shall bear no
indemnification responsibility) and (B) the aggregate amount of such Damages
exceeds $750,000, and (ii) except in respect of Warranty Breaches of
Buyer Fundamental Representations, Buyers maximum liability shall not exceed
$12,500,000, (y) for three (3) years following the Closing Date, any claims
brought against Seller or any of its Affiliates by any Continuing Employee
that are due to or caused by Buyers failure to comply with Applicable Law
when taking actions with respect to Continuing Employees following the Closing
Date and (z) the excess, if any, of any reserve related to item #3 on Schedule
11.02 included in the Closing Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant
to Section 2.04 _over_ all amounts incurred by the Company, Buyer or any of
their respective affiliates after the Closing (including reasonable attorneys
and other professional fees) to settle all claims related to or arising out
of item #3 on Schedule 11.02; _provided_ that Buyers indemnification
obligations under this clause (z) may be satisfied, at Buyers election, by
increasing the outstanding amount of the Term Loan by the amount of such
excess, if any.

Section 11.03 _. Third Party Claim Procedures._

(a) The party seeking indemnification under Section 11.02 (the "Indemnified
Party") agrees to give prompt notice in writing to the party against whom
indemnity is to be sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of any
claim or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding by any third party
in respect of which indemnity may be sought under such Section (each, a
"Third Party Claim"). Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such
Third Party Claim and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the
information then available to the Indemnified Party). The failure to so
notify the

 



59  Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have materially
and adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. Thereafter, the Indemnified
Party shall from time to time deliver to the Indemnifying Party (if the
Indemnifying Party assumed control of the defense pursuant to Section 11.03(b)
below) promptly following receipt thereof, copies of all notices and
documents, including all court papers, received by the Indemnified Party
relating to the Third Party Claim. An Indemnified Partys failure to timely
provide notice or copies of documents shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party
from its indemnification obligations, except to the extent the Indemnifying
Party is actually and demonstrably prejudiced as a result of such failure.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section, be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel for such defense, in
each case at its own expense; _provided_  that prior to assuming control of
such defense, the Indemnifying Party must (i) acknowledge that it would have
an indemnity obligation for the Damages resulting from such Third Party Claim
as provided under this Article 11 and (ii) furnish the Indemnified Party with
evidence that the Indemnifying Party has adequate resources to defend the
Third Party Claim and fulfill its indemnity obligations hereunder.

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or maintain control
of the defense of any Third Party Claim and shall pay the fees and expenses of
counsel retained by the Indemnified Party (so long as such counsel is
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party) if (i) the Indemnifying Party
does not deliver the acknowledgment referred to in Section 11.03(b)(i) within
30 days of receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim pursuant to Section
11.03(a), (ii) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with
any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation,
(iii) the Indemnified Party reasonably believes an adverse determination with
respect to the Third Party Claim would be detrimental to the reputation or
future business prospects of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates,
(iv) the Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against
the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or (v) the Indemnifying Party
has failed or is failing to prosecute or defend the Third Party Claim actively
and in good faith.

 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense of any
Third Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.03(c), the
Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party before entering into any settlement of such Third Party Claim unless the
settlement (i) expressly and unconditionally releases the Indemnified Party
and its Affiliates from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such
Third Party Claim and (ii) does not impose injunctive or other equitable
relief against the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates;  _provided_
that no such prior written consent shall be required with respect to a
settlement of any matter listed in Schedule 11.02 so long as such settlement
does not impose injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates and the applicable indemnification remains in
effect with respect to any liabilities and obligations not released.

 



60 (e) In circumstances where the Indemnifying Party is controlling the defense
of a Third Party Claim in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) above, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Third
Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose, it
being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall control such
defense. The fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the
Indemnified Party; _provided_ that in such event the Indemnifying Party shall
pay the fees and expenses of such separate counsel (i) incurred by the
Indemnified Party prior to the date the Indemnifying Party assumes control of
the defense of the Third Party Claim or (ii) if representation of both the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party by the same counsel would create
a conflict of interest.

(f) If the Indemnified Party is controlling the defense of a Third Party
Claim, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of any Third Party Claim together with separate counsel of its choice
for such purpose, it being understood, however, that the Indemnified Party
shall, subject to the limitations set forth in clause (ii), control such
defense and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement
of any proceeding effected without its written consent, which shall not be
withheld unreasonably, but if settled with such consent or if there be a
final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Party agrees to indemnify
the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by
reason of such settlement or judgment. 

(g) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall
retain and furnish or cause to be retained and furnished such records and
information and provide testimony, make employees reasonably available and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

Section 11.04 _. Direct Claim Procedures._ In the event an Indemnified Party
has a claim for indemnity under Section 11.02 against an Indemnifying Party
that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to
give prompt notice in writing of such claim to the Indemnifying Party. Such
notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such claim and the basis for
indemnification (taking into account the information then available to the
Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the
extent such failure shall have prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30)
days following the receipt of a notice with respect to any such claim that
the Indemnifying Party disputes its indemnity obligation to the Indemnified
Party for any Damages with respect to such claim, such Damages shall be
conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall promptly pay to the

 



61  Indemnified Party any and all Damages arising out of such claim. If the
Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its indemnity obligation for any
Damages with respect to such claim, the parties shall proceed in good faith
to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through
negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an appropriate
court of jurisdiction determined pursuant to Section 13.07. 

Section 11.05 _. Exclusive Remedy._ From and after the Closing, except as set
forth in Section 8.03 or with respect to fraud, the indemnification
provisions of this Article 11 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any and all claims arising out of or relating to Buyers
investigation of Seller, the Company, the Subsidiaries and their business,
this Agreement, the negotiation and execution of this Agreement or any
Contract entered into pursuant to this Agreement or the performance by the
parties of its or their terms, and no other remedy shall be had (all of which
are hereby waived) pursuant to any contract, misrepresentation, negligence,
strict liability or tort theory of Law or equity, violation of Applicable Law
or otherwise by any party and its officers, directors, employees, agents,
affiliates, attorneys, consultants, insurers, successors and assigns, all
such remedies being hereby expressly waived to the fullest extent permitted
under Applicable Law. Seller agrees to waive any and all indemnification
rights arising under the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or any other
organizational document of the Company or any Subsidiary or under any Contract
with the Company or any Subsidiary, in each case, in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in respect of matters to which a
Buyer Indemnified Party asserts a claim for indemnification under Section 8.03
or Article 11 of this Agreement.

Section 11.06 _. Offset for Reserves._ The obligation of Seller to indemnify
the Buyer Indemnified Parties against any Damages under Section 11.02 shall be
reduced by the full amount of any reserve, provision or allowance (in the
form of an accrued liability or an offset to an asset or similar item) that
was reflected in the calculation of the Closing Working Capital solely to the
extent it related to the matter for which Seller would otherwise be required
to provide such indemnification.

Section 11.07 _. Insurance/Net Tax Benefits._ (a) The indemnification
obligations of an Indemnifying Party under this Article 11 shall be adjusted
so as to give effect to any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified
Party under applicable policies of insurance acquired by the Company prior to
the Closing Date (net of any expenses of collection) that provide coverage
against the circumstances giving rise to such claim.

 

(b) If any Indemnified Party actually realizes a net Tax benefit ( _i.e._ , an
actual reduction of Tax liability of the Indemnified Party or an actual
refund received by the Indemnified Party (reduced by any actual liability of
such Indemnified Party for Taxes resulting from the accrual or receipt of such
refund or any payment by such Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section
11.07(b))) for

 



62  the year with respect to which a claim for Damages was paid by the
Indemnifying Party and arising from the incurrence or payment of such Damages,
the Indemnified Party shall pay such net Tax benefit to the Indemnifying
Party. In computing the amount of any such net Tax benefit, the Indemnified
Party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss,
deduction or credit before recognizing any items arising from the incurrence
or payment of any such Damages. The Indemnified Party shall pay any amount
required pursuant to this Section 11.07(b) promptly after (i) in the case of a
refund, the receipt of such refund and (ii) in the case of a reduction in the
Tax liability of the Indemnified Party, the filing of the Tax Return
reflecting such reduced Tax liability.

 

Section 11.08. _Mitigation_. Each of the parties agrees to take all
commercially reasonable steps to mitigate their respective Damages upon and
after becoming aware of any event or condition that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to any Damages that are indemnifiable under this Article
11.

ARTICLE 12

TERMINATION

 

Section 12.01 _. Grounds for Termination._ This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Closing:

 

(a) by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer;

(b) by either Seller or Buyer if the Closing shall not have been consummated
on or before October 24, 2013; or

(c) by either Seller or Buyer if there shall be any Applicable Law that makes
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby illegal or otherwise
prohibited or if consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby would
violate any nonappealable final order, decree or judgment of any Governmental
Authority having competent jurisdiction.

Section 12.01(c) shall give notice of such termination to the other party.

permitted by Section 12.01, such termination shall be without liability of

consultant or representative of such party) to the other party to this
Agreement; _provided_ the provisions of Section 6.01, Section 13.03, Section
13.06, Section 13.07 and Section 13.08 shall survive any termination hereof
pursuant to Section 12.01, and _provided further_ that if such termination
shall result from the willful or knowing failure of either party to perform
its obligations hereunder, such party shall be fully liable for any and all
Damages incurred or suffered by the other party as a result of such failure.

 



63 Section 12.03 _. Post-termination Obligations._ Upon delivery of a valid
notice of termination in accordance with Section 12.01:

action by any party; and

its terms, as supplemented by this Agreement, notwithstanding the termination

party against whom the waiver is to be effective.

Section 13.03 _. Disclosure Schedule References._ The parties hereto
agree that any reference in a particular Section of either the Seller
Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule (the "Disclosure
Schedules") shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a
disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) of the relevant party that are contained in the
corresponding Section of this Agreement and (b) any other representations and
warranties of such party that is contained in this Agreement, but only if the
relevance of that reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes
of) such representations and warranties would be reasonably apparent. The
Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement are qualified in their entirety by
reference to specific provisions of this Agreement. The Schedules to this
Agreement are not intended to constitute, and shall not be construed as, an
admission or indication that any such fact or item is required to 

 



65  be disclosed, and any fact or item disclosed in the Schedules to this
Agreement shall not by reason only of such inclusion be deemed to be material,
to establish any standard of materiality or to define further the meaning of
such terms for purposes of this Agreement, and no disclosure in the Schedules
to this Agreement relating to any possible breach or violation of any Contract
or Applicable Law shall be construed as an admission or indication that any
such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. References in any
Schedules to this Agreement to any Contract, plan, instrument, document or
legal proceeding are qualified in their entirety by reference to more
detailed information in documents attached thereto or previously delivered or
made available to Buyer and its representatives. After the date hereof and
prior to the Closing, Seller shall have the right to supplement, modify or
update the Schedules to this Agreement solely to reflect actions taken by the
Company to the extent permitted by Section 5.01. Sellers right to supplement,
modify or update the Schedules to this Agreement pursuant to the previous
sentence shall include the right to add new Schedules to this Agreement that
qualify representations and warranties set forth in Article 3 that do not
currently reference any Schedule to this Agreement. Upon delivery of any such
supplements, modifications or updates, the Schedules to this Agreement shall
be deemed amended for all purposes of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, solely for purposes of determining whether the condition set forth in

jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or

AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER BUYER, SELLER NOR THE
COMPANY MAKES ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, AND EACH
HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES MADE BY ITSELF OR
ANY OF ITS OFFICERS,

 



67  DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, FINANCIAL AND LEGAL ADVISORS OR OTHER
REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO THE EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR
DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR
OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING.

 

Section 13.11 _. Severability._ If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 13.12. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or
any New York State court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City,

equity. 

Section 13.13. _Conflicts and Privilege_. Buyer, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates (which, for this purpose, shall be deemed to include the Company
and the Subsidiaries) agrees that, notwithstanding any current or prior
representation of the Company and the Subsidiaries by Sidley Austin LLP,
Sidley Austin LLP shall be allowed to represent Seller and any of his
Affiliates in any matters and disputes adverse to Buyer, the Company and/or
any Subsidiary that either are existing on the date hereof or arise in the
future. Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (which, for this
purpose, shall be deemed to include the Company and the Subsidiaries) hereby
waives any claim that Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary has or may have
that Sidley Austin LLP has a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited
from engaging in such representation and agrees that, if a dispute arises
after the Closing between Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary and Seller or
any of his Affiliates, then Sidley Austin LLP may represent Seller or such
Affiliate in such dispute even though the interests of Seller or such
Affiliate may be directly adverse to Buyer, the Company and/or such Subsidiary
and even though Sidley Austin LLP may have represented the Company or such
Subsidiary in a matter substantially related to such dispute. Buyer, on
behalf of itself and its

 



68  Affiliates (which, for this purpose, shall be deemed to include the Company
and the Subsidiaries), also agrees that, as to all communications between or
among Sidley Austin LLP and Seller, the Company, any Subsidiary and/or any of
their respective Affiliates that occur prior to the Closing, the attorney-
client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to Seller
and may be controlled by Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed by Buyer,
the Company or any Subsidiary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a dispute
arises between Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary and a third party other
than Seller or an Affiliate of Seller after the Closing, then the Company or
any such Subsidiary (to the extent applicable) may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent disclosure to such third party of confidential
communications by Sidley Austin LLP; _provided_ that if the Company or the
Subsidiaries elect to waive such privilege, the Company or the Subsidiaries,
as applicable, shall provide Seller with reasonable advance notice of such
waiver.

 



69 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly
executed by their respective authorized officers as of the day and year first
above written.
