NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
hereinafter set forth and for other good and valuable consideration, the

agree as follows:

 

Article I

 

PURCHASE AND SALE

 

Section 1.01 _Purchase and Sale_. Subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein, at the Closing, (i) Seller shall sell to EVL, and EVL shall
purchase from Seller, the Distributed Company Assets and (ii) Seller shall
sell to PPI, and PPI shall purchase from Seller, the LLC Interests, all free

Section 1.02   _Purchase Price; Payment of Purchase Price_.

(a) _Purchase Price_. The aggregate purchase price for the LLC Interests
and the Distributed Company Assets shall be $159,250,000 (the " _Base Purchase
Price_ "), subject to adjustment pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.03_ (the "
_Purchase Price_ ").

(b) _Payment of Purchase Price_. The Purchase Price shall be paid by
Buyers in immediately available funds by wire transfer at the Closing as
follows:

 



1 (i) to the Escrow Agent (to a bank account designated by the Escrow
Agent in writing to Buyers prior to the Closing):

(A) the Indemnification Escrow Amount (such amount, including any interest
or other amounts earned thereon and less any disbursements therefrom in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement, the " _Indemnification Escrow Fund_ "),
to be held for the purpose of securing the indemnification obligations
of Seller and the Seller Related Parties set forth in this Agreement and the
obligations pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.03(c_ _)(_ _vi)_ ; and

 

(B) the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount (such amount, including any
interest or other amounts earned thereon and less any disbursements therefrom
in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, the " _Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Fund_ " and together, with the Indemnification Escrow Fund, the "
_Escrow Funds_ "), to be held for the purpose of securing the obligations of
Seller in _Section_ __ _ 1.03(c_ _)(_ _vi);_

 

(ii) to holders of outstanding Indebtedness, if any, that amount of money
due and owing from the Company to such holders, as set forth on the Closing
Indebtedness Certificate;

(iii) to third parties that amount of money due and owing from the Company
to such third parties as Transaction Expenses, as set forth on the Closing
Transaction Expenses Certificate;

 

(iv) to the Company, the Bonus Pool Amount; and

 

(v) to Seller (to a bank account designated by Seller in writing to Buyers
prior to Closing), the Base Purchase Price _plus_ Cash _plus_ or _minus_ the
Closing Adjustment calculated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.03(a)(ii)
__less_ the Escrow Funds, the Indebtedness, the Transaction Expenses, and the
Bonus Pool (the " _Closing Payment_ ").

Section 1.03 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

(a) _Closing Adjustment_.

 

(i) At least two (2) Business Days before the Closing, Seller shall prepare
and deliver to Buyers (A) a statement, substantially in the form of _Exhibit
A_ , setting forth its good faith estimate of Cash and Closing Working Capital
(the "Estimated Closing Working Capital"), which statement shall contain an
estimated balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date (without giving
effect to the transactions contemplated herein) (the " _Closing Date Balance
Sheet_ "), a calculation of Estimated Closing Working Capital (the "
_Estimated Closing Working Capital Statement_ ") and (B) a certificate of the
Chief Financial Officer of Seller that the Estimated Closing Working Capital
Statement was prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles attached
hereto as _Exhibit B_.

 

(ii) If the Estimated Working Capital exceeds $10 million (the " _Maximum
Working Capital Threshold_ "), the " _Closing Adjustment_ " shall be a
positive amount equal to the Estimated Working Capital _minus_ the Maximum
Working Capital Threshold. If the Estimated Working Capital is less than $8
million (the " _Minimum Working Capital Threshold_ "), the Closing Adjustment
shall be a negative number equal to the Estimated Working Capital _minus_ the
Minimum Working Capital Threshold.

 



2 (iii) If the Estimated Working Capital (subject to final
adjustment pursuant to Section 1.03(b)(ii)) is between $8 million and $10
million inclusive, there shall be no Closing Adjustment.

 

(b) _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 

(i) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyers shall prepare and
deliver to Seller (A) a written statement setting forth its calculation of
Closing Working Capital, which statement shall contain an unaudited Closing
Date Balance Sheet (without giving effect to the transactions contemplated
herein), a calculation of Cash and Closing Working Capital (the " _Closing
Working Capital Statement_ ") and (B) a certificate of an officer of a Buyer
that the Closing Working Capital Statement was prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles.

 

(ii) The post-closing adjustment shall be an amount equal to the Closing
Adjustment calculated as set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 1.03(a_ _)(_ _ii)_ but
using Closing Working Capital as finally determined in accordance with the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 1.03(c)_ (the " _Post-Closing Adjustment_ ").
If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive number, Buyers shall pay to
Seller an amount equal to the Post-Closing Adjustment. If the Post-Closing
Adjustment is a negative number, Seller shall pay to Buyers an amount equal to
the Post-Closing Adjustment. Any Closing Adjustment calculated at Closing on
an estimated basis shall be credited against payments due under this _Section_
__ _ 1.03(b)(ii)_, and any overpayment or underpayment of the Closing
Adjustment at Closing on an estimated basis shall be refunded to the
appropriate party if not otherwise capable of being reimbursed through the
Post-Closing Adjustment.

 

(c) _Examination and Review_.

 

(i) _Examination_. After receipt of the Closing Working Capital Statement,
Seller shall have thirty (30) days (the " _Review Period_ ") to review the
Closing Working Capital Statement. During the Review Period, Seller and
Sellers accountants shall have full access to the books and records of the
Company, the personnel of, and work papers prepared by, Buyers and/or Buyers
accountants to the extent that they relate to the Closing Working Capital
Statement and to such historical financial information (to the extent in
Buyers possession) relating to the Closing Working Capital Statement as
Seller may reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing the Closing Working
Capital Statement and to prepare a Statement of Objections, _provided_ that
such access shall be in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with
the normal business operations of Buyers or the Company.

(ii) _Objection_. On or prior to the last day of the Review Period,
Seller may object to the Closing Working Capital Statement by delivering to
Buyers a written statement setting forth Sellers objections in reasonable
detail, indicating each disputed item or amount and the basis for Sellers
disagreement therewith (the " _Statement of Objections_ "). If Seller fails to
deliver the Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Review
Period, the Closing Working Capital Statement, and the Post-Closing
Adjustment, as the case may be, reflected in the Closing Working Capital
Statement and shall be deemed to have been accepted by Seller. If Seller
delivers the Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Review
Period, Buyers and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such
objections within twenty (20) days after the delivery of the Statement of

 



3  Objections (the " _Resolution Period_ "), and, if the same are so resolved
within the Resolution Period, the Post-Closing Adjustment and the Closing
Working Capital Statement with such changes as may have been previously
agreed in writing by Buyers and Seller, shall be final and binding.

 

(iii) _Resolution of Disputes_. If Seller and Buyers fail to reach an
agreement with respect to all of the matters set forth in the Statement of
Objections before expiration of the Resolution Period, then any amounts
remaining in dispute (" _Disputed Amounts_ " and any amounts not so disputed,
the " _Undisputed Amounts_ ") shall be submitted for resolution to the
Independent Accountant who, acting as experts and not arbitrators, shall
resolve the Disputed Amounts only and make any adjustments to the Post-Closing
Adjustment, as the case may be, and the Closing Working Capital Statement.
The Independent Accountant shall only decide the specific items under dispute
by the parties and their decision for each Disputed Amount must be within the
range of values assigned to each such item in the Closing Working
Capital Statement and the Statement of Objections, respectively.

(iv) _Fees of the Independent Accountant_. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant shall be paid by Seller, on the one hand, and by
Buyers, on the other hand, based upon the percentage that the amount actually
contested but not awarded to Seller or Buyers, respectively, bears to
the aggregate amount actually contested by Seller and Buyers.

(v) _Determination by Independent Accountant_. The Independent Accountant
shall make a determination as soon as practicable within thirty (30) days (or
such other time as the parties hereto shall agree in writing) after their
engagement, and their resolution of the Disputed Amounts and
their adjustments to the Closing Working Capital Statement and the Post-
Closing Adjustment shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto,
and judgment on such decision may be entered in any court of competent
jurisdiction.

 

(vi) _Payments_ _of Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 

(A) If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative number, Buyers and Seller
shall, within two (2) Business Days after the final determination of the
Post-Closing Adjustment, jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse from
the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund (i) to Buyers, the Post-Closing
Adjustment, and (ii) to Seller any amounts remaining in the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Fund. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is greater than the
amount held in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund, then Buyers and
Seller shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse from
the Indemnification Escrow Fund by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to Buyers the amount by which the Post-Closing Adjustment exceeds the
amount in the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund (up to the amount in the
Indemnification Escrow Fund).

(B) If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive number, Buyers shall,
within two (2) Business Days after the final determination of the Post-
Closing Adjustment, (i) pay to Seller the Post-Closing Adjustment and (ii)
Buyers and Seller shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse to
Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds the entire amount of
the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund.

(d) _Adjustments for Tax Purposes_. Any payments made pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.03_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price
by the parties for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

 



4 Section 1.04 _Withholding Tax_. Buyers shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the Purchase Price all Taxes that Buyers may be required to
deduct and withhold under any provision of Tax Law. Except with respect to any
compensatory payments, Buyers shall take commercially reasonable efforts to
give Seller at least five (5) Business Days prior written notice of its
intention to make any such deduction or withholding and shall utilize
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Seller to mitigate any such
deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority in accordance
with applicable law, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to Seller. Buyers shall
furnish Seller official receipts (or copies thereof) or other reasonable
evidence showing payment of such Taxes.

 

Article II

the Closing Date. The covenants and agreements herein that are required to be
performed after the Closing Date shall survive the Closing in accordance with
their respective terms. Neither Seller, Seller Related Parties nor Buyer shall
have any obligations or liabilities for any Losses except as to any claims
asserted in good faith with reasonable specificity (to the extent known at
such time) pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.05_ prior to the expiration date of
the applicable survival period, _provided_ that if a claim is asserted prior
to the expiration of the applicable survival period as aforesaid, such claim
shall not thereafter be barred by the expiration of the relevant
representation or warranty or covenant and shall survive until finally
resolved.

 

Section 8.02 _Indemnification_ _By_ _Seller_ _and the Seller Related

against, and shall pay and reimburse each of them for, any and all Losses
incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the Buyer Indemnitees based upon,
arising out of, with respect to or by reason of:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach (or alleged breach if asserted by a third
party) of any of the representations or warranties of Seller contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate or instrument delivered by or on behalf of
Seller pursuant to this Agreement (other than in respect of _Section_ __ _
3.22_, it being understood that the sole remedy for any such inaccuracy in or
breach thereof shall be pursuant to _Article VI_ );

 



46 (b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation
to be performed by Seller or the Seller Related Parties pursuant to this
Agreement (other than any breach or violation of, or failure to fully perform,
any covenant, agreement, undertaking or obligation in  _Article VI_ , it
being understood that the sole remedy for any such breach, violation or
failure shall be pursuant to _Article VI_ );

 

(c) any Indebtedness as of the Closing Date to the extent not paid at
Closing in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 1.02(b)(ii)_;

(d) any Transaction Expense to the extent not paid at Closing
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.02(b)(iii)_; or

_Section_ __ _ 3.20(d)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

Section 8.03 _Indemnification_ _By_ _ Buyer_ _s_. Subject to the other
terms and conditions of this _Article VIII_ , Buyers shall indemnify and
defend Seller and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives
(collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") against, and shall hold each of
them harmless from and against, and shall pay and reimburse each of them for,
any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the Seller
Indemnitees based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties
of Buyers contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or instrument
delivered by or on behalf of Buyers pursuant to this Agreement; or

 

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation
to be performed by Buyers pursuant to this Agreement (other than _Article VI_
, it being understood that the sole remedy for any such breach thereof shall
be pursuant to _Article VI_ ).

 

Section 8.04 _Certain Limitations_. The indemnification provided for in 
_Section_ __ _ 8.02_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.03_ shall be subject to the
following limitations:

 

(a) Other than with respect to Losses resulting from Fraud or a breach of
Fundamental Representations, Seller and the Seller Related Parties shall not
be liable to the Buyer Indemnitees for indemnification under _Section_ __ _
8.02(a)_ until the aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of
indemnification under  _Section_ __ _ 8.02(a)_ exceeds $796,250 (the
"Deductible"), in which event Seller and Seller Related Parties in the
aggregate shall be required to pay or be liable only for all such Losses in
excess of the Deductible. Other than with respect to Losses resulting from
Fraud or a breach of Fundamental Representations, (i) any amount of Losses
payable to any Buyer Indemnitee in respect of indemnification under _Section_
__ _ 8.02(a)_ shall be paid solely and exclusively from the Indemnification
Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms hereof and of the Escrow Agreement;
and (ii) Sellers and Seller Related Parties liability for indemnification of
Losses pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.02(a)_ shall be limited, in the
aggregate, to the Indemnification Escrow Fund (the " _Cap_ "). Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary Seller and Seller Related Parties
maximum aggregate liability for indemnification for Losses in respect of
indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 8.02(a)_, including from a breach of any
Fundamental Representation, or _Article VI_ (other than Losses resulting
from Fraud), shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the Base Purchase Price.

 



47 (b) Without limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in this 
_Article VIII_ , for purposes of computing the amount of any Losses incurred
by the Buyer Indemnitees under this _Article VIII_ , there shall be deducted
an amount equal to the amount of any insurance proceeds, indemnification
payments, contribution payments or reimbursements actually received by Buyer
Indemnitees in connection with such Losses or any of the circumstances giving
rise thereto (it being understood that the Buyer Indemnitees shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such proceeds, payments or
reimbursements, but the possibility of recovering such amounts shall in no way
delay the resolution or payment of any indemnification under this _Article
VIII_ ), net of costs and expenses incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees in
connection with such recoveries. If the Buyer Indemnitees receive any
insurance proceeds, indemnification payments, contribution payments or
reimbursements for any Losses subsequent to an applicable indemnification
payment under this _Article VIII_ , then such member of the Buyer Indemnitees
shall promptly reimburse Seller for any indemnification payment previously
made up to the amount received by the Buyer Indemnitees, net of any expenses
incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees in collecting such amount.

Section 8.05 _Indemnification Procedures_.

(a) Any party seeking indemnification under this _Article VIII_ (an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly give the party from whom
indemnification is being sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") notice (a "
_Claims Notice_ ") of any matter which such Indemnified Party has determined
has given or could give rise to a right to indemnification under this
Agreement, within 30 days of such determination, stating in reasonable detail,
to the extent feasible, the nature of the claim and a good-faith reasonable
estimate of the Loss. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall
not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys failure to give such notice.

(b) _Third-Party Claims_. Any Indemnified Party shall notify the
Indemnifying Party by providing a Claims Notice after receiving notice of any
potential or actual assertion or commencement of any Action made or brought by
any Person who is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to
this Agreement or a Representative of the foregoing (a " _Third-Party Claim_
") against such Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnified Party
is seeking indemnification under this Agreement from the Indemnifying Party.
The Claims Notice shall specify in reasonable detail, to the extent
reasonably known and practicable at such time, the amount of the Third-Party
Claim to which the Claims Notice pertains and the basis for indemnification,
and will include copies of all notices and documents (including court papers)
served on or received by the Indemnified Party in connection with the Third-
Party Claims. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in,
or if it has acknowledged in writing that such Third-Party Claim is within the
scope of its indemnification obligations hereunder, to assume the defense of
any Third-Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys expense and by the
Indemnifying Partys own counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified
Party, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such
defense; _provided_ , that if the Indemnifying Party is Seller or the Seller
Related Parties, such Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to defend or
direct the defense of any such Third-Party Claim that (x) seeks an injunction
or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or (y) would exceed
the Cap. In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any
Third-Party Claim, subject to  _Section_ __ _ 8.05(c)_, it shall have the
right to take such action as it deems

 



48  necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining
to any such Third-Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the
defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the
Indemnifying Partys right to control the defense thereof. The fees and
disbursements of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified
Party; _provided_ that if in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
Indemnified Party, (A) there are legal defenses available to an Indemnified
Party that are different from or additional to those available to
the Indemnifying Party; or (B) there exists a conflict of interest between
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot be waived, the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel to the Indemnified Party in each jurisdiction for which the
Indemnified Party determines counsel is required. If the Indemnifying Party
elects not to compromise or defend such Third-Party Claim, fails to promptly
notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as provided
in this Agreement, or fails to diligently prosecute the defense of such Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may pay, compromise, defend such Third-
Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon,
arising from or relating to such Third-Party Claim. Seller or the Seller
Related Parties, as applicable, and Buyers shall cooperate with each other in
all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any Third-Party
Claim, including making available (subject to the provisions of _Section_ __
_ 5.07_) records relating to such Third-Party Claim and furnishing, without
expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the
defending party, management employees of the non-defending party as may be
reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third-Party
Claim, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid production of
confidential information (consistent with applicable Law) and to cause all
communications among Seller, Buyers, their respective employees
and Representatives to be made so as to preserve applicable attorney-client
or work-product privileges.

 

(c) _Settlement of Third-Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into
settlement of any Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed);
_provided_ that no consent shall be required if such settlement includes an
unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from all liabilities and
obligations in connection with such Third-Party Claim and provides solely for
the payment of monetary damages for which the Indemnified Party will
be indemnified under this Agreement.

(d) _Direct Claims_. Any Action by an Indemnified Party on account of
a Loss which does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ")
shall be asserted by the Indemnified Party providing a Claims Notice to the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have twenty (20) days after
its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. The
Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional
advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the
Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect
of the Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying
Partys investigation by giving such information and assistance (including
reasonable access to the Companys premises and personnel and the right to
examine and copy any accounts, documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party
or any of its professional advisors may reasonably request. If the
Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such twenty (20)-day period, the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case
the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be
available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions
of this Agreement.

 



49 (e) _Tax Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
the control of any claim, assertion, event or proceeding in respect of Taxes
of the Company (including any such claim in respect of a breach of the
representations and warranties in _Section_ __ _ 3.22_ hereof or any breach
or violation of or failure to fully perform any covenant, agreement,
undertaking or obligation in _Article VI_ ) shall be governed exclusively by
_Article VI_ hereof.

 

Section 8.06 _Payments; Indemnification Escrow Funds_.

 

(a) Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or finally
adjudicated to be payable pursuant to _Article VI_ or this _Article VIII_ ,
the Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its obligations within five (5) Business
Days of such agreement or adjudication in the case where the Buyer is the
Indemnifying Party, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, and in
the case where the Seller is the Indemnifying Party delivery of joint written
instructions directing the Escrow Agent to release such amount of the Escrow
funds to satisfy the Loss or, to the extent the Loss is not related to an
indemnification claim that is limited to the Indemnification Escrow Fund, by
wire transfer or immediately available funds. The parties hereto agree that
should an Indemnifying Party not make full payment, or delivery of written
instructions to the Escrow Agent, of any such obligations within such five
(5) Business Day period, any amount payable shall accrue interest from and
including the date of agreement of the Indemnifying Party or final
adjudication to and including the date such payment has been made at a rate
per annum equal to 10%. Such interest shall be calculated daily on the basis
of a 365 day year and the actual number of days elapsed.

 

(b) Any Losses payable to a Buyer Indemnitee pursuant to _Article VI_ or
this _Article VIII_ shall be satisfied: (i) first from the Indemnification
Escrow Fund; and (ii) subject to the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _
8.04(a)_, to the extent the amount of Losses exceeds the amounts available to
the Buyer Indemnitee in the Indemnification Escrow Fund, then from Seller or
the Seller Related Parties; _provided_ that in such event, the Buyer
Indemnitee shall first look to Veerappan Subramanian to satisfy such Loss and
then to Anu and Ilango. Buyers and Seller agree to execute and deliver to the
Escrow Agent, within two (2) Business Days of the date a Loss is agreed to or
finally adjudicated to be payable pursuant to _Article VI_ or this _Article
VIII_ , joint written instructions directing the release of Indemnification
Escrow Funds in accordance with such agreement of final adjudication.

(c) The Escrow Agreement shall provide that on the first Business day
after the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing (the " _Initial
Escrow Release Date_ "), the Escrow Agent shall release to Seller the sum of
the remaining amounts in the Indemnification Escrow Fund _plus_ all interest
accrued on amounts in the Indemnification Escrow Fund as of the Initial Escrow
Release Date, less (i) $5,000,000 _plus_ (ii) the aggregate amount of all
Unresolved Claims, and on the first Business Day after the twenty fourth
(24th) month anniversary of the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall release
to Seller the remaining amounts in the Indemnification Escrow Fund _minus_
the aggregate amount of all Unresolved Claims. The Indemnification Escrow
Funds retained shall be released by the Escrow Agent (to the extent not
utilized to pay a Buyer Indemnitee for any such Losses resolved in favor of a
Buyer Indemnitee) upon their resolution in accordance with _Article VI_ or
this _Article VIII_ and the terms of the Escrow Agreement

 

(d) Each Person that brings a claim for indemnification under this Article
VIII shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any liability or
Losses that such Person asserts under this Article VIII.

 



50 Section 8.07 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments; No Right of
Contribution_.

(a) All indemnification payments made under this Agreement, including
under _Section_ __ _ 6.09_, shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not have any right of contribution,
indemnification or right of advancement from the Company with respect to any
loss claimed by an Indemnified Party.

Section 8.08   _Effect of Investigation_. The representations, warranties
and covenants of the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Partys right to
indemnification with respect thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived
by reason of any investigation made by Indemnified Party (including by any of
its Representatives) or by reason of the fact that the Indemnified Party knew
or should have known that any such representation or warranty is, was or might
be inaccurate or by reason of the Indemnified Partys waiver of any condition
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.02_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.03_, as the case may
be, except as otherwise set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 10.04(b)_.

Section 8.09 _N_ _o Double Recovery_. Notwithstanding the fact that any
party may have the right to assert claims for indemnification under or in
respect of more than one provision of this Agreement or another agreement
entered into in connection herewith in respect of any fact, event, condition
or circumstance, no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover the amount
of any Losses suffered by such Indemnified Party more than once under all such
agreements in respect of such fact, event, condition or circumstance, and an
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for indemnification to the extent the
Indemnified Party has otherwise been fully compensated on a dollar-for-dollar
basis for such Losses pursuant to the Post-Closing adjustments under
_Section_ __ _ 1.03_.

 

Section 8.10 _Exclusive Remedies_. Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 5.07_ and
_Section_ __ _ 10.11_, from and after the Closing, the parties acknowledge
and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all
claims (other than claims arising from Fraud on the part of a party hereto in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) for any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set
forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement,
shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in _Article VI_
and this _Article VIII_. Nothing in this _Article VIII_ shall limit any
Persons right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any Person
shall be entitled or to seek any remedy on account of any partys Fraud.

Article IX

_Section_ __ _ 7.02_ shall not have been, or become incapable of being
fulfilled by the ten (10) month anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the

(i) neither Seller nor any Seller related Party is then in material breach

to perform or comply with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions
hereof to be performed or complied with by it prior to the Closing; or

 

(d) by Buyers or Seller in the event that (i) there shall be any Law that

Section 10.03 _Rules of Construction_.

 

(a) When the context in which words are used in this Agreement indicates
that such is the intent, words used in the singular shall have a comparable
meaning when used in the plural, and vice versa; pronouns stated in the
masculine, feminine or neuter shall include each other gender.

 

(b) The section headings contained in this Agreement are solely for the
purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the parties hereto and
shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 

(c) The term "including" is not limiting and means "including, without
limitation."

 

(d) Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, (i) references to
agreements (including this Agreement) and other contractual instruments shall
be deemed to include all subsequent amendments and other modifications
thereto, but only to the extent such amendments and other modifications are
disclosed to Buyers, (ii) references to any statute or regulation shall be
construed as including all statutory and regulatory provisions amending,
replacing, supplementing or interpreting such statute or regulation, except
that for purposes of determining the accuracy of 

 



54  any representation and warranty, such reference shall only be to such
statute or regulation as in effect on the date the representation and warranty
was made and (iii) references to "Sections," "Schedules" or "Exhibits" are to
sections, schedules or exhibits, as applicable, of this Agreement.

 

(e) Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, "dollars" or "$" means the
currency of the U.S. that, as at the time of payment, is legal tender for the
payment of public and private debts.

(f) This Agreement is between financially sophisticated and knowledgeable
parties and is entered into by such parties in reliance upon the economic and
legal bargains contained herein, the language used in this Agreement has been
negotiated by the parties and their Representatives and shall be interpreted
and construed in a fair and impartial manner without regard to such factors as
the party who prepared, or caused the preparation of, this Agreement or the
relative bargaining power of the parties.

 

Section 10.04 _D_ _isclosure Schedules_.

 

(a) The Seller Disclosure Schedule and the Buyers Disclosure Schedule
referred to herein and delivered pursuant to and attached to this Agreement
(collectively, " _Disclosure Schedules_ ") are integral parts of this
Agreement. The Company is responsible for preparing and arranging the Seller
Disclosure Schedule and Buyers are responsible for preparing and arranging
the Buyers Disclosure Schedule. Nothing in a Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made
herein, unless the Disclosure Schedule identifies the exception
with reasonable particularity and describes the relevant facts in reasonable
detail, including by explicit cross-reference to another Disclosure Schedule
to this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the mere
listing, or inclusion of a copy, of a document or other item shall not be
deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made
herein, unless the representation or warranty is being made as to the
existence of the document or other item itself. The inclusion of any
information in the Disclosure Schedules will not be deemed an admission or
acknowledgement to any third party that such information is required to be
listed in the Disclosure Schedules or that such items are material.
The disclosure of any item in one section of the Disclosure Schedules as an
exception to a particular representation or warranty will be deemed adequately
disclosed as an exception with respect to all other representations and
warranties to the extent that the relevance of such item to such other
representations or warranties is reasonably apparent on its face,
notwithstanding the presence or absence of an appropriate cross-reference
thereto.

 

(b) From time to time prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall supplement,
or amend and deliver updates to the Seller Disclosure Schedule (each a "
_Schedule Update_ ") that are necessary to complete, update or correct any
information in such Seller Disclosure Schedule, or in any representation or
warranty of Seller that has been rendered inaccurate since the date of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Schedule Update shall not be given
effect for the purpose of determining whether the condition of Closing in
_Section_ __ _ 7.02(a)_ has been satisfied and shall not limit Buyers
termination right set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.01(b)(_ _i_ _)_ ; _provided
however_ , that in the event any Schedule Update would result in Buyers
condition to Closing set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.02(a)_ to not be met and
Buyers choose to consummate the transactions, Buyers shall be deemed to have
irrevocably waived any right to indemnification pursuant to _Article VIII_
with respect to such Schedule Update.
