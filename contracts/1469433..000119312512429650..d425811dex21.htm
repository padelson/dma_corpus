Merger Sub will cease and the Company will continue its corporate existence
under Delaware law as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ").

_Section 1.2_ _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson LLP, One

extent permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
actions to be taken at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of such conditions) or at such other place, date and time as the Company and
Parent may agree in writing; _provided_ , that without the prior written
consent of Parent, the Closing shall not occur prior to the earlier of (x) a
date during the Marketing Period specified by Parent on no fewer than five
Business Days notice to the Company or (y) if no such date has been
specified by Parent, the second Business Day following the final day of the

 _Section 1.3_ _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
at the Closing, the Company will cause a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with Section 251 of
the DGCL. The Merger will become effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or at such later date or time as may be agreed by the Company and
Merger Sub in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger
in accordance with the DGCL (the effective time of the Merger being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

_Section 1.4_ _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

 

 _Section 1.5_ _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation_. Subject to Section 5.9, at the Effective Time, (a) the
certificate of incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to

Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL and such
certificate of incorporation; and (b) the bylaws of the Company shall be
amended and restated to conform to the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as so amended shall be the bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the
DGCL and such bylaws.

 



-2-  _Section 1.6_ _Directors_. Subject to applicable Law, the directors of Merger
Sub as of the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, or their earlier death, incapacitation, retirement,
resignation or removal. 

_Section 1.7_ _Officers_. The officers of the Company as of the Effective Time
shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold
office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or
their earlier death, incapacitation, retirement, resignation or removal.

 

ARTICLE II

 

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

_Section 2.1_ _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or
the holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

(a) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing prior
to the Effective Time by Parent and a holder of shares of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (such shares, collectively, the " _Common Stock_ ," and each,
a " _Share_ "), each Share other than Shares to be cancelled or converted
pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and other than Dissenting Shares, shall be
converted automatically into the right to receive $32.00 in cash (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), without interest. All Shares that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
this Section 2.1 shall be automatically cancelled upon the conversion thereof
and shall cease to exist, and the holders of certificates that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented such Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Shares other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (less any applicable withholding Taxes), without interest.

(b) _Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Shares_. Each Share that is owned directly by
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
(the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation.

 

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the
Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub
shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 



-3-  (d) _Dissenters  Rights_. Any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent
required thereby), Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares) and that are held by
holders of such Shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who have properly exercised
appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have
complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders
of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled to receive payment of the fair
value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of such
Section 262 unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If,
after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be deemed
to have been converted into, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and the Surviving
Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the Merger Consideration for
such Shares. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in
Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. The Company
will give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisals of Shares and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such notices and demands. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle any such demands.

 

 _Section 2.2_ _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to or at the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall
be appointed by Parent (and reasonably satisfactory to the Company) to act as
a paying agent hereunder (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of
holders of the Shares, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares),
payable upon due surrender of the certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented Shares (" _Certificates_ ") (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or non-certificated Shares represented by
book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_
").

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the second Business Day following the Closing Date, the
Surviving Corporation shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder
of record of Shares whose Shares were converted into the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.1, (A) a letter of transmittal

 



-4-   (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the
Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent and the Company may mutually agree), and (B) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required
by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates (or effective affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive
from the Exchange Fund in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the
product of (x) the number of Shares represented by such holders properly
surrendered Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares and (y) the Merger Consideration (less any
applicable withholding Taxes). No interest will be paid or accrued on any
amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment upon due surrender of the Certificate may be paid to such a
transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented
to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes
have been paid or are not applicable. The Merger Consideration, paid in full
with respect to any Share in accordance with the terms hereof, shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Share.

(iii) The Paying Agent, the Company and its Subsidiaries, Parent and Merger
Sub, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
" _Code_ "), and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To
the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted or
withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the applicable entity to the
appropriate Governmental Entity and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which
such deduction or withholding was made.

(c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer, the holder of Certificates
shall be given a copy of the letter of transmittal referred to in Section
2.2(b) and instructed to comply with the instructions in that letter of
transmittal in order to receive the cash to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to this Article II.

(d)  _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed
to the former holders of Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving

 



-5-   Corporation upon demand, and any former holders of Shares who have not
surrendered their Shares in accordance with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter
look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon due surrender of
their Shares.

 

(e) _No Liability_. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent
or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct short-
term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the U.S. government. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to Section 2.2(d).

(g)  _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Paying Agent or Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond
in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the amount of the
number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
multiplied by the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.

 

 _Section 2.3_ _Treatment of Company Options and Company RSU Awards_.

 

(a) Unless otherwise agreed to in writing prior to the Effective Time by
Parent and a holder of a Company Option, each Company Option, whether vested
or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested and be converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the excess,
if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share of such
Company Option multiplied by (ii) the total number of Shares subject to such
Company Option. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing prior to the Effective
Time by Parent and a holder of a Company Option, the Surviving Corporation or
one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall pay to each holder of Company
Options the cash amounts described in the immediately preceding sentence
(through the Companys payroll system or through the Companys equity award
administrator), less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with
respect to the making of such payment (the " _Option Consideration_ "),
within five calendar days following the Effective Time. Unless otherwise
agreed to in writing prior to the Effective Time by Parent and a holder of a
Company Option, from and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
outstanding Company Options, and the former holders thereof shall be entitled
only to the payment of the Option Consideration.

 



-6-  (b) Unless otherwise agreed to in writing prior to the Effective Time by
Parent and a holder of a Company RSU Award, each Company RSU Award, whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested (without regard to
the satisfaction of any performance condition) and be converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total
number of Shares subject to such Company RSU Award multiplied by (ii) the
Merger Consideration. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing prior to the
Effective Time by Parent and a holder of a Company RSU Award, the Surviving
Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall pay to each
holder of Company RSU Awards the cash amounts described in the
immediately preceding sentence (through the Companys payroll system or
through the Companys equity award administrator), less such amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment, within
five calendar days following the Effective Time.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will adopt such resolutions,
provide optionees with notice of their opportunity to exercise their Company
Options if such notice is required by the applicable plan or award agreement
and take all other such actions as may reasonably be necessary in its
discretion to effectuate the treatment of the Company Options and the Company
RSU Awards as contemplated by this Section 2.3. The parties agree to the
additional matters set forth in Section 2.3(c) of the Company Disclosure
Letter.

(d) Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall enter into or engage in
substantive discussions with any Company employee regarding the rollover of a
Company Option, Company RSU Award or Shares without the consent of a majority
of the Company Board or its Compensation Committee, excluding the Chief
Executive Officer of the Company and any member of the Company Board who is
an Affiliate of a party to a Rollover Contribution Agreement, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld. Parent agrees that neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates will (i) amend or modify (including waiving any provision
thereunder) any Rollover Contribution Agreement with any Rollover Investor or
(ii) enter into, amend or modify (including waiving any provision thereunder)

_Section 4.3_ _Investigations; Litigation_. There is no investigation or
review pending (or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened) by any
Governmental Entity with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries which
would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse

-27-  _Section 4.5_ _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent has received and accepted an executed commitment letter dated
October 21, 2012 and attached as Annex III (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ")
from the lenders party thereto (collectively, the " _Lenders_ ") pursuant to
which the Lenders have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to
provide the debt amounts set forth therein (the " _Debt Financing
Commitments_ "). The Debt Financing Commitments pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letter are collectively referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Debt Financing_."

 

(b) Parent has received and accepted (i) executed commitment letters dated
October 21, 2012 and attached as Annex IV (collectively, the " _Equity
Commitment Letters_ ") from certain Persons (collectively, the " _Equity
Investors_ "), pursuant to which the Equity Investors have agreed, subject to
the terms and conditions thereof, to invest in Parent the amounts set forth
therein (the " _Equity Financing Commitments_ ") and (ii) executed
contribution agreements and rollover agreements dated October 21, 2012 and
attached as Annex V (the " _Rollover Contribution Agreements_ " and, together
with the Debt Commitment Letters and the Equity Commitment Letters, the "
_Commitment Letters_ ") from certain Persons (collectively, the " _Rollover
Investors_ "), pursuant to which the Rollover Investors have committed,
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to contribute to Parent the
amount of shares of Common Stock, Company Options or Company RSU Awards, as
applicable, as set forth therein (the " _Rollover Investment_ " and, together
with the Debt Financing Commitments, and the Equity Financing Commitments, the
" _Financing Commitments_ "). The equity committed pursuant to the Equity
Commitment Letters is collectively referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Equity Financing_." The Equity Financing, the Debt Financing and the Rollover
Investment are collectively referred to as the " _Financing_." Parent has
delivered to the Company true, complete and correct copies of the executed
Commitment Letters and the fee letter referenced in the Debt Commitment Letter
(the " _Fee Letter_ ") (except that only the fee amounts, consent fees, price
caps (including price caps in any securities demand provisions and economic
"flex" provisions) set forth therein have been redacted).

(c) Except as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters, there are no
conditions precedent to the obligations of the Lenders, the Equity Investors
and the Rollover Investors to provide the Financing or any contingencies that
would permit the Lenders, the Equity Investors or the Rollover Investors to
reduce the total amount of the Financing. Assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth Section 6.1 and 6.3, the completion of the Marketing
Period and the performance by the Company of its obligations under this
Agreement, Parent does not have any reason to believe that it will be unable
to satisfy on a timely basis all conditions and material terms to be satisfied
by it in any of the Commitment Letters on or prior to the Closing Date, nor
does Parent have Knowledge that any of the Lenders, Equity Investors or the
Rollover Investors will not perform its obligations thereunder.

(d) The Financing, when funded in accordance with the Commitment Letters,
shall provide Parent with cash proceeds on the Closing Date (after netting out
applicable fees, expenses, original issue discount and similar premiums and
charges and after giving effect to the maximum amount of flex (including
original issue discount flex) provided under the Debt Commitment Letter and
Fee Letter) sufficient for the satisfaction of Parents and Merger Subs
obligations to pay the Merger Consideration and any fees and expenses of or
payable by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation.

 



-28-  (e) The Commitment Letters are (i) valid and binding obligations of Parent
and, to the Knowledge of Parent, of each of the other parties thereto
(subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting creditors rights
generally and general principles of equity whether considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law) and (ii) in full force and effect. No event has occurred
that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would reasonably be
expected to constitute a default or breach or a failure to satisfy a
condition precedent on the part of Parent under the terms and conditions of
the Commitment Letters. Parent has paid in full any and all commitment fees or
other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letters
on or before the date of this Agreement, and will pay in full any such
amounts due on or before the Closing Date. None of the Commitment Letters has
been modified, amended or altered as of the date hereof, none of the
Commitment Letters will be amended, modified or altered at any time through
the Closing, except as permitted by Section 5.11(a) and none of the respective
commitments under any of the Commitment Letters have been withdrawn or
rescinded in any respect.

 

(f) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by Parent or any
Affiliate or any other financing or other transactions be a condition to any
of Parents or Merger Subs obligations hereunder.

_Section 4.6_ _Funding Agreement_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, the Sponsor has delivered to the Company the duly executed Funding
Agreement. The Funding Agreement is in full force and effect and is a valid,
binding and enforceable obligation of the Sponsor. No event has occurred,
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default on the part of the Sponsor under the Funding Agreement. 

_Section 4.7_ _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. As of the date hereof, the
authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, 100 shares of which are validly issued and
outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is,
and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent. Merger Sub has
outstanding no option, warrant, right, or any other agreement pursuant to
which any Person other than Parent may acquire any equity security of Merger
Sub. Merger Sub has been formed solely for the purpose of the Merger Agreement
and has not conducted any business prior to the date hereof and has, and
prior to the Effective Time will have, no assets, liabilities or obligations
of any nature other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this
Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

_Section 4.8_ _Finders or Brokers_. Except for Morgan Stanley, neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries has employed any investment banker, broker or
finder in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement who
might be entitled to any fee or any commission in connection with or
upon consummation of the Merger.

 



-29-  _Section 4.9_ _WARN Act_. Parent and Merger Sub are neither planning
nor contemplating, and Parent and Merger Sub have neither made nor taken, any
decisions or actions concerning the employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries after the Closing that would require the service of notice under
the WARN Act or similar local Laws.

_Section 4.10_ _No Additional Representations_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledges that it and its Representatives
have received access to such books and records, facilities, equipment,
contracts and other assets of the Company which it and its Representatives
have desired or requested to review, and that it and its Representatives have

information, including the management presentation materials delivered to
Parent, as subsequently updated, supplemented or amended (the " _Confidential
Information Memorandum_ "), or any information, documents or material made
available to Parent in the due diligence materials provided to Parent,
including in the Data Room, other management presentations (formal
or informal) or in any other form in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company
makes no representation or warranty to Parent or Merger Sub with respect to
(i) the information set forth in the Confidential Information Memorandum or
(ii) any business or financial projection or forecast relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not included in the Confidential
Information Memorandum, the Data Room or any management presentation. Parent,
on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, expressly waives any such claim
relating to the foregoing matters.

of Directors, on the other hand, relating in any way to the Company, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to the operations of the
Company after the Effective Time.

_Section 4.12_ _Investment_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Sponsor or any of

the Exchange Act, (D) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve or recommend to the stockholders of the Company an Alternative
Proposal or (E) enter into any agreement, contract or agreement in principle
requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or breach its obligations
hereunder or fail to consummate the Merger (actions prohibited this clause (i)
being referred to as a " _Change of Recommendation_ ") or (ii) authorize,
cause or permit the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to enter into
any Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.3 to the contrary, at any time
prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders:

 

(i) if (A) the Company receives a written bona fide Alternative Proposal which
the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisers and outside legal counsel, is or would reasonably be
expected to result in, a Superior Proposal and (B) the Company has not
breached in any material respect Section 5.3(a), the Company may take the
following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information to the third party making
such Alternative Proposal, if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such
information, the Company receives from the third party an executed
confidentiality agreement having provisions as to confidential treatment of
information that are substantially similar to the confidentiality provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such
confidentiality agreement need not contain any "standstill" or similar
provisions or otherwise prohibit the making or amendment of any Alternative
Proposal without the prior written consent of the Board of Directors);
_provided_ , that the Company shall as promptly as practicable provide to
Parent any nonpublic information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries
that is provided to a third party given such access which was not previously
provided to Parent or its Representatives, and (y) engage in discussions
or negotiations with the third party with respect to the Alternative
Proposal; _provided_ , that the Company shall as promptly as practicable
provide to Parent a copy of any Alternative Proposal made to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries; and 

(ii) in response to an Alternative Proposal, the Board of Directors may effect
a Change of Recommendation but only if prior to taking any such action:

(1) the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisers and outside legal counsel, that such Alternative
Proposal is a Superior Proposal (taking into account any adjustment or
revisions proposed by Parent in response to such Alternative Proposal
(including pursuant to clause (3) below));

 



-37-  (2) the Company has given Parent at least four (4) Business Days prior
written notice of its intention to effect a Change of Recommendation (the "
_Negotiation Period_ ") and has contemporaneously provided to Parent a copy of
such Superior Proposal and each of the relevant proposed
transaction agreements to be entered into by the Company with the third party
making such Superior Proposal;

(3) during the Negotiation Period, the Company has negotiated in good faith
with Parent to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to
revise the terms and conditions of this Agreement and/or the terms of the
Financing, and either (x) prior to the expiration of the Negotiation Period,
Parent shall not have proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, or (y) if Parent within such period shall have proposed revisions
to the terms of this Agreement, the Board of Directors, after consultation
with the Companys financial advisors and outside legal counsel, shall have
determined in good faith that the third partys Alternative Proposal remains a
Superior Proposal with respect to Parents revised proposal; _provided_ ,
that each time material modifications to the material terms of an Alternative
Proposal determined to be a Superior Proposal are made, the Negotiation Period
shall be extended for two (2) Business Days after written notification of
such change to Parent shall have been provided (which notification shall
include a copy or description of the Superior Proposal with such material
modifications);

 

(4) in light of such Superior Proposal, following the expiration of the
Negotiation Period, the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure of the
Board of Directors to effect a Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and 

(5) the Company shall not have breached in any material respect this Section
5.3; in which event, following the satisfaction of each of the foregoing
clauses (1) through (5), the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(h); _provided_ that prior to or substantially concurrent with such
termination the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.3 to the contrary, at any time
prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders, other
than in connection with an Alternative Proposal, the Board of Directors may
effect a Change of Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event, but
only if prior to taking any such action:

(i) the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors to
effect a Change of Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law (taking into
account any adjustment or revisions proposed by Parent (including pursuant to
clause (iii) below));

 



-38-  (ii) the Board of Directors has given Parent at least five (5) Business Days
prior written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall
specify in detail the basis for the Change of Recommendation;

(iii) during such five (5) Business Day period, the Company has negotiated,
and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent to
the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to revise the terms
of this Agreement in such a manner that would obviate the need for taking such
action; and

(iv) following such five (5) Business Day period, the Board of Directors shall
have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisers
and outside legal counsel, that the revisions proposed by Parent pursuant to
the foregoing clause (iii) would not obviate the need for a Change of
Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act,
or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its
position thereunder or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors to
make such disclosure would be inconsistent with the directors exercise of
their fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Law.

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Proposal_ " shall mean any bona
fide inquiry, proposal or offer made by any Person for (i) a merger,
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or similar transaction involving
the Company, (ii) the direct or indirect acquisition by any Person of twenty
percent (20%) or more of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, on a
consolidated basis, or (iii) the direct or indirect acquisition by any Person
of twenty percent (20%) or more of the voting power of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock, including any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning Shares with twenty
percent (20%) or more of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock.

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a written
Alternative Proposal, substituting "fifty percent (50%)" for "twenty percent
(20%)," that the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys financial advisers and outside legal counsel,
and considering such factors as the Board of Directors considers to be
appropriate, (x) to be more favorable to the Company and its stockholders than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (y) is reasonably likely
to be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all
financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of the proposal, including, to
the extent debt financing is required, whether such proposal is fully financed
by means of an executed customary commitment letter from a reputable Person
that has agreed to provide or cause to be provided the amounts set forth
therein or by preexisting debt facilities.

 



-39-  (i) As used in this Agreement, " _Intervening Event_ " shall mean a
fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (other than any event or
circumstance resulting from a breach of this Agreement by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries) that was not known to the Board of Directors as of or
prior to the date of this Agreement.

_Section 5.4_ _Filings; Other Actions_.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement (but no
later than 10 (ten) Business Days after the date hereof), subject to the
receipt from Parent and Merger Sub of the information described in the second
sentence of this clause (a), the Company shall prepare (in consultation with
Parent and after taking into account any comments made by Parent) and file
with the SEC (i) the Proxy Statement, which shall, subject to Section 5.3,
include the Recommendation and (ii) a Rule 13E-3 transaction statement on
Schedule 13E-3 (the " _Schedule 13E-3_ "), and shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments by
the SEC staff in respect of the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3 and to
cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish all information concerning
themselves and their Affiliates that is required to be included in the Proxy
Statement and the Schedule 13E-3, or that is customarily included in a proxy
statement or a Schedule 13E-3 prepared in connection with transactions of the
type contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall promptly notify Parent
upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any request
from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement
or the Schedule 13E-3 and shall provide Parent with copies of all
correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the
SEC and its staff, on the other hand, relating to the Proxy Statement or the
Schedule 13E-3. If at any time prior to the Company Meeting any information
relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors is discovered by the Company or Parent which should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Schedule
13E-3, so that the Proxy Statement, Schedule 13E-3 or the other filings shall
not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
no misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement or making the other filings (including the
Schedule 13E-3) (or, in each case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall
provide Parent an opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response and shall include in such document or response comments reasonably
proposed by Parent in good faith. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement
to be mailed to holders of Common Stock as of the record date established for
the Company Meeting as promptly as practicable, and in no event more than five
(5) Business Days after the date on which the SEC confirms that it has no
further comments on the Proxy Statement.

 



-40-  (b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall (i)
take all action necessary in accordance with the DGCL and its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders promptly following the mailing of the Proxy
Statement for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (the
" _Company Meeting_ "), with the record date and meeting date of the Company
Meeting to be selected after reasonable consultation with Parent, and (ii)
subject to a Change of Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.3, use all
reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the
approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 _Section 5.5_ _Employee Matters_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Company shall, and Parent shall
cause the Company to, honor all Company Benefit Plans, Company Foreign Plans
and compensation arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms
as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, provided that nothing
herein shall be construed as prohibiting the amendment or termination of any
of the foregoing in accordance with its terms. For a period of one year
following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be
provided, to each current and former employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (" _Company Employees_ ") (i) base compensation and bonus
opportunities (taking into account equity-based compensation granted by
Parent or its Affiliates, which, for the avoidance of doubt, does not include
any equity granted in connection with a Rollover Investment), that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than were provided to the Company Employee
immediately before the Effective Time and (ii) all other compensation and
benefits (excluding equity-based compensation) that are no less favorable in
the aggregate than were provided to the Company Employee immediately before
the Effective Time. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, (A) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide to each Company Employee whose employment terminates during the one-
year period following the Effective Time severance benefits equal to the
severance benefits provided for under the Companys severance arrangements in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) during such one-year
period following the Effective Time, severance benefits offered to each
Company Employee shall be determined without taking into account any reduction
after the Effective Time in compensation paid to such Company Employee.

 

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the
Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited
with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as
such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for
such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan or Company Foreign Plan in
which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate
immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided that the foregoing shall not
apply with respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan
or to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any and all 

 



-41-   New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a
Company Benefit Plan or Company Foreign Plan in which such Company Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company
Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been
waived under the comparable plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in
which such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or
her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plans
ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New
Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.

(c) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans or the Company Foreign Plans,
as applicable, will occur at or prior to the Effective Time, as applicable.

 

(d) If the Company has not paid the annual bonuses in respect of calendar year
2012 based on the Companys Annual 2012 Performance Incentive Program a
summary of the material terms of which is described on Section 5.5(d) of the
Company Disclosure Letter (" _2012 Annual Bonuses_ ") prior to the Effective
Time, then, no later than February 15, 2013, Parent shall cause to be paid to
each Company Employee who is employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and who participates in a
Company annual bonus or incentive plan in respect of calendar year 2012,
such Company Employees 2012 Annual Bonus based on actual performance levels;
_provided_ , _however_ , that senior management of the Company as of the date
of this Agreement may determine in its sole discretion to reduce or eliminate
the 2012 Annual Bonus for any Company Employee whose employment with the
Company terminates prior to the payment of the 2012 Annual Bonuses.

_Section 5.6_ _Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take
promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to
be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all
things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to
consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary
actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, approvals, and
expirations or terminations of waiting periods, including the Specified

action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the
defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions 

 



-42-   contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to pay prior to the Effective
Time any fee, penalty or other consideration to any third party for any
consent or approval required for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any contract or agreement.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided (including for the
avoidance of doubt Section 5.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter) and
without limiting the foregoing, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i)
promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date
hereof, file any and all required Notification and Report Forms under the HSR
Act with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and such filings Parent and the Company shall agree upon, and with
respect to such filings, Parent and the Company shall request early
termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, and use all
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act, (ii) use all reasonable best
efforts to cooperate with each other in (x) determining whether any filings
are required to be made with, or consents, permits, authorizations, waivers,
clearances, approvals, and expirations or terminations of waiting periods are
required to be obtained from, any third parties or other Governmental Entities
in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (y) promptly, but in
no event later than twenty (20) Business Days after the date hereof, making
the filing under the Irish Competition Act of 2002 as amended, and under the
Italian Competition Law (Law No. 287/1990),  _provided_ , that the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub respond promptly to any information requests regarding
the preparation of such filings, and any other such filings and timely
obtaining all applicable consents, permits, authorizations or approvals,
(iii) supply to any Governmental Entity as promptly as reasonably practicable
any additional information or documents that may be requested pursuant to any
Law or by such Governmental Entity, and (iv) take, or cause to be taken, all
other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby, including taking all such further action as
may be reasonably necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the United
States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice or competition authorities of any other nation or other
jurisdiction or any other Person may assert under any Law with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the End Date); _provided_
, that notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement
shall require or obligate Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to,
and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, without the prior
written consent of Parent, (x) propose, negotiate, commit to or effect, by
consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture,
licenses or disposition of any assets, products, rights, services, licenses
or businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or any interest or interests therein or (y) otherwise take or
commit to take any actions that after the Closing Date would limit the
freedom of Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporations)
or Affiliates freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain,
one or more of its or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporations) businesses, products, services, rights, licenses, product lines
or assets or any interest or interests

 



-43-   therein if such action would (a) be reasonably likely to have a material
adverse effect on the business, financial condition, properties, assets or
results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole
or (b) materially impair the benefits, taken as a whole, Parent reasonably
expected to derive from the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and _provided_ , _further_ that neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall become subject to, or consent or agree to or
otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition,
understanding, agreement or order of a Governmental Authority to sell, to
hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate,
invest or otherwise change the assets or business of the Company or any of its
Affiliates, unless such requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or
order is binding on the Company only in the event that the Closing occurs.
Except as otherwise permitted under this Agreement (including for the
avoidance of doubt Section 5.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter), the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall not (and shall cause their Subsidiaries
and Affiliates not to) take or agree to take any action that would be
reasonably likely to prevent or materially delay the Closing.

(c) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate and consult with each
other in connection with the making of all registrations, filings,
notifications, communications, submissions, and any other material actions
pursuant to this Section 5.6, and subject to applicable legal limitations and

Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall keep each other apprised on a
current basis of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
transactions contemplated thereby, including promptly furnishing the other

Entity with respect to such transactions. Subject to applicable Law relating
to the exchange of information, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and
Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall permit counsel for the other party
reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith the
views of the other party in connection with, any proposed notifications or
filings and any written communications or submissions, and with respect to any
such notification, filing, written communication or submission, any documents
submitted therewith to any Governmental Entity; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that materials may be redacted (x) to remove references concerning the
valuation of the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or proposals
from third parties with respect thereto, (y) as necessary to comply
with contractual agreements, and (z) as necessary to address reasonable
privilege or confidentiality concerns. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub agrees not to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion, either
in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in connection with
the proposed transactions unless it consults with the other party in advance
and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 5.6, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Law, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
shall cooperate in all respects with each other and shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents

 



-44-   or restricts consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 5.6 shall limit a
partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or
Section 7.1(c) so long as such party has, prior to such termination, complied
with its obligations under this Section 5.6. 

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 5.6, the Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, (i) of any notice
or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if the
subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain
such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, (ii) of any Actions commenced or, to such partys knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or otherwise affecting such party or any of
its Affiliates in connection with, arising from or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Transaction Litigation_
") or (iii) if such party becomes aware of any facts or circumstances that
such party believes do, or with the passage of time are reasonably likely to,
constitute a breach of this Agreement by the other party or the occurrence or
non-occurrence, of any event that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to cause any condition to the obligations of any party
hereto to effect the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement not to be satisfied; _provided_ that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 5.6(e) shall not cure any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement or otherwise limit or
affect the remedies available hereunder to any party hereto.

_Section 5.7_ _Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition" or other form of antitakeover statute or regulation shall
become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub and the members of their respective Boards of
Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 _Section 5.8_ _Public Announcements_. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub will
consult with and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment
upon any press release or other public statement or comment prior to the
issuance of such press release or other public statement or comment relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein and shall not issue
any such press release or other public statement or comment prior to such
consultation except as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or as
may be requested by a Governmental Authority; _provided_ that the
restrictions in this Section 5.8 shall not apply to any Company communication
regarding an Alternative Proposal or a Change of Recommendation. Parent and
the Company agree to issue a joint press release announcing this Agreement.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing in favor of
the current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be,

in any agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect. For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys and
any Company Subsidiarys certificates of incorporation and bylaws or similar
organizational documents as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with
any of their respective directors, officers or employees as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect
the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were
current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification
in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such
period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of
such claim. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall assume, be jointly
and severally liable for, and honor, guaranty and stand surety for, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance
with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this Section
5.9.

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance
funds in respect of each of the foregoing) each current and former director,
officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each Person
who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise (each, together with such Persons heirs,
executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs or
expenses (including advancing reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid
in settlement (collectively, " _Losses_ ") in connection with any actual or
threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising out of,
relating to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged
to have occurred whether before or after the Effective Time in connection with
such Indemnified Partys service as a director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (including acts or omissions in connection with such
Indemnified Partys service as officer, director, member, trustee or other
fiduciary in any other entity if such services was at the request or for the
benefit of the Company); _provided_ , that any Person to whom any funds are
advanced pursuant to the foregoing must provide an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification. In the event of any such Action, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any
such Action.

 



-46-  (c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising
on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the
Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess
of 250% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date
hereof in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto,
but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for
such amount. At the Companys option, the Company may purchase, prior to the
Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions
providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters
arising on or before the Effective Time, covering without limitation the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not pay in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid by the
Company prior to the date hereof in respect of such "tail" policy. If such
"tail" prepaid policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and
effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored
by the Surviving Corporation, and no other party shall have any further
obligation to purchase or pay for insurance hereunder.

 

(d) Parent shall cause to be paid all reasonable expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 5.9.

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other organization
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. The
provisions of this Section 5.9 shall survive the consummation of the Merger
and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Parties.

(f) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.9.

 

 _Section 5.10_ _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the Companys operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
operations.

 



-47-  _Section 5.11_ _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, or cause to be
obtained, the proceeds of the Financing on the terms and conditions described
in the Commitment Letters, including (i) maintaining in effect the Commitment
Letters, (ii) negotiating definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing (the " _Definitive Agreements_ ") consistent in all material
respects with the terms and conditions contained therein (including, as
necessary, the "flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter) or, if
available, on other terms that would not adversely impact the ability of
Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii)
satisfying all conditions applicable to Parent and its Subsidiaries to
obtaining the Financing. In the event that all conditions contained in the
Commitment Letters (other than, with respect to the Debt Financing, the
availability of the Equity Financing) have been satisfied, Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Lenders, Equity Investors and the
Rollover Investors to fund the Financing required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related fees and
expenses on the Closing Date (including by seeking to enforce its rights under
the Financing Commitments and Definitive Agreements in the event of a breach
by the other parties thereto). Parent shall comply with its obligations, and
enforce its rights, under the Commitment Letters in a timely and diligent
manner. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any material breach by
any party to the Commitment Letters of which Parent has become aware or any
termination of any of the Commitment Letters. Parent shall not, without the
prior written consent of the Company, (A) permit any amendment or modification
to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, or replace, the
Commitment Letters if such amendment, modification, waiver, or replacement (w)
would (i) add new (or adversely modify any existing) condition to the
Financing Commitments or otherwise adversely affect the ability or likelihood
of Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or (ii) make the timely funding of the Debt Financing or
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing less likely to
occur, (x) reduces the amount of the Debt Financing such that the aggregate
funds that would be available to Parent and Merger Sub at the Closing (taking
into account the Equity Financing and the Rollover Investment) would not
be sufficient to satisfy Parents and Merger Subs obligations to pay the
Merger Consideration and any fees and expenses of or payable by Parent, Merger
Sub or the Surviving Corporation unless the Equity Financing and/or the
Rollover Investment is increased by a corresponding amount, (y) adversely
affects the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against other parties to
the Commitment Letters or the Definitive Agreements as so amended, replaced,
supplemented or otherwise modified, relative to the ability of Parent to
enforce its rights against such other parties to the Commitment Letters as in
effect on the date hereof or in the Definitive Agreements or (z) could
reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (B)
terminate any Commitment Letter, unless such Commitment Letter is replaced in
a manner consistent with the foregoing clause (A). Upon any such amendment,
supplement or modification of the Debt Financing Commitments in accordance
with this Section 5.11(a), the term "Debt Financing Commitments" shall mean
the Debt Financing Commitments as so amended, supplemented or modified. In
the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable,
regardless of the reason therefor, Parent will (1) use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event and in any event no later than the last day of the Marketing Period,
alternative debt financing (in an amount sufficient, when taken together with
other sources of funds available to Parent, including additional equity
financing or rollover investments, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related fees and expenses) on
substantially equivalent or more favorable terms from the same or other
sources and which would not prevent, impede or materially delay and would not
reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation
of the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(2) promptly notify the Company of such unavailability and the reason
therefor. In furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the
event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, regardless
of the reason therefor, but the bridge facilities contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter (or alternative bridge facilities obtained in accordance
with this Section 5.11(a)) are available on the terms and conditions described
in the Debt Commitment Letter (or replacements thereof), then Parent shall
cause the proceeds of such bridge financing to be used in lieu of such
contemplated Debt Financing. For the purposes of this Agreement, the terms
"Debt Commitment Letter" and "Debt Financing Commitments" shall be deemed to
include any commitment letter (or similar agreement) or commitment with
respect to any alternative financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any
Debt Commitment Letter and Debt Financing Commitment remaining in effect at
the time in question). In the event that any portion of the Equity Financing
becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, Parent will (1) use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable following
the occurrence of such event and in any event no later than the last day of
the Marketing Period, alternative equity financing (in an amount sufficient,
when taken together with other sources of funds available to Parent, including
additional debt financing or rollover investments, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related fees and
expenses) on substantially

 



-48-   equivalent or more favorable terms from the same or other sources and which
would not prevent, impede or materially delay and would not reasonably be
expected to prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the
Equity Financing or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (2)
promptly notify the Company of such unavailability and the reason therefor.
For the purposes of this Agreement, the terms "Equity Commitment Letter" and
"Equity Financing Commitments" shall be deemed to include any commitment
letter (or similar agreement) or commitment with respect to any alternative
financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any Equity Commitment Letter
and Equity Financing Commitment remaining in effect at the time in question).
Parent shall provide the Company with prompt oral and written notice of (1)
any material breach or default by any party to any Commitment Letters or the
Definitive Agreements of which Parent becomes aware and (2) the receipt of any
written notice or other written communication from any Lender, Equity
Investor, Rollover Investor or other financing source with respect to any
breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Commitment
Letters or the Definitive Agreements of any provision thereof. Parent shall
keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the
status of its efforts to consummate the Financing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, compliance by Parent with this Section 5.11 shall not relieve
Parent of its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement whether or not the Financing is available. 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its officers, employees, consultants,
agents, advisors, Affiliates and other representatives (" _Representatives_
"), including legal and accounting, to provide all cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing
(including any offering or private placement of debt securities), including
(i) furnishing Parent and the Lenders as promptly as practicable (and in any
event in the case of quarterly or annual financial statements
required pursuant to this Section 5.11(b) that have not

 



-49-   been delivered to Parent prior to the date hereof, by a date that is not
later than (A) 45 days after the end of the relevant fiscal quarter in respect
of unaudited quarterly financial statements required pursuant to this Section
5.11(b) and (B) 90 days after the end of the relevant fiscal year in respect
of audited financial statements required pursuant to this Section 5.11(b), as
applicable) with financial information and other pertinent information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested (and
updated as reasonably requested) by Parent to consummate the Financing and is
customary to be included in (x) marketing materials for senior secured or
unsecured indebtedness (or any documentation or deliverables in connection
therewith) or (y) an offering document relating to a private placement of
secured or unsecured high-yield debt securities under Rule 144A of the
Securities Act, including data and other information that would be included
customarily in such marketing materials and offering document (including the
information required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities
Act for registered offerings of debt securities (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall include the financial statements and pro forma financial
information required by Item 9.01 of Form 8-K for the Companys recently
completed acquisition of Archives.com)), and all information and data that
would be necessary for an investment bank to receive customary (for high yield
debt securities) "comfort" (including "negative assurance" comfort) from
independent accountants in connection with such offering (all such
information in this clause (i), together with all such other information
required by the Debt Financing Commitments, the " _Required Information_ ";
_provided_ that the Required Information shall not include, and Parent shall
be responsible for, any post-Closing or pro forma cost savings, synergies,
capitalization, ownership or other post-Closing pro forma adjustments desired
to be incorporated into any information used in connection with the Debt
Financing), (ii) participating in a reasonable number of meetings (including
customary one-on-one meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers or
agents for, and prospective lenders and purchasers of, the Financing
and senior management, representatives or advisors, with appropriate
seniority and expertise, of the Company), presentations, road shows, due
diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies in
connection with the Financing, and assisting with the preparation of
materials for rating agency presentations, roadshow presentations, offering
memoranda, bank information memoranda and similar documents required in
connection with the Debt Financing and otherwise reasonably cooperate in the
marketing efforts related to the Debt Financing, (iii) using reasonable best
efforts to obtain consents and customary comfort letters of independent
accountants (including "negative assurance" comfort), legal opinions, surveys
and title insurance as reasonably requested by Parent as necessary and
customary for financings similar to the Financing (including any offering or
private placement of debt securities pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act), (iv) using reasonable best efforts to assist in the
preparation of a customary confidential information memorandum for the
facilities and other customary marketing materials to be used in connection
with the syndications reasonably deemed necessary by the lead arranger of the
Debt Financing to complete a successful syndication pursuant to the terms of
the Debt Commitment Letter, (v) using reasonable best efforts to help the
Company procure a public corporate credit rating and a public corporate
family rating in respect of the relevant borrower under the facilities
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter from Standard and Poors Ratings
Services (" _S andP_") and Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (" _Moody s_"),
respectively, and public ratings for any of the facilities or notes issued in
connection with the Debt Financing from each of SandP and Moodys, (vi) assist
in the preparation of one or more credit or other agreements, as well as any
pledge and security documents, and other definitive financing documents,
collateral filings or other certificates

 



-50-   or documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent (including a
certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company with respect to
solvency matters of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis)
and otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, the delivery of stock certificates and stock
powers with respect to outstanding shares of Subsidiaries of the
Company prior to the Closing Date to be held in escrow pending the Closing)
and taking all necessary corporate or other entity actions to facilitate all
of the foregoing, (vii) at least three Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, providing all documentation and other information about the Company as
is reasonably requested by the Lenders with respect to applicable "know your
customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations including without
limitation the USA PATRIOT Act, provided that the request by Parent for such
information is received by the Company at least five (5) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, and (viii) arranging for the repayment on the Closing
Date of all of the Companys and its Subsidiaries existing secured bank and
unsecured notes facilities (including the Existing Credit Facility) and using
reasonable best efforts to obtain customary pay-off letters, lien
terminations, title transfers, and instruments of discharge or transfer
relating to any collateral to be delivered at the Closing Date; _provided_ in
each case that none of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be required to
enter into any agreement that is not contingent upon the Closing. The
foregoing notwithstanding, (A) neither the Company nor any Persons who are
directors of the Company shall be required to pass resolutions or consents to
approve or authorize the execution of the Debt Financing, (B) no obligation of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives under any certificate, document or instrument executed
pursuant to the foregoing shall be effective until the Closing and (C) none of
the Company or its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Representatives
shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any
other cost or expense that is not simultaneously reimbursed by Parent in
connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Closing. Nothing contained in
this Section 5.11(b) or otherwise shall require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, prior to the Closing, to be an issuer or other obligor with
respect to the Debt Financing. Parent shall, promptly upon request by
the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives in connection with such cooperation and shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives for and against any and all Losses actually suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing, any
action taken by them at the request of Parent pursuant to this Section
5.11(b) and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than
information provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries).

(c) If the Company at any point believes that it has delivered the Required
Information in accordance with this Section 5.11, it may deliver to Parent a
written notice to such effect, in which case the Company shall be deemed to
have delivered the Required Information unless Parent shall provide to Company
within five (5) Business Days a written notice describing in reasonable detail
what information that constitutes Required Information the Company has not
delivered.

(d) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company
or its Subsidiaries obtained by Parent or its Representatives pursuant to
this Section 5.11(d) shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and
its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Financing.

 _Section 8.4_ _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict
of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other

immune

 



-58-   from the jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced
in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to

or otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law,
any claim that (x) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in
an inconvenient forum, (y) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (z) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing and without limiting Section 8.4(a), each of
the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause
of action, claim, cross-claim or third party claim of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the Lenders or any Lender Related Party in any way relating
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way
to the Debt Commitment Letter or any other letter or agreement related to any
Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other than any State
or Federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York.

_Section 8.5_ _Specific Enforcement_. 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Each party agrees that,
subject to Section 8.5(b), in the event of any breach or threatened breach by
any other party of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement,
the non-breaching party shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy
that may be available to it whether in law or equity, including monetary
damages) to seek to obtain (a) a decree or order of specific performance to
enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation, and
(b) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties
hereby acknowledge and agree that the Company shall be entitled to specific
performance to cause Parent to draw down the full proceeds of the Equity
Financing pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Equity Commitment
Letters and to cause Parent to effect the Closing in accordance with Section
1.2, in each case, only if (i) all conditions in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3
have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied by actions to be taken at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions, and other than those conditions
the failure of which to be satisfied is caused by a breach by Parent or
Merger Sub of their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement), (ii) the Debt Financing (or alternative
financing in accordance with Section 5.11) has been funded or will be funded
on the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2
upon consummation of the Rollover Investment and the delivery of a drawdown
notice by Parent and/or notice from Parent that the Equity Financing will be
funded at such date, (iii) Parent and/or Merger Sub fails to complete the
Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to
Section 1.2 and (iv) the Company has confirmed in writing that if specific
performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded
and the Rollover Investment is consummated, then the Closing will occur.

 



-59-  (c) Each party further agrees that, subject to Section 8.5(b) (x) they will
not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that the other Party has an
adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity and (y) no other party or
any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or
similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any
remedy referred to in this Section 8.5, and each party irrevocably waives any
right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such
bond or similar instrument.

(d) While the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance under
this Section 8.5 and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee under Section
7.3(b), under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to
receive both (i) a grant of specific performance that permits the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (ii) monetary damages in
connection with this Agreement or any termination of this Agreement, including
all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee.

_Section 8.6_ _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. WITHOUT LIMITING SECTION 8.14 HEREOF,

_Section 8.11_ _Amendments; Waivers_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of
the Company or the sole stockholder of the Merger Sub, any provision of this
Agreement may be amended (by action taken or authorized by their respective

effectiveness of such amendment or waiver shall be subject to the approval of
the stockholders of the Company or the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, as
applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company
