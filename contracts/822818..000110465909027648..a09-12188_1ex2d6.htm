#### (ii) If Parent has not completed the Financing by the Original Closing
Date and the Outside Date has been postponed in accordance with subsection
(i) of the definition of Outside Date [Regulatory Approvals not obtained],
Parent shall purchase (or designate and cause one or more of its Subsidiaries
to purchase), and Eveready shall cause its appropriate Subsidiaries to sell,

the Cat Tech Purchase Price and the Pembina Assets for the Pembina Purchase
Price within one week after the receipt of any required Regulatory Approvals

#### 

  

##### (A) on the closing date for the Cat Tech Purchase and/or the Pembina
Purchase, as applicable, (x) all of the representations and warranties of
Eveready contained in Section 3.1 shall be true and complete in all material
respects (unless the failure or failures of all such representations and
warranties to be so true and correct in all respects would not reasonably be
expected to have an Eveready Material Adverse Effect), (y) insofar as the
representations of Eveready contained in Section 3.1 relate to the Cat Tech
Assets and/or the Pembina Landfill Assets, such representations and
warranties shall additionally be true and complete as if Eveready had made
such representations and warranties solely with respect to the Cat Tech
Assets and/or the Pembina Landfill Assets, as applicable, to be acquired, and
relative to the size thereof, as though the Cat Tech Assets and/or the
Pembina Landfill Assets, as applicable,

  



        
   

  



  

##### consisted of a business independent of the other assets and business of
Eveready (unless the failure or failures of all such representations and
warranties to be so true and correct in all respects would not reasonably be
expected to have an Eveready Material Adverse Effect, as adjusted relative to
the size thereof), and (z) Parent shall have received a certificate of
Eveready addressed to Parent dated such closing date, signed on behalf of
Eveready by two senior executive officers of Eveready (on EvereadyÂ’s behalf
and without personal liability) confirming the accuracy of the statements in
clauses (x) and (y) as of such closing date;

  

##### 

  

##### (B) on the closing date for the Cat Tech Purchase and/or the Pembina
Purchase, as applicable, any required Regulatory Approvals or other third
party consents or approvals (including, without limitation, under the
Eveready Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) shall have been obtained
(provided that if such Regulatory Approvals or other third party consents or
approvals have not been obtained by the Original Closing Date for one or both
of the Cat Tech Purchase or the Pembina Purchase, Parent shall be obligated
to complete any such purchase on the Original Closing Date for which all such
Regulatory Approvals or other third party consents or approvals have been
obtained by such date and shall, in accordance with clause (ii) of this
Section 2.4(c), be obligated to complete any other such purchase following
such Regulatory Approvals or other third party consents or approvals having
been obtained; and

  

##### 

  

##### (C) by not later than the Original Closing Date, Eveready shall have
held the Eveready Meeting and obtained the Required Vote in favor of the
Arrangement, provided that Eveready shall not be required to hold the
Eveready Meeting or obtain the Required Vote in favour of the Arrangement if
this Agreement has been terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.2(c)(iv)
[ParentÂ’s inability to complete financing] or by Eveready pursuant to Section
8.2(d)(i) [ParentÂ’s failure to deliver Letter of Credit] or Section
8.2(d)(iii) [ParentÂ’s breach] (it being mutually acknowledged that the
obligations under this Section 2.4(c) shall survive any such termination of
this Agreement).

  

##### 

  

#### (iv) Eveready shall, on the closing date for the Cat Tech Purchase
and/or the Pembina Purchase, as applicable, cause the Subsidiaries whose
equity interests are being transferred as part of the Cat Tech Purchase
and/or the Pembina Purchase, as applicable, and the respective assets of such
Subsidiaries to be released from any Indebtedness or Liens (including,
without limitation, any Indebtedness or Liens now outstanding under the
Eveready Amended and Restated Credit Agreement or any net Indebtedness
owed to, or held by, any other Subsidiary of Eveready either under any
promissory notes or any other instruments of Indebtedness) except with
respect to any Pembina or Cat Tech capital lease obligations under capital
leases (which are not cross-defaulted with the capital leases or other
Indebtedness of any other Person), Permitted Liens and any Liens (including
those related to the royalty interest granted to Kenneth Byram) on the assets
of the Persons that comprise the Pembina Landfill Assets registered against
those assets on the date hereof with the exclusion of those relating to the
Eveready Amended and Restated Credit Facility.

  

#### 

  

#### (v) EvereadyÂ’s obligation to complete the transactions contemplated by
this Section 2.4(c) shall be subject to the condition that any required
Regulatory Approvals or other third party consents or approvals (including,
without limitation, under the Eveready Amended and Restated Credit Agreement)
shall have been obtained.

  



         
 

  

#### 

  

#### (vi) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither Eveready
nor Parent will be obligated to complete any one of the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.4(c) which has not been completed by the
Outside Date if any required Regulatory Approval or other third party consent
or approval (including, without limitation, under the Eveready Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement) for such transaction which remains to be closed
has not been obtained with respect to such transaction by the Outside Date.

  

#### 

  

#### (vii) Parent covenants and agrees that it shall apply for and use all
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all Regulatory Approvals required
for it to complete the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.4(c)
and, in doing so, keep Eveready reasonably informed as to the status of
the proceedings related to obtaining the Regulatory Approvals, including
providing Eveready with copies of all related applications and notifications
in draft form (other than confidential information contained in such
applications and notifications), in order for Eveready to provide its
reasonable comments thereon; provided, however, that nothing in this
Agreement shall require Parent or its Affiliates to divest or hold separate
or otherwise take or commit to take any action to obtain any such Regulatory
Approval.

  

#### 

  

#### (viii) In the event the Cat Tech Purchase and/or the Pembina Purchase,
as applicable, shall occur, each of Parent and Eveready shall take, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to take, all such further actions and
execute and deliver all such further documents as shall be necessary
and appropriate as if the Cat Tech Purchase and/or the Pembina Purchase,
as applicable, were being made under a separate purchase and sale
agreement containing customary terms and conditions for a similar transaction
on an armÂ’s length basis and without giving consideration to the other terms
of this Agreement.

  

#### 

  

### (d) Parent shall, by not later than 5:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the date
that is two Business Days after the date of this Agreement, deliver to
Eveready an irrevocable letter of credit, in the form agreed to between
Parent and Eveready prior to the execution of this Agreement, for $5.0
million from Bank of America, N.A. (the " **Letter of Credit** "). Eveready
shall return the Letter of Credit to Parent if either (i) the Arrangement or
the Cat Tech Purchase and the Pembina Purchase closes or (ii) all Regulatory
Approvals and other third party consents required for any one of the
transactions contemplated by this Section 2.4(c) which remains to be closed
shall not have been obtained by the Outside Date, unless this Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with the following sentence. If Parent defaults
in its obligations to close either the Arrangement or the Cat Tech Purchase
and the Pembina Purchase in accordance with Section 2.4(c), (i) Eveready
will be entitled to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section
8.2(d)(i) and call on the Letter of Credit, and (ii) if Eveready so elects,
sue for specific performance on ParentÂ’s obligations to complete the Cat Tech
Purchase and the Pembina Purchase in accordance with Section 2.4(c). If both
the Cat Tech Purchase and the Pembina Purchase thereafter close, Parent
will receive on the closing of both such transactions (if both such closings
occur on the same date) or the later of the closings of such transactions (if
such closings occur on different dates) credit for the $5.0 million drawn
on the Letter of Credit against the Cat Tech Purchase Price and/or the
Pembina Purchase Price, as applicable. If (i) Parent defaults in its
obligations to complete the Cat Tech Purchase or the Pembina Purchase, but
(ii) Eveready elects not to sue for specific performance or the Cat Tech
Purchase or the Pembina Purchase do not thereafter close for some other
reason (but all Regulatory Approvals and other third party consents required
for the Cat Tech Purchase or the Pembina Purchase, as applicable,

  



        
   

  



  

### shall have been obtained by the Outside Date), Eveready will be entitled
to retain the $5.0 million as liquidated damages relating to the Cat Tech
Purchase and the Pembina Purchase.

  

### 

  

### (e) If the Arrangement closes on either the Original Closing Date or
another Closing Date pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Articles of
Arrangement will on that date be filed with the Registrar and, upon the
issuance of a Certificate by the Registrar, the Articles of Arrangement will
implement the Plan of Arrangement as of the Effective Time. As of the
Effective Time, each Eveready Share outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be exchanged, the Eveready Options and Eveready Deferred
Shares will be redeemed for cancellation and the Eveready Debentures will be
repurchased all on the terms provided in the Plan of Arrangement, and the
Arrangement will, from and after the Effective Time, have all of the effects
provided by applicable Laws, including the ABCA.

  

###

Subject to compliance with Section 2.6, as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Eveready will prepare the
Eveready Circular together with any other documents required by the ABCA,
Securities Laws or other applicable Laws in connection with the
Eveready Meeting required to be filed or prepared by Eveready, and, subject
to Section 2.6(b) as promptly as is reasonably practicable after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, Eveready will, unless otherwise
agreed by the Parties, cause the Eveready Circular and other documentation
required in connection with the Eveready Meeting to be sent to the Eveready
Shareholders and filed as required by the Interim Order and applicable Laws.
 The Eveready Circular will include the recommendation of the Board that the
Eveready Shareholders vote in favour of the Arrangement Resolution
unless such recommendation has been withdrawn, modified or amended in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

 **Section 2.6.** ** ****_Preparation of Filings_**

  

 ** **

  

### (a) The Parties will co-operate in the preparation of any application for
the Regulatory Approvals and any other orders, registrations, consents,
filings, rulings, exemptions, no-action letters and approvals and the

to discharge their respective obligations or otherwise advisable under
applicable Laws in connection with the Arrangement and this Agreement as
promptly as practicable hereafter.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Parties will co-operate in the preparation, filing and mailing of
the Eveready Circular. Eveready will provide Parent and its representatives
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Eveready Circular,
including by providing on a timely basis a description of any information
required to be supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Circular, prior to its
mailing to Eveready Shareholders and filing in accordance with the Interim
Order and applicable Laws. Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that whether or
not such comments are appropriate or any revisions will be made as a
result thereof to the Eveready Circular will be determined solely by Eveready
acting reasonably.

  

### 

  

### (c) Eveready will ensure that the Eveready Circular complies with the
Interim Order and all applicable Laws and, without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, that the 

  



        
   

  



  

### Eveready Circular does not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading in light of
the circumstances under which they are made (other than with respect to any
information relating to and provided by Parent, Purchaser or their
Affiliates). Eveready will promptly inform Parent of any requests or comments
made by Securities Authorities in connection with the Eveready Circular.

  

### 

  

### (d) Parent will furnish to Eveready such information concerning Parent,
Purchaser or their Affiliates as may be reasonably required by Eveready in
the preparation of the Eveready Circular and other documents related thereto,
and Parent will ensure that the information supplied by it for inclusion in
the Eveready Circular will, at the time of the mailing of the Eveready
Circular, not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements contained therein not misleading in light of the
circumstances under which they are made.

  

### 

  

### (e) Each of the Parties will, in the case of Eveready only with respect
to Eveready and in the case of Parent and Purchaser only with respect to
Parent and Purchaser, promptly notify the other if at any time before the
Effective Time it becomes aware that the Eveready Circular, an application
for a Regulatory Approval or any other order, registration, consent, ruling,
exemption, no-action letter or approval, any registration statement or any
circular or other filing under applicable Laws contains an untrue statement
of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading
in light of the circumstances under which they are made, or of information
that otherwise requires an amendment or supplement to the Eveready Circular,
such application, registration statement, circular or filing, and the Parties
will co-operate in the preparation of such amendment or supplement as
required, including the distribution and filing of such amendment or
supplement by Eveready.

  

### 

  

### (f) Parent shall use reasonable efforts to obtain all orders required
from the applicable Securities Authorities to permit the issuance and first
resale of the Parent Common Shares issued, indirectly, to the Eveready
Shareholders pursuant to the Arrangement without qualification with or
approval of or the filing of any registration statement or prospectus, or the
taking of any proceeding with, or the obtaining of any further order, ruling
or consent from any Governmental Entity under any United States or Canadian
federal, state, provincial or territorial securities or other Laws or
pursuant to the rules and regulations of any Securities Authority
administering such Laws or the fulfillment of any other legal requirement in
any such jurisdiction. However, in the case of the Eveready Management
Shareholders, the first resale of the Parent Common Shares received by such
shareholders shall be subject to the "lock-up" and potential manner of sale
restrictions set forth in the Voting and Lock-Up Agreements.

  

### 

  

### (g) Eveready will advise Parent as Parent may reasonably request and at
least on a daily basis on each of the last seven Business Days prior to the
Eveready Meeting, as to the aggregate tally of the proxies received by
Eveready (including voting reports prepared by Broadridge) in respect of the
Arrangement Resolution and any other matters to be considered at the Eveready
Meeting.

  



        
   

  



  

### (h) Eveready will give notice to Parent of the Eveready Meeting and allow
ParentÂ’s representatives and legal counsel to attend the Eveready Meeting.

  

### 

  

 **Section 2.7.** ** ****_Court Proceedings_**

  

 ** **

  

Eveready will provide Parent and its legal counsel with
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon drafts of all material to
be filed with the Court in connection with the Arrangement, including by
providing on a timely basis a description of any information required to be
supplied by Parent for inclusion in such material, prior to the service and
filing of that material, and will accept the reasonable comments of Parent
and its legal counsel. In addition, Eveready will not object to legal
counsel to Parent making such submissions on the hearing of the motion for
the Interim Order and the application for the Final Order as such counsel
considers appropriate, provided that Eveready is advised of the nature of any
submissions on a timely basis prior to the hearing. Eveready will also provide
legal counsel to Parent on a timely basis with copies of any notice of
appearance and evidence served on Eveready or its legal counsel in respect of
the application for the Final Order or any appeal therefrom.  Except as
required by applicable Laws, Eveready will not file any material with the
Court in connection with the Arrangement or serve any such material, and will
not agree to modify or amend materials so filed or served, except as
contemplated hereby or with ParentÂ’s prior written consent, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that nothing herein will
require Parent to agree or consent to any increased purchase price or other
consideration or other modification or amendment to such filed or served
materials that expands or increases ParentÂ’s or PurchaserÂ’s obligations set
forth in any such filed or served materials.

  



  

 **Section 2.8.** ** ****_Public Communications_**

  

 ** **

  

Eveready and Parent shall consult with each other prior to issuing any press
releases or otherwise making public announcements with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement. Neither
Eveready nor Parent will issue any press release or otherwise make public
statements with respect to this Agreement or the Arrangement without the
prior written consent of the other Party (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); Eveready will not make any filing with any
Governmental Entity or with the Toronto Stock Exchange (the " **TSX** ") with
respect thereto without prior consultation with Parent; and Parent will not
make any filing with any Governmental Entity or with any stock exchange with
respect thereto without prior consultation with Eveready.  However, the
foregoing provisions of this Section 2.8 will be subject to each PartyÂ’s
overriding obligation to make any disclosure or filing required under
applicable Laws, and the Party making any such disclosure or filing will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to give prior oral or written notice to
the other Party and reasonable opportunity for the other Party to review or
comment on the disclosure or filing (other than with respect to confidential
information contained in such disclosure or filing), and, if such prior
notice is not possible, to give such notice immediately following the making
of any such disclosure or filing.

Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Eveready
is delivering to Parent the Disclosure Letter required to be
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, which is deemed to constitute an
integral part of this Agreement and to modify or supplement, as applicable,
the representations and warranties of Eveready contained in this Agreement.
Eveready will not be in breach of this Agreement as a result of a
representation or warranty being inaccurate or incomplete if, by virtue of
any disclosure in any part of the Disclosure Letter or of this Agreement, the
true facts with respect to the representation or warranty have been disclosed
with particularity and the relevant facts are described in reasonable detail.
Eveready represents and warrants to and in favour of Parent and Purchaser as
follows and acknowledges that Parent and Purchaser are relying upon such
representations and warranties in connection with entering into this
Agreement:

  



  

### (a) _Board Approval_.  As of the date hereof, the Board, after
consultation with its financial and legal advisors, has determined
unanimously that the Arrangement is fair to the Eveready Shareholders and is
in the best interests of Eveready and has resolved unanimously to recommend
to the Eveready Shareholders that they vote their Eveready Common Shares in
favour of the Arrangement.

owned and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Eveready and
each of its Subsidiaries is duly registered or otherwise authorized to do
business and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the character of
its properties, owned, leased, licensed or otherwise held, or the nature of
its activities makes such registration necessary, except where the failure to
be so registered or in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an Eveready Material Adverse Effect
or prevent or materially delay the Arrangement.  Correct, current and
complete copies of the articles of incorporation, continuance or amalgamation
and by-laws (or the equivalent organizational documents), each as amended to
date, of Eveready and each of its Subsidiaries listed in Section 3.1(g) of
the Disclosure Letter (collectively, the " **Eveready Organizational
Documents** ") have been made available to Parent and its advisors.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. Eveready has the requisite
corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to carry out
its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Eveready and the consummation by Eveready of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement have been duly authorized by the Board, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of Eveready are necessary to authorize the execution
and delivery by it of this Agreement or any agreement ancillary hereto and
the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
subject, in the case of

  



        
   

  



  

### completion of the Arrangement, to the receipt of the Required Vote and
approval by the Court. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
by Eveready and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Eveready

qualification that such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other laws of general application relating to
or affecting rights of creditors and that equitable remedies, including
specific performance, are discretionary and may not be ordered.

  

### 

  

### (d) _No Violations_.  Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Eveready, nor the consummation of the Arrangement by Eveready,
nor compliance by Eveready with any of the provisions hereof will:

  

### 

  

#### (i) except as described in Section 3.1(d) of the Disclosure Letter, and
subject to obtaining waivers or refinancing as of the Effective Time of the
outstanding debt of Eveready or its Subsidiaries as contemplated in Section
5.4(d), and except where it would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have an Eveready Material Adverse Effect, violate,
conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, require any
consent, approval or notice under, or constitute a default (or an event which
with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default)

to come due before its stated maturity or cause any credit commitment to
cease to be available or cause any payment or other obligation to be imposed
on Eveready or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of (A) the respective charters or by-laws or other comparable
organizational documents of Eveready and its Subsidiaries or (B) any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, loan agreement, deed of trust, Lien, or
other Contract to which Eveready or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or to
which Eveready or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
properties or assets may be subject or by which Eveready or any of its
Subsidiaries is bound; or

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) subject to obtaining the Regulatory Approvals and the Required Vote

the exception of 251,726 outstanding Eveready Common Shares currently held by

which will vest to such employees in accordance with the terms of such Plan
including the past practices and policies of Eveready and Predecessor, there
are no other options, warrants or other rights, shareholder rights plans,
agreements or commitments of any character whatsoever requiring or which may
require the issuance, sale or transfer by Eveready of any shares of Eveready
(including Eveready Common Shares) or any securities convertible into, or
exchangeable or exercisable for, or otherwise evidencing a right to acquire,
any shares of Eveready (including Eveready Common Shares).

and non-assessable. All securities of Eveready (including the Eveready Common
Shares, the Eveready Options, the Eveready Deferred Shares, and the Eveready
Debentures) have been issued in compliance, in all material respects, with
all applicable Securities Laws.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) Other than the Eveready Options, the Eveready Deferred Shares, and
the Eveready Debentures, there are no securities of Eveready or of any of its
Subsidiaries outstanding which have the right to vote generally (or are

vote generally) with the Eveready Shareholders on any matter. Except as
contemplated by the Plan of Arrangement, there are no outstanding contractual
or other obligations of Eveready to (A) repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any of its securities, other than as provided in the Trust Indenture
and the certificates representing the Eveready Debentures, or (B) make any
investment in or provide any funds to (whether in the form of a loan, capital
contribution or otherwise) any Person, other than a wholly-owned Subsidiary
of Eveready.

  

#### 

  

### (f) _Reporting Status and Securities Laws Matters_. Eveready is a
"reporting issuer" and not on any list of reporting issuers in default under
applicable Securities Laws and is in compliance in all material respects with
all applicable Securities Laws. No delisting of, suspension of trading in or
cease trading order is in effect with respect to any securities of Eveready
and, to the knowledge of Eveready, except as described in writing by Eveready
to Parent, no inquiry or investigation (formal or informal) of any Securities
Authority is ongoing or expected to be implemented or undertaken with respect

disclosure requirements under any Securities Laws.

  



         
 

  

### 

  

### (g) _Ownership of Subsidiaries_. Section 3.1(g) of the Disclosure Letter
sets forth a complete and accurate list and/or chart of all
Subsidiaries owned, directly or indirectly, by Eveready, each of which is
wholly-owned except as otherwise noted in such list or chart. All of the
outstanding shares of capital and other ownership interests in each of
EvereadyÂ’s Subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable, and all such shares and other ownership interests held
directly or indirectly by Eveready are, except pursuant to restrictions on
transfer contained in constating documents or pursuant to existing financing
arrangements involving Eveready or its Subsidiaries, owned free and clear of
all Liens other than Permitted Liens and subject to no proxy, voting trust or
other agreement relating to the voting of such shares, and there are no
outstanding Contracts regarding the right or obligation to acquire any such
shares of capital or other ownership interests in or real properties of any
of EvereadyÂ’s Subsidiaries. Except as set out in section 3.1(g) of the
Disclosure Letter, there are no outstanding contractual or other obligations
of any Subsidiaries of Eveready to (i) repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any of their respective securities or with respect to the voting or
disposition of any outstanding securities of any Subsidiaries of Eveready, or
(ii) make any investment in or provide any funds to (whether in the form of a
loan, capital contribution or otherwise) any Person, other than a wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Eveready.

  

###

filed by them with the Canadian Securities Authorities
(collectively, including any other reports filed with the Canadian Securities

and warranties in connection with entering into this Agreement:

  



  

### (a) _Organization and Qualification_.  Parent and each of its
Subsidiaries (including Purchaser) is a corporation duly incorporated or an
entity duly created and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction
of incorporation or creation and has the requisite corporate or other power
and authority to own its assets as now owned and to carry on its business as
it is now being conducted. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries (including
Purchaser) is duly registered or otherwise authorized to do business and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the character of
its properties, owned, leased, licensed or otherwise held, or the nature of
its activities makes such registration necessary, except where the failure to
be so registered or in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or
prevent or materially delay the Arrangement. All of the issued and
outstanding securities or other ownership interests of each of Parent and
Purchaser are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. Each of Parent and Purchaser
has the requisite corporate authority to enter into this Agreement and to
carry out its obligations hereunder. The execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement and the consummation by each of Parent and Purchaser of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by
their respective boards of directors, and no other corporate proceedings on
the part of either Parent or Purchaser are necessary to authorize the
execution and delivery by it of this Agreement and the consummation by it of
the transactions contemplated thereby. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by each of Parent and Purchaser and constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of Parent and Purchaser enforceable against each of
them in accordance with its terms, subject to the qualification that
such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization
or other laws of general application relating to or affecting rights of
creditors and that equitable remedies, including specific performance, are
discretionary and may not be ordered.

  

### 

  

### (c) _No Violations_.  Neither the execution nor delivery of this
Agreement by Parent and Purchaser, nor the consummation of the Arrangement by
Parent and Purchaser, nor compliance by Parent and Purchaser with any of the
provisions hereof will:

  

### 

  

#### (i) violate, conflict with, or result in a breach of any material
provision of, require any consent, approval or notice under, or constitute a
default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default) under (A) the articles of incorporation or by-laws
governing Parent or Purchaser or (B) subject to obtaining waivers or
refinancing as of the Effective Time of the outstanding debt of Parent and
its Subsidiaries as described in Section 5.4(d), any material contract or
other instrument or obligation to which

  



        
   

  



  

#### Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or to which any of them, or
any of their respective properties or assets, may be subject or by which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is bound and, in each case, individually or
in the aggregate would materially adversely affect ParentÂ’s or PurchaserÂ’s
ability to perform its respective obligations under this Agreement, or
subject to obtaining the Regulatory Approvals, violate any Law applicable to
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or
assets; or

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) subject to obtaining the Regulatory Approvals and, assuming

for 195,943 such shares were then exercisable).

of its Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations convertible to,
exchangeable into, or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to
subscribe for or acquire, any securities of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations evidencing such rights are
authorized, issued or outstanding.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) Parent does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or
other obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or which are
convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with

#### 

  

#### (iv) The Parent Common Shares to be issued, indirectly, to the Eveready
Shareholders in accordance with the Arrangement will, when issued,

Parent and Purchaser and the consummation by Parent and Purchaser of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement, except where
the failure to make any such notice, report or filing or obtain any such

no Taxes are owing or eligible under any of the Parent Plans. All
contributions or premiums required to be made or paid by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, under the terms of each Parent Plan or by
applicable Laws have been made in a timely fashion in accordance with
applicable Laws in all material respects and in accordance with the terms of
the Parent Plans.

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) Each Parent Plan is insured or funded as may be required by
applicable Law and in good standing with such Governmental Entities as may be
applicable and, as of the date hereof, no currently outstanding notice of
under-funding, non-compliance, failure to be in good standing or otherwise
has been received by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from any such
Governmental Entities. No Parent Plan provides any non-pension post-
retirement or post-employment benefits. Except as described in note 15 to
ParentÂ’s audited financial statements as at and for the three years ended
December 31, 2008 which are included in the Parent Reports, none of the
Parent Plans are pension plans. None of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
would incur any material withdrawal liability from withdrawing from any

  



        
   

  



  

#### multiemployer plan. Parent has an effective reservation of rights for
each non-pension post-retirement or post-employment benefit plan which allows
Parent to amend or terminate such plan, subject to applicable Law.

  

#### 

  

#### (v) No Parent Plan is subject to any pending investigation, examination
or other proceeding, action or claim initiated by any Governmental Entity, or
by any other party (other than routine claims for benefits), and, to the
knowledge of Parent, there exists no state of facts which after notice or
lapse of time or both would reasonably be expected to give rise to any such
investigation, examination or other proceeding, action or claim or to affect
the registration or qualification of any Parent Plan required to be
registered or qualified.

  

#### 

  

#### (vi) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent or
consummation of the Arrangement or compliance by Parent with any of the
provisions hereof will result in any payment (including severance,
unemployment compensation, bonuses or otherwise) becoming due to any director
or employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or result in any increase or
acceleration of contributions, liabilities or benefits, or acceleration of
vesting, under any Parent Plan or restriction held in connection with a
Parent Plan.

  

#### 

  

### (q) _Compliance with Laws_.  Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have
complied, in all material respects, with and are not, in any material
respect, in violation of any applicable Laws. None of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of Parent, any of their
respective directors, executives, representatives, agents or employees (i)
has used or is using any corporate funds for any illegal contributions,
gifts, entertainment or other unlawful expenses relating to political
activity, (ii) has used or is using any corporate funds for any direct or
indirect unlawful payments to any foreign or domestic governmental officials
or employees, (iii) has violated or is violating any provision of the United
States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, (iv) has established or
maintained, or is maintaining, any unlawful fund of corporate monies or other
properties, or (v) has made any bribe, unlawful rebate, unlawful payoff,
influence payment, kickback or other unlawful payment of any nature.

each of its Subsidiaries is covered by valid and currently
effective insurance policies issued in favour of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries that Parent reasonably has determined to be prudent, taking into
account the industries in which Parent and its Subsidiaries operate, and as
is sufficient to comply with applicable Law. Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, with respect to each insurance policy issued
in favour of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or pursuant to which Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries is a named insured or otherwise a beneficiary under
an insurance policy (i) the policy is in full force and effect and
all premiums due thereon have been paid, (ii) neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries is in breach or default, and neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries has taken any action or failed to take any action which,
with notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such a breach or default,
or permit termination or modification of, any such policy, (iii) to
the knowledge of Parent, no insurer on any such policy has been declared
insolvent or placed in receivership, debt restructuring proceedings or
liquidation, and no notice of cancellation or termination has been received
by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any such policy, (iv) to
the knowledge of Parent, none of such policies will terminate or lapse by
reason of

  



         
 

  



  

### the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (v) no insurer under any
such policy has cancelled or generally disclaimed liability under any such
policy or indicated any intent to do so or not to renew any such policy, (vi)
there is no claim by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pending under any such
policy that has been denied or disputed by the insurer, and (vii) all claims
under such policies have been filed in a timely fashion.

  

### 

  

### (s) _Property_.

  

###

licenses, easements and rights of way, except for such failure of title or
default in respect of such real property interests, leases, licenses,
easements and rights of way as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) The properties and buildings and improvements thereon necessary to
permit the operation of the current businesses of each of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are in good operating condition and repair, subject to normal
wear and tear. To the knowledge of Parent, there are no latent defects
affecting any such property or the buildings or improvements thereon, other
than those that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

#### 

  

### (t) _Intellectual Property_.  (i) Parent and its Subsidiaries own all
right, title and interest in and to, or are validly licensed (and are not in
material breach of such licenses) to use, all patents, trade-marks, trade
names, service marks, copyrights, know-how, trade secrets, software,
technology, and all other intellectual property and proprietary rights that
are material to the conduct of the business, as presently conducted, of
Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (collectively, the " **Parent
Intellectual Property Rights** "); (ii) all such Parent Intellectual
Property Rights are sufficient for conducting the business, as presently
conducted, of Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; (iii) to the
knowledge of Parent, all such Parent Intellectual Property Rights are valid
and enforceable and do not infringe in any material way upon any third
partiesÂ’ intellectual property and proprietary rights, and no event will

invalid or unenforceable any such Parent Intellectual Property Rights; (iv)
to the knowledge of Parent, no third party is infringing upon such Parent
Intellectual Property Rights in any material respect; (v) all hardware,
software and firmware, processed data, technology infrastructure and other

are not in material breach of such licenses) such Parent Technology and have
commercially reasonable virus protection and security measures in place in
relation to such Parent Technology; and (vii) Parent and its Subsidiaries
have reasonable back-up systems and a disaster recovery plan adequate to
ensure the continuing availability of the functionality provided by the
Parent Technology, and have ownership of or a valid license to the Parent
Intellectual Property Rights necessary to allow them

  



        
   

  



  

### to continue to provide the functionality provided by the Parent
Technology in the event of any malfunction of the Parent Technology or other
form of disaster affecting the Parent Technology.

  

### 

  

### (u) _Material Contracts_.

  

### 

  

#### (i) None of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of
Parent, any of the other parties thereto, is in breach or violation of, or
default (in each case, with or without notice or lapse of time or both)
under, any contract material to it and none of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries has received or given any notice of default under any
such material contract which remains uncured and, to the knowledge of Parent,
there exists no state of facts which after notice or lapse of time or both
would constitute a default or breach of any such material contracts. All such
material contracts are in good standing and in full force and effect without
modification (written or oral) thereto and Parent or one of its Subsidiaries
is entitled to all benefits thereunder.

  

####

reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, none of
Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of Parent, any of the

case, with or without notice or lapse of time or both) under, any contract
(other than the material contracts referred to in Section 4.1(u)(i)
above) and none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has received or given
any notice of default under any such contract which remains uncured, and, to
the knowledge of Parent, there exists no state of facts which after notice or
lapse of time or both would constitute a default or breach of such contract.

 ** **

  

No investigation by or on behalf of, or knowledge of, Eveready or any of its
Affiliates will mitigate, diminish or affect the representations
or warranties made by Parent and Purchaser in this Agreement or any

aware of: (i) anything that causes any of the representations or warranties
of Parent set out in this Agreement to be materially untrue or inaccurate; or

Purchaser set out in this Agreement. The representations and warranties of
Parent contained in this Agreement will expire and be terminated on the

is terminated in accordance with its terms.  This Section 4.2 will not limit
any covenant or agreement of Parent or Purchaser which, by its terms,
contemplates performance after the Effective Time or the date on which this
Agreement is terminated, as the case may be.

### 

  

 **Section 5.2.** ** ****_Pre-Acquisition Transactions_**

  

 ** **

  

### (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Eveready agrees to (i) at ParentÂ’s
expense, cooperate with and provide reasonable assistance to Parent in
connection with ParentÂ’s planning for and implementation of any such
reorganizations of the business, operations, assets or corporate structure of
Eveready and its Subsidiaries as Parent may request, acting reasonably (each
a " **Pre-Acquisition Transaction** "), and (ii) at ParentÂ’s expense, use
commercially reasonable efforts to implement in advance of the Effective Time
any Pre-Acquisition Transaction as reasonably requested by Parent. At
ParentÂ’s option, such Pre-Acquisition Transactions may include, without
limitation, (i) formation of new Eveready Subsidiaries, (ii) merger,
amalgamation or consolidation of existing Eveready Subsidiaries, (iii)
transfer of securities in, or assets held by, existing Eveready Subsidiaries
either by sale, dividend or contribution, and (iv) filing of any elections
required or permitted under applicable Tax Laws relating to such
transactions. However, Eveready will not be required to implement any such
Acquisition Transaction prior to the Effective Time unless it determines to
its satisfaction, acting reasonably, that (A) such implementation will not
delay or prevent consummation of the Arrangement (including by giving rise to
litigation by third parties); (B) such implementation will not have an
adverse impact on the Eveready Shareholders or holders of the Eveready
Debentures; and (C) the Arrangement will be consummated and the Effective
Time will occur immediately following the completion of such Pre-Acquisition
Transaction.  Parent agrees that any Pre-Acquisition Transaction that is
implemented at ParentÂ’s request in advance of the Effective Time will not be
considered in determining whether a representation or warranty of Eveready
under this Agreement has been breached.

  

### 

  

### (b) To the extent that a Pre-Acquisition Transaction requires approval of
the Eveready Shareholders under the ABCA, Eveready shall at ParentÂ’s expense,
(i) seek approval of the Eveready Shareholders for such Pre-Acquisition
Transaction at the Eveready Meeting, (ii) include in the Eveready Circular a
form of special resolution of the Eveready Shareholders (the "
**Transaction Resolution** ") approving such Pre-Acquisition Transaction in
form and substance acceptable to Parent, acting reasonably, either included
within the Arrangement Resolution or separate from the Arrangement Resolution
if so requested by Parent, and (iii) include in the Eveready Circular
the unanimous recommendation of the Board that the Eveready Shareholders vote
in favour of the Transaction Resolution, provided that Parent and Purchaser
agree to amend the provisions of this Agreement requiring Eveready to take
certain action by specified times, including such provisions contained in
Sections 2.1 and 2.3, to the extent necessary to facilitate the foregoing.
Subject to the provisions of this Section 5.2, the provisions in this
Agreement regarding EvereadyÂ’s obligations respecting the approval of the
Arrangement Resolution shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to the approval of the
Transaction Resolution.

  



        
   

  



  

### (c) Subject to the provisions of Sections 5.2(a) and 5.2(b), the Parties
will work cooperatively and use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare
prior to the Effective Time all documentation necessary and do such other
acts and things as are necessary to give effect to any Pre-Acquisition
Transactions. Subject to the provisions of Sections 5.2(a) and 5.2(b), the
Parties shall give effect to any Pre-Acquisition Transactions immediately
before the Effective Time and shall seek to have them become effective
immediately before the Effective Time (but after Parent shall have confirmed
that all conditions in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 have been satisfied or waived by
Parent and Eveready shall have confirmed that all conditions in Sections 6.1
and 6.3 have been satisfied or waived by Eveready). In no event shall
completion of any Pre-Acquisition Transactions be a condition to completion
of the Arrangement.

  

### 

  

 **Section 5.3.** ** ****_Covenants of Eveready Regarding the Arrangement_**

  

 ** **

  

Eveready will perform, and will cause its Subsidiaries to perform,
all obligations required or desirable to be performed by Eveready or any of
its Subsidiaries under this Agreement, co-operate with Parent and Purchaser
in connection therewith, and do all such other acts and things as may be
necessary or desirable in order to consummate and make effective, as soon as
reasonably practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Eveready will and, where
appropriate, will cause its Subsidiaries to:

  



  

### (a) except as specifically permitted by Section 7.2, use all commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the Required Vote;

  

### 

  

### (b) unless this Agreement will have been terminated in accordance with
Section 8.2, submit this Agreement to the Eveready Shareholders at the
Eveready Meeting even if the Board will have withdrawn, amended, modified or
qualified its recommendation of this Agreement or the Arrangement;

  

### 

  

### (c) use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary
waivers, consents and approvals required to be obtained by Eveready or a
Subsidiary in connection with the Arrangement from other parties to the
Contracts and, in connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any
Person (other than a Governmental Entity) with respect to any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, (i) without the prior written consent of
Parent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, not pay or commit to
pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or
other consideration, or make any commitment or incur any liability or other
obligation to such Person for such approval or consent, and (ii) not request
of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to pay or commit to pay to any Person
(other than a Governmental Entity) whose approval or consent is being
solicited any cash or other consideration, or make any commitment or incur
any liability or other obligation to such Person for such approval or
consent;

  

### 

  

### (d) use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect all necessary
registrations, filings and submissions of information required by
Governmental Entities from Eveready or any of its Subsidiaries relating to
the Arrangement;

  



        
   

  



  

### (e) apply for and use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all
Regulatory Approvals relating to Eveready or any of its Subsidiaries which
are typically applied for by a Person being acquired and, in doing so, keep
Parent reasonably informed as to the status of the proceedings related to
obtaining the Regulatory Approvals, including providing Parent with copies of
all related applications and notifications (other than confidential
information contained in such applications and notifications), in draft form,
in order for Parent to provide its comments thereon; provided, however, that
nothing in this Agreement shall require Eveready or its Affiliates to divest
or hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action with respect
to any asset, property or agreement of Eveready or any of its Subsidiaries in
order to obtain any such Regulatory Approval;

  

### 

  

### (f) waive the Eveready Shareholders Rights Plan with respect to this
Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (with
such Plan to be terminated at the Effective Time in accordance with the Plan

Proposal from such Person and such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal;

  

##### 

  

##### (B) Eveready will have complied with all other requirements of this

##### 

  

##### (C) the Board, after consultation with and based upon the advice of its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under all applicable Laws;

  

##### 

  

##### (D) in the case of clause (ii) of this Section 7.2(d), prior to
providing any information or data to such Person in connection with such
Acquisition Proposal, the Board receives from such Person an
executed confidentiality agreement having substantially the same terms as
the Confidentiality Agreement and, taken as a whole, being no less favourable
to Eveready than the Confidentiality Agreement (provided that such
confidentiality agreement, if not existing on the date hereof, may not
preclude Eveready from complying with the provisions of this Agreement and
may not include any provision calling for an exclusive right to negotiate
with Eveready and may not prohibit Eveready from providing information to
Parent regarding the Acquisition Proposal), and Eveready sends a copy of any
such confidentiality agreement to Parent promptly upon its execution and
Parent is immediately provided with a list of, or in the case of information
that was not previously made available to Parent, copies of or access to, any
information provided to such Person; and

  

##### 

  

##### (E) in the case of clause (ii) of this Section 7.2(d), prior to

##### 

  

### (e) Nothing contained in this Section 7.2 will prohibit the Board from
making any disclosure to Eveready Shareholders prior to the Effective Time
if, in the good faith judgment of the Board, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, such disclosure is necessary for the Board to act in a manner
consistent with its fiduciary duties or is otherwise required under
applicable Law.

  

### 

  

### (f) Eveready will, within five (5) Business Days, promptly publicly
reaffirm its recommendation of this Agreement and the Arrangement after any
Acquisition Proposal that is not a Superior Proposal is publicly announced or
made.

  

### 

  

### (g) Nothing contained in this Section 7.2 will limit in any way the
obligation of Eveready to convene and hold the Eveready Meeting in accordance
with Section 2.2 of this Agreement unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Article VIII.

  



        
   

  



  

 **Section 7.3.** ** ****_Right to Match_**

  

 ** **

  

### (a) Subject to Section 7.3(b), Eveready covenants that it will not
accept, approve, recommend or enter into any agreement, understanding,
arrangement or Contract in respect of a Superior Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement permitted by Section 7.2(d)) unless:

  

### 

  

#### (i) Eveready has complied with its obligations under Section 7.2 and the
other provisions of this Article VII and has provided Parent with a copy of
the Superior Proposal; and

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) a period (the " **Response Period** ") of five Business Days will
have elapsed from the date on which Parent received written notice from the
Board of Directors of Eveready that the Board of Directors of Eveready
determined, subject only to compliance with this Section 7.3, to accept,
approve, recommend or enter into a binding agreement to proceed with the
Superior Proposal. In the event that Eveready provides Parent with the notice
contemplated in this Section on a date that is less than five Business Days
prior to the Eveready Meeting, Eveready will be entitled to adjourn the
Eveready Meeting to a date that is not more than five Business Days after the
date of such notice.

  

#### 

  

### (b) During the first three Business Days of the Response Period, Parent
will have the right, but not the obligation, to offer to amend the terms of
this Agreement. The Board of Directors of Eveready will review any such
proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement, including an
increase in, or modification of, the consideration to be received by the
Eveready Shareholders, to determine whether the Acquisition Proposal to which
Parent is responding would be a Superior Proposal when assessed against the
Arrangement as it is proposed by Parent to be amended. If the Board of
Directors of Eveready determines that the Acquisition Proposal would no
longer be a Superior Proposal if the Arrangement was so amended and Parent
and Purchaser enter into an amendment to this Agreement incorporating the
terms of the amended offer, the Board of Directors of Eveready will promptly
publicly reaffirm its recommendation of the Arrangement. If the Board of
Directors of Eveready determines, in good faith after consultation with its
financial advisors and its outside counsel, that the Acquisition Proposal
continues to be a Superior Proposal, Eveready may approve, recommend, accept
or enter into an agreement, understanding or arrangement to proceed with the
Superior Proposal.

  

### 

  

### (c) Each successive amendment to any Acquisition Proposal that results in
an increase in, or modification of, the consideration (or value of such
consideration) to be received by the Eveready Shareholders will constitute a
new Acquisition Proposal for the purposes of this Section 7.3 and Parent will
be afforded a new Response Period in respect of each such Acquisition
Proposal.

  

### 

  

### (d) Eveready shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that
the directors and officers of Eveready and each of its Subsidiaries and any
investment bankers, counsel or other advisors, representatives or agents
retained by Eveready are aware of, and abide by, the provisions of Sections

 ** **

  

### (a) Notwithstanding any other provision relating to the payment of fees

##### 

  

#### (ii) if

  

#### 

  

#### (A) after the date hereof and prior to the termination of this
Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal will have been made or proposed
to Eveready or otherwise publicly announced (which has not been withdrawn),
or a Person has publicly announced an intention to do so (which has not been
withdrawn),

  

#### 

  

#### (B) any of the facts set out in Section 8.2(c)(i) (A) through (D) exist
after the date hereof and prior to the termination of this Agreement, and

  

#### 

  

#### (C) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or Eveready pursuant
to Section 8.2(b)(ii) [Required Vote not obtained],

  

#### 

  

#### Eveready will pay to Parent the Eveready Termination Fee within two
Business Days of such termination, plus ParentÂ’s Expense Reimbursement Costs
not to exceed $5.0 million as provided in Section 7.4(e) below; or

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) if Eveready terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.2(d)(ii) [Board approves agreement for Superior Proposal], Eveready will
pay to Parent the Eveready Termination Fee before or concurrently with such
termination (and payment of the Eveready Termination Fee will be a condition
to the effectiveness of such termination), plus ParentÂ’s Expense
Reimbursement Costs not to exceed $5.0 million as provided in Section 7.4(e)
below.

  

#### 

  

### (b) If either Parent or Eveready terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.2(b)(ii) [Required Vote not obtained], but not under the
circumstances described elsewhere in this Section 8.2, Eveready will pay to
Parent its Expense Reimbursement Costs not to exceed $5.0 million as provided
in Section 7.4(e) below.

  



        
   

  



  

### (c) If Eveready terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.2(d)(iii)
[ParentÂ’s breach], Parent will pay to Eveready a termination fee of $3.0
million (the " **Parent Termination Fee** ") within two Business Days of
such termination, plus EvereadyÂ’s Expense Reimbursement Costs not to exceed
$2.0 million as provided under Section 7.4(e) below, and if ParentÂ’s breach
relates to its obligations with respect to the Letter of Credit or the Cat
Tech Purchase or the Pembina Purchase, Eveready will be entitled, if
it elects to do so, to all of its rights referenced in Section 2.4(c)
and (d), including the right to call on the Letter of Credit and to pursue
specific performance of such Parent obligations as described in Section

### 

  

### (e) Expense Reimbursement Costs shall be paid not later than two Business
Days after delivery to the Party responsible for such payment of notice of
demand for payment and documented itemization setting forth in reasonable
detail all Expense Reimbursement Costs (which itemization may be supplemented
and updated from time to time until the thirtieth day after delivery of the
first notice of demand for payment), provided that no notice of demand for
payment may be made more than 60 calendar days following the termination of
this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (f) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section
7.4 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, neither Parent nor Eveready would have
entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if Eveready or Parent fails to
timely pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.4 and, in order to
obtain the payment, the Party who is owed such payment commences a suit which
results in a judgment against the other Party for the payment set forth in
this Section 7.4, the defaulting Party shall pay to the other Party its
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount due from each
day for which payment is due until the date of the payment at the prime rate
of the Bank of Canada in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made.

  

### 

  

 **Section 7.5.** ** ****_Fees and Expenses_**

  

 ** **

  

Except as provided in Section 7.4, each Party will pay all fees, costs and
expenses incurred by such Party in connection with this Agreement and the
Arrangement. For such purposes, the filing fees paid to Governmental Entities
in connection with applicable filings under the Competition Act and any
applicable antitrust laws of other jurisdictions shall be shared equally by
Parent and Eveready.

  



  

 **Section 7.6.** ** ****_Liquidated Damages, Injunctive Relief and No
Liability of Others_**

  

 ** **

  

Parent and Eveready acknowledge that all of the payment amounts set out in
Section 7.4 are payments of liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-
estimate of the damages Parent or Eveready will suffer or incur as a
result of the event giving rise to such payment and the resultant termination
of this Agreement and are not penalties. Parent and Eveready irrevocably
waive any

  



        
   

  



  

right to raise as a defense that any such liquidated damages are excessive or
punitive. For greater certainty, the Parties agree that, subject to Section
7.4, payment of the amount determined pursuant to this Article in the manner
provided in respect thereof is the sole monetary remedy of the
Party receiving such payment. Nothing contained herein will preclude a Party
from seeking injunctive relief in accordance with Section 9.3 to restrain any
breach or threatened breach of the covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement or otherwise to obtain specific
performance of any of such acts, covenants or agreements, without the
necessity of posting a bond or security in connection therewith. In the event
that either Parent or Eveready become liable to make a payment under Section
7.4, there will be no liability of any shareholder, director, officer,
employee, advisor or representative of Parent or Eveready or any Affiliate
thereof, whether to the other Party or any other Person (including any
shareholder, director, officer, employee, advisor or representative thereof)
in connection with any liability or other obligation of the Parent or
Eveready, and whether hereunder or otherwise in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

 **Section 7.7.** ** ****_Access to Information; Confidentiality_**

  

 ** **

  

### (a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement, subject to compliance with applicable Law and
the terms of any existing Contracts, Eveready will, and will cause its
Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, employees, independent
auditors, accounting advisers and agents to, afford to Parent and to its
officers, employees, agents, representatives, advisers and lenders such
access as Parent may reasonably request at all reasonable times, including
for the purpose of facilitating integration business planning, to their
officers, employees, agents, properties, books, records and Contracts, and
will furnish Parent with all data and information as Parent may reasonably
request. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and its representatives
(including its financing sources) will, upon reasonable prior notice, have
the right to conduct appraisal and environmental and engineering inspections
of each of the Properties, and to contact any third party to a Material
Contract to which Eveready or any of its Subsidiaries is a party; provided,
that no such inspections will be conducted in a manner which disrupts in any
material respect the normal course of business of Eveready at the applicable
Property. Parent and Eveready acknowledge and agree that information
furnished pursuant to this Section 7.7(a) will be subject to the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (b) Parent will provide Eveready and its employees, representatives,
agents and advisors with reasonable opportunity and access to investigate the
financial condition and operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries in order
for the officers and directors of Eveready to properly exercise their
fiduciary duty in evaluating the Parent Common Shares to be received by the
Eveready Shareholders pursuant to the Arrangement. Parent and its advisors
will cooperate with Eveready with respect to the investigation and, in that
regard, Eveready will, upon reasonable notice, have access at all reasonable
times to the facilities and personnel of Parent and its Subsidiaries. Parent
and Eveready acknowledge and agree that information furnished pursuant to
this Section 7.7(b) will be subject to the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (c) No investigation conducted pursuant to Section 7.7(a) or Section
7.7(b) shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
made by any Party hereto,

  



        
   

  



  

### and nothing in Section 7.7(a) shall require any Party to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment
of such Party would result in (i) a violation of any of its obligations with
respect to confidentiality if such Party shall have used reasonable efforts
to obtain the consent of any third party to such inspection or (ii) any
violation of Laws relating to the sharing of information between competitors,
it being understood that (A) the Parties will provide extracts, or summaries,
or aggregations or other information to the greatest extent practicable in a
manner that does not result in any such violation or improper disclosure and
(B) Eveready will provide certain information in accordance with, and subject
to, the confidentiality provisions of the McKinsey Agreement.

  

### 

  

 **Section 7.8.** ** ****_Insurance and Indemnification_**

  

 ** **

  

### (a) If the Arrangement shall become effective, Parent will, or will cause
Eveready and its Subsidiaries to, maintain in effect without any reduction in
scope or coverage for six years from the Effective Time customary policies of
directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance providing protection equal to or
better than the protection provided by the policies maintained by Eveready
and its Subsidiaries which are in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time and providing protection in respect of claims arising from facts or
events which occurred on or prior to the Effective Time; provided, however,
that Parent will not be required, in order to maintain such directorsÂ’ and
officersÂ’ liability insurance policy, to pay, or to cause Eveready and its
Subsidiaries to pay, an annual premium in excess of 250% of the cost of the
existing policies; and provided further that, if equivalent coverage cannot
be obtained or can only be obtained by paying an annual premium in excess of
250% of such amount, Parent will only be required to obtain, or to cause
Eveready and its Subsidiaries to obtain, as much coverage as can be obtained
by paying an annual premium equal to 250% of such amount. Furthermore, prior
to the Effective Time Eveready may, in the alternative, purchase run
off directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance for a period of up to six
years from the Effective Time provided that the premiums will not exceed 250%
of the premiums currently charged to Eveready for directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’
liability insurance.

  

### 

  

### (b) Parent agrees that it will directly honour all rights to
indemnification or exculpation now existing in favour of present and former
officers and directors of Eveready and its Subsidiaries which will survive
the completion of the Arrangement.

  

### 

  

### (c) The provisions of this Section 7.8 are intended for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by, each insured or indemnified Person described in
Section 7.8(a), his or her heirs and his or her legal representatives and,
for such purpose, the Parties hereby confirm that, in negotiating and
agreeing with the provisions of this Section 7.8, Eveready is acting as agent
and trustee on their behalf.

  

### 

  

 **Section 7.9.** ** ****_Exchange De-Listing_**

  

 ** **

  

Parent and Eveready will use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Eveready Common Shares to be de-listed from the TSX promptly following
the Effective Time.

  



        
   

  



  

 **Section 7.10.** ** ****_Tax Matters_**

  

 ** **

  

During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
Eveready and its Subsidiaries will:

  



  

### (a) prepare and timely file all Returns (which shall be correct and
complete in all respects) required to be filed by them on or before the
Effective Time (" **Post-Signing Returns** ") in a manner consistent, in
all material respects, with past practice, except as otherwise required
by applicable Laws;

  

### 

  

### (b) pay, withhold, collect and remit in a timely fashion all amounts of
Taxes required to be so paid, withheld, collected or remitted; and

  

### 

  

### (c) properly reserve (and reflect such reserve in their books and records
and financial statements) for all Taxes payable by them for which no Post-
Signing Return is due prior to the Effective Time in a manner consistent with
past practice.

  

### 

  

 **Section 7.11.** ** ****_Resignations_**

  

 ** **

  

Subject to confirmation that insurance coverage is maintained as contemplated
by Section 7.8, Eveready will obtain and deliver to Parent at the Effective
Time evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation effective
as of the Effective Time of those directors of Eveready designated by Parent
to Eveready in writing at least five calendar days prior to the Effective
Time.

### 

  

### (b) _Termination by Either Parent or Eveready_. This Agreement may be

Time:

  

### 

  

#### (i) if the Effective Time has not occurred on or prior to the Outside

any of its obligations has been a principal cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of the Effective Time to occur by such date; or

  



         
 

  



  

#### (ii) if the Required Vote is not obtained at the Eveready Meeting (or
any adjournment or postponement thereof); or

  

####

and such Law has become final and non-appealable.

  

#### 

  

### (c) _Termination By Parent_.  This Agreement may be terminated by Parent
at any time prior to the Effective Time:

  

### 

  

#### (i) if (A) the Board will have failed to recommend this Agreement or the

set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b), and which is not cured within
the earlier of (i) the Outside Date, and (ii) 15 Business Days following
receipt by Eveready of written notice from Parent of such breach, or which by
its nature or timing cannot be cured within such period; or

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) if the Eveready Meeting is cancelled, adjourned or postponed
except as agreed to by Parent in writing or as otherwise permitted in this
Agreement; or

  

####

Eveready the Parent Termination Fee in accordance with Section

### 

  

#### (i) Parent shall fail to deliver the Letter of Credit in accordance with

or

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) if the Board of Directors of Eveready approves, and authorizes
Eveready to enter into, an agreement providing for the implementation of a
Superior Proposal,

  



        
   

  



  

#### but only so long as: (A) the Board of Directors of Eveready has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that such definitive agreement constitutes a Superior
Proposal; (B) Eveready pays to Purchaser the Eveready Termination Fee in
accordance with Section 7.4 simultaneously with such termination (any
purported termination pursuant to this Section 8.2(d)(ii) being void and of
no force or effect unless Eveready will have made such payment); and (C)
Eveready shall have no right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.2(d)(ii) after the Required Vote for the Arrangement has been
obtained and Parent has completed the Cat Tech Purchase and/or the Pembina
Purchase to the extent then required by Section 2.4(c); or

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) if Eveready is not in material breach of any of its obligations

cured within such period.

  

#### 

  

### (e) _Effect of Termination_.  If this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section, this Agreement will
forthwith become void and of no further force or effect and no Party will
have any further obligations hereunder except as provided in Sections 2.4,
7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 9.2 and this Section 8.2(e) and the Confidentiality Agreement
and as otherwise expressly contemplated hereby.

  

### 

  

 **Section 8.3.** ** ****_Amendment_**

This Agreement will be governed, including as to validity, interpretation and
effect, by the laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada
applicable therein, and will be construed and treated in all respects as an
Alberta contract. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably attorns to the non-
exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of the Province of Alberta in respect of
all matters arising under and in relation to this Agreement and the
Arrangement. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE

NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

  



  

 **Section 9.3.** ** ****_Injunctive Relief_**

  

 ** **

  

The Parties agree that irreparable harm would occur in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached for which money damages would not
be an adequate remedy at law. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties will
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions and other equitable relief
to prevent breaches of this Agreement, with any requirement for the securing
or posting of any bond in connection with obtaining any such injunctive or
other equitable relief hereby being waived.

### (a) With the exception of the obligation to issue Parent Common Shares to
the Eveready Shareholders in exchange for their Eveready Common Shares, as
contemplated in the Plan of Arrangement, and provided it is acceptable to the
Court without the imposition of commercially unreasonable conditions or any
other conditions that would impede, prevent or materially delay the
completion of the transactions contemplated hereby by the Outside Date,
 Parent and Purchaser may assign all or any part of their respective rights
under this Agreement to, and their respective obligations under
this Agreement may be assumed by, a Subsidiary or Affiliate of Parent or
Purchaser, provided that if such assignment and/or assumption takes place,
Parent and Purchaser will continue to be liable jointly and severally with

Eveready shareholders and holders of Eveready Debentures shall not be

respect to Eveready Common Shares or Eveready Debentures other than the
consideration which they are entitled to receive pursuant to the terms of the
Arrangement.

  



  

3.5 **No Fractional Shares.** No fractional Parent Common Shares will be
issued.  The aggregate number of Parent Common Shares issued to an

Common Shares if the fractional entitlement is less than 0.5.

  



  

3.6 **Distribution with Respect to Undelivered Certificates.** All dividends

nature and the right of the holder of Eveready Common Shares or Eveready
Debentures represented by any such certificate to receive consideration
pursuant to this Arrangement shall be deemed to be surrendered to Parent
together with all dividends, distributions and any interest thereon held for
such holder.

  



        
   

  



  

3.8 **Withholding Rights.** Eveready, Parent, Purchaser, Depositary and
Trustee shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any dividend, price or
consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Eveready Common Shares,
Eveready Debentures, Eveready Options or Eveready Deferred Shares such
amounts as Eveready, Parent, Purchaser, the Depositary or the Trustee is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the Tax
Act, or any provision of federal, provincial, territorial, state, local or
foreign tax law, in each case, as amended. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof as
having been paid to the holder of the securities in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts
are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. Eveready,
Parent, Purchaser, the Depositary and the Trustee are hereby authorized to
sell or otherwise dispose of such portion of the consideration as is
necessary to provide sufficient funds to Eveready, Parent, Purchaser, the
Depositary or the Trustee, as the case may be, to enable it to comply with
such deduction or withholding requirement and Eveready, Parent, Purchaser,
the Depositary or the Trustee shall notify the holder thereof and remit to
such holder any unapplied balance of the net proceeds of such sale.
