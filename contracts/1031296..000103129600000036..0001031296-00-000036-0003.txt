Merger as one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.10 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

               ----------------------------------------
common stock, par value $2.50  per share, of GPU ("GPU Common Stock") that
is owned by GPU as treasury stock shall be canceled and cease to exist,
and no stock or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

          (c)  Conversion of GPU Common Stock.  Each share of GPU Common

Stock, other than Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.01(n)) and
shares canceled pursuant to Section 2.01(b), issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into
the right to receive (i) $36.50 in cash, without interest (the "Cash

Ratio (as defined below) or (iii) a combination of cash and shares as
provided in Sections 2.01(e), (g) and (h) below ((i), (ii) or (iii) as
applicable, the "Merger Consideration").  The "Exchange Ratio" shall be
                 --------------------          --------------
equal to the quotient (rounded to the nearest ten thousandth, or if there
is no nearest ten thousandth, the next higher ten thousandth) of the Cash
Consideration divided by the FirstEnergy Share Price (as defined below);
provided, however, that if the FirstEnergy Share Price is less than

$24.2438, the "Exchange Ratio" shall be 1.5055, and if the FirstEnergy
Share Price is greater than $29.6313, the "Exchange Ratio" shall be

typographical or other manifest errors in such reporting), over the 20
trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the fifth
Business Day (as defined in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the
"Exchange Act")) prior to the Election Deadline.  FirstEnergy shall make a
 ------------
public announcement of the Exchange Ratio and the Election Deadline (as
defined below) no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the fifth
Business Day prior to the date of the Election Deadline by issuing a
release to the Dow Jones News Service or similar U.S. news service.

          (d)  Cash Election.  Subject to the immediately following
               -------------
sentence, each record holder of shares of GPU Common Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be entitled to elect to receive cash,
without interest, for all or any part of such holder's shares of GPU
Common Stock (a "Cash Election").  Notwithstanding the foregoing and
                 -------------
subject to Section 2.01(l), the aggregate number of shares of GPU Common
Stock that will be converted into the right to receive cash in the Merger
(the "Cash Election Number") will be 50% of the total number of shares of
      --------------------
GPU Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.  Cash
Elections shall be made on a form reasonably acceptable to GPU and
FirstEnergy designed for that purpose (a "Form of Election").
                                          ----------------

          (e)  Oversubscribed Cash Election.  If the aggregate number of
               ----------------------------
shares of GPU Common Stock covered by Cash Elections (the "Cash Election
                                                           -------------
Shares") exceeds the Cash Election Number, (1) each Cash Election Share
------
shall be converted into (i) the right to receive an amount of cash,
without interest, equal to the product of (a) the Cash Consideration and
(b) a fraction (the "Cash Fraction"), the numerator of which shall be the
                     -------------
Cash Election Number and


<PAGE>

the denominator of which shall be the total number of Cash Election
Shares, and (ii) a number of shares of FirstEnergy Common Stock equal to
the product of (a) the Exchange Ratio and (b) a fraction equal to one
minus the Cash Fraction and (2) each Stock Election Share and each No
Election Share (each as defined below) shall be converted into the right
to receive a number of shares of FirstEnergy Common Stock equal to the
Exchange Ratio.

          (f)  Stock Election.  Subject to the immediately following
               --------------
sentence, each record holder of shares of GPU Common Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be entitled to elect to receive shares
of FirstEnergy Common Stock for all or any part of such holder's shares of
GPU Common Stock (a "Stock Election", and together with a Cash Election,
                     --------------
the "Election").  Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to Section
     --------
2.01(l), the aggregate number of shares of GPU Common Stock that will be
converted into the right to receive shares of FirstEnergy Common Stock in
the Merger (the "Stock Election Number") shall be 50% of the total number
                 ---------------------
of shares of GPU Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the Effective
Time.  Stock Elections shall be made on a Form of Election.

          (g)  Oversubscribed Stock Election.  If the aggregate number of
               -----------------------------
shares of GPU Common Stock covered by Stock Elections (the "Stock Election
                                                            --------------
Shares") exceeds the Stock Election Number, (1) each Stock Election Share
------
shall be converted into (i) the right to receive a number of shares of
FirstEnergy Common Stock, equal to the product of (a) the Exchange Ratio
and (b) a fraction (the "Stock Fraction"), the numerator of which shall be
                         --------------
the Stock Election Number and the denominator of which shall be the total
number of Stock Election Shares, and (ii) an amount of cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (a) the Cash Consideration and (b) a
fraction equal to one minus the Stock Fraction and (2) each Cash Election
Share and No Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive
an amount of cash, without interest, equal to the Cash Consideration.

          (h)  Undersubscribed Cash Election and Stock Election.  If (x)
               ------------------------------------------------
the aggregate number of Cash Election Shares is equal to or less than the
Cash Election Number and (y) the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares
                     ---
is equal to or less than the Stock Election Number, (1) each Cash Election
Share shall be converted into the right to receive an amount of cash,
without interest, equal to the Cash Consideration, (2) each Stock Election
Share shall be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of
FirstEnergy Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio and (3) each No
Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive (A) an amount
of cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the Cash
Consideration and (ii) a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be the
Cash Election Number less the number of Cash Election Shares and the (y)
denominator of which shall be the aggregate number of No Election Shares
and (B) a number of shares of FirstEnergy Common Stock equal to the
product of (i) the Exchange Ratio and (ii) a fraction (x) the numerator of
which shall be the Stock Election Number less the number of Stock Election
Shares and (y) the denominator of which shall be the aggregate number of
No Election Shares.

          (i)  Form of Election.  To be effective, a Form of Election must
               ----------------
be properly completed, signed and submitted to the Exchange Agent (defined
below), and accompanied by the certificates representing the shares of GPU
Common Stock ("GPU Certificates") as to which the election is being made
               ----------------
(or by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such GPU Certificate signed
by a firm that is a member of any registered national securities exchange
or a member of

<PAGE>

the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or a bank, broker,
dealer, credit union, savings association or other entity that is a member
in good standing of a recognized Medallion Program approved by the
Securities Transfer Association Inc.).  FirstEnergy shall have the
discretion, which it may delegate in whole or in part to the Exchange
Agent, to determine whether Forms of Election have been properly
completed, signed and submitted or revoked and to disregard immaterial
defects in Forms of Election.  The decision of FirstEnergy (or the
Exchange Agent) in such matters shall be conclusive and binding.  Neither
FirstEnergy nor the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify
any person of any defect in a Form of Election submitted to the Exchange
Agent.  The Exchange Agent shall also make all computations contemplated
by Sections 2.01(e), (g) and (h), and all such computations shall be
conclusive and binding on the holders of shares of GPU Common Stock
(absent manifest error).

          (j)  Deemed Non-Election.  For the purposes hereof, a holder of
               -------------------
shares of GPU Common Stock who does not submit a Form of Election that is
received by the Paying Agent prior to the Election Deadline (as defined in
Section 2.01(k)) (the "No Election Shares") shall be deemed not to have
                       ------------------
made a Cash Election or Stock Election.  If FirstEnergy or the Exchange
Agent shall determine that any purported Election was not properly made
prior to the Election Deadline, the shares subject to such improperly made
Election shall be treated as No Election Shares.

          (k)  Election Deadline.  Not more than 90 days nor less than 20
               -----------------
Business Days prior to the Election Deadline, FirstEnergy shall cause
copies of the Form of Election, together, in the case of holders of GPU
Common Stock who became such after the record date for the meeting
referred to therein, with a copy of the Joint Proxy Statement (as defined
in Section 3.05), to be mailed to the holders of record of GPU Common
Stock (as of a record date as close as practicable to the date of mailing
and mutually agreed by GPU and FirstEnergy).  FirstEnergy shall use best
efforts to make the Form of Election, together with a copy of the Joint
Proxy Statement, available to all persons who become record holders of GPU
Common Stock subsequent to the record date with respect to such mailing
and prior to the Election Deadline. A Form of Election must be received by
the Exchange Agent by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day
prior to the Effective Time (the "Election Deadline"), in order to be
                                  -----------------
effective.  All Elections may be revoked until the Election Deadline in
writing by the record holders submitting Forms of Election.  In addition,
all Elections shall automatically be revoked if the Merger Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Section 9.01.  If an Election is revoked,
the GPU Certificates (or guarantee of delivery, as applicable) to which
the Election relates shall be promptly returned to the shareholder
submitting those GPU Certificates in respect of such Election.  Nothing
contained herein shall be interpreted to prohibit a holder of shares of
GPU Common Stock from making Cash Elections with respect to those shares.

          (l)  Adjustment Per Tax Opinion.  Notwithstanding anything in
               --------------------------
this Article II to the contrary (other than the last sentence of Section
2.01(m)), if, based on the Exchange Ratio determined in accordance with
Section 2.01(c), the Tax Ratio (as defined below) is less than 45% (or
such lesser percentage, not below 40%, as shall be reasonably agreed to by
tax counsel to FirstEnergy and GPU to enable such tax counsel to deliver
the tax opinions referred to in Section 8.02(c) and 8.03(c)) (the "Minimum
                                                                   -------

Tax Ratio"), the amount of cash to be delivered (but for this Section
---------
2.01(l)) with respect to each share of GPU Common Stock convertible, in
whole or in part, into a right to receive cash shall be reduced to the
minimum extent necessary (the

<PAGE>

amount of such reduction, the "Reduction Amount") (and FirstEnergy shall
                               ----------------
deliver with respect to each such share of GPU Common Stock, in lieu of
the Reduction Amount, that number of shares of FirstEnergy Common Stock
having an aggregate value (based on the closing price of the FirstEnergy
Common Stock on the Closing Date) equal to the Reduction Amount) so that
the Tax Ratio is equal to the Minimum Tax Ratio.  "Tax Ratio" shall mean
                                                   ---------
the ratio of (i) the product of (A) the closing price per share of
FirstEnergy Common Stock on the Closing Date times (B) the excess of (x)
the aggregate number of shares of FirstEnergy Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to this Section 2.01 over (y) the number of shares of FirstEnergy
Common Stock that tax counsel to FirstEnergy or GPU reasonably deems
necessary to exclude for purposes of the "continuity-of-interest"
requirements under applicable federal income tax principles relating to
reorganizations described in the Code (the "Aggregate Stock Amount"), to
                                            ----------------------
(ii) the sum of (u) the Aggregate Stock Amount plus (v) the aggregate cash
payable pursuant to this Section 2.01 (plus the aggregate estimated amount
of cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of FirstEnergy Common Stock
pursuant to Section 2.02(e)(ii)) plus (w) the number of Dissenting Shares
times the per share fair value of such shares determined pursuant to
applicable law or, if such fair value has not been determined as of the
date the calculation required by this Section 2.01(l) is required to be
made, then times the greater of (A) the Cash Consideration and (B) the
value of the number of shares of FirstEnergy Common Stock equal to the
Exchange Ratio (based on the closing price per share of FirstEnergy Common
Stock on the Closing Date), plus (x) any other amounts paid by GPU (or any
affiliate thereof) to, or on behalf of, any holder of shares of GPU Common
Stock in connection with the sale, redemption or other disposition of any
GPU Common Stock in connection with the Merger for purposes of Treasury
Regulation Sections 1.368-1(e) and 1.368-1T(e) plus (y) any extraordinary
dividend distributed by GPU prior to and in connection with the Merger for
purposes of Treasury Regulation Sections 1.368-1(e) and 1.368-1T(e), plus
(z) the amount of any other items  that tax counsel to FirstEnergy or GPU
reasonably deems necessary to take into account for purposes of making the
Merger satisfy the "continuity-of-interest" requirements under applicable
federal income tax principles relating to reorganizations described in the
Code.

          (m)  Anti-Dilution Provisions.  In the event FirstEnergy (i)
               ------------------------
changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the number of shares
of FirstEnergy Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective
Time as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, stock combination,
recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization or similar transaction
with respect to the outstanding FirstEnergy Common Stock or (ii) pays or
makes a dividend or distribution not permitted by Section 6.02 in respect
of FirstEnergy Common Stock (other than a distribution referred to in
clause (i) of this sentence) and, in either case, the record date therefor
or the effective time thereof shall be prior to the Effective Time, the
Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted appropriately.  Regular quarterly cash
dividends and increases thereon shall not be considered extraordinary for
purposes of the preceding sentence. If, between the date hereof and the
Effective Time, FirstEnergy shall merge or consolidate with or into any
other corporation in an transaction otherwise permitted by the terms of
this Agreement and the terms thereof shall provide that FirstEnergy Common
Stock shall be converted into or exchanged for the shares of any other
corporation or entity, then provision shall be made so that shareholders
of GPU who would be entitled to receive shares of FirstEnergy Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of each
share of FirstEnergy Common Stock issuable to such shareholders as
provided herein, the same kind and amount of securities or assets as shall
be distributable upon such merger or consolidation with respect to one
share of FirstEnergy

<PAGE>


Common Stock and the parties hereto shall agree on an appropriate
restructuring of the transactions contemplated herein.

          (n)  Dissenting Shares.  Each outstanding share of GPU Common
               -----------------
Stock the holder of which has perfected his right to dissent under
applicable law and has not effectively withdrawn or lost such right as of
the Effective Time (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into
                         -----------------
or represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration, and the holder
thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by applicable
law; provided however, that any Dissenting Share
     -------- -------
held by a person at the Effective Time who shall, after the Effective
Time, withdraw the demand for payment for shares or lose the right to
payment for shares, in either case pursuant to the Pennsylvania BCL, shall
be deemed to be converted into, as of the Effective Time, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01, without
interest thereon, upon surrender of the GPU Certificates representing such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 2.02 hereof.  GPU shall give
(i) FirstEnergy prompt notice upon receipt by GPU of any written demands
for payment of the fair value of any shares of GPU Common Stock and of
withdrawals of any such demands and any other instruments provided
pursuant to applicable law and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
the Pennsylvania BCL.  GPU shall not voluntarily make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal and shall not, except with the prior
written consent of FirstEnergy, settle or offer to settle any such
demands.  Any payments made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made
by the Surviving Corporation.

     Section 2.02   Exchange of Certificates.  (a) Deposit with Exchange
                    ------------------------       ---------------------
Agent.  As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving
-----
Corporation shall deposit with a bank or trust company mutually agreeable
to FirstEnergy and GPU (the "Exchange Agent"), pursuant to an agreement in
                             --------------
form and substance reasonably acceptable to FirstEnergy and GPU, an amount
of cash and certificates representing the shares of FirstEnergy Common
Stock required to effect the conversion of GPU Common Stock into
FirstEnergy Common Stock and cash in accordance with Section 2.01.

          (b)  Exchange and Payment Procedures.  (i)  As soon as
               -------------------------------
     reasonably practicable after the Merger, FirstEnergy shall cause the
     Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record as of the Effective
     Time of one or more GPU Certificates in respect of which the holder
     failed to return a properly completed Form of Election,

                    (A)  a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
          delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
          GPU Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the GPU
          Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and

                    (B)  instructions for effecting the surrender of the
          GPU Certificates and receiving the Aggregate Consideration (as
          defined below) to which such holder shall be entitled pursuant
          to Section 2.01.

            (ii)  Upon surrender of a GPU Certificate for cancellation to
     the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
     appointed by FirstEnergy for such purpose, together with such letter
     of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such GPU Certificate
     shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a certificate
     representing

<PAGE>

     that number of shares of FirstEnergy Common Stock ("FirstEnergy
                                                         -----------
     Shares") into which the shares of GPU Common Stock previously
     ------
     represented by such GPU Certificate are converted in accordance with
     Section 2.01, (y) the cash to which such holder is entitled in
     accordance with Section 2.01, and (z) the cash in lieu of fractional
     FirstEnergy Shares which such holder has the right to receive
     pursuant to Section 2.02(e) (the shares of FirstEnergy Common Stock
     and cash described in clauses (x), (y) and (z) above being referred
     to collectively as the "Aggregate Consideration").  In the event the
                             -----------------------
     Aggregate Consideration is to be delivered to any person who is not
     the person in whose name the GPU Certificate surrendered in exchange
     therefor is registered in the transfer records of GPU, the Aggregate
     Consideration may be delivered to a transferee if the GPU Certificate
     is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
     reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and by
     evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Exchange Agent that any
     applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
     contemplated by this Section 2.02, each GPU Certificate (other than a
     GPU Certificate representing shares of GPU Common Stock to be
     canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b)) shall be deemed at any
     time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
     upon such surrender the Aggregate Consideration contemplated by this
     Section 2.02.  No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash
     payable to holders of GPU Certificates pursuant to provisions of this
     Article II.

          (c)  Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares.  No
               ------------------------------------------------
dividends or other distributions declared or paid after the Effective Time
with respect to FirstEnergy Shares with a record date after the Effective
Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered GPU Certificate with
respect to the FirstEnergy Shares represented thereby and no cash payment
in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to
Section 2.02(e) until the holder of record of such GPU Certificate shall
surrender such GPU Certificate.  Subject to the effect of unclaimed
property, escheat and other applicable laws, following surrender of any
such GPU Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the
certificates representing whole FirstEnergy Shares issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount
of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of FirstEnergy Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole FirstEnergy
Shares and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but
prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with
respect to such whole FirstEnergy Shares.

          (d)  No Further Ownership Rights in GPU Common Stock.  (i) The
               -----------------------------------------------
     payment of the Aggregate Consideration to be made to holders of GPU
     Certificates upon conversion of shares of GPU Common Stock in
     accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid in lieu of
     fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(e)) shall be deemed to
     have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights
     pertaining to such shares of GPU Common Stock, subject, however, to
     the obligation of FirstEnergy to pay any dividends or make any other
     distributions pursuant to Section 2.02(c) above.

            (ii)  If, after the Effective Time, GPU Certificates are
     presented to FirstEnergy for any reason, they shall be canceled and
     exchanged as provided in this Article II.


<PAGE>

          (e)  No Fractional Shares.    No certificates or scrip
               --------------------
representing fractional shares of FirstEnergy Common Stock shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of GPU Certificates, and such fractional
share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any
rights of a shareholder of FirstEnergy.

              (ii)  To the extent a holder of GPU Common Stock would
     otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional share of
     FirstEnergy Common Stock, such holder shall be entitled to receive in
     lieu thereof a payment in cash, without interest, in an amount equal
     to (x) such fraction multiplied by (y) the average of the closing
     prices of the shares of FirstEnergy Common Stock on the NYSE over the
     five trading day period ending on the trading day immediately prior
     to the Closing Date, as reported in The Wall Street Journal (but
     subject to correction for typographical or other manifest errors in
     such reporting).  The fractional shares of FirstEnergy Common Stock
     shall be aggregated and no holder of GPU Common Stock shall be
     entitled to receive cash in an amount equal to or greater than the
     value of one full share of FirstEnergy Common Stock as calculated
     above.

          (f)  Termination of Exchange Agent.  Any certificates
               -----------------------------
representing FirstEnergy Shares deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant
to Section 2.02(a) and not exchanged within one year after the Effective
Time pursuant to this Section 2.02 shall be returned by the Exchange Agent
to FirstEnergy, which shall thereafter act as Exchange Agent.  All funds
held by the Exchange Agent for payment to the holders of unsurrendered GPU
Certificates and unclaimed at the end of one year from the Effective Time
shall be returned to FirstEnergy, after which time any holder of
unsurrendered GPU Certificates shall look as a general creditor only to
FirstEnergy for payment of such funds to which such holder may be due,
subject to applicable law.

          (g)  Withholding Rights.  FirstEnergy shall be entitled to
               ------------------
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of GPU Common Stock (or to any person
pursuant to Section 2.02(h)) such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law.  To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by FirstEnergy, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
shares of GPU Common Stock (or to any person pursuant to Section 2.02(h))
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
FirstEnergy.

          (h)  Stock Options of GPU.  (i)  At the Effective Time, each
               --------------------
     unexpired and unexercised option to purchase GPU Common Stock (each,

     price per share of GPU Common Stock, as reported on the New York
     Stock Exchange Composite Tape, occurring during the 90-day period
     immediately preceding the Effective Time (the "GPU Stock Price"), and

     Effective Time.  Each GPU Deferred Unit that does not become payable
     upon consummation of the Merger, shall, at the written election of
     the holder thereof delivered to FirstEnergy within 30 days after the
     Effective Time, be converted at the Effective Time into either (i) a

     the Effective Time, GPU shall take, or cause the appropriate
     committee to take, all action necessary to effectuate the foregoing,
     including the adoption of necessary amendments to the applicable GPU
     Stock Plan.

              (iii)  From and after the Effective Time, each substituted
     FirstEnergy Option and FirstEnergy Deferred Unit provided for in this

          Section 2.02(h),

                    (C)  from and after the Effective Time, upon exercise
          of the FirstEnergy Options or upon the payment of GPU Stock
          Units or FirstEnergy Deferred Units, in each case, in accordance
          with the terms thereof, make available for issuance all shares
          of FirstEnergy Common Stock covered thereby, and

          Unit a document evidencing the foregoing assumption by
          FirstEnergy.

              (vi)  FirstEnergy shall use reasonable best efforts to
     ensure that the shares of FirstEnergy Common Stock issuable or
     deliverable upon the exercise of the FirstEnergy Options or upon the
     payment of the GPU Stock Units or FirstEnergy Deferred Units are

Service (the "IRS"), or the applicable statute of limitations with respect
              ---
to such years, including extensions thereof, has expired.  As of the date

         (d)  Except as would not have a GPU Material Adverse Effect, with
respect to each GPU Controlled Group Plan, there are no material funded

     the IRS,

             (ii)  any such FirstEnergy Controlled Group Plan,

     ERISA.

         (b)  (i)  Each of the FirstEnergy Controlled Group Plans intended
     to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code

     knowledge of the executive officers of FirstEnergy, no circumstances
     exist that are reasonably expected by FirstEnergy to result in the
     revocation of any such determination.

             (ii)  Except as would not have a FirstEnergy Material Adverse
     Effect, FirstEnergy is in compliance with, and each FirstEnergy
     Controlled Group Plan is and has been operated in compliance with,

individually and in the aggregate, no event has occurred, and to the
knowledge of any of the executive officers of FirstEnergy or any of its
Subsidiaries, there exists no condition or set of circumstances in
connection with which FirstEnergy or any of its Subsidiaries could be
subject to any liability that is reasonably likely to exceed $1,000,000
(except liability for benefits claims and funding obligations payable in
the ordinary course) under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable law.

         (d)  Except as would not have a FirstEnergy Material Adverse
Effect, with respect to each FirstEnergy Controlled Group Plan, there are
no material funded benefit obligations for which contributions have not
been made or in accordance with GAAP properly accrued and there are no
material unfunded benefit obligations which have not been accounted for in
accordance with GAAP, on the financial statements of FirstEnergy or any of

     plan;

             (ii)  except for the transactions contemplated in this
     Agreement, no event has occurred and no condition exists which would
     give rise to the recapture of any Tax credit previously claimed with
     respect to the plan or to any Tax or penalties assessable against
     FirstEnergy or any of its Subsidiaries; and

            (iii)  except for the transactions contemplated in this
     Agreement, no event has occurred and no condition exists which would
     cause the termination of the plan and the distribution of all amounts
     held thereunder to give rise to the recapture of any Tax credit
     previously claimed with respect to the plan or to any Tax or
     penalties assessable against FirstEnergy or any of its Subsidiaries.

         (h)  None of the FirstEnergy Controlled Group Plans that are
welfare plans (within the meaning of Section 3(l) of ERISA) provides for
any retiree benefits.

         (i)  Except as would not have a FirstEnergy Material Adverse
Effect,

              (i)  the consummation or announcement of any transaction
     contemplated by this Agreement will not (either alone or upon the
     occurrence of any additional or further acts or events) result in any

                    (A)  payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise)

agree to any material conditions, terms or restrictions on the conduct of
its business or any dispositions of assets or businesses in order to

commitment that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect (as defined in Section 3.01(a) but without reference to GPU or

          practical, in all job placement, job posting, job training,
          career development and educational programs of FirstEnergy and
          its Subsidiaries; and

                    (C)  consider such employees for positions at
          FirstEnergy and its Subsidiaries resulting from the Merger using
          criteria including previous work history, job experience and

              (i)  all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses,

     be unreasonably withheld) of or in connection with any claim, action,
     suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on or
     arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or
     was a director, officer or employee of GPU or any of its
     Subsidiaries, whether pertaining to any matter existing or occurring

     prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time (the "GPU Indemnified
     Liabilities"), and

             (ii)  all GPU Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in
     part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to this
     Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case to
     the full extent permitted by applicable law (and the applicable GPU
     Indemnifying Party will pay expenses as incurred in advance of the
     final disposition of any such action or proceeding to each GPU
     Indemnified Party to the full extent permitted by applicable law).

         (b)  (i)  Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such
     claim, action, suit, proceeding, or investigation is brought against
     any GPU Indemnified Party (whether arising before or after the

          satisfactory to them and approved by the GPU Indemnifying Party,
          which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,

                    (B)  the GPU Indemnifying Party shall pay all
          reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the GPU
          Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are

                    (C)  the GPU Indemnifying Party will use all
          reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of any such
          matter.

             (ii)  However, no GPU Indemnifying Party shall be liable for

     indemnification under this Section 7.13, upon learning of any such
     claim, action, suit, proceeding, or investigation, shall notify the
     applicable GPU Indemnifying Party (but the failure so to notify a GPU
     Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any liability which it
     may have under this Section 7.13 except to the extent such failure
     prejudices such party).

             (iv)  The GPU Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only
     one law firm to represent them with respect to each such matter
     unless there is, under applicable standards of professional conduct,

         (c)  For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by GPU
(provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies
of at least the same coverage and amounts and otherwise containing terms
and conditions which, in the aggregate, are no less advantageous than the
current policies maintained by GPU with respect to its directors and
officers) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which
occurred before the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event
                                    --------  -------
shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend, in order to
maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant to this Section 7.13(c),

Surviving Corporation. (each of FirstEnergy and the Surviving Corporation,

     shall not be unreasonably withheld) of or in connection with any
     claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in
     part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such
     person is or was a director, officer or employee of FirstEnergy or
     any of its Subsidiaries, whether pertaining to any matter existing or
     occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and whether asserted or
     claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time (the
     "FirstEnergy Indemnified Liabilities"), and
      -----------------------------------

     or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining
     to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in each
     case to the full extent permitted by applicable law (and the
     applicable FirstEnergy Indemnifying Party will pay expenses as
     incurred in advance of

<PAGE>

     the final disposition of any such action or proceeding to each
     FirstEnergy Indemnified Party to the full extent permitted by
     applicable law).

     claim, action, suit, proceeding, or investigation is brought against
     any FirstEnergy Indemnified Party (whether arising before or after
     the Effective Time),

                    (A)  the FirstEnergy Indemnified Parties may retain
          counsel satisfactory to them and approved by the FirstEnergy
          Indemnifying Party, which approval shall not be unreasonably
          withheld,

                    (B)  the FirstEnergy Indemnifying Party shall pay all
          reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the FirstEnergy
          Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are
          received, and

                    (C)  the FirstEnergy Indemnifying Party will use all
          reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of any such
          matter.

             (ii)  However, no FirstEnergy Indemnifying Party shall be
     liable for any settlement of any claim effected without its written
     consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

            (iii)  Any FirstEnergy Indemnified Party wishing to claim
     indemnification under this Section 7.13, upon learning of any such
     claim, action, suit, proceeding, or investigation, shall notify the
     applicable FirstEnergy Indemnifying Party (but the failure so to
     notify a FirstEnergy Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any
     liability which it may have under this Section 7.13 except to the
     extent such failure prejudices such party).

             (iv)  The FirstEnergy Indemnified Parties as a group may
     retain only one law firm to represent them with respect to each such
     matter unless there is, under applicable standards of professional
     conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between the positions of
     any two or more FirstEnergy Indemnified Parties.

         (f)  For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by
FirstEnergy (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts and otherwise
containing terms and conditions which, in the aggregate, are no less
advantageous than the current policies maintained by FirstEnergy with
respect to its directors and officers) with respect to claims arising from
facts or events which occurred before the Effective Time; provided,
                                                          --------
however, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to
-------
expend, in order to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant to
this Section 7.13(f), any amount per annum in excess of 200% of the
aggregate premiums paid by FirstEnergy in 2000 on an annualized basis for
such purpose.
         (g)  The provisions of this Section 7.13 are intended to be for
the sole benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party
and his or her heirs and representatives.

that party from any other remedy against the other party to which it may
otherwise be entitled under this Agreement, at law or in equity or
otherwise.

             (ii)  The parties agree that the agreements contained in this
     Section 9.05 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
     the Agreement, that the damages that would be suffered by a party
     upon breach of this Agreement by the other party are inherently
     insusceptible of calculation, and that the agreements contained in
     this Section 9.05 therefore constitute liquidated damages and not a
     penalty.

            (iii)  If one party fails to pay promptly to the other any fee
     due hereunder, the defaulting party shall pay the costs and expenses
     (including legal fees and expenses) in connection with any action,
     including the filing of any lawsuit or other legal action, taken to
     collect payment, together with interest on the amount of any unpaid
     fee at the publicly announced prime or base rate of Citibank, N.A.,
     from the date such fee was required to be paid.

                               GPU, Inc.


                               By: ___________________
                                   Name:
                                   Title:

<PAGE>

                              EXHIBIT B

                                                                 [Date]


Ladies and Gentlemen:

     The undersigned, a holder of shares of Common Stock, par value $2.50
per share ("GPU Common Stock"), of GPU, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation
("GPU"), may receive, in connection with the merger (the "Merger") of GPU
with and into FirstEnergy Corp., an Ohio corporation ("FirstEnergy"), with
FirstEnergy continuing as the surviving corporation, common stock, par
value $.10 per share, of FirstEnergy (the "FirstEnergy Common Stock").
The undersigned acknowledges that the undersigned may be deemed an
"affiliate" of GPU subject to Rule 145 ("Rule 145") promulgated under the
Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act"), although nothing contained herein
should be construed as an admission of such fact.

     If in fact the undersigned is an affiliate of GPU under the Act at
the time the Merger is submitted to a vote of shareholders of GPU, the
undersigned's ability to sell, assign or transfer the FirstEnergy Common
Stock received by it in exchange for any shares of GPU Common Stock
pursuant to the Merger may be restricted unless such sale, assignment or
transfer is registered under the Act or an exemption from such
registration is available.  The undersigned understands that such
exemptions are limited and the undersigned has obtained advice of counsel
as to the nature and conditions of such exemptions, including information
with respect to the applicability to the sale of such securities of Rules
144 and 145(d) promulgated under the Act.

     The undersigned hereby represents to and covenants with FirstEnergy
that it will not sell, assign or transfer any of the FirstEnergy Common
Stock received by it in exchange for shares of GPU Common Stock pursuant
to the Merger except

              (i)  pursuant to an effective registration statement under
     the Act,

             (ii)  in a transaction in conformity with the volume and
     other limitations of Rule 145; or

            (iii)  in a transaction which, in the opinion of independent
     counsel reasonably satisfactory to FirstEnergy (the fees of which
     counsel will be paid by the undersigned) or as described in a "no-
     action" or interpretive letter from the Staff of the Securities and
     Exchange Commission is not required to be registered under the Act.

     In the event of a sale or other disposition of FirstEnergy Common
Stock other than pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Act, the undersigned will supply FirstEnergy with evidence of compliance
with Rule 145, in the form of a letter in the form of Annex A hereto or
the opinion of counsel referred to above.  The undersigned understands
that FirstEnergy may instruct its transfer agent to withhold the transfer
of any FirstEnergy Common Stock disposed of by it, but that upon receipt
of such letter or opinion the transfer agent shall effectuate the transfer
of such FirstEnergy Common Stock indicated as sold in the letter or sold
in accordance with that opinion.


<PAGE>

     The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that customary legends will
be placed on certificates representing shares of FirstEnergy Common Stock
received by the undersigned pursuant to the Merger or held by a transferee
thereof (unless the shares were transferred to the transferee pursuant to
an effective registration statement under the Act or in a transaction in
conformity with Rule 145), which legends will be removed in connection
with a transfer thereof pursuant to an effective registration statement
under the Act or in a transaction made in conformity with Rule 145 or by
delivery of substitute certificates upon receipt of an opinion in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to FirstEnergy from independent counsel
reasonably satisfactory to FirstEnergy (the fees of which counsel will be
paid by the undersigned) to the effect that such legends are no longer
required for purposes of the Act.

     The undersigned acknowledges that it has carefully read this letter
and understands the requirements hereto and the limitations imposed upon
the distribution, sale, transfer or other disposition of shares of
FirstEnergy Common Stock.

                               Very truly yours,



                               [Name]

                                                           [Date]


FirstEnergy
[Address]

Attention:

     On ____________________, I sold the securities (the "Securities") of
FirstEnergy ("FirstEnergy") described below in the space provided for that
purpose.  The Securities were received by me in connection with the merger
of GPU with and into FirstEnergy.

     Based upon the most recent report or statement filed by FirstEnergy
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Securities were sold by
me in conformity with Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of
1933 (the "Act").

                               Very truly yours,
