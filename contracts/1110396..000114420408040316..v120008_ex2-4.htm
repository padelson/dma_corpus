Sino's  predecessor, Innovative Coatings, a Georgia Corporation, ceased
operations  in  June 2003. On August 1, 2003, ICC Holdings Corp. was formed
as a wholly-owned  subsidiary of Innovative Coatings. Also on August 1,
2003, Instachem  Systems was formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ICC
Holdings Corp. and ICC  Merger Corp. was formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Instachem Systems.  On August 11, 2003, ICC Holdings Corp. merged with
its parent company,  Innovative Coatings, to change its State of
incorporation from Georgia to  Oklahoma. On August 12, 2003, ICC Merger
Corp. bought ICC Holdings Corp. A  new corporation with ownership unrelated
to the above, Sino-Biotics, Inc.,  was  formed in Delaware on July 6, 2005.
On July 18, 2005, Instachem Systems  sold ICC Merger Corp. to an individual
for $500. On July 19, 2005, Sino  bought Instachem Systems. As a result of
the above, the pre-existing creditors  of the original operating entity,
Innovative Coatings, were spun off through  the  sale of ICC Merger in July
2005.

**FORM  OF INVESTMENT LETTER**

 

 

The  Board  of Directors of Sino-Biotics, Inc.

 

 

Re: Purchase  of Shares of Common Stock of Sino-Biotics, Inc.

 

 

Gentlemen:

 

 

In  connection with the acquisition by the undersigned of Ninety-Three
Million  (93,000,000) shares of common stock of Sino-Biotics, Inc., par value
$0.001  per  share (the " _Securities_ "),  the  undersigned represents
that the Securities are being acquired without a view  to,  or for, resale
in connection with any distribution of such Securities or any  interest
therein without registration or other compliance under the Securities  Act of
1933, as amended (" _Securities  Act_ "),  and  that the undersigned has no
direct or indirect participation in any such  undertaking or in the
underwriting of such an undertaking.

 

 

The  undersigned understands that the Securities have not been registered,
but are  being acquired by reason of a specific exemption under the
Securities Act as  well as under certain State statutes for transactions by
an issuer not involving  any public offering and that any disposition of the
subject Securities may,  under certain circumstances, be inconsistent with
this exemption and may make  the undersigned an "underwriter" within the
meaning of the Securities Act. It is  understood that the definition of an
"underwriter" focuses on the concept of "distribution" and that any
subsequent disposition of the Securities can only be  effected in
transactions which are not considered distributions. Generally,  the  term
"distribution" is considered synonymous with "public offering" or any other 
offer or sale involving general solicitation or general advertising. Under 
present law, in determining whether a distribution occurs when securities
are  sold into the public market, under certain circumstances one must
consider  the  availability of public information regarding the issuer, a
holding period for  the securities sufficient to assure that the persons
desiring to sell the  securities without registration first bear the economic
risk of their  investment, and a limitation on the number of securities which
the stockholder  is permitted to sell and on the manner of sale, thereby
reducing the potential  impact of the sale on the trading markets. These
criteria are set forth  specifically in Rule 144 promulgated under the
Securities Act. After six (6)  months from the date the Securities are fully
paid for and the subscription  is  accepted by the issuer, all as calculated
in accordance with that Rule, sales  of  the Securities in reliance on Rule
144 can only be made in limited amounts  in  accordance with the terms and
conditions of that Rule. After one (1) year from  the date the Securities are
fully paid for, as calculated in accordance with  that Rule, the Securities
can generally be sold without meeting these conditions  provided the holder
is not (and has not been for the preceding three (3) months)  an affiliate of
the issuer.

Sino-Biotics,  Inc.

 

Page  Two

 

 

The  undersigned acknowledges that the Securities must be held and may not be
sold,  transferred, or otherwise disposed of for value unless it is
subsequently  registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such
registration  is  available; the issuer is under no obligation to register
the Securities under  the Securities Act or under Section 12 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934,  as amended, except as may be expressly
agreed to by it in writing; if Rule  144  is available, and no assurance is
given that it will be, initially only routine  sales of such Securities in
limited amounts can be made in reliance on Rule  144  in accordance with the
terms and conditions of that Rule; the issuer is under  no  obligation to
the undersigned to make Rule 144 available, except as may be  expressly
agreed to by it in writing; in the event Rule 144 is not available, 
compliance with Regulation A or some other exemption may be required before 
the  undersigned can sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of such Securities
without  registration under the Securities Act; the issuer's registrar and
transfer agent  will maintain a stop transfer order against the registration
of transfer of  the  Securities; and the certificate representing the
convertible promissory notes  and warrants composing the Securities will bear
a legend in substantially the  following form so restricting the sale of such
Securities.

 

 

THE  SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED
UNDER THE  SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), AND ARE
"RESTRICTED  SECURITIES" WITHIN THE MEANING OF RULE 144 PROMULGATED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT.  THE SECURITIES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT AND MAY NOT
BE SOLD OR  TRANSFERRED WITHOUT COMPLYING WITH RULE 144 IN THE ABSENCE OF AN
EFFECTIVE  REGISTRATION OR OTHER COMPLIANCE UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT.

 

 

The  issuer may refuse to register transfer of the securities in the absence
of  compliance with Rule 144 unless the undersigned furnishes the issuer with
a  "no-action" or interpretative letter from the U.S. Securities and
Exchange  Commission or an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the
issuer stating  that the transfer is proper; further, unless such letter or
opinion states  that  the Securities are free of any restrictions under the
Securities Act, the issuer  may refuse to transfer the Securities to any
transferee who does not furnish  in  writing to the issuer the same
representations and agree to the same conditions  with respect to such
Securities as are set forth herein. The issuer may also  refuse to transfer
the securities if any circumstances are present reasonably  indicating that
the transferee's representations are not accurate.

 

 

         | Very  truly yours,
