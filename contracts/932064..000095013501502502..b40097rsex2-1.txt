                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

     This Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement") is entered into as of
July 30, 2001, by and among RSA SECURITY INC., a Delaware corporation (the
"Buyer"); FALCON ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Buyer (the "Transitory Subsidiary"); SECURANT TECHNOLOGIES,
INC., a California corporation (the "Company"); and RH Investments 2001 LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company, solely in its capacity as Shareholders'
Representative (as defined herein) and solely for the purposes set forth in
Sections 1.8, 1.10, 9.7, 9.8, 9.11 and 9.13 and Article VI. The Buyer, the
Transitory Subsidiary and the Company are referred to collectively herein as the
"Parties."

     This Agreement contemplates a merger of the Transitory Subsidiary into the
Company. In such merger, the shareholders of the Company will receive cash in
exchange for their shares of capital stock of the Company.

     Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and
inducement of the willingness of Buyer to enter into this Agreement, certain
shareholders of the Company have executed Shareholder Agreements in favor of the
Buyer in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT A (the "Shareholder Voting
Agreement"), pursuant to which such shareholders have agreed to vote and to give
Buyer a proxy to vote all of the shares of capital stock of the Company that
such shareholders own in favor of the transactions described herein.

     Now, therefore, in consideration of the representations, warranties and
covenants herein contained, the Parties agree as follows.

                                   ARTICLE I

Agreement, the Transitory Subsidiary shall merge with and into the Company (with
such merger referred to herein as the "Merger") at the Effective Time (as
defined below). From and after the Effective Time, the separate corporate
existence of the Transitory Subsidiary shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving
Corporation"). The "Effective Time" shall be the later to occur of (i) the time
at which the Surviving Corporation files the Agreement of Merger in the form
attached hereto as EXHIBIT B-1 (the "Agreement of Merger") or other appropriate
documents, together with the required officers' certificates and the
certificates of satisfaction from the California Franchise Tax Board for the
Transitory Subsidiary and the Company (collectively, the "California Merger
Filings"), in accordance with Section 1103 of the California General Corporation
Law, with the Secretary of State of the State of California, and (ii) the time
at which the Surviving Corporation files a certificate of merger in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit B-2 or other appropriate documents prepared and
executed in accordance with Section 252(c) of the Delaware General Corporation
Law with the Secretary of

60 State Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109, commencing at 9:00 a.m. local time
on August 31, 2001, or, if all of the conditions to the obligations of the
Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby have not been
satisfied or waived by such date, on such mutually agreeable later date as soon
as practicable (and in any event not later than three business days) after the
satisfaction or waiver of all conditions (excluding the delivery of any
documents to be delivered at the Closing by any of the Parties) set forth in
Article V hereof (the "Closing Date").

          (c)  COMPANY OPTIONS.

               (i) COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS. As of the Effective Time, as the
Company may designate at least two (2) business days prior to the Closing, and
subject to the reduction in the cash payments for amounts specified in Section
1.5(c)(ii) and (iii), each Company Vested Option that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall either (A) be exercised as of the Effective
Time conditional upon the Closing on the basis that the shares issued upon
exercise on such date will be entitled to an amount in cash equal to the Per
Share Net Participation Amount and a conditional amount of cash per share equal
to the Per Share Escrow Amount, or (B) be deemed cancelled and converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Net Participation
Amount and a conditional amount in cash equal to the Per Share Escrow Amount.
Thereafter, without impairing the rights of the holders of Company Vested
Options to receive cash payments to the extent set forth herein, the holders of
Company Options shall, as of the Effective Time, cease to have any further right
or entitlement to acquire any Company Common Shares or any shares of capital
stock of the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation under the cancelled Company
Options.

               (ii) WITHHOLDING FROM CASH FOR COMPANY OPTIONS. The Buyer shall
withhold from the cash payments made with respect to Company Vested Options held
by employees of the Company or any Subsidiary (as defined below), in lieu of
paying the withheld amounts to those holders of Company Vested Options, all
Withholding Taxes. After the Closing, the Buyer will timely file, or will cause
the Surviving Corporation to timely file, any related returns of such
Withholding Taxes and will timely remit, or cause the timely remission of, these
withheld amounts to the taxing authorities entitled to receive the same. It is
the express intention of the Parties that the Exchange Fund shall be reduced to
the extent of any Withholding Taxes, which, to the extent withheld from such
fund, shall not be treated as a liability of the Company for purposes of the
Closing Balance Sheet. The Company and the Shareholders' Representative agree to
provide the Buyer with such information as it may reasonably require in order to
calculate any Withholding Taxes.

               (iii) ADJUSTMENTS TO PAYMENTS OR SHARES UNDER CERTAIN OPTIONS. To
the extent that the Company has permitted any Company Vested Options to be
cancelled in exchange for cash payments, or exercised on the basis that a number
of shares is withheld in payment of the applicable exercise price, the cash
payments to be received by the holder the of those Company Vested Options or
number of shares issued or deemed issued, as applicable, under those Company
Vested Options shall be reduced by the applicable aggregate exercise price not
paid in cash by the holders of the Company Vested Options.

               (iv) OTHER RIGHTS TO ACQUIRE COMPANY SHARES. The Company shall
take all other actions necessary or appropriate so that, as of the Effective
Time and as a result of the Merger, (A) no options, warrants or other rights to
acquire any Company Shares or any securities, debt or other rights convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Company's capital stock are
outstanding, and (B) no person other than the holders of Company


                                      -7-
<PAGE>   13


Shares and/or Company Options, prior to the Closing, shall have any right, title
or interest in or to the ownership of the Company or the Surviving Corporation
or any securities issued by Company or the Surviving Corporation, and (C) the
holders of Company Shares and holders of Company Options shall, on and after the
Closing, have no right, title or interest in or to Company or the Surviving
Corporation or any securities of Company or the Surviving Corporation, other
than the right to payments of cash in the manner described herein, and (D) no
person holding Company Shares and/or Company Options or rights to acquire
Company Shares or Company Options shall by virtue of any such securities have
any right to acquire any securities of the Buyer.

               (v) NO INFERRED AMENDMENTS TO COMPANY OPTIONS. No provision of
this Section 1.5 or other provision of this Agreement is intended by its terms
to amend any Company Option or to give any rights to any holders of Company
Options to require accelerated vesting or other amendments to Company Options,
except to the extent that the Company in its discretion and prior to the
Closing, elects to implement any such accelerated vesting or other amendments in
accordance with and subject to the provisions of Section 4.4(a) hereof.

          (d)  RETENTION BONUS PROGRAM. The Company may (but is not obligated
to), not later than five (5) business days before the Closing, designate a
portion of the Merger Consideration to be separately funded by the Buyer within
the Exchange Fund (the "Retention Bonus Fund") and paid as retention bonuses to
those Company employees whose employment with the Surviving Corporation
continues for six months after the Effective Time on terms to be specified by
the Company prior to the Closing, provided that such arrangements are approved
before the Closing by the Buyer, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, and such arrangements, including amounts needed to fund
applicable employer and employee withholding requirements upon payment of the
retention bonuses, do not increase the cash payments of the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable by the Buyer under this Agreement. To the extent that such
retention bonuses are not paid under the terms specified, the Exchange Agreement
shall specify that the sums not paid will be promptly distributed to the holders
of Company Shares in the proportionate amounts otherwise established by the
Exchange Agreement.

          (e)  SM NON-COMPETE PAYMENT. If and only if (i) Shawn McLaren has
executed and delivered on or before the date of this Agreement the Shareholder
Voting Agreement and Non-Competition Agreement in the forms attached hereto to
be signed by him, and (ii) the Closing occurs pursuant to this Agreement, the
Buyer shall deduct from the Preliminary Merger Consideration (defined in Section
1.8(a)) and, on the Closing Date, pay or cause the Surviving Corporation to pay
to Shawn McLaren the sum of Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars ($800,000.00) (the
"SM Non-Compete Payment"), in immediately available funds to an account
designated by Shawn McLaren at least two (2) business days prior to the Closing.
The Parties agree that the SM Non-Compete payment is to be made in consideration
of obligations under the Non-Competition Agreement executed and delivered by
Shawn McLaren pursuant to


                                      -8-
<PAGE>   14


this Agreement, and do not intend that such payment be in the nature of a
severance payment or other payment for his past employment by the Company.

          (f)  PRELIMINARY ALLOCATION OF PROCEEDS. The Company has prepared
Schedule 1.5 attached hereto (the "Preliminary Allocation Schedule") as a
preliminary summary of the allocation of proceeds to holders of Company Shares
contemplated by this Section 1.5 based on, among other things, the Company's
allocation of preferences set forth in Section 1.5(b), certain assumptions
concerning Company Options and the Retention Bonus Fund, and estimates of the
adjustments to the Merger Consideration required under this Agreement as of the
Effective Time, but EXCLUDING any assumptions concerning (i) estimated
Withholding Taxes, (ii) the adjustments, if any, based on the Closing Balance
Sheet described in Sections 1.8 and 1.9, or (iii) any claims against the Escrow
Fund. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Company and the Buyer will
jointly amend Schedule 1.5 as of the Effective Time to (i) reflect the actual
adjustments and allocation of proceeds then required by the applicable
provisions of this Agreement and the respective rights, preferences and
privileges of the Company Shares, and (ii) instruct the Exchange Agent as to the
portion of the Exchange Fund payable as of the Effective Time to specific
holders of Company Shares. The Parties acknowledge that the aggregate dollar
amount allocated to holders of Company Shares at the Closing may differ from the
Preliminary Allocation Schedule based upon (i) final amounts allocated to the
Expenses, the Shareholders' Representative Fund, the Retention Bonus Fund, the
SM Non-Compete Payment, Withholding Taxes, and adjustments based on the Closing
Balance Sheet, (ii) the number of Company Common Shares issued or deemed issued
as of the Effective Time pursuant to Company Options and other outstanding
securities of the Company convertible into or exercisable for Company Common
Shares, and (iii) other applicable provisions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth herein, in no event shall
the aggregate amounts payable by the Buyer to the Exchange Fund, the Escrow
Fund, the Shareholders' Representative Fund and the Retention Bonus Fund, when
added to the sum of the SM Non-Compete Payment and any amounts withheld or paid
to fund any Withholding Taxes, exceed $140,000,000, but without regard to any
positive or negative adjustments provided for in Section 1.8 hereof.

          (g)  COMPANY TREASURY SHARES. Each Company Share held in the Company's
treasury immediately prior to the Effective Time and each Company share owned
beneficially by the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary shall be cancelled and
retired without payment therefor.

          (h)  TRANSITORY SUB SHARES. Each share of common stock, $.01 par value
per share, of the Transitory Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and thereafter evidence one share
of common stock, $.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

     1.6  DISSENTING SHARES.

          (a)  For purposes of this Agreement, "Dissenting Shares" means Company
Shares held as of the Effective Time by shareholders of record of the Company
immediately


                                      -9-
<PAGE>   15


prior to the Effective Time ("Company Shareholders") who have not voted such
Company Shares in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the Merger and
with respect to which appraisal shall have been duly demanded and perfected in
accordance with Chapter 13 of the California General Corporation Law and not
effectively withdrawn or forfeited prior to the Effective Time. Dissenting
Shares shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration which the Company Shareholders are entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 1.5(a), unless such Company Shareholder's right to appraisal shall have
ceased in accordance with Section 1309 of the California General Corporation Law
or the Company Shareholder shall have properly withdrawn his, her or its demand
for appraisal. If such Company Shareholder has so forfeited or withdrawn his,
her or its right to appraisal of Dissenting Shares, then, as of the occurrence
of such event, such holder's Dissenting Shares shall cease to be Dissenting
Shares and shall be converted into and represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such Company Shares pursuant to Section 1.5.

          (b) The Company shall give the Buyer prompt notice of any written
demands for appraisal of any Company Shares, withdrawals of such demands, and
any other instruments that relate to such demands received by the Company. Until
such time, if any, as the number of Dissenting Shares exceeds five percent (5%)
of the number of outstanding Company Shares on an as-converted basis, the
Company shall provide the Buyer with the opportunity to direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the California
General Corporation Law; provided, however, that prior to the Effective Time the
Buyer shall not be permitted to settle any such demand for appraisal without the
Company's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. In the event the number of Dissenting Shares exceeds five percent
(5%) of the number of outstanding Common Shares on an as-converted basis, (i)
prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer and the Company shall mutually agree on
the method by which negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands
for appraisal under the California General Corporation Law shall be conducted
and (ii) from and after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall direct all such
negotiations and proceedings. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of the Buyer, make or agree to make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal of Company Shares or offer to settle or settle any
such demands.

     1.7  EXCHANGE OF SHARES.

          (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer and the Shareholders'
Representative shall enter into an agreement with the Exchange Agent, in
customary form reasonably acceptable to the Buyer and the Shareholders'
Representative (the "Exchange Agreement"), to (i) effect the exchange for the
Merger Consideration of certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, represented Company Shares converted into the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 1.5 ("Certificates") and (ii) pay any excess Adjusted Merger
Consideration (as defined in Section 1.8(f) to the Company Shareholders in
accordance with the provisions of Section 1.9 of this Agreement. On the Closing
Date, the Buyer shall deliver to the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of
holders of Certificates, a wire transfer in the amount


                                      -10-
<PAGE>   16


of $120,000,000, subject to the adjustments provided in Sections 1.8 and 1.10
(the "Exchange Fund"). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (but in
no event later than five (5) business days thereafter), the Buyer shall cause
the Exchange Agent to send a notice and a transmittal form to each holder of a
Certificate advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and the
procedure for surrendering to the Exchange Agent such Certificate in exchange
for the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.5. Each holder of a
Certificate, upon proper surrender thereof to the Exchange Agent in accordance
with the instructions in such notice, shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (subject to any taxes required to be withheld and without interest) the
Merger Consideration payable to such holder pursuant to Section 1.5. Until
properly surrendered, each such Certificate shall be deemed for all purposes to
evidence only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
Section 1.5. Holders of Certificates shall not be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration to which they would otherwise be entitled until such Certificates
are properly surrendered.

          (b) If any Merger Consideration is to be delivered to a person other
than the person in whose name the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor
is registered, it shall be a condition to the delivery of such Merger
Consideration that (i) the Certificate so surrendered shall be transferable, and
shall be properly assigned, endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers,
(ii) such transfer shall otherwise be proper and (iii) the person requesting
such transfer shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes
payable by reason of the foregoing or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such taxes have been paid or are not required to be paid.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any Party shall be
liable to a holder of Company Shares for any Merger Consideration payable to
such holder pursuant to Section 1.5 that are delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

          (c) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall
deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable in exchange therefor pursuant to Section 1.5. The Exchange
Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance
thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to give
the Exchange Agent a bond for the benefit of the Exchange Agent and the Buyer in
such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against the Exchange Agent and/or the Buyer with respect to the Certificate
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

          (d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to
the holders of Company Shares for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to the Buyer, upon demand, and any holder of Company Shares who has
not previously complied with this Section 1.7 shall thereafter look only to the
Buyer, as a general unsecured creditor, for payment of its Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 1.5.


                                      -11-

     1.8  ADJUSTMENTS BEFORE AND AFTER THE CLOSING. The Merger Consideration
shall be subject to adjustment as follows:

          (a) Not later than three business days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer a balance sheet of the Seller as
of a date (the "Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet Date") within five business
days of the Closing Date (the "Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet"). The
Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with the
provisions relating to the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet (as defined
below) set forth in this Section 1.8. The Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet
shall be accompanied by (i) all relevant backup materials and schedules, in
detail reasonably acceptable to the Buyer, and (ii) a statement setting forth
the amount, if any, by which the estimated Closing Working Capital (as
hereinafter defined) is greater than, or less than, the Target Amount (as
hereinafter defined) (the "Preliminary Closing Working Capital"). In the event
that the Preliminary Closing Working Capital on the Preliminary Closing Balance
Sheet is $50,000 or more less than the Target Amount, the amount of such
deficiency shall be deducted from the $120,000,000 portion of the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable at the Closing under Section 1.7(a) (as so
adjusted, the "Preliminary Merger Consideration").

          (b) Not later than 30 calendar days after the Closing Date, the
Shareholders' Representative shall deliver to the Buyer a balance sheet of the
Company and the Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 2.4) as of the Closing Date
(the "Closing Balance Sheet"). The Closing Balance Sheet shall be audited by
Ernst & Young LLP (the "Company's Auditor") and shall be prepared in accordance
with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied
consistently with the Company's past practice (to the extent such past practices
are consistent with GAAP), subject to the adjustments set forth in this Section
1.8 (which shall be in addition to and not in lieu of those required by GAAP).
The cost of the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet shall be paid one half
by the Company Shareholders, whose share of the cost thereof shall be paid from
the Escrow Fund (as defined in Section 1.11), and one half by the Buyer;
provided, however that the Buyer's share of the cost of the preparation of the
Closing Balance Sheet shall not exceed $30,000. The Closing Balance Sheet shall
(i) exclude as liabilities of the Company up to $300,000 of financial advisor,
legal and accounting expenses incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries (as
defined in Section 2.4) to be borne by the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to Section 4.8 of this Agreement, and also exclude as liabilities the
portion of those expenses which are deducted from the Preliminary Merger
Consideration and paid to the professional advisors as of the Closing from
amounts otherwise included in the Preliminary Merger Consideration; and (ii)
exclude as an asset any loan payable to the Company by any employee or former
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, provided that all repayments
of such loans by applications of the Preliminary Merger Consideration or other
payments received by the Company within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date
shall be included as assets of the Company for purposes of the Closing Balance
Sheet and adjustments in the Merger Consideration relating thereto. The Buyer
shall afford the Shareholders' Representative and the Company's Auditor
reasonable access to the Company's books and


                                      -12-
<PAGE>   18

records during normal business hours for purposes of the preparation of the
Closing Balance Sheet.

          (c) The Closing Balance Sheet delivered pursuant to paragraph (b)
above shall be accompanied by (i) relevant backup materials and schedules, in
detail reasonably acceptable to the Buyer, (ii) copies of all accounting work
papers relevant to the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet, and (iii) a
statement setting forth the amount, if any, by which the Closing Working Capital
is greater than, or less than, $3,500,000 (the "Target Amount") (the amount of
such difference, as it may be adjusted pursuant to the resolution of any
disputes resolved pursuant to paragraph (d) below, the "Closing Working Capital
Adjustment") (with the Closing Working Capital Adjustment to be expressed as a
positive number if the Closing Working Capital on the Closing Balance Sheet is
greater than the Target Amount and as a negative number if the Closing Working
Capital on the Closing Balance Sheet is less than the Target Amount). For
purposes of this Agreement, "Closing Working Capital" shall mean the total
consolidated current assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries minus the total
consolidated current liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including
in current assets all cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, unbilled
receivables, inventory and prepaid expenses and excluding from current assets
all income tax assets, and including in current liabilities accounts payable and
accrued expenses, and excluding from current liabilities income tax
liabilities).

          (d) In the event that the Buyer disputes the Closing Balance Sheet or
the calculation of the Closing Working Capital, the Buyer shall notify the
Shareholders' Representative in writing (the "Dispute Notice") of the amount,
nature and basis of such dispute, within 30 calendar days after delivery of the
Closing Balance Sheet. In the event of such a dispute, the Buyer and the
Shareholders' Representative shall first use their diligent good faith efforts
to resolve such dispute between themselves. If the parties are unable to resolve
the dispute within 30 calendar days after delivery of the Dispute Notice, then
any remaining items in dispute shall be submitted to an independent nationally
recognized accounting firm selected in writing by the Shareholders'
Representative and the Buyer or, if the Shareholders' Representative and the
Buyer fail or refuse to select a firm within 10 calendar days after written
request therefor by the Shareholders' Representative or the Buyer, such an
independent nationally recognized accounting firm shall be selected in
accordance with the rules of the Boston, Massachusetts office of the American
Arbitration Association (the "Arbitrator"). All determinations pursuant to this
paragraph (d) shall be in writing and shall be delivered to the Parties. The
determination of the Arbitrator as to the resolution of any dispute shall be
binding and conclusive upon all Parties. A judgment on the determination made by
the Arbitrator pursuant to this Section 1.8 may be entered in and enforced by
any court having jurisdiction thereover.

          (e) The fees and expenses of the Arbitrator in connection with the
resolution of disputes pursuant to paragraph (d) above shall be shared equally
by the Company Shareholders and the Buyer; PROVIDED, however, that if the
Arbitrator determines that one Party has adopted a position or positions with
respect to the Closing Balance Sheet or the calculation


                                      -13-
<PAGE>   19


of the Closing Working Capital that is frivolous or clearly without merit, the
Arbitrator may, in its discretion, assign a greater portion of any such fees and
expenses to such Party.

          (f)  Immediately upon the expiration of the 30-day period for giving
the Dispute Notice, if no Dispute Notice is given, or upon notification by the
Buyer to the Shareholders' Representative that no Dispute Notice will be given,
or immediately upon the resolution of disputes, if any, pursuant to this Section
1.8, the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted as follows (as so adjusted, the
"Adjusted Merger Consideration"):

               (i)   If the Closing Working Capital Adjustment is negative, such
deficiency shall be deducted from the Merger Consideration to obtain the
Adjusted Merger Consideration.

               (ii)  If the Closing Working Capital Adjustment is zero, the
Adjusted Merger Consideration shall be equal to the Merger Consideration.

               (iii) If the Closing Working Capital Adjustment is positive, such
additional amount shall be added to the Merger Consideration to obtain the
Adjusted Merger Consideration.

     1.9  PAYMENTS ON ACCOUNT OF ADJUSTMENTS. In the event the Adjusted Merger
Consideration is greater than the Preliminary Merger Consideration, the Buyer
shall pay the amount owing to the Company Shareholders upon the expiration of
the 30-day period for giving the Dispute Notice, if no Dispute Notice is given,
or upon notification by the Buyer to the Shareholders' Representative that no
Dispute Notice will be given, or immediately upon final resolution of any
dispute in connection with the determination of the Adjusted Merger
Consideration. In the event the Adjusted Merger Consideration is less than the
Preliminary Merger Consideration, the Company Shareholders shall pay the amount
owing to the Buyer upon the expiration of the 30-day period for giving the
Dispute Notice, if no Dispute Notice is given, or upon notification by the Buyer
to the Shareholders' Representative that no Dispute Notice will be given, or
immediately upon final resolution of any dispute in connection with the
determination of the Adjusted Merger Consideration. Any amounts payable to the
Buyer pursuant to this Section 1.9 shall be promptly paid solely from the Escrow
Fund. Any amounts payable to the Company Shareholders pursuant to this Section
1.9 shall be promptly deposited with the Exchange Agent for distribution by the
Exchange Agent to the Company Shareholders.

     1.10 SHAREHOLDERS' REPRESENTATIVE.

          (a) In order to efficiently administer the transactions contemplated
hereby, including (i) the determination of the Closing Working Capital
Adjustment and the Adjusted Merger Consideration, (ii) the waiver of any
condition to the obligations of the Company and the Company Shareholders to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) the defense and/or
settlement of any claims for which the Company Shareholders may be required to


                                      -14-
<PAGE>   20


indemnify the Buyer and/or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Article VI
hereof, the Company Shareholders, by the approval and adoption of this
Agreement, shall designate RH Investments 2001 LLC as their representative (the
"Shareholders' Representative"). The parties acknowledge that the Company and
the Shareholders' Representative shall, prior to the Closing, direct by joint
written notice(s) to the Buyer and the Exchange Agent that, on the Closing Date
(i) a portion of the Preliminary Merger Consideration, not to exceed an amount
to be disclosed in the Information Statement (as defined in Section 4.3) (the
"Shareholders' Representative Fund"), shall be withheld and paid directly by the
Buyer to an account designated in such notice, as a fund for the fees and
expenses of the Shareholders' Representative incurred in connection with this
Agreement, with any balance of the Shareholders' Representative Fund not
incurred for such purposes to be returned to the Company Shareholders in
proportion to their interests in the Escrow Fund, and in such manner that the
Shareholders' Representative and the Company may prior to the Closing agree in
writing, and (ii) a portion of the Preliminary Merger Consideration, in excess
of the $300,000 of such expenses to be borne by the Buyer under Section 4.8, but
not to exceed an amount to be disclosed in the Information Statement, shall be
paid directly by the Buyer to certain financial and professional advisors and
legal counsel to the Company in amounts to be set forth in such joint written
notice (such amounts, after deducting such $300,000 sum, the "Expenses").

          (b) The Company Shareholders by the approval and adoption of this
Agreement authorize the Shareholders' Representative (i) to make all decisions
relating to the determination of the Closing Working Capital Adjustment and the
Adjusted Merger Consideration, (ii) to take all action necessary in connection
with the waiver of any condition to the obligations of the Company Shareholders
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, or the defense and/or
settlement of any claims for which the Company Shareholders may be required to
indemnify the Buyer and/or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Article VI
hereof, (iii) to give and receive all notices required to be given under the
Agreement, and (iv) to take any and all additional action as is contemplated to
be taken by or on behalf of the Company Shareholders by the terms of this
Agreement.

          (c) In the event that the Shareholders' Representative dies, becomes
unable to perform his or her responsibilities hereunder or resigns from such
position, the Company Shareholders holding, prior to the Closing, a majority of
the Company Shares (on an as-converted basis) immediately prior to the Effective
Time are authorized to and shall select another representative to fill such
vacancy and such substituted representative shall be deemed to be the
Shareholders' Representative for all purposes of this Agreement and the
documents delivered pursuant hereto.

          (d) All decisions and actions by the Shareholders' Representative,
including without limitation any agreement between the Shareholders'
Representative and the Buyer relating to the determination of the Closing
Working Capital Adjustment and/or the Adjusted Merger Consideration, or the
defense or settlement of any claims for which the Company Shareholders may be
required to indemnify the Buyer and/or the Surviving Corporation pursuant


                                      -15-
<PAGE>   21


to Article VI hereof, shall be binding upon all of the Company Shareholders, and
no Company Shareholder shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or
otherwise contest the same.

          (e)  The Shareholders' Representative shall not have any liability to
any of the Parties or the Company Shareholders for any act done or omitted
hereunder as Shareholders' Representative while acting in good faith and in the
exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the
advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Company
Shareholders shall severally indemnify the Shareholders' Representative and hold
him harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross
negligence or bad faith on the part of the Shareholders' Representative and
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of his
duties hereunder.

          (f)  By his, her or its approval of the Merger, this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, each Company Shareholder agrees, in addition to the foregoing,
that:

               (i)   the Buyer shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the
instructions and decisions of the Shareholders' Representative as to the
determination of the Closing Working Capital Adjustment and/or the Adjusted
Merger Consideration, or the settlement of any claims for indemnification by the
Buyer and/or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Article VI hereof, or any
other actions required or permitted to be taken by the Shareholders'
Representative hereunder, and no party hereunder shall have any cause of action
against the Buyer for any action taken by the Buyer in reliance upon the
instructions or decisions of the Shareholders' Representative;

               (ii)  all actions, decisions and instructions of the
Shareholders' Representative shall be conclusive and binding upon all of the
Company Shareholders and no Company Shareholder shall have any cause of action
against the Shareholders' Representative for any action taken, decision made or
instruction given by the Shareholders' Representative under this Agreement,
except for Fraud (as defined in Section 6.4) or willful misconduct by the
Shareholders' Representative in connection with the matters described in this
Section 1.10;

               (iii) the provisions of this Section 1.10 are independent and
severable, are irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall be enforceable
notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Company Shareholder may have in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

               (iv)  remedies available at law for any breach of the provisions
of this Section 1.10 are inadequate; therefore, the Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief
without the necessity of proving damages if either the Buyer and/or the
Surviving Corporation brings an action to enforce the provisions of this Section
1.10; and


                                      -16-
<PAGE>   22


               (v)   the provisions of this Section 1.10 shall be binding upon
the executors, heirs, legal representatives, personal representatives, successor
trustees and successors of each Company Shareholder, and any references in this
Agreement to a Company Shareholder or the Company Shareholders shall mean and
include the successors to the Company Shareholder's rights hereunder, whether
pursuant to testamentary disposition, the laws of descent and distribution or
otherwise.

     1.11 ESCROW.

          (a)  On the Closing Date, the Buyer shall (or shall cause the
Transitory Subsidiary to) deliver to the Escrow Agent a wire transfer in the
amount of $20,000,000, which amount shall be deemed withheld from the total
$140,000,000 of Merger Consideration defined in Section 1.5(a) of this Agreement
and shall be deposited with the Escrow Agent for the purpose of securing the
indemnification and Merger Consideration adjustment obligations of the Company
Shareholders set forth in this Agreement. Such $20,000,000 (together with all
accrued interest thereon, the "Escrow Fund") shall be deemed to have been
withheld from each Company Shareholder pro rata in the same proportion as the
total amount of Merger Consideration payable to such Shareholder under Section
1.5 bears to the Merger Consideration payable to all holders of Company Shares
pursuant to Section 1.5. The Escrow Fund shall be held by the Escrow Agent under
the Escrow Agreement pursuant to the terms thereof. The Escrow Fund shall be
held as a trust fund and shall not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee
process or any other judicial process of any creditor of any party, and shall be
held and disbursed solely for the purposes and in accordance with the terms of
the Escrow Agreement.

          (b)  The adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger by
the Company Shareholders shall constitute approval of the Escrow Agreement and
of all of the arrangements relating thereto, including without limitation the
placement of the Escrow Fund in escrow in accordance with the terms thereof.

     1.12 ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS.

          (a)  The Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Effective Time shall be in the form attached to the
Agreement of Merger.

          (b)  The By-laws of the Surviving Corporation immediately following
the Effective Time shall be the same as the By-laws of the Transitory Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of the corporation
set forth therein shall be changed to the name of the Company.

     1.13 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. The directors of the Transitory Subsidiary
shall become the directors of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time. Officers of the Transitory Subsidiary shall become the officers of the
Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time, in their respective positions as
with the Transitory Subsidiary.

     1.14 NO FURTHER RIGHTS. From and after the Effective Time, no Company
Shares shall be deemed to be outstanding, and holders of certificates formerly
representing Company Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto
except as provided herein or by law.

     1.15 CLOSING OF TRANSFER BOOKS. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of Company Shares shall
thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, certificates formerly
representing Company Shares are presented to the Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration
in accordance with Section 1.5, subject to Section 1.11 and to applicable law in
the case of Dissenting Shares.

     1.16 TAXES. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the
Buyer shall have the right to withhold or cause the Exchange Agent to withhold
Taxes from any payments to be made hereunder (including any payments to be made
under the Escrow Agreement) if such withholding is required by law and to
collect Forms W-8 or W-9, as applicable, from the Company Shareholders.

requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended (the "Hart-Scott-Rodino Act") and the filing of the California Merger

     2.6 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The Company has provided to the Buyer (a) the

Sheet") and statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows

consistent basis throughout the periods covered thereby, fairly present the
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and the
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and for the periods referred to
therein and are consistent with the books and records of the Company and the
Subsidiaries.

     2.7  ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES. Since the Balance Sheet Date, (a) there
has not been any material adverse change in the assets, business, financial
condition, results of operations or future prospects of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, nor to the Company's best knowledge has there
occurred any event or development which could reasonably be foreseen to result
in such a material adverse change in the future, and (b) neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary has taken any of the actions set forth in paragraphs (a) through
(o) of Section 4.4 below without, in the case of events arising after the date
of this Agreement, the prior written consent of the Buyer.

     2.8  UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. None of the Company and its Subsidiaries has
any liability (whether known or unknown, whether absolute or contingent, whether
liquidated or unliquidated and whether due or to become due), except for (a)
liabilities accrued or expressly reserved for on the Most Recent Balance Sheet,
a copy of which is included in Section 2.8 of the Disclosure Schedule, (b)
liabilities which have arisen since the Balance Sheet Date in the Ordinary
Course of Business and which are similar in nature and amount to the liabilities
which arose during the comparable period of time in the immediately preceding
fiscal period and (c) contractual liabilities incurred in the Ordinary Course of
Business of the Company and its Subsidiaries which are not required by GAAP to
be reflected on a balance sheet and that are not in the aggregate material.

     2.9  TAX MATTERS.

          (a)  For purposes of this Agreement:

               (i) The term "Taxes" means (x) all taxes, and any and all other
charges, fees, levies, duties, deficiencies, customs or other similar
assessments or liabilities in the nature of a tax, including without limitation
any income, gross receipts, ad valorem, premium, value-added, excise, severance,
stamp, occupation, windfall profits, real property, personal property, sales,
use, transfer, transfer gains, withholding, employment, unemployment, insurance,
social security, business license, business organization, environmental, workers
compensation, payroll, profits, license, lease, service, service use, and
franchise taxes imposed by any federal, state, local, or foreign government, or
any agency or political subdivision thereof, (y) any interest, fines, penalties,
assessments, or additions resulting from, attributable to, or incurred in
connection with any items described in this paragraph or any contest or dispute


                                      -22-
<PAGE>   28


thereof, and (z) any items described in this paragraph that are attributable to
another person but that the Company or any Subsidiary is liable to pay by law,
by contract, or otherwise; and

               (ii) The term "Tax Returns" means all reports, returns,
declarations, statements, forms, or other information required to be supplied to
a taxing authority or to any individual or entity in connection with Taxes and
any associated schedules or work papers provided in connection with such items.

          (b)  Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries has properly filed on a
timely basis all Tax Returns that it was required to file, and all such Tax
Returns were correct and complete in all respects. Each of the Company and the
Subsidiaries has properly paid on a timely basis all Taxes, whether or not shown
on any of its Tax Returns, that were due and payable. All Taxes that the Company
and any Subsidiary is or was required by law to withhold or collect have been
withheld or collected and, to the extent required, have been properly paid on a
timely basis to the appropriate Governmental Entity.

          (c)  The unpaid Taxes of the Company and the Subsidiaries for periods
through the date of the Most Recent Balance Sheet do not exceed the accruals and
reserves for Taxes (excluding reserves for deferred Taxes) set forth on the Most
Recent Balance Sheet. All Taxes attributable to the period from and after the
date of the Most Recent Balance Sheet and continuing through the Closing Date
are attributable to the conduct by the Company and the Subsidiaries of their
respective operations in the Ordinary Course of Business and are consistent both
as to type and amount with Taxes attributable to such comparable period in the
immediately preceding year.

          (d)  Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is or has ever been a
member of any group of corporations with which it has filed (or been required to
file) consolidated, combined, or unitary Tax Returns, other than a group of
which only the Company and the Subsidiaries are or were members. Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary has any actual or potential liability under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of federal, state, local,
or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise for any
Taxes of any person (including without limitation any affiliated, combined, or
unitary group of corporations or other entities that included the Company or any
Subsidiary during a prior Tax period) other than the Company and the
Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to, bound by, or
obligated under any Tax allocation, Tax sharing, or Tax indemnity agreement.

          (e)  The Company has delivered to the Buyer correct and complete
copies of all income Tax Returns, examination reports, and statements of
deficiencies assessed against or agreed to by any of the Company or any
Subsidiary with respect to all taxable years for which the applicable statute of
limitations has not run. No examination or audit of any Tax Return of the
Company or any Subsidiary by any Governmental Entity is currently in progress
or, to the best knowledge of the Company or any Subsidiary, threatened or
contemplated, and neither the


                                      -23-
<PAGE>   29


Company nor any Subsidiary knows of any basis upon which a Tax deficiency or
assessment could reasonably be expected to be asserted against the Company or
any Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has been informed by any
jurisdiction that the jurisdiction believes that the Company or any Subsidiary
was required to file any Tax Return that was not filed.

          (f) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has in effect currently any
waiver of any statute of limitations with respect to Taxes or agreed to an
extension of time with respect to an assessment of or deficiency in Taxes that
is currently in effect.

          (g) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to any Tax
litigation or, to the best knowledge of the Company or any Subsidiary, is the
subject of any Tax audit. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is and neither
has been a party to any specific transaction the main purpose of which has been
to avoid, defer, or reduce Taxes. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is and
neither has been a party to any transaction or agreement that is in conflict
with the Tax rules on transfer pricing in any relevant jurisdiction. The Company
has disclosed on its federal income Tax Returns all positions taken therein that
could give rise to a substantial understatement of federal income Tax within the
meaning of Section 6662 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code").

          (h) There are no liens or other encumbrances with respect to Taxes
upon any of the assets or properties of the Company or any Subsidiary, other
than with respect to Taxes not yet due and payable.

          (i) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a "consenting
corporation" within the meaning of Section 341(f) of the Code, and none of the
assets of the Company or any Subsidiary are subject to an election under Section
341(f) of the Code.

          (j) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has been a United States
real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the
Code during the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the
Code.

          (k) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has made any payments, is
obligated to make any payments or is a party to any agreement, contract,

welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), and any other
written or oral plan, agreement or arrangement involving direct or indirect
compensation, including without limitation insurance coverage, severance
benefits, disability benefits, pension, retirement plans, profit sharing,
deferred compensation, bonuses, stock options, stock purchase, phantom stock,
stock appreciation or other forms of incentive compensation or post-retirement
compensation. Full reservations have been made in the Financial Statements for
all present and future liabilities in respect of pensions and other payments
related to compensation to be paid to employees. For purposes of this Agreement,

of corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code), (ii) a group of
trades or businesses under common control (as defined in Section 414(c) of the
Code), or (iii) an affiliated service group (as defined under Section 414(m) of

Employee Benefit Plans which have been


                                      -34-

Plans, (iii) all related trust agreements, insurance contracts and summary plan
descriptions, (iv) all annual reports filed on IRS Form 5500, 5500C or 5500R for
the last three plan years for each Employee Benefit Plan, (v) copies of the most
recent reports relating to compliance with Sections 401(k), 401(m) and 410(b) of
the Code, and (vi) all employee handbooks have been delivered to the Buyer. Each
Employee Benefit Plan has been administered in accordance with its terms and
each of the Company, the Subsidiaries and the ERISA Affiliates has met its
obligations with respect to such Employee Benefit Plan and has made all required
contributions thereto. The Company, each Subsidiary and all Employee Benefit
Plans are in compliance with the currently applicable provisions of ERISA and
the Code and other applicable federal, state and local laws and the regulations
thereunder (including without limitation Section 4980B of the Code, Subtitle K,
Chapter 100 of the Code and Sections 601 through 608 and Section 701 ET SEQ. of
ERISA). All filings and reports as to each Employee Benefit Plan required to

Department of Labor have been duly submitted.

          (b) There are no inquiries or investigations by any Governmental
Entity, termination proceedings or other claims (except claims for benefits
payable in the normal operation of the Employee Benefit Plans and proceedings
with respect to qualified domestic relations orders), suits or proceedings
against or involving any Employee Benefit Plan or asserting any such claims
under any Employee Benefit Plan.

          (c) All the Employee Benefit Plans that are intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code have received determination letters from the
Internal Revenue Service to the effect that such Employee Benefit Plans are
qualified and the plans and the trusts related thereto are exempt from federal
income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, no
such determination letter has been revoked and revocation has not been
threatened, and no such Employee Benefit Plan has been amended or operated since
the date of its most recent determination letter or application therefor in any
respect, and no act or omission has occurred, that would adversely affect its
qualification. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any
action, or failed to take an action, that would increase the cost of any
Employee Benefit Plan, nor will the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
give rise to any increased cost or liabilities with respect to any Employee
Benefit Plan. Each Employee Benefit Plan which is required to satisfy Section
401(k)(3) or Section 401(m)(2) of the Code has been tested for compliance with,
and satisfies the requirements of, Section 401(k)(3) and Section (m)(2) of the
Code for each plan year ending prior to the Closing Date.

          (d) Neither the Company, any Subsidiary, nor any ERISA Affiliate has
ever maintained an Employee Benefit Plan subject to Section 412 of the Code or
Title IV of ERISA.

          (e) At no time has the Company, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate
been obligated to contribute to any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section
4001(a)(3) of ERISA).

          (f) There are no unfunded obligations under any Employee Benefit Plan
providing benefits after termination of employment to any employee of the
Company or any Subsidiary (or to any beneficiary of any such employee),
including but not limited to retiree health coverage and deferred compensation,
but excluding continuation of health coverage required to be continued under
Section 4980B of the Code or any similar state law and insurance conversion
privileges under state law. The assets of each Employee Benefit Plan which is
funded are reported at their fair market value on the books and records of such
Employee Benefit Plan.

          (g) No act or omission has occurred and no condition exists with
respect to any Employee Benefit Plan maintained by the Company, any Subsidiary
or any ERISA Affiliate that would subject the Company, any Subsidiary or any
ERISA Affiliate to any (i) fine, penalty, tax or liability imposed under ERISA
or the Code (other than liabilities incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business
that are consistent with the Code and ERISA, including liabilities for benefits,
contributions, premiums and other similar costs), or (ii) contractual
indemnification or contribution obligation protecting any fiduciary, insurer or
service provider with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan.

          (h) No Employee Benefit Plan is funded by, associated with, or related
to a "voluntary employee's beneficiary association" within the meaning of
Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

          (i) No Employee Benefit Plan, plan documentation or agreement, summary
plan description or other written communication distributed generally to
employees by its terms prohibits the Company from amending or terminating any
such Employee Benefit Plan and any Employee Benefit Plan may be terminated
without liability to the Company, any Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation or
the Buyer, except for benefits accrued through the date of termination and
administrative and professional costs incurred in such termination. No former
employees participate in any welfare benefit plans listed in Section 2.19(a) of
the Disclosure Schedule. No Employee Benefit Plan includes in its assets any
securities issued by the Company or any Subsidiary. No Employee Benefit Plan has
been subject to tax under Section 511 of the Code.

          (j) Section 2.19(j) of the Disclosure Schedule discloses each: (i)
agreement with any director, executive officer or other key employee of the
Company or any Subsidiary (A) the benefits of which are contingent, or the terms
of which are altered, upon the occurrence of a transaction involving the Company
or any Subsidiary of the nature of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (B) providing any term of employment or compensation guarantee or (C)
providing severance benefits or other benefits after the termination of
employment of such director, executive officer or key employee; (ii) agreement,
plan or arrangement under which any person may receive payments from the Company
or any Subsidiary that may be subject to the tax imposed by Section 4999 of the
Code or included in the determination of such person's "parachute payment" under
Section 280G of the Code; and (iii) agreement or plan binding the Company or any
Subsidiary, including without limitation any

stock option plan, stock appreciation right plan, restricted stock plan, stock
purchase plan, severance benefit plan, or any Employee Benefit Plan, any of the
benefits of which will be increased, or the vesting of the benefits of which
will be accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the value of any of the benefits of which will be
calculated on the basis of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

          (k) Section 2.22(k) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth the policy
of the Company and any Subsidiary with respect to accrued vacation, accrued sick
time and earned time-off and the amount of such liabilities as of December 31,
2000.

          (l) Each individual who has received compensation for the performance
of services on behalf of the Company, any of the Company's Subsidiaries or its
ERISA Affiliates, has been properly classified as an employee or independent
contractor in accordance with applicable law.

     2.20 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

          (a) Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries has complied and is in
compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws (as defined below). There is
no pending or, to the best knowledge of the Company, threatened civil or

Entity, relating to any Environmental Law involving the Company or any
Subsidiary. For purposes of this Agreement, "Environmental Law" means any
federal, state or local law, statute, rule or regulation or the common law

federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of
1980 ("CERCLA").

          (b) There have been no releases of any Materials of Environmental
Concern (as defined below) into the environment at any parcel of real property
or any facility formerly or currently owned, leased, operated or controlled by
the Company or a Subsidiary for which the


                                      -37-
<PAGE>   43


Company or any Subsidiary may be liable under any Environmental Law. With
respect to any such releases of Materials of Environmental Concern, the Company
or a Subsidiary has given all required notices to Governmental Entities (copies
of which have been provided to the Buyer). Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary is aware of any other releases of Materials of Environmental Concern
at parcels of real property or facilities (including, without limitation, those
owned, leased, operated or controlled by the Company or a Subsidiary) that could
reasonably be expected to have an impact on the real property or facilities
owned, operated or controlled by the Company or a Subsidiary. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Materials of Environmental Concern" means any chemicals,
pollutants or contaminants, hazardous substances (as such term is defined under
CERCLA or any Environmental Law), solid wastes and hazardous wastes (as such
terms are defined under the federal Resources Conservation and Recovery Act or
any Environmental Law), toxic materials, oil or petroleum and petroleum
products, asbestos, or any other material subject to regulation under any
Environmental Law.

          (c) Set forth in Section 2.20(c) of the Disclosure Schedule is a list

by the Company or any Subsidiary (whether conducted by or on behalf of the
Company, a Subsidiary or a third party, and whether done at the initiative of
the Company or a Subsidiary or directed by a Governmental Entity or other third
party) issued or conducted during the past ten years and relating to premises
currently or previously owned, leased, or operated by the Company or a
Subsidiary. Complete and accurate copies of each such report, and the results of
each such investigation or audit, have been provided to the Buyer.

          (d) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is aware of any material
environmental liability on the part of any of the solid or hazardous waste
transporters and treatment, storage and disposal facilities that have been
utilized by the Company or a Subsidiary.

     2.21 LEGAL COMPLIANCE. Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries, and the
conduct and operations of their respective businesses, are and have been in
compliance with each law (including rules and regulations thereunder) of any
federal, state, local or foreign government, or any Governmental Entity, which

businesses.

     2.22 PERMITS. Section 2.22 of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of

held by the Company or any Subsidiary. Such listed Permits are the only Permits
that are required for the Company and the Subsidiaries to conduct their
respective businesses as presently conducted or as proposed to be conducted.
Each such Permit is in full force and effect and, to the best knowledge of the
Company, no suspension or cancellation of such Permit is threatened and there is
no basis for believing that such Permit will not be


                                      -38-

renewable upon expiration. Each such Permit will continue in full force and

maintained by the Company or a Subsidiary shall not be excluded from Buyer's

respective Subsidiaries to continue the employment of any Continuing Employee
for any period of time following the Effective Time.

8 and 9), 2.7 (items 6, 8, 17 and 20), 2.8 (items 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16
and 17), 2.9, 2.14 (item 16), 2.17 and 2.18(f) of the Disclosure Schedule
(collectively, the "Section 6.1(e) Matters"); or

          (f) any liability, obligation or claim arising out of or relating to
any payment required to be made under the terms of the Outlook Release, as
defined in Section 2.7 of the Disclosure Schedule.

     6.2  INDEMNIFICATION BY THE BUYER. In the event the Closing occurs, and
subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6.5, the Buyer shall indemnify
the Company Shareholders in respect of, and hold them harmless against, any and
all Damages incurred or suffered by the Company Shareholders resulting from,
relating to or constituting any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or failure
to perform any covenant or agreement of the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary
contained in this Agreement or the Buyer Certificate.

     6.3  INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS.

          (a) A party entitled, or seeking to assert rights, to indemnification
under this Article VI (an "Indemnified Party") shall give written notification
to the party from whom indemnification is sought (an "Indemnifying Party") of
the commencement of any suit or proceeding relating to a third party claim for
which indemnification pursuant to this Article VI may be sought. Such
notification shall be given within 20 business days after receipt by the
Indemnified Party of notice of such suit or proceeding, shall be accompanied by
reasonable supporting documentation submitted by such third party (to the extent
then in the possession of the Indemnified Party) and shall describe in
reasonable detail (to the extent known by the Indemnified Party) the facts
constituting the basis for such suit or proceeding and the amount of the claimed
damages; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no delay or deficiency on the part of the


                                      -54-
<PAGE>   60


Indemnified Party in so notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any liability or obligation hereunder except to the extent
of any damage or liability caused by or arising out of such failure. Within 20
days after delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon
written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense
of such suit or proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) the Indemnifying Party may only
assume control of such defense if it acknowledges in writing to the Indemnified
Party that any damages, fines, costs or other liabilities that may be assessed
against the Indemnified Party in connection with such suit or proceeding
constitute Damages for which the Indemnified Party shall be indemnified pursuant
to this Article VI, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party may not assume control of
the defense of a suit or proceeding involving criminal liability or in which any
relief other than monetary damages is sought against the Indemnified Party. If
the Indemnifying Party does not so assume control of such defense, the
Indemnified Party shall control such defense. The party not controlling such
defense (the "Non-controlling Party") may participate therein at its own
expense; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the Indemnifying Party assumes control of
such defense and the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes that the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests or
different defenses available with respect to such suit or proceeding, the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party shall be
considered "Damages" for purposes of this Agreement. The party controlling such
defense (the "Controlling Party") shall keep the Non-controlling Party advised
of the status of such suit or proceeding and the defense thereof and shall
consider in good faith recommendations made by the Non-controlling Party with
respect thereto. The Non-controlling Party shall furnish the Controlling Party
with such information as it may have with respect to such suit or proceeding
(including copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading which may have
been served on such party and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or
other document evidencing or asserting the same) and shall otherwise cooperate
with and assist the Controlling Party in the defense of such suit or proceeding.
The Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any
judgment arising from, any such suit or proceeding without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the consent of the Indemnified Party shall not
be required if the Indemnifying Party agrees in writing to pay any amounts
payable pursuant to such settlement or judgment and such settlement or judgment
includes a complete release of the Indemnified Party from further liability and
has no other adverse effect on the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party
shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from,
any such suit or proceeding without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

          (b) In order to seek indemnification under this Article VI, an
Indemnified Party shall give written notification (a "Claim Notice") to the
Indemnifying Party which contains (i) a description and the amount (the "Claimed
Amount") of any Damages incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the
Indemnified Party, (ii) a statement that the Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification under this Article VI for such Damages and a reasonable
explanation of the basis therefor, and (iii) a demand for payment (in the manner
provided in paragraph (c)


                                      -55-
<PAGE>   61


below) in the amount of such Damages. If the Indemnified Party is the Buyer, the
Indemnifying Party shall deliver a copy of the Claim Notice to the Escrow Agent.

          (c) Within 20 days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying
Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a written response (the "Response")
in which the Indemnifying Party shall: (i) agree that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount (in which case the Response shall
be accompanied by a payment by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party
of the Claimed Amount, by check or by wire transfer, provided that if the
Indemnified Party is (A) the Buyer, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, within three days following the
delivery of the Response, a written notice executed by both parties instructing
the Escrow Agent to disburse the Claimed Amount to the Buyer, or (B) the Company
Shareholders, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the Claimed Amount in accordance
with a payment and distribution method reasonably acceptable to the Buyer and
the Shareholders' Representative), (ii) agree that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to receive part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount (the "Agreed
Amount") (in which case the Response shall be accompanied by a payment by the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of the Agreed Amount, by check or by
wire transfer; provided that if the Indemnified Party is (A) the Buyer, the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Escrow Agent,
within three days following the delivery of the Response, a written notice
executed by both parties instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the Agreed
Amount to the Buyer, or (B) the Company Shareholders, the Indemnifying Party
shall pay the Agreed Amount in accordance with a payment and distribution method
reasonably acceptable to the Buyer and the Shareholders' Representative), or
(iii) dispute that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the
Claimed Amount.

          (d) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 6.3, if a
third party asserts (other than by means of a lawsuit) that an Indemnified Party
is liable to such third party for a monetary or other obligation which may
constitute or result in Damages (not to exceed $200,000) for which such
Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article
VI, and such Indemnified Party reasonably determines that it has a valid
business reason to fulfill such obligation, then (i) such Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to satisfy such obligation, without prior notice to or consent
from the Indemnifying Party, (ii) such Indemnified Party may subsequently make a
claim for indemnification in accordance with the provisions of this Article VI,
and (iii) such Indemnified Party shall be reimbursed, in accordance with the
provisions of this Article VI, for any such Damages for which it is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Article VI (subject to the right of the
Indemnifying Party to dispute the Indemnified Party's entitlement to
indemnification, or the amount for which it is entitled to indemnification,
under the terms of this Article VI).

          (e) In the event the Buyer makes a claim for indemnification pursuant
to the provisions of Section 6.1(f), then (i) the Buyer shall be entitled to
satisfy such obligation, without prior notice to or consent from the
Shareholders' Representative, and (ii) Buyer shall be reimbursed from the Escrow
Fund for any such Damages for which it is entitled to


                                      -56-
<PAGE>   62


indemnification pursuant to this Article VI without approval of or objection by
the Shareholders' Representative.

          (f) For purposes of this Section 6.3 and the last two sentences of
Section 6.4, (i) if the Company Shareholders comprise the Indemnifying Party,
any references to the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party (except
provisions relating to an obligation to make or a right to receive any payments
provided for in Section 6.3 or Section 6.4) shall be deemed to refer to the
Shareholders' Representative, and (ii) if the Company Shareholders comprise the
Indemnified Party, any references to the Indemnified Party (except provisions
relating to an obligation to make or a right to receive any payments provided
for in Section 6.3 or Section 6.4) shall be deemed to refer to the Shareholders'
Representative. The Shareholders' Representative shall have full power and
authority on behalf of each Company Shareholder to take any and all actions on
behalf of, execute any and all instruments on behalf of, and execute or waive
any and all rights of, the Company Shareholders under this Article VI. The
Shareholders' Representative shall have no liability to any Company Shareholder
for any action taken or omitted on behalf of the Company Shareholders pursuant
to this Article VI.

          (g) If at the time the last of the Section 6.1(e) Matters has been
fully resolved, the aggregate amount of the specific reserves, if any, for such
Section 6.1(e) Matters set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet is in excess of
the aggregate amount of Damages incurred by the Buyer with respect to such
Section 6.1(e) Matters, the amount of such excess shall be paid by the Buyer to
the Shareholders' Representative for distribution to the Company Shareholders in
proportion to their interests in the Escrow Fund.

     6.4  SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Except in the case of
Fraud (which, for purposes of this Agreement, shall mean an intentional and/or
knowing: (i) perversion of truth for the purpose of inducing another to rely
upon it, (ii) false representation of a material fact or (iii) concealment of
material fact which should have been disclosed, which in each case is intended
to deceive another party), all representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement, the Company Certificate or the Buyer Certificate shall (a) survive
the Closing and any investigation at any time made by or on behalf of an
Indemnified Party and (b) shall expire on the date 18 months following the
Closing Date. If an Indemnified Party delivers to an Indemnifying Party, before
expiration of a representation or warranty, either a Claim Notice based upon a
breach of such representation or warranty, or a notice that, as a result of a
legal proceeding instituted by or claim made by a third party, the Indemnified
Party reasonably expects to incur Damages (an "Expected Claim Notice"), then the
applicable representation or warranty shall survive until, but only for purposes
of, the resolution of the matter covered by such notice. If the legal proceeding
or written claim with respect to which an Expected Claim Notice has been given
is definitively withdrawn or resolved in favor of the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly so notify the Indemnifying Party; and if the
Indemnified Party has delivered a copy of the Expected Claim Notice to the
Escrow Agent and funds have been retained in escrow after the Termination Date
(as defined in the Escrow Agreement) with respect to such Expected Claim Notice,
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall


                                      -57-
<PAGE>   63


promptly deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice executed by both parties
instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse such retained funds to the Company
Shareholders in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

     6.5  LIMITATIONS.

          (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Buyer shall
not be entitled to recover any portion of the Escrow Fund under this Article VI
unless and until the aggregate Damages are in excess of $250,000 (at which point
the Buyer shall be entitled to recover from the Escrow Fund the aggregate
Damages in excess of $100,000, and not just amounts in excess of $250,000);
provided that the limitation set forth above shall not apply to a claim against
the Escrow Fund pursuant to (x) Section 1.8, (y) Section 6.1(a) relating to a
breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3
or 2.9 (or the portions of the Company Certificate relating thereto), or (z)
Section 6.1(b), (c), (d), (e) or (f).

          (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Buyer shall
not be liable under this Article VI unless and until the aggregate Damages for
which it would otherwise be liable exceed $250,000 (at which point the Buyer
shall become liable for the aggregate Damages in excess of $100,000, and not
just amounts in excess of $250,000); provided that the limitation set forth
above shall not apply to a claim pursuant to Section 6.2 relating to a breach of
the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1, 3.2 or 3.5 (or the
portions of the Buyer Certificate relating thereto).

          (c) Except in the case of Fraud, the Escrow Agreement shall be the
exclusive means for the Buyer to collect any Damages for which it is entitled to
indemnification under this Article VI. Except in the case of Fraud or
intentional misrepresentation, the Buyer's liability for all Damages shall not
exceed $20,000,000.

          (d) No Company Shareholder shall have any right of contribution
against the Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any breach by
the Company of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements.

          (e) The amount of any and all Damages for which indemnification is
provided pursuant to this Article VI shall be net of any amounts actually
received by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies with respect to such
Damages.

                                  TERMINATION

<PAGE>   64


          (b) the Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to
the Company in the event the Company is in breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement, and such breach, individually
or in combination with any other such breach, (i) would cause the conditions set
forth in clauses (c) or (d) of Section 5.2 not to be satisfied and (ii) is not
cured within 20 days following delivery by the Buyer to the Company of written
notice of such breach;

          (c) the Company may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice
to the Buyer in the event the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary is in breach of
any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement, and such
breach, individually or in combination with any other such breach, (i) would
cause the conditions set forth in clauses (a) or (b) of Section 5.3 not to be
satisfied and (ii) is not cured within 20 days following delivery by the Company
to the Buyer of written notice of such breach;

          (d) any Party may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to

the Merger failed to receive the Requisite Shareholder Approval;

          (e) the Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to
the Company if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before September 30,
2001 by reason of the failure of any condition precedent under Section 5.1 or

the Transitory Subsidiary of any representation, warranty or covenant contained
in this Agreement);

          (f) the Company may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice
to the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary if on or after September 1, 2001 the
Company shall have requested the bridge financing contemplated by Section 4.13
and the Buyer shall have thereafter notified the Company in writing that the
Buyer has elected not to provide such bridge financing as a result of the
occurrence of a material breach or default by the Company of any of its
obligations under this Agreement (which notice from the Buyer to the Company
shall also constitute an election by Buyer to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to the provisions of Section 7.1(b));

          (g) the Company may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice
to the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary if the Closing shall not have
occurred on or before September 30, 2001 by reason of the failure of any
condition precedent under Section 5.1 or 5.3 hereof (unless the failure results
directly from a breach by the Company of any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement); provided, however, that in the event the
Buyer provides bridge financing to the Company in accordance with the provisions
of Section 4.13, the Buyer shall have the right to extend the outside date for
termination of this Agreement by the Company from September 30, 2001 until
October 15, 2001; or


                                      -59-
<PAGE>   65


          (h) the Company may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice
to the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary if the Buyer receives an HSR
Additional Action Request from the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice and does not elect to comply
with such HSR Additional Action Request within fourteen days of receipt of such
request.

     7.2  EFFECT OF TERMINATION. If any Party terminates this Agreement pursuant
to Section 7.1, all obligations of the Parties hereunder shall terminate without
any liability of any Party to any other Party (except for any liability of any
Party for breaches of this Agreement).

hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery, expedited courier,

whom it is intended. Any Party may change the address to which notices,
requests, demands, claims, and other communications hereunder are to be
delivered by giving the other Parties notice in the manner herein set forth.

     9.8 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect
to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of

     9.9  AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. The Parties may mutually amend any provision
of this Agreement at any time prior to the Effective Time; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that any amendment effected subsequent to the Requisite Shareholder Approval
shall be subject to any restrictions contained in the Delaware General
Corporation Law and the California General Corporation Law. No amendment of any
provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by all of the Parties. No waiver of any right or remedy hereunder
shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Party
giving such waiver. No waiver by any Party with respect to any default,
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder shall be deemed to
extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach of
warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue
of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

     9.10 SEVERABILITY. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or
unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to limit the term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or
unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so
modified.

     9.11 SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION. Each of the Parties (a) submits to the
jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in Boston, Massachusetts in
any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, (b)
agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in any such court, and (c) agrees not to bring any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other court. Each
of the Parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other
security that might be required of any other Party with respect thereto. Any
Party may make service on another Party by sending or delivering a copy of the
process to the Party to be served at the address and in the manner provided for
the giving of notices in Section 9.7. Nothing in this Section 9.11, however,
shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by law.

     9.12 CONSTRUCTION.

          (a) The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the
language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of
strict construction shall be applied against any Party.
