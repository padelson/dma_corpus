bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of BMBC immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation,
in each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified.

 



 

 _2.5. Effects of the Merger_ _._

 



 

At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects as set
forth in the PBCL.

 



 

 _2.6. Tax Consequences._

 



 

It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement shall
constitute a "plan of reorganization" as that term is used in Sections 354 and
361 of the Code. From and after the date of this Agreement and until the
Closing, each party hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Merger to qualify, and will not knowingly take any action, cause any
action to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to be
taken, which action or failure to act could prevent the Merger from qualifying
as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. BMBC and RBPI each
hereby agrees to deliver certificates substantially in compliance with IRS
published advance ruling guidelines, with customary exceptions and
modifications thereto, to enable counsel to deliver the legal opinions
contemplated by Section 9.1.6, which certificates shall be effective as of the
date of such opinions.

 



 



 

 



   



 

 _2.7. Possible Alternative Structures._

 



 

Prior to the Effective Time, BMBC shall be entitled to change the structure of
the Merger or the Bank Merger, including, without limitation, by merging RBPI
into a wholly-owned Subsidiary of BMBC, without the approval of RBPI;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such change shall (a) adversely alter or
change the federal income Tax treatment of holders of RBPI Common Stock in
connection with the Merger from what such treatment would have been absent
such change; (b) alter or change the kind or amount of the consideration to be
paid to the holders of RBPI Common Stock under this Agreement; and (c) impede
or delay consummation of the Merger or the Bank Merger or otherwise adversely
affect RBPI or the holders of RBPI Common Stock in any material respect. The
parties hereto agree to appropriately amend this Agreement and any related
documents in order to reflect any such revised structure.

 



 

 _2.8. Bank Merger_ _._

 



 

The Bank Merger shall be consummated immediately after the Merger, or as
promptly as practicable thereafter. In furtherance of the foregoing, promptly
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, BMBC will cause BMT,
and RBPI will cause RBA, to execute and deliver an agreement and plan of
merger, substantially in the form attached to this Agreement as _Exhibit B_,
with respect to the Bank Merger.

 



 

 _2.9. Absence of Control._

 



 

Subject to any specific provisions of this Agreement, it is the intent of the
parties hereto that BMBC by reason of this Agreement shall not be deemed
(until consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) to control,
directly or indirectly, RBPI or to exercise, directly or indirectly, a
controlling influence over the management or policies of RBPI.

 



 

ARTICLE III 

CONVERSION OF SHARES

 



 

 _3.1. Conversion of RBPI Common Stock; Merger Consideration_ _._

 



 

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of BMBC, RBPI or the holders of any of the shares of RBPI Common Stock,
the Merger shall be effected in accordance with the following terms:

 



 

 _3.1.1. BMBC __Shares._ Each share of BMBC Common Stock that is issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued
and outstanding following the Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the
Merger.

 



 

 _3.1.2. Cancelled RBPI Shares. _All shares of RBPI Common Stock held in
the treasury of RBPI ("Treasury Stock") and each share of RBPI Common Stock
owned by BMBC immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares held
in a fiduciary or agency capacity) shall, at the Effective Time, cease to
exist, and the certificates for such shares shall be cancelled as promptly as
practicable thereafter, and no payment or distribution shall be made in
consideration therefor.

 



 



 

 



   



 

 _3.1.3. Merger Consideration_ _._ Subject to the provisions of this
Article III, each share of RBPI Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than as set forth in Section
3.1.2 above), except as to Dissenting Shares, shall become and be converted
into, as provided in and subject to the limitations set forth in this
Agreement, the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, subject to
adjustment in accordance with Section 3.1.5 hereof.

 



 

 _3.1.4. Rights __of RBPI Shares Post-Effective Time._ After the
Effective Time, shares of RBPI Common Stock shall be no longer outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, except as to
Dissenting Shares, and shall thereafter by operation of this section represent
only the right to receive Merger Consideration and any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto or any dividends or distributions with a
record date prior to the Effective Time that were declared or made by RBPI on
such shares of RBPI Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement on or prior to the Effective Time and which remain unpaid at the
Effective Time.

 



 

 _3.1.5. Stock Splits, Etc._ In the event BMBC changes (or establishes a
record date for changing) the number of, or provides for the exchange of,
shares of BMBC Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time
as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization,
reclassification, or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding BMBC
Common Stock and the record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective
Time, the Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately and appropriately adjusted;
_provided_ that no such adjustment shall be made with regard to BMBC Common
Stock if BMBC issues additional shares of BMBC Common Stock and receives fair
market value consideration for such shares.

 



 

 _3.1.6. No Fractional Shares. _Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of
BMBC Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for
exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to BMBC Common Stock shall
be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional
share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other
rights of a shareholder of BMBC. In lieu of the issuance of any such
fractional share, BMBC shall pay to each former shareholder of RBPI who
otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share, an amount in
cash (rounded to the nearest cent), determined by multiplying (a) the fraction
of a share (after taking into account all shares of RBPI Common Stock held by
such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest thousandth when
expressed in decimal form) of BMBC Common Stock to which such holder would
otherwise have been entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1, and (b) the
average of the daily closing sales prices of a share of BMBC Common Stock as
reported on NASDAQ for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding
the fifth calendar day prior to the Closing Date. For purposes of determining
any fractional share interest, all shares of RBPI Common Stock owned by a RBPI
shareholder shall be combined so as to calculate the maximum number of whole
shares of BMBC Common Stock issuable to such RBPI shareholder. For the
avoidance of doubt, the parties hereby acknowledge that BMBC is providing such
cash payments in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares of BMBC Common
Stock solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense of inconvenience to BMBC
of issuing such fractional shares, and such cash payments do not represent
separately bargained-for consideration in addition to the Merger Consideration
under this Agreement. The aggregate cash consideration paid by BMBC to RBPI's
shareholders in lieu of issuing fractional shares of BMBC Common Stock shall
not exceed one percent of the Merger Consideration. The fractional share
interests of each RBPI shareholder will be aggregated, and no RBPI shareholder
will receive cash consideration in lieu of the issuance of any fractional
shares of BMBC Common Stock in an amount equal to or greater than the value of
one full share of BMBC Common Stock.

 



 



 

 



   



 

 _3.2. Procedures for Exchange of RBPI Common Stock_ _._

 



 

 _3.2.1. Deposit of __Merger Consideration_. At least two Business Days
prior to the Effective Time, BMBC shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent certificates, or at BMBC's option,
evidence of shares in book entry form, representing the aggregate number of
shares of BMBC Common Stock, and an amount of cash sufficient to pay the
aggregate amount of cash payable pursuant to this Article III (including the
amount of cash to pay the estimated amount of cash in lieu of fractional
shares) sufficient to deliver the Merger Consideration (and cash in lieu of
fractional shares) (collectively, the "Exchange Fund"), and BMBC shall
instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the aggregate Merger Consideration
(and cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with this Agreement).

 



 

 _3.2.2. Exchange of __Certificates_. BMBC shall cause the Exchange
Agent, within ten (10) Business Days after the Effective Time (subject to
extension as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request), to mail to each
holder of a Certificate or Certificates, a letter of transmittal for return to
the Exchange Agent and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates for the Merger Consideration (and cash in lieu of fractional
shares), if any, into which the RBPI Common Stock represented by such
Certificates shall have been converted as a result of the Merger. The letter
of transmittal shall be subject to the approval of RBPI (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent. Upon proper surrender
of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as
applicable, (a) a certificate representing the aggregate amount of Per Share
Merger Consideration to which such former holder of RBPI Common Stock shall
have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.1 hereof, and (b)
a check representing the aggregate amount of cash (if any) payable in lieu of
fractional shares of BMBC Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole cent), to
which such former holder of RBPI Common Stock shall have become entitled
pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.1 hereof, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on the cash payable in lieu of fractional shares.

 



 

 _3.2.3. Rights of Certificate Holders after the __Effective Time_. The
holder of a Certificate that prior to the Merger represented issued and
outstanding RBPI Common Stock shall have no rights, after the Effective Time,
with respect to such RBPI Common Stock except to surrender the Certificate in
exchange for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to BMBC Common Stock shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares
of BMBC Common Stock represented thereby, in each case until the surrender of
such Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.2. Subject to the effect of
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender of
any such Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.2, the record holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest, (a) the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of BMBC Common Stock
represented by such Certificate and not paid and/or (b) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with
respect to shares of BMBC Common Stock represented by such Certificate with a
record date after the Effective Time (but before such surrender date) and with
a payment date subsequent to the issuance of the BMBC Common Stock issuable
with respect to such Certificate.

 



 



 

 



   



 

 _3.2.4. Surrender by Persons Other than Record Holders_. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing RBPI Common Stock that
is not registered in the stock transfer records of RBPI, the Merger
Consideration (and cash in lieu of fractional shares), shall be issued and
paid in exchange therefor to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate formerly
representing such RBPI Common Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such issuance and
payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of
the issuance and payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of BMBC that the Tax has been
paid or is not applicable.

 



 

 _3.2.5. Closing __of Transfer Books_. From and after the Effective Time,
there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of RBPI of the shares
of RBPI Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time other than to settle transfers of RBPI Common Stock that
occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the
Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration (and cash in lieu of fractional shares) to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section
3.2.

 



 

 _3.2.6. Return of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the shareholders of RBPI as of the first anniversary of
the Effective Time may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be paid to
BMBC. In such event, any former shareholders of RBPI who have not theretofore
complied with this Section 3.2 shall thereafter look only to BMBC with respect
to the Per Share Merger Consideration (and cash in lieu of any fractional
shares) and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the BMBC Common Stock
deliverable in respect of each share of RBPI Common Stock such shareholder
holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of BMBC, RBPI, the
Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of RBPI Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 



 

 _3.2.7. Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by BMBC or the Exchange Agent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as BMBC may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Per Share Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 



 

 



   



 

 _3.2.8. Withholding __Rights_ _._ BMBC or the Exchange Agent will be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to any
holder of RBPI Common Stock such amounts as BMBC (or any Affiliate thereof) or
the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any applicable provision of U.S.
federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that such amounts are
properly withheld by BMBC or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts will be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the RBPI Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding
were made by BMBC or the Exchange Agent.

 



 

 _3.2.9. Treatment of __RBPI Warrants_ _and_ _RBPI Restricted Stock
Awards_. RBPI Disclosure Schedule 4.2.1 sets forth all of the outstanding RBPI
Warrants and RBPI Restricted Stock Awards as of the date hereof, and includes,
as applicable, the name of the individual grantee, the date of grant, the
exercise price, the vesting schedule, if any, and the expiration date.

 



 

(A) At the Effective Time, all RBPI Warrants which are outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior thereto shall become fully vested, to the extent
not fully vested, and exercisable and be converted, in their entirety,
automatically into fully vested and exercisable warrants as applicable to
purchase shares of BMBC Common Stock (the "Continuing Warrants") in an amount
and at an exercise price determined as provided below (and otherwise subject
to the terms of the RBPI Warrant):

 



 

(i) The number of shares of BMBC Common Stock to be subject to the
Continuing Warrants shall be equal to the product of the number of shares of
RBPI Common Stock subject to the RBPI Warrants, and the Exchange Ratio;
_provided_ that any fractional shares of BMBC Common Stock resulting from such
multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest share; and

 



 

(ii) The exercise price per share of BMBC Common Stock under the
Continuing Warrants shall be equal to the exercise price per share of RBPI
Common Stock under the RBPI Warrants, as applicable, divided by the Exchange
Ratio; _provided_ that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest
cent.

 



 

The duration and other terms of the Continuing Warrants shall be the same as
the RBPI Warrants, except that all references to RBPI shall be deemed to be
references to BMBC.

 



 

(B) At all times after the Effective Time, BMBC shall reserve for
issuance such number of shares of BMBC Common Stock as necessary so as to
permit the exercise of Continuing Warrants in the manner contemplated by this
Agreement and in the instruments pursuant to which such warrants were granted.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(C) Each outstanding RBPI Restricted Stock Award granted by RBPI
pursuant to the RBPI Stock Benefit Plan, which is unvested immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall vest and be free of any restrictions as of the
Effective Time to the extent that such treatment is provided under the terms
of the RBPI Stock Benefit Plan and the applicable Restricted Stock Award
Agreement and be exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in Section
3.1.3 hereof.

 



 

Prior to the Effective Time, RBPI shall take or cause to be taken all actions
required or necessary under the RBPI Stock Benefit Plan and the RBPI Warrants
and RBPI Restricted Stock Awards to provide for the actions set forth in this
Section 3.2.9.

 



 

 _3.2.10. Exercise of __Continuing Warrants_. Continuing Warrants may be
exercised in accordance with the terms of the RBPI Warrants in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the terms of the
Continuing Warrants and applicable Law.

 



 

 _3.2.11. Treatment of __RBPI Options_. RBPI Disclosure Schedule 4.2.1
sets forth all of the RBPI Options outstanding as of the date hereof, and
includes for each such RBPI Option grant, the name of the individual grantee,
the date of grant, the exercise price, the vesting schedule and the expiration
date. As of and immediately prior to the Effective Time, all rights with
respect to RBPI Class A Stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of RBPI
Options which remain outstanding at the Effective Time of the Merger and which
have not yet been exercised, shall be cancelled by RBPI in exchange for a cash
payment equal to the positive difference, if any, between $4.19 and the
corresponding exercise price of such RBPI Option (the "Cash-Out
Consideration"). The cancellation of RBPI Options as provided for in this
section shall be deemed a release of any and all rights the holder had or may
have had in respect of such RBPI Options; _provided_ , _however_ _that_ RBPI
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to have each holder of a RBPI
Option execute and deliver a Stock Option Cancellation Acknowledgment in the
form set forth as _Exhibit C_ hereto. Prior to the Effective Time, RBPI shall
take or cause to be taken all actions required under the RBPI Stock Benefit
Plan and the applicable option agreements to provide for the actions set forth
in this Section 3.2.11.

 



 

 _3.2.12. Dissenters' __Rights_.

 



 

(A) Each outstanding share of RBPI Class B Stock, the holder of which has
provided notice of his, her or its intent to dissent under and in accordance
with the PBCL and has not effectively withdrawn or lost such right as of the
Effective Time (the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into or
represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration hereunder, and the
holder thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the
PBCL. RBPI shall give BMBC prompt notice upon receipt by RBPI of any such
demands for payment of the fair value of such shares of RBPI Class B Stock and
of withdrawals of such notice and any other related communications served
pursuant to the applicable provisions of the PBCL (any shareholder duly making
such demand being hereinafter called a "Dissenting Shareholder"), and BMBC
shall have the right to participate in all discussions, negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demands. RBPI shall not, except with the
prior written consent of BMBC, voluntarily make any payment with respect to,
or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment, or waive any
failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or the taking of any
other action by such Dissenting Shareholder as may be necessary to perfect
dissenters rights under the PBCL. Any payments made in respect of Dissenting
Shares shall be made by the Surviving Corporation.

 



 



 

 



   



 

(B) If any holder of Dissenting Shares shall fail to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent at or prior to the
Effective Time, such holder's shares of RBPI Class B Stock shall be converted
into a right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the
applicable provisions of this Agreement. If such holder withdraws or loses
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to such payment after the
Effective Time, each share of RBPI Class B Stock of such holder shall be
entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration.

omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which

into account any extensions (all such Tax Returns being accurate and correct
in all respects and prepared in compliance with all applicable Law) and has
duly paid or made provisions that are adequate for the payment of all Taxes
which have been incurred by or are due or claimed to be due from RBPI and any

(b) request for information related to Tax matters, or (c) notice of
deficiency or proposed adjustment for any amount of Tax proposed, asserted, or

4.6.5. Neither RBPI nor any RBPI Subsidiary has disposed of property in a
transaction presently being accounted for under the installment method under

by any other Person pursuant to the so-called "safe harbor lease" provisions
of former Section 168(f)(8) of the Code. None of the assets of RBPI or any
RBPI Subsidiary directly or indirectly, secures any debt the interest on which
is tax exempt under Section 103(a) of the Code. Neither RBPI nor any RBPI

Subsidiary is "tax-exempt use property" within the meaning of Section 168(h)
of the Code. No excess loss account exists with respect to any RBPI
Subsidiary. RBPI and each RBPI Subsidiary is not required to include in income
any adjustment pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code by reason of a voluntary
change in accounting and RBPI has no Knowledge that the IRS has proposed such
adjustment in accounting method. Except as described in the RBPI Disclosure
Schedule 4.6.5, the acquisition of the RBPI Common Stock and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not be a factor causing any
payments to be made by RBPI and each RBPI Subsidiary not to be deductible (in
whole or in part) pursuant to Sections 280G, 404 or 162(m) of the Code (or any
corresponding provisions of state, local, or non-U.S. Tax law). There are no
rulings, requests for rulings, or closing agreements with any Taxing Authority
specifically requested or entered into by RBPI or a RBPI Subsidiary, which
could affect their respective Taxes for any period after the Closing. All
transactions that could give rise to an understatement of federal income Tax
(within the meaning of Sections 6662 and 6662A of the Code) with respect to
RBPI and each RBPI Subsidiary were adequately disclosed on Tax Returns to the
extent required under the Code. There are no Liens for Taxes upon any property
or assets of RBPI and each RBPI Subsidiary except for Liens for current Taxes,
assessments, and other governmental charges not yet due, or which may
thereafter be paid without penalty.

in any transaction wherein the financial statement effects of the tax position
related thereto are not recognized pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards

the technical merits, it is not more likely than not that the position will be
sustained upon examination.

changes in existing elections made by RBPI or any of its Subsidiaries for

real or personal property to which either RBPI or any RBPI Subsidiary is a
party, and there has not occurred any event that, with lapse of time or the
giving of notice or both, would constitute such a default. RBPI is not a party
to any agreement pursuant to which it has securitized any of its assets.

 



 

4.9.2. With respect to all agreements pursuant to which RBPI or any RBPI
Subsidiary has purchased securities subject to an agreement to resell, if any,
RBPI or such RBPI Subsidiary, as the case may be, has a valid, perfected,
first priority Lien in the securities or other collateral securing the
repurchase agreement, and the value of such collateral equals or exceeds the
amount of the debt secured thereby.

 



 

4.9.3. RBPI and each RBPI Subsidiary currently maintain insurance
considered by each of them to be reasonable for their respective operations.
Neither RBPI nor any RBPI Subsidiary, except as disclosed in RBPI Disclosure
Schedule 4.9.3, has received notice from any insurance carrier during the past
five years that (a) such insurance will be cancelled or that coverage
thereunder will be reduced or eliminated, or (b) premium costs (other than
with respect to health or disability insurance) with respect to such policies
of insurance will be substantially increased. Except as set forth on RBPI
Disclosure Schedule 4.9.3, there are presently no claims pending under such
policies of insurance and no notices have been given by RBPI or any RBPI
Subsidiary under such policies (other than with respect to health or
disability insurance). RBPI and all RBPI Subsidiaries maintain such fidelity
bonds and errors and omissions insurance as may be customary or required under
applicable Law. All such insurance is valid and enforceable and in full force
and effect, and within the last three years RBPI and each RBPI Subsidiary has
received each type of insurance coverage for which it has applied and during
such periods has not been denied indemnification for any claims submitted
under any of its insurance policies. RBPI Disclosure Schedule 4.9.3 identifies
all policies of insurance maintained by RBPI and each RBPI Subsidiary as well
as the other matters required to be disclosed under this Section.

 



 



 

 



   



 

4.9.4. All real property owned by RBPI or a RBPI Subsidiary is in material
compliance with all applicable zoning laws and building codes, and the
buildings and improvements located on such real property are in good operating
condition and in a state of good working order, ordinary wear and tear and
casualty excepted. There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of RBPI,
threatened condemnation proceedings against such real property. RBPI and the
applicable RBPI Subsidiaries are in material compliance with all applicable
health and safety related requirements for the owned real property, including
those under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Occupational
Safety and Health Act of 1970. Insurance is currently maintained on all
property, including all owned real property, in amounts, scope and coverage
reasonably necessary for its operations. Neither RBPI nor any RBPI Subsidiary
has received any written notice of termination, nonrenewal or premium
adjustment for such policies.

Subsidiary has been advised in writing or, to RBPI's Knowledge, orally, or
otherwise has Knowledge of, the threat of any such action.

not limited to any licenses or approvals required for RBA to conduct mortgage
lending activities in the State of New Jersey; all such permits, licenses,
certificates of authority, orders and approvals are in full force and effect,
and no suspension or cancellation of any such permit, license, certificate,

to revoke any license, franchise, permit or governmental authorization; (c)
requiring, or threatening to require, RBPI or any RBPI Subsidiary, or
indicating that RBPI or any RBPI Subsidiary may be required, to enter into a
cease and desist order, agreement or memorandum of understanding or any other
agreement with any federal or state governmental agency or authority which is
charged with the supervision or regulation of banks or engages in the
insurance of bank deposits restricting or limiting, or purporting to restrict
or limit the operations of RBPI or any RBPI Subsidiary, including without
limitation any restriction on the payment of dividends; or (d) directing,
restricting or limiting, or purporting to direct, restrict or limit, in any
manner the operations of RBPI or any RBPI Subsidiary, including without
limitation any restriction on the payment of dividends (any such notice,

hereinafter referred to as a "RBPI Regulatory Agreement"). Except as disclosed
on RBPI Disclosure Schedule 4.11.3, neither RBPI nor any RBPI Subsidiary is a
party to or is subject to any order, decree, agreement, memorandum of
understanding or similar arrangement with, or a commitment letter or similar
submission to, or extraordinary supervisory letter from, any Bank Regulator or
any federal or state governmental agency or authority charged with the
supervision or regulation of issuers of securities or the supervision or

violations, criticism, or exception by any Regulatory Authority with respect
to any RBPI Regulatory Agreement. There is no injunction, order, judgment or
decree imposed upon RBPI or any RBPI Subsidiary or the assets of RBPI or any
RBPI Subsidiary.

RBPI's or RBPI Subsidiary's officers, directors, managers, members, employees,

 _4.12. Employee Benefit Plans._

 



 

4.12.1. RBPI Disclosure Schedule 4.12.1 includes a list of all RBPI
Compensation and Benefit Plans. Neither RBPI nor any RBPI Subsidiary has any
commitment to create any additional RBPI Compensation and Benefit Plan or to

available to BMBC true and correct copies of the agreements or other documents
establishing and evidencing the RBPI Compensation and Benefit Plans.

 



 

4.12.2. Except as disclosed in RBPI Disclosure Schedule 4.12.2, each RBPI

and Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Pension Plan") and which is intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS, or is in the form of a prototype or volume
submitter plan that is the subject of a favorable opinion letter from the IRS
on which RBPI is entitled to rely, and RBPI is not aware of any circumstances
which are reasonably likely to result in revocation of any such favorable
determination letter or opinion letter. There is no pending or, to the
Knowledge of RBPI, threatened action, suit or claim relating to any of the
RBPI Compensation and Benefit Plans (other than routine claims for benefits).
Neither RBPI nor any RBPI Subsidiary has engaged in a transaction, or omitted
to take any action, with respect to any RBPI Compensation and Benefit Plan
that would reasonably be expected to subject RBPI or any RBPI Subsidiary to an
unpaid tax or penalty imposed by either Sections 4975, 4980B or 5000 of the
Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

 



 



 

 



   



 

4.12.3. Neither RBPI nor any entity with which it is or was ever
considered one employer under Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA or Section 414 of
the Code (an "RBPI ERISA Affiliate") since the effective date of ERISA
maintains or ever maintained or participated in a plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA, or contributes to, contributed to, is obligated to contribute to or was
ever obligated to contribute to a "multiemployer plan," as defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA. Neither RBPI, nor any RBPI ERISA Affiliate, nor any RBPI
Compensation and Benefit Plan, nor any trust created thereunder, nor any
trustee or administrator thereof has engaged in a transaction in connection
with which RBPI, any RBPI ERISA Affiliate, and any RBPI Compensation and
Benefit Plan, or any such trust or any trustee or administrator thereof, could
reasonably be expected to be subject to either a civil liability or penalty
pursuant to Section 409, 502(i) or 502(l) of ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant
to Chapter 43 of the Code.

 



 

4.12.4. All contributions required to be made under the terms of any RBPI
Compensation and Benefit Plan have been timely made, and all anticipated
contributions and funding obligations are accrued on RBPI's consolidated

Subsidiary has expensed and accrued as a liability the present value of future
benefits under each applicable RBPI Compensation and Benefit Plan for
financial reporting purposes as required by GAAP.

 



 

4.12.5. Neither RBPI nor any RBPI Subsidiary has any obligations to
provide retiree health, life insurance, death benefits, or disability
insurance, except as set forth in RBPI Disclosure Schedule 4.12.5, under any
RBPI Compensation and Benefit Plan, other than benefits mandated by Section
4980B of the Code. Except as set forth in RBPI Disclosure Schedule 4.12.5,
there has been no communication to employees by RBPI or any RBPI Subsidiary
that would reasonably be expected to promise or guarantee such employees
retiree health, life insurance, or disability insurance, or any retiree death
benefits.

and Benefit Plans covering employees who are not United States residents.

trust instruments and insurance contracts; (b) three most recent Forms 5500
filed with the IRS, including all schedules and attachments thereto; (c) three

4.12.8. Except as provided in RBPI Disclosure Schedule 4.12.8 and in
Section 3.2.9, the consummation of the Merger will not, directly or indirectly
(including, without limitation, as a result of any termination of employment
or service at any time prior to or following the Effective Time) (a) entitle
any employee, consultant or director to any payment or benefit (including
severance pay, change in control benefit, or similar compensation) or any
increase in compensation, (b) result in any increase in benefits payable under
any RBPI Compensation and Benefit Plan, or (c) entitle any current or former
employee, director or independent contractor of RBPI or any RBPI Subsidiary to
any actual or deemed payment (or benefit) which could constitute a "parachute
payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G of the Code).

 



 

4.12.9. Except as disclosed in RBPI Disclosure Schedule 4.12.9, neither
RBPI nor any RBPI Subsidiary maintains any compensation plans, programs or
arrangements under which any payment is reasonably likely to become non-
deductible, in whole or in part, for tax reporting purposes as a result of the
limitations under Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations issued
thereunder.

 



 

4.12.10. Except as disclosed in RBPI Disclosure Schedule 4.12.10, all

in form and operation, with Section 409A of the Code and all guidance issued
thereunder.

 



 

4.12.11. Except as disclosed in RBPI Disclosure Schedule 4.12.11, there
are no stock options, stock appreciation or similar rights, earned dividends
or dividend equivalents, or shares of restricted stock, outstanding under any
of the RBPI Compensation and Benefit Plans or otherwise as of the date hereof.

 _4.14. Environmental Matters._

 



 

4.14.1. Except as may be set forth in RBPI Disclosure Schedule 4.14, with
respect to RBPI and each RBPI Subsidiary:

 



 

(A) Except as set forth on RBPI Disclosure Schedule 4.14, neither the
conduct nor operation of its business nor any condition of any property
currently owned or operated, or to RBPI's Knowledge previously owned or
operated, by it during the period of such ownership or operation by RBPI or
any RBPI Subsidiary, or to RBPI's Knowledge at any other time, (including
Participation Facilities, as hereinafter defined) including, without
limitation, in a fiduciary or agency capacity, or, to RBPI's Knowledge, any
property on which it holds a Lien, results or resulted in a violation of or
gives rise to any potential liability under, any Environmental Laws that is
reasonably likely to impose a liability (including a remediation obligation)
upon RBPI or any RBPI Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of RBPI, no condition has
existed or event has occurred with respect to any of them or any such property
that, with notice or the passage of time, or both, is reasonably likely to
result in any liability to RBPI or any RBPI Subsidiary by reason of any
Environmental Laws. Neither RBPI nor any RBPI Subsidiary during the past five
years has received any written notice from any Person or Governmental Entity
that RBPI or any RBPI Subsidiary or the operation or condition of any property
ever owned, operated (including Participation Facilities), or held as
collateral or in a fiduciary capacity by any of them, is currently in
violation of or otherwise is alleged to have liability under any Environmental
Laws or relating to Materials of Environmental Concern (including, but not
limited to, responsibility (or potential responsibility) for the
investigation, cleanup or other remediation of any Materials of Environmental
Concern at, on, beneath, or originating from any such property) for which a
material liability is reasonably likely to be imposed upon RBPI or any RBPI
Subsidiary;

 



 

(B) There is no suit, claim, action, demand, executive or administrative
order, directive, investigation, proceeding or agreement pending or, to RBPI's
Knowledge, threatened, before any court, Governmental Entity or other forum
against RBPI or any RBPI Subsidiary (a) for alleged noncompliance (including
by any predecessor) with, or liability under, any Environmental Law or (b)
relating to the presence or threat of a Release, whether or not occurring at
or on a site owned, leased or operated by RBPI or any RBPI Subsidiary;

 



 

(C) To RBPI's Knowledge, there are no underground storage tanks on, in or
under any properties owned or operated by RBPI or any of the RBPI
Subsidiaries, and to RBPI's Knowledge no underground storage tanks have been
closed or removed from any properties owned or operated by RBPI or any of the
RBPI Subsidiaries or any Participation Facility except in compliance with
Environmental Laws; and

 



 

(D) "Participation Facility" shall mean any facility in which RBPI or any
of the RBPI Subsidiaries participates in the management, whether as a
fiduciary, lender in control of the facility, owner or operator.

 



 



 

 



   



 

 _4.15. Loan Portfolio._

 



 

4.15.1. RBPI Disclosure Schedule 4.15.1 sets forth a listing, as of
December 31, 2016, by name and account, of: (a) all Loans of RBA or any other
RBPI Subsidiary that have had their respective terms to maturity accelerated
during the past twelve months; (b) all loan commitments or lines of credit of
RBA or any other RBPI Subsidiary which have been terminated by RBA or any
other RBPI Subsidiary during the past twelve months by reason of a default or
adverse developments in the condition of the borrower or other events or
circumstances affecting the credit of the borrower; (c) each borrower,
customer or other party which has notified RBA or any other RBPI Subsidiary
during the past twelve months of, or has asserted against RBA or any other
RBPI Subsidiary, in each case in writing, any "lender liability" or similar
claim, and each borrower, customer or other party which has given RBA or any
other RBPI Subsidiary any oral notification of, or orally asserted to or
against RBA or any other RBPI Subsidiary, any such claim.

 



 

4.15.2. RBPI Disclosure Schedule 4.15.2 sets forth a listing of all Loans,
(a) that are contractually past due 30 days or more in the payment of
principal and/or interest, (b) that are on non-accrual status, (c) that as of
the date of this Agreement are classified as "Watch," "Other Loans Specially
Mentioned," "Special Mention," "Substandard," "Doubtful," "Loss,"
"Classified," "Criticized," "Credit Risk Assets," "Concerned Loans," "Watch
List" or words of similar import, together with the principal amount of and
accrued and unpaid interest on each such Loan and the identity of the obligor
thereunder, (d) where, during the past three years, the interest rate terms
have been reduced and/or the maturity dates have been extended subsequent to
the agreement under which the Loan was originally created due to concerns
regarding the borrower's ability to pay in accordance with such initial terms,
(e) that qualify as Troubled Debt Restructurings, (f) where a specific reserve
allocation exists in connection therewith.

 



 

4.15.3. RBPI Disclosure Schedule 4.15.3 identifies each asset of RBPI or
any of its Subsidiaries that as of September 30, 2016 was classified as OREO
and the book value thereof as of the date of this Agreement as well as any
assets classified as OREO since September 30, 2016 to the date hereof and any
sales of OREO between September 30, 2016 and the date hereof, reflecting any
gain or loss with respect to any OREO sold.

 



 

4.15.4. All Loans receivable (including discounts) and accrued interest
entered on the books of RBPI and the RBPI Subsidiaries arose out of bona fide
arm's-length transactions, were made for good and valuable consideration in
the Ordinary Course of Business, and the notes or other evidences of
indebtedness with respect to such Loans (including discounts), and all
pledges, mortgages, deeds of trust and other collateral documents or security
instruments relating thereto, are valid, true and genuine and are what they
purport to be. To RBPI's Knowledge, the Loans, discounts and the accrued
interest reflected on the books of RBPI and the RBPI Subsidiaries are subject
to no defenses, set-offs or counterclaims (including, without limitation,
those afforded by usury or truth-in-lending laws), except as may be provided
by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors' rights
generally or by general principles of equity. All such Loans are being
transferred with good and marketable title, free and clear of any and all
Liens encumbering such Loan and are evidenced by notes, agreements or other
evidences of indebtedness which are true, genuine and correct, and to the
extent secured, are secured by valid Liens that are legal, valid and binding
obligations of the maker thereof, enforceable in accordance with the
respective terms thereof, except as such enforcement may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws or equitable
principles affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights, which have been
perfected.

 



 



 

 



   



 

4.15.5. All currently outstanding Loans held in RBPI's, RBA's or any of
their respective Subsidiaries' loan portfolio (each a "RBPI Loan") were
solicited, originated, administered, and, currently exist, and the relevant
Loan files are being maintained, in material compliance with all applicable
requirements of Law, the applicable loan documents, and RBA's lending policies
at the time of origination of such RBPI Loans, and the notes or other credit
or security documents with respect to each such outstanding RBPI Loan are
complete and correct in all material respects. There are no oral modifications
or amendments or additional agreements related to the RBPI Loans that are not
reflected in the written records of RBPI or RBA, as applicable. All such RBPI
Loans are owned by RBPI or RBA free and clear of any Liens (other than blanket
Liens by the FHLB). No claims of defense as to the enforcement of any
currently outstanding RBPI Loan have been asserted in writing against RBPI or
RBA for which there is a reasonable probability of an adverse determination,
and, except as set forth in RBPI Disclosure Schedule 4.15.5(i), neither RBPI
nor RBA has any Knowledge of any claim or right of rescission for which there
is a reasonable probability of a determination adverse to RBA. Except as set
forth in RBPI Disclosure Schedule 4.15.5(ii), no RBPI Loans are presently
serviced by third parties, and there is no obligation which could result in
any RBPI Loan becoming subject to any third party servicing.

 



 

4.15.6. Except as would not reasonably be expected to be material, neither
RBPI nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement or arrangement
with (or otherwise obligated to) any Person which obligates RBPI or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase from any such Person any Loan or other asset of
RBPI or any of its Subsidiaries, unless there is a material breach of a
representation or covenant by RBPI or any of its Subsidiaries, and none of the
agreements pursuant to which RBPI or any of its Subsidiaries has sold Loans or
pools of Loans or participations in Loans or pools of Loans contains any
obligation to repurchase such Loans or interests therein solely on account of
a payment default by the obligor on any such Loan.

 



 

4.15.7. Neither RBPI nor any of its Subsidiaries is now nor has it ever
been since January 1, 2012, subject to any fine, suspension, settlement or
other contract or other administrative agreement or sanction by, or any
reduction in any loan purchase commitment from, any Governmental Entity
relating to the origination, sale or servicing of mortgage or consumer Loans.

 



 

4.15.8. Since January 1, 2014, neither RBPI nor any of its Subsidiaries
has canceled, released or compromised any Loan, obligation, claim or
receivable other than in the Ordinary Course of Business.

 



 

4.15.9. RBPI and RBA have not, since December 31, 2013, extended or
maintained credit, arranged for the extension of credit, or renewed an
extension of credit, in the form of a personal loan to or for any director,
executive officer, or principal shareholder (or equivalent thereof) of RBPI or
any of its Subsidiaries (as such terms are defined in FRB Regulation O),
except as permitted by Regulation O and that have been made in compliance with
the provisions of Regulation O (or that are exempt therefrom). RBPI Disclosure
Schedule 4.15.9 identifies, as of September 30, 2016, any loan or extension of
credit maintained by RBPI and RBA to which Regulation O applies, and there has
been no default on, or forgiveness of waiver of, in whole or in part, any such
loan during the two (2) years preceding the date hereof.

 



 



 

 



   



 

4.15.10. RBPI's reserves, allowance for loan and lease losses and carrying
value for real estate owned as reflected in each of the RBPI Financial
Statements were, in the opinion of management, as of the applicable dates
thereof, adequate in all material respects to provide for possible losses on
the applicable items and in compliance with RBPI's and RBA's existing
methodology for determining the adequacy of its allowance for loan and lease
losses as well as the standards established by applicable Governmental Entity,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board and GAAP.

 



 

 _4.16. Documents._

 



 

RBPI has made available to BMBC copies of its annual reports and proxy
materials used or for use in connection with its meetings of shareholders,
each since January 1, 2013.

 



 

 _4.17. Related Party Transactions._

 



 

Except as set forth in RBPI Disclosure Schedule 4.17, neither RBPI nor any
RBPI Subsidiary is a party to any transaction (including any loan or other
credit accommodation) with any Affiliate of RBPI or any RBPI Affiliate. All
such transactions (a) were made in the Ordinary Course of Business, (b) were
made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral,
as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other
Persons, and (c) did not involve substantially more than the normal risk of
collectability or present other unfavorable features (as such terms are used
under Regulation O of the FRB). No loan or credit accommodation to any

limiting, or purporting to direct, restrict or limit, in any manner the
operations of BMBC or any BMBC Subsidiary, including without limitation any
restriction on the payment of dividends (any such notice, communication,
memorandum, agreement or order described in this sentence is hereinafter
referred to as an "BMBC Regulatory Agreement"). Neither BMBC nor any BMBC
Subsidiary is a party to or is subject to any order, decree, agreement,
memorandum of understanding or similar arrangement with, or a commitment
letter or similar submission to, or extraordinary supervisory letter from, any
Bank Regulator or any federal or state governmental agency or authority
charged with the supervision or regulation of issuers of securities or the
supervision or regulation of it. The most recent regulatory rating given to
BMT as to compliance with the CRA is satisfactory or better. There are no
unresolved violations, criticism, or exception by any Regulatory Authority
with respect to any BMBC Regulatory Agreement. There is no injunction, order,
judgment or decree imposed upon BMBC or any BMBC Subsidiary or the assets of
BMBC or any BMBC Subsidiary.

 



 

5.10.4. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, BMBC has been and
is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 



 

 _5.11. Employee Benefit Plans._

 



 

5.11.1. Neither BMBC nor any BMBC Subsidiary has any commitment to create
any additional BMBC Compensation and Benefit Plan or to modify, change or
renew any existing BMBC Compensation and Benefit Plan, except as required to
maintain the qualified status thereof.

 



 

5.11.2. Each BMBC Compensation and Benefit Plan has been operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and with
applicable Law, including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code, the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, COBRA, HIPAA
and any regulations or rules promulgated thereunder, and all material filings,
disclosures and notices required by ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, COBRA and HIPAA and
any other applicable Law have been timely made or any interest, fines,
penalties or other impositions for late filings have been paid in full. Each
BMBC Compensation and Benefit Plan which is a Pension Plan and which is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS, or is in the form of a prototype
or volume submitter plan that is the subject of a favorable opinion letter
from the IRS on which BMBC is entitled to rely, and BMBC is not aware of any
circumstances which are reasonably likely to result in revocation of any such
favorable determination letter or opinion letter. There is no pending or, to
the Knowledge of BMBC, threatened action, suit or claim relating to any of the
BMBC Compensation and Benefit Plans (other than routine claims for benefits).
Neither BMBC nor any BMBC Subsidiary has engaged in a transaction, or omitted
to take any action, with respect to any BMBC Compensation and Benefit Plan
that would reasonably be expected to subject BMBC or any BMBC Subsidiary to a
material unpaid tax or penalty imposed by either Sections 4975, 4980B or 5000
of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

 



 



 

 



   



 

5.11.3. No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by BMBC or
any BMBC Subsidiary with respect to any BMBC Compensation and Benefit Plan
which is subject to Title IV of ERISA ("BMBC Pension Plan") currently or
formerly maintained by BMBC or any entity which is considered one employer
with BMBC under Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an
"BMBC ERISA Affiliate") since the effective date of ERISA that has not been
satisfied in full, and no condition exists that presents a risk to BMBC or any
BMBC ERISA Affiliate of incurring a liability under such Title. No BMBC
Pension Plan had an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section
302 of ERISA), whether or not waived, as of the last day of the end of the
most recent plan year ending prior to the date hereof; there is not currently
pending with the PBGC any filing with respect to any reportable event under
Section 4043 of ERISA nor has any reportable event occurred as to which a
filing is required and has not been made (other than as might be required with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby). Neither
BMBC nor any BMBC ERISA Affiliate has contributed to or has or had any
obligation to contribute to any "multiemployer plan," as defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA. Neither BMBC, nor any BMBC ERISA Affiliate, nor any BMBC
Compensation and Benefit Plan, including any BMBC Pension Plan, nor any trust
created thereunder, nor any trustee or administrator thereof has engaged in a
transaction in connection with which BMBC, any BMBC ERISA Affiliate, and any
BMBC Compensation and Benefit Plan, including any BMBC Pension Plan or any
such trust or any trustee or administrator thereof, could reasonably be
expected to be subject to either a civil liability or penalty pursuant to
Section 409, 502(i) or 502(l) of ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant to Chapter 43
of the Code.

 



 

5.11.4. All contributions required to be accrued under the terms of any
BMBC Compensation and Benefit Plan have been timely accrued, and all
anticipated contributions and funding obligations are accrued on BMBC's
consolidated financial statements to the extent required by GAAP. BMBC and
each BMBC Subsidiary has expensed and accrued as a liability the present value
of future benefits under each applicable BMBC Compensation and Benefit Plan
for financial reporting purposes as required by GAAP.

 



 

5.11.5. Neither BMBC nor any BMBC Subsidiary has any obligations to
provide retiree health, life insurance, death benefits, or disability
insurance, under any BMBC Compensation and Benefit Plan, other than benefits
mandated by Section 4980B of the Code. There has been no communication to
employees by BMBC or any BMBC Subsidiary that would reasonably be expected to
promise or guarantee such employees retiree health, life insurance, or
disability insurance, or any retiree death benefits.

 



 

5.11.6. BMBC and its Subsidiaries do not maintain any BMBC Compensation
and Benefit Plans covering employees who are not United States residents.

 



 

5.11.7. Neither BMBC nor any BMBC Subsidiary maintains any compensation
plans, programs or arrangements under which any payment is reasonably likely
to become non-deductible, in whole or in part, for tax reporting purposes as a
result of the limitations under Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations
issued thereunder.

 



 

5.11.8. All deferred compensation plans, programs or arrangements are in
compliance, both in form and operation, with Section 409A of the Code and all
guidance issued thereunder.

 



 

5.11.9. Except as disclosed in BMBC Disclosure Schedule 5.11.9, there are
no stock options, stock appreciation or similar rights, earned dividends or
dividend equivalents, or shares of restricted stock, outstanding under any of
the BMBC Compensation and Benefit Plans or otherwise as of the date hereof.

reasonably likely to impose a material liability (including a remediation
obligation) upon BMBC or any BMBC Subsidiary. No condition has existed or
event has occurred with respect to any of them or any such property that, with

liability under any Environmental Laws or relating to Materials of
Environmental Concern (including, but not limited to, responsibility (or
potential responsibility) for the investigation, cleanup or other remediation
of any Materials of Environmental Concern at, on, beneath, or originating from
any such property) for which a material liability may be reasonably likely to
be imposed upon BMBC or any BMBC Subsidiary.

 



 

(B) There is no suit, claim, action, demand, executive or administrative
order, directive, investigation, proceeding or agreement pending or, to BMBC's
Knowledge, threatened, before any court, Governmental Entity or other forum
against BMBC or any BMBC Subsidiary (a) for alleged noncompliance (including
by any predecessor) with, or liability under, any Environmental Law or (b)
relating to the presence or threat of a Release, whether or not occurring at
or on a site owned, leased or operated by BMBC or any BMBC Subsidiary.

 



 

 _5.13. Brokers, Finders and Financial Advisors._

 



 

Neither BMBC nor any BMBC Subsidiary, nor any of their respective officers,
directors, employees or agents, has employed any broker, finder or financial
advisor in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or
incurred any liability or commitment for any fees or commissions to any such
person in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
except for the retention of Boenning and Scattergood, Inc. and the fee payable
pursuant thereto.

 



 



 

 



   



 

 _5.14. BMBC Common Stock_ _._

authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and subject to no
preemptive rights.

 



 

 _5.15. BMBC Information Supplied._

 



 

5.15.1. The information relating to BMBC and any BMBC Subsidiary to be
contained in the Merger Registration Statement, or in any other document filed
with any Bank Regulator or other Governmental Entity in connection herewith,
will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they are made, not misleading.

 



 

5.15.2. The Merger Registration Statement will comply with the provisions
of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and the
provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder,
except that no representation or warranty is made by BMBC with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied by RBPI specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Merger Registration Statement.

 



 

5.15.3. The information supplied by BMBC and any BMBC Subsidiary for
inclusion in the Applications will, at the time each such document is filed
with any Bank Regulator and up to and including the dates of any required
regulatory approvals or consents, as such Applications may be amended by
subsequent filings, be accurate in all material respects.

 



 

 _5.16. PBCL Sections 2538 and 2553_

 



 

Other than by reason of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, BMBC is not an "interested shareholder" (as defined in Sections 2538
or 2553 of the PBCL) of RBPI.

each calendar month, a written list of nonperforming assets and RBPI
Delinquencies. The term "nonperforming assets," for purposes of this
subsection, means (a) loans that are Troubled Debt Restructurings, (b) loans
on nonaccrual, (c) OREO, (d) all loans thirty (30) days or more past due as of
the end of such month and (e) and impaired loans. On a monthly basis, RBPI
shall provide to BMT, within twenty (20) days after the end of each calendar
month, a schedule of all loan approvals, which schedule shall indicate the
loan amount, loan type and other material features of the loan, as well as the
related loan origination/underwriting documentation and credit file detail if
requested by BMT. On a monthly basis, RBPI shall provide to BMT, within twenty
(20) days after the end of each calendar month, the following reports: (a)
watch list report; (b) classified asset report; (c) individual asset quality
write ups that are classified as "special assets"; (d) pipeline report; and

to BMT, within thirty (30) days after the end of each quarter, a loan loss
reserve analysis.

 



 

6.2.4. RBPI shall promptly inform BMBC upon receiving notice of any legal,
administrative, arbitration or other proceedings, demands, notices, audits or
investigations by any Governmental Entity relating to the alleged liability of
RBPI or any RBPI Subsidiary under any labor or employment law, or related to
any claims made by or threatened by any current or former employee or
applicant.

 



 

 _6.3. Access to Properties and Records._

 



 

Subject to Section 12.1 hereof, RBPI shall permit BMBC reasonable access
during normal business hours upon reasonable notice to its properties and
those of the RBPI Subsidiaries, and shall disclose and make available to BMBC
during normal business hours all of its books, papers and records relating to
the assets, properties, operations, obligations and liabilities, including,
but not limited to, all books of account (including the general ledger), tax
records, minute books of directors' (other than minutes that discuss any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other subject matter
RBPI reasonably determines based on the advice of legal counsel should be
treated as confidential) and shareholders' meetings, organizational documents,
bylaws, contracts and agreements, filings with any Governmental Entity,
litigation files, plans affecting employees, and any other business activities
or prospects in which BMBC may have a reasonable interest; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that RBPI shall not be required to take any action that would
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would violate or prejudice the rights or business interests or confidences of
any customer or other person or would result in the waiver by it of the
privilege protecting communications between it and any of its counsel or that
is otherwise prohibited by Law. RBPI shall provide and shall request its
auditors to provide BMBC with such historical financial information regarding
it (and related audit reports and consents) as BMBC may reasonably request for
securities disclosure. BMBC shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
minimize any interference with RBPI's regular business operations during any
such access to RBPI's property, books and records. RBPI shall permit BMBC, at
BMBC's expense, to cause a Phase I and any Phase II recommended therein to be
performed at each RBPI Real Property; _provided_ , _however_ : (i) that BMBC
shall have the right to conduct a Phase II only to the extent that RBPI has a
right of access to the RBPI Real Property sufficient to grant BMBC the right
to perform such Phase II activities; _provided_ that RBPI shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such right of access; and (ii) prior
to the Closing Date only to the extent that a Phase II is within the scope of
additional testing recommended by the Phase I to be performed as a result of
either a "Historical Recognized Environmental Condition" or a "Recognized
Environmental Condition" (as such terms are defined by the ASTM Standard
E1527-13) that was discovered in the Phase I. Any such Phase I shall be
commenced within thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement and any
such Phase II, to the extent permitted by the provisions hereof to be
conducted prior to Closing, recommended to be performed by any such Phase I
shall be commenced within thirty (30) days of the Phase I report recommending
such Phase II. BMBC shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any
such Phase I conducted to be completed within thirty (30) days of the date of
commencement thereof, but in no event more than sixty (60) days after the date
of commencement thereof. In the event BMBC elects to commence any Phase II, to
the extent permitted pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6.3 to be
conducted prior to Closing, BMBC shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
have any such Phase II completed within forty-five (45) days of the
commencement thereof, but in no event more than sixty (60) days after the date
of commencement thereof. BMBC and its environmental consultant shall conduct
all environmental assessments pursuant to this Section at mutually agreeable
times and so as to eliminate or minimize to the greatest extent possible
interference with RBPI's operation of its business, and BMBC shall maintain or
cause to be maintained reasonably adequate insurance with respect to any
assessment conducted hereunder. BMBC shall be required to restore each RBPI
Real Property to substantially its pre-assessment condition. All costs and
expenses incurred in connection with any Phase I or Phase II and any post-
assessment restoration or an assessed property substantially to its pre-
assessment condition, shall be borne solely by BMBC.

 



 



 

 



   



 

 _6.4. Financial and Other Statements._

 



 

6.4.1. Promptly after review and approval by the RBPI Audit Committee,
RBPI will furnish to BMBC copies of each annual, interim or special audit of
the books of RBPI and the RBPI Subsidiaries made by its independent auditors
and copies of all internal control reports submitted to RBPI by such auditors
in connection with each annual, interim or special audit of the books of RBPI
and the RBPI Subsidiaries made by such auditors.

 



 

6.4.2. As soon as reasonably available, RBPI will furnish to BMBC copies
of all documents, statements and reports that it or any RBPI Subsidiary shall
send to its shareholders or any Bank Regulator to the extent legally permitted
to do so; _provided_ that if RBPI is not legally permitted to furnish BMBC
with a document without having received the approval of a Bank Regulator, RBPI
shall promptly request such approval from the applicable Bank Regulator.

 



 

6.4.3. To the extent legally permitted to do so, RBPI will advise BMBC
promptly of the receipt of any written communication of any Bank Regulator
with respect to the condition or activities of RBPI or any of the RBPI
Subsidiaries; _provided further_ that if RBPI is not legally permitted to
furnish BMBC with such written communication without having received the
approval of a Bank Regulator, RBPI shall promptly request such approval from
the applicable Bank Regulator.

 



 

6.4.4. RBPI shall notify BMBC (a) if aggregate RBA borrowings (excluding
deposits and any subordinated indebtedness outstanding on the date of this
Agreement) exceed $115 in outstanding borrowings at the close of business on
any Business Day prior to the Effective Time, and (b) of any decrease in RBA's
maximum borrowing capacity at the FHLB.

 



 



 

 



   



 

 _6.5. Maintenance of Insurance._

 



 

RBPI shall maintain, and cause each RBPI Subsidiary to maintain, insurance in
such amounts as are reasonable to cover such risks as are customary in
relation to the character and location of their properties and the nature of
their business, but in no event shall such coverage be less than coverage by
the policies in place as of the date of this Agreement.

 



 

 _6.6. Regulatory Actions_.

 



 

To the extent that either RBPI or RBA is currently subject to any outstanding
supervisory action (including but not limited to a consent order, formal
agreement, or memorandum of understanding) involving a Bank Regulator, RBPI __
and RBA shall make commercially reasonable efforts and take appropriate steps
to seek and obtain the termination of such supervisory action.

 



 

 _6.7. Consents and Approvals of Third Parties._

 



 

RBPI shall obtain as soon as practicable, but in any event prior to the
Closing Date, all consents and approvals necessary or desirable for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by RBPI. For
the avoidance of doubt, RBPI's obligations with respect to obtaining
Regulatory Approvals shall be governed by Section 8.3.

 



 

 _6.8. Commercially Reasonable Efforts._

 



 

Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, RBPI agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and
to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with BMBC in doing,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in
the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, without limitation, any actions necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law and any actions, assistance or cooperation in
preparation for the conversion and integration of RBA's operations into BMT's
operations.

 



 

 _6.9. Failure to Fulfill Conditions._

 



 

In the event that RBPI determines that a condition to its obligation to
complete the Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will not waive that
condition, it will promptly notify BMBC.

 



 

 _6.10. No Solicitation._

 



 

6.10.1. RBPI shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, financial
advisors, attorneys, accountants, consultants, affiliates and other agents
(collectively, "Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly, (a)
initiate, solicit, induce or knowingly encourage, or take any action to
facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (b)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition
Proposal or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to any Person (other than
BMBC) any information or data with respect to RBPI or any of its Subsidiaries
or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal; (c) release any Person from,
waive any provisions of, or fail to enforce any confidentiality agreement or
standstill agreement to which RBPI or any of its Subsidiaries is a party; or
(d) enter into any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of intent with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve or resolve to approve any
Acquisition Proposal or any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of
intent relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Any violation of the foregoing
restrictions by RBPI, any RBPI Subsidiary or any Representative, whether or
not such Representative is so authorized and whether or not such
Representative is purporting to act on behalf of RBPI or otherwise, shall be
deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by RBPI. RBPI and its Subsidiaries
shall, and shall cause each of Representative to, immediately cease and cause
to be terminated any and all existing discussions, negotiations, and
communications with any Persons with respect to any existing or potential
Acquisition Proposal.

 



 



 

 



   



 

For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any inquiry,
offer or proposal (other than an inquiry, offer or proposal from BMBC),
whether or not in writing, contemplating, relating to, or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Transaction. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean (a) any transaction or
series of transactions involving any merger, consolidation, recapitalization,
share exchange, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving RBPI
or any of its Subsidiaries; (b) any transaction pursuant to which any third
party or group acquires or would acquire (whether through sale, lease or other
disposition), directly or indirectly, any assets of RBPI or any of its
Subsidiaries representing, in the aggregate, fifteen percent (15%) or more of
the assets of RBPI and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; (c) any
issuance, sale or other disposition of (including by way of merger,
consolidation, share exchange or any similar transaction) securities (or
options, rights or warrants to purchase or securities convertible into, such
securities) representing fifteen percent (15%) or more of the votes attached
to the outstanding securities of RBPI or any of its Subsidiaries; (d) any
tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any third
party or group beneficially owning fifteen percent (15%) or more of any class
of equity securities of RBPI or any of its Subsidiaries; or (e) any
transaction which is similar in form, substance or purpose to any of the
foregoing transactions, or any combination of the foregoing.

 



 

6.10.2. Notwithstanding Section 6.10.1, at any time prior to obtaining the
Requisite RBPI Shareholder Approval, RBPI may take any of the actions
described in clause (b) of the first paragraph of Section 6.10.1 if, but only
if, (a) RBPI has received a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal
that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.10; (b) the Board of
Directors of RBPI determines in good faith, after consultation with and having
considered the advice of its outside legal counsel and its independent
financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal; (c) RBPI has provided BMBC with at least three (3) Business Days
prior notice of such determination to take any of the actions described in
clause (b) of the first paragraph of Section 6.10.1; (d) prior to furnishing
or affording access to any information or data with respect to RBPI or any of
its Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, RBPI
receives from such Person a confidentiality agreement with terms no less
favorable to RBPI than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; and
(e) the Board of Directors of RBPI determines in good faith, after
consultation with and having considered the advice of its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take any such actions would be reasonably likely
to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. RBPI shall promptly
provide to BMBC any non-public information regarding RBPI or its Subsidiaries
provided to any other Person that was not previously provided to BMBC, such
additional information to be provided no later than the date of provision of
such information to such other party.

 



 



 

 



   



 

For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean any unsolicited
bona fide written proposal (on its most recently amended or modified terms, if
amended or modified) made by a third party to enter into an Acquisition
Transaction on terms that the Board of Directors of RBPI reasonably determines
in its good faith judgment, after consultation with and having considered the
advice of outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, (a) would, if
consummated, result in the acquisition of all, but not less than all, of the
issued and outstanding shares of RBPI Common Stock or all, or substantially
all, of the assets of RBPI and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; (b)
would result in a transaction that (i) involves consideration to the holders
of the shares of RBPI Common Stock that is more favorable than the Merger
Consideration to be paid to RBPI's shareholders pursuant to this Agreement,
considering, among other things, the nature of the consideration being
offered, any regulatory approvals or other risks associated with the timing of
the proposed transaction beyond the identity of such Person making such
proposal or other factors and risks in addition to those specifically
contemplated hereby, and which proposal is not conditioned upon obtaining
additional financing; and (ii) is, in light of the other terms of such
proposal, more favorable to RBPI than the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and (c) is reasonably likely to be completed
on the terms proposed, in each case taking into account all legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of the proposal.

 



 

6.10.3. RBPI shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) notify BMBC in writing if any proposals or offers are received by, any
information is requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought
to be initiated or continued with, RBPI or any RBPI Representatives, in each
case in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, and such notice shall
indicate the name of the Person initiating such discussions or negotiations or
making such proposal, offer or information request and the terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers (and, in the case of written materials
relating to such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or
discussion, providing copies of such materials (including e-mails or other
electronic communications) unless (a) such materials constitute confidential
information of the party making such offer or proposal under an effective
confidentiality agreement, (b) disclosure of such materials jeopardizes the
attorney-client privilege or (c) disclosure of such materials contravenes any
law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree). RBPI agrees that it shall
keep BMBC informed, on a current basis, of the status and terms of any such
proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or discussions (including
any amendments or modifications to such proposal, offer or request).

 



 

6.10.4. Neither the Board of Directors of RBPI nor any committee thereof
shall (a) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose to withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse in any respect to BMBC in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Merger), the RBPI Recommendation (as defined in Section 8.1), or take any
action or make any statement, filing or release, in connection with the RBPI
Shareholders Meeting or otherwise, inconsistent with the RBPI Recommendation
(it being understood that taking a neutral position or no position with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an adverse modification
of the RBPI Recommendation); (b) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; (c) resolve to take, or
publicly announce an intention to take, any of the foregoing actions (each of
(a), (b) and (c), an "RBPI Subsequent Determination"); or (d) enter into (or
cause RBPI or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into) any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement (i) related
to any Acquisition Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement entered
into in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.10.2) or (ii) requiring
RBPI to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 



 

 



   



 

6.10.5. Notwithstanding Section 6.10.4, prior to the date of RBPI
Shareholders Meeting, the Board of Directors of RBPI may make an RBPI
Subsequent Determination after the third (3rd) Business Day following BMBC's
receipt of a notice (the "Notice of Superior Proposal") from RBPI advising
BMBC that the Board of Directors of RBPI has decided that a bona fide
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that it received (that did not result
from a breach of this Section 6.10) constitutes a Superior Proposal (it being
understood that RBPI shall be required to deliver a new Notice of Superior
Proposal in respect of any revised Superior Proposal from such third party or
its affiliates that RBPI proposes to accept and the subsequent notice period
shall be two (2) Business Days) if, but only if, (a) the Board of Directors of
RBPI has reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation with and
having considered the advice of outside legal counsel and a financial advisor,
that the failure to take such actions would be reasonably likely to violate
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (b) at the end of such three
(3) Business Day period or the two (2) Business Day period (as the case may
be), after taking into account any such adjusted, modified or amended terms as
may have been committed to in writing by BMBC since its receipt of such Notice
of Superior Proposal ( _provided_ , _however_ , that BMBC shall not have any
obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications or amendments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement), the Board of Directors of RBPI has
again in good faith made the determination (i) in clause (a) of this Section
6.10.5 and (ii) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the changing, qualifying or modifying
of the RBPI Recommendation or the making of a RBPI Subsequent Determination by
the Board of Directors of RBPI shall not change the approval of the Board of
Directors of RBPI for purposes of causing any applicable federal or state
anti-takeover laws or regulations to be inapplicable to this Agreement and the
RBPI Voting Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including the Merger.

 



 

6.10.6. Nothing contained in Section 6.10 shall prohibit RBPI or the Board
of Directors of RBPI from complying with RBPI's obligations under Rules 14d-9
(as if such rule were applicable to RBPI) and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , _that_ any such disclosure relating to
an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed a change in the RBPI Recommendation
unless the Board of Directors of RBPI reaffirms the RBPI Recommendation in
such disclosure, in which case, for the avoidance of doubt, such disclosure
will not be considered a RBPI Subsequent Determination.

 



 

 _6.11. Reserves and Merger_ _-Related Costs._

 



 

RBPI agrees to consult with BMBC with respect to its loan, litigation and real
estate valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and
levels of reserves). BMBC and RBPI shall also consult with respect to the
character, amount and timing of restructuring charges to be taken by each of
them in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and shall take
such charges as BMBC shall reasonably request and which are not inconsistent
with GAAP; _provided_ that no such actions need be effected until BMBC shall
have irrevocably certified to RBPI that all conditions set forth in Article IX
to the obligation of BMBC to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
have been satisfied or, where legally permissible, waived.

 



 



 

 



   



 

 _6.12. RBPI/RBA Board of Directors and Committee Meetings._

 



 

RBPI shall distribute by overnight mail with an electronic copy by email, a
copy of any RBPI or RBA board or board committee package, including the agenda
and any draft minutes, to BMBC at the same time in which it distributes a copy
of such package to the board of directors of RBPI, RBA, or any committee
thereof, as the case may be, and RBPI and RBA shall permit representatives of
BMBC to attend any meeting of the Board of Directors of RBPI and/or RBA or any
committees thereof as an observer; provided that neither RBPI nor RBA shall be
required to copy BMBC on any documents with respect to, or permit the BMBC
representative to remain present during, any confidential discussion of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or any third party proposal
to acquire control of RBPI or RBA or during any other matter that the
respective Board of Directors has been advised of by counsel that such
distribution to, or participation by BMBC would violate a confidentiality
obligation or fiduciary duty or any Law, or may result in a waiver of RBPI's
or RBA's attorney-client privilege.

 



 

 _6.13. RBPI/RBA Director and Employee Agreements._

 



 

6.13.1. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, each individual
who is a director of RBPI or RBA on the date of this Agreement shall have
executed a non-solicitation agreement with a two (2) year term and otherwise
in a form acceptable to BMBC and BMT.

 



 

6.13.2. RBPI shall cause the employees listed on RBPI Disclosure Schedule
6.13.2 to execute and deliver, in the manner prescribed by RBPI Disclosure
Schedule 6.13.2, legally binding non-solicitation agreements, in the form set
forth as _Exhibit D_ hereto ("Employee Non-Solicitation Agreements"), and,
until the Effective Time, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce
or cause to be enforced each such Non-Solicitation Agreement; notwithstanding
the foregoing, should RBPI learn that a party to an Employee Non-Solicitation
Agreement is in violation of any of the terms or conditions thereof, RBPI
shall notify BMBC in writing immediately, and shall take such steps as BMBC
reasonably requests in order to enforce such agreement.

 



 

6.13.3. RBPI shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each and
every employment, consulting, change in control or severance agreement or
contract providing severance payments to any employee or consultant whose
employment or services are terminated on or after the date hereof to be
subject to a legally binding amendment or provision that (i) requires the
execution of a release in a form satisfactory to RBPI or its successor as a
precondition to the payment of severance (or similar) benefits thereunder and
(ii) imposes non-solicitation and non-competition restrictions on the
applicable counterparty(ies) satisfactory to BMBC and RBPI.

 



 



 

 



   



 

 _6.14. Anti-takeover Provisions._

 



 

To the extent legally permitted, RBPI and its Subsidiaries shall take all
steps required by any applicable Law or under any relevant agreement or other
document to exempt or continue to exempt BMBC, BMT, the Merger, the Bank
Merger, the Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby from any
provisions of an anti-takeover nature contained in RBPI's or its Subsidiaries'
organizational documents, and the provisions of any applicable federal or
state anti-takeover Laws.

 



 

 _6.15. 2016 Tax Returns_ _._

 



 

RBPI shall file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns required to be filed by
or with respect to RBPI and every RBPI Subsidiary, either separately or as a
member of a group of corporations, with respect to the taxable year ended
December 31, 2016. RBPI shall provide a draft copy of the federal return to
BMBC for its review and approval not later than June 15, 2017. BMBC agrees to
provide its approval and any comments on said draft no later than July 31,
2017 so as to enable timely filing of the extended RBPI and Subsidiary federal
return on or before September 15, 2017. RBPI shall not, and shall not allow
any RBPI Subsidiary, to file such Tax Returns without the prior written
approval of BMBC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, RBPI and each RBPI Subsidiary
agree that they shall not file such Tax Returns in any manner materially
different from their past customs or practices to the extent permitted by
applicable Law.

 



 

 _6.16. RBPI Warrants_ _._

 



 

RBPI shall diligently attempt to repurchase and retire the RBPI Warrants prior
to the Closing Date for an amount mutually acceptable to RBPI and BMBC after
consultation with each other.

 



 

 _6.17. Divestment of Non_ _-Volcker Compliant Securities._

 



 

RBPI shall divest from its investment portfolio prior to July 1, 2017, any
securities that, were they to remain in RBA's investment portfolio through
July 1 2017, would fail to comply with the Volcker Rule (§ 619 (12 U.S.C. §
1851)).

 



 

ARTICLE VII

 


COVENANTS OF BMBC

 



 

 _7.1. Conduct of Business._

 



 

During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
except with the prior written consent of RBPI (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld conditioned or delayed), BMBC will, and it will cause
each BMBC Subsidiary to use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with
past practices to preserve intact its business organization and assets; and
voluntarily take no action that would, or would be reasonably likely to: (a)
adversely affect the ability of the parties to obtain any Regulatory Approval,
or increase the period of time necessary to obtain any such approval; (b)
adversely affect its ability to perform its covenants and agreements under
this Agreement; or (c) result in the representations and warranties contained
in Article V of this Agreement not being true and correct on the date of this
Agreement or at any future date on or prior to the Closing Date or in any of
the conditions set forth in Article IX hereof not being satisfied.

 



 



 

 



   



 

 _7.2. Current Information._

 



 

During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, BMBC
will cause one or more of its representatives to confer with representatives
of RBPI and report the general status of its ongoing operations at such times
and in such manner as RBPI may reasonably request. BMBC will promptly notify
RBPI, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, of any governmental
complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications indicating that the
same may be contemplated), which might adversely affect the ability of the
parties to obtain the Regulatory Approvals or increase the period of time
necessary to obtain such approvals; or the institution of material litigation
involving BMBC and any BMBC Subsidiary.

 



 

 _7.3. Financial and Other Statements._

 



 

From and after the date hereof until the Effective Time, BMBC will make
available to RBPI the Securities Documents filed by it with the SEC under the
Securities Laws and will furnish to RBPI copies of all documents, statements
and reports that it or BMT intends to file with any Bank Regulator with
respect to the Merger.

 



 

 _7.4. Consents and Approvals of Third Parties._

 



 

BMBC shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as soon as
practicable all consents and approvals, necessary or desirable for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, BMBC's obligations with respect to obtaining Regulatory
Approvals shall be governed by Section 8.3.

 



 

 _7.5. Commercially Reasonable Efforts._

 



 

Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, BMBC agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and
to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with RBPI in doing,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in
the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, without limitation, any actions necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law and any actions, assistance or cooperation in
preparation for the conversion and integration of RBA's operations into BMT's
operations.

 



 

 _7.6. Failure to Fulfill Conditions._

 



 

In the event that BMBC determines that a condition to its obligation to
complete the Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will not waive that
condition, it will promptly notify RBPI.

 



 



 

 



   



 

 _7.7. Employee Benefits._

 



 

7.7.1. Prior to the Effective Time, BMBC shall take all reasonable action
so that employees of RBPI and its Subsidiaries who become employees of BMBC or
a BMBC Subsidiary ("Continuing Employees") shall be entitled to participate,
effective as soon as administratively practicable following the Effective
Time, in each of the BMBC Compensation and Benefit Plans to the same extent as
similarly-situated employees of BMBC and its Subsidiaries (it being understood
that inclusion of the employees of RBPI and its Subsidiaries in the BMBC
Compensation and Benefit Plans may occur at different times with respect to
different plans and that any grants to any Continuing Employee under any BMBC
Stock Benefit Plan shall be at the discretion of BMBC). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, BMBC may determine to continue any of the employee benefit plans,
programs or arrangements of RBPI or any its Subsidiaries for Continuing
Employees in lieu of offering participation in the BMBC Compensation and
Benefit Plans providing similar benefits (e.g., medical and hospitalization
benefits), to terminate any of such benefit plans, or to merge any such
benefit plans with the corresponding BMBC Compensation and Benefit Plans,
provided the result is the provision of benefits to Continuing Employees that
are substantially similar to the benefits provided to the employees of BMBC
and its Subsidiaries generally. Should BMBC notify RBPI in advance of the
Effective Time that it wishes RBPI or any RBPI Subsidiary to terminate any
RBPI Compensation and Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time, RBPI shall
take all steps necessary to comply with such request prior to the Effective
Time; provided that RBPI shall have no obligation to terminate any such plan
unless and until BMBC shall have irrevocably certified to RBPI that all
conditions set forth in Article IX to the obligation of BMBC to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby have been satisfied or, where legally
permissible, waived. BMBC shall cause each BMBC Compensation and Benefit Plan
in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate to recognize, for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate in, the vesting of benefits
and for all other purposes (but not for the accrual of benefits, except as
specifically set forth herein) under the BMBC Compensation and Benefit Plans
the service of such Continuing Employees with RBPI and its Subsidiaries or any
predecessor thereto prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that
credit for benefit accrual purposes shall be given for purposes of BMBC
vacation and other leave policies or programs and for purposes of the
calculation of severance benefits under any severance compensation plan or
practice of BMBC and its Subsidiaries as set forth in BMBC Disclosure Schedule
7.7.1. This Agreement shall not be construed to limit the ability of BMBC or
BMT to terminate the employment of any employee or to review employee benefits
programs from time to time and to make such changes (including terminating any
program) as they deem appropriate.

 



 

7.7.2. BMT agrees to honor, or cause one of the BMT Subsidiaries to honor,
in accordance with their terms, all employment and change of control
agreements listed on RBPI Disclosure Schedule 4.8.1, each as amended pursuant
to Section 6.13.3, as applicable, subject to any limitations imposed under
applicable Law or by any Regulatory Authority; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the foregoing shall not prevent BMT or any of the BMT Subsidiaries from
amending or terminating any such agreement in accordance with its terms and
applicable Law.

 



 

7.7.3. Subject to the execution of a standard release in form acceptable
to BMBC, any employee of RBPI or any RBPI Subsidiary who is not a party to an

the date hereof and at or before the Effective Time or within twelve (12)
months after the Effective Time, shall receive severance pay at the time of
termination of employment in an amount equal to two (2) weeks of such
employee's regular pay for each year that such employee was employed by RBPI,
any RBPI Subsidiary or any successor thereto, up to a maximum of twenty six
(26) weeks.

 



 



 

 



   



 



 

7.7.4. In the event of any termination of any medical, dental, health or
disability plan (collectively, "Health Plans") of RBPI and its Subsidiaries or
the consolidation of any such Health Plans with a corresponding Health Plan of
BMBC and its Subsidiaries, BMBC shall make available to Continuing Employees
and their dependents employer-provided coverage under the corresponding Health
Plans of BMBC and its Subsidiaries on the same basis as it provides coverage
to employees of BMBC and its Subsidiaries, provided that BMBC shall cause each
such plan to (a) waive any pre-existing condition limitations to the extent
such conditions are covered under the applicable Health Plans of RBPI and its
Subsidiaries, (b) honor under such plans any deductible, co-payment and out-
of-pocket expenses incurred by the employees and their dependents under the
Health Plans of RBPI and its Subsidiaries during the portion of the plan year
prior to participation in the corresponding Health Plan of BMBC and its
Subsidiaries, and (c) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of
insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to the Continuing
Employees and their dependents on or after the Effective Time, in each case to
the extent such employee or dependent had satisfied any similar limitation or
requirement under an analogous Health Plan of RBPI or its Subsidiaries prior
to the Effective Time. Unless a Continuing Employee affirmatively terminates
coverage under a Health Plan of RBPI and its Subsidiaries prior to the time
that such Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate in the
corresponding Health Plan of BMBC and its Subsidiaries, no coverage of any of
the Continuing Employees or their dependents shall terminate under any Health
Plan of RBPI and its Subsidiaries prior to the time such Continuing Employees
and their dependents become eligible to participate in the Health Plans,
programs and benefits common to all employees of BMBC and its Subsidiaries and
their dependents. In the event of a termination or consolidation of any Health
Plan of RBPI and its Subsidiaries, terminated employees of RBPI and its
Subsidiaries and qualified beneficiaries will have the right to continued
coverage under group Health Plans of BMBC and its Subsidiaries in accordance
with COBRA.

 



 

 _7.8. Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance._

 



 

7.8.1. For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, BMBC shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or who has been at
any time before the date hereof or who becomes before the Effective Time, an
officer or director of RBPI or a RBPI Subsidiary (the "Indemnified Parties")
against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including attorney's
fees), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement (which
settlement shall require the prior written consent of BMBC, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld) of or in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, or
administrative (each a "Claim"), in which an Indemnified Party is, or is
threatened to be made, a party or witness in whole or in part or arising in
whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director or
officer of RBPI or a RBPI Subsidiary if such Claim pertains to any matter of
fact arising, existing or occurring at or before the Effective Time
(including, without limitation, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby), regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed
before, or after, the Effective Time, to the fullest extent as would have been
permitted by RBPI under the PBCL and under RBPI's articles of incorporation
and bylaws or equivalent governing documents of any RBPI Subsidiary, as
applicable, in each case as in effect on the date hereof. BMBC shall pay
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such action or proceeding
to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent as would have been permitted
by RBPI under the PBCL and under RBPI's articles of incorporation upon receipt
of an undertaking to repay such advance payments if such Indemnified Party
shall be adjudicated or determined to be not entitled to indemnification in
the manner set forth below. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this Section 7.8.1 upon learning of any Claim, shall
notify BMBC (but the failure so to notify BMBC shall not relieve it from any
liability which it may have under this Section 7.8.1, except to the extent
such failure prejudices BMBC) and shall deliver to BMBC the undertaking
referred to in the previous sentence.

 



 



 

 



   



 

7.8.2. In the event that either BMBC or any of its successors or assigns
(a) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving bank or entity of such consolidation or merger or (b)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of BMBC shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 7.8.

 



 

7.8.3. BMBC shall maintain, or shall cause BMT to maintain, in effect for
six (6) years following the Effective Time, the current directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies covering the officers and directors of
RBPI ( _provided_ , that BMBC may substitute therefore policies of at least
the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are not materially
less favorable) with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall BMBC be required to
expend per year pursuant to this Section 7.8.3 more than one hundred fifty
percent (150%) of the annual cost currently expended by RBPI with respect to
such insurance (the "Maximum Amount"); _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
amount of the annual premium necessary to maintain or procure such insurance
coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, BMBC shall maintain the most advantageous
policies of directors' and officers' insurance obtainable for a premium equal
to the Maximum Amount. In connection with the foregoing, RBPI agrees in order
for BMBC to fulfill its agreement to provide directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies for six (6) years to provide such insurer or
substitute insurer with such reasonable and customary representations as such
insurer may request with respect to the reporting of any prior claims.

 



 

7.8.4. The obligations of BMBC provided under this Section 7.8 are
intended to be enforceable against BMBC directly by the Indemnified Parties
and their respective heirs and representatives and shall be binding on all
respective successors and permitted assigns of BMBC.

 



 

 _7.9. Stock Listing._

 



 

Prior to the Effective Time, BMBC will take all steps necessary to list on
NASDAQ (or such other national securities exchange on which the shares of the
BMBC Common Stock shall be listed as of the date of consummation of the
Merger), subject to official notice of issuance, the shares of BMBC Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger. At all times from the date of this Agreement
until the Merger Consideration has been paid in full, BMBC will reserve a
sufficient number of shares of BMBC Common Stock to fulfill its obligations
under this Agreement.

 



 



 

 



   



 

 _7.10. BMT Advisory Board_ _._

 



 

Upon the Effective Time, BMT shall form an advisory board (the "Advisory
Board"), comprised of certain members of RBPI's and/or RBA's Boards of
Directors immediately prior to the Effective Time who do not become directors
of BMBC and BMT pursuant to Section 7.11 hereof and who agree in writing, at
or prior to the Effective Time, to serve on such Advisory Board immediately
following the Effective Time.

 



 

 _7.11. BMBC/BMT Board of Directors._

 



 

Following the date of this Agreement, BMBC and BMT shall take all action
necessary to (a) cause each of their boards of directors to be increased by
one member, effective immediately following the Effective Time, and (b) elect
one current director of RBPI selected by BMBC, in its sole discretion, as a
director to each of BMBC and BMT in the class of directors whose terms expire
at the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders of BMBC. At the end of the initial
term of such director, he or she will be re-nominated for an additional term,
subject to the fiduciary duties of the board of directors of BMBC and any
applicable eligibility requirements set forth in BMBC's articles of
incorporation, bylaws, or nominating and corporate governance committee
guidelines, or any applicable Law, such that the director will have the
opportunity to serve at least four years on the boards of directors of BMBC
and BMT. In the event such director of RBPI resigns or is unable to serve as a
director of BMBC and BMT for any reason, BMBC will consider the election of
another former director of RBPI (who meets the criteria set forth in the
preceding sentence) selected by BMBC, in its sole discretion, to fill the
unexpired term of the director of RBPI originally elected by BMBC and BMT to
their respective boards of directors.

 



 

 _7.12. Rule 16b-3._

 



 

BMBC shall take all steps, as may be necessary or appropriate, to cause the
transactions contemplated by Article III and any other dispositions of equity
securities of RBPI (including derivative securities) or acquisitions of equity
securities of BMBC in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

applicable Law. RBPI shall keep BMBC updated with respect to the proxy
solicitation results in connection with the RBPI Shareholders Meeting as
reasonably requested by BMBC.

 



 

8.1.3. Except to the extent provided otherwise in Section 6.10, RBPI shall

quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of
such meeting RBPI has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of

the SEC. BMBC shall give RBPI and its counsel reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Proxy Statement-Prospectus prior to its being filed with
the SEC and shall give RBPI and its counsel the reasonable opportunity to

become effective or any supplement or amendment thereto has been filed, the
issuance of any stop order, or the suspension of the qualifications of shares
of BMBC Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Merger Registration Statement,
or the initiation of any proceeding for any such purpose.

 



 

8.2.3. RBPI and BMBC shall promptly notify the other party if at any time
it becomes aware that the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or the Merger
Registration Statement contains any untrue statement of a material fact or
omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. In such event, RBPI shall cooperate with
BMBC in the preparation of a supplement or amendment to such Proxy Statement-

 _11.1. Termination._

 



 

This Agreement may be terminated, and the transactions contemplated hereby may
be abandoned:

 



 

11.1.1. At any time prior to the Effective Time, by the mutual consent, in
writing, of BMBC and RBPI;

 



 

11.1.2. By BMBC or RBPI in the event any Regulatory Approval required for
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have
been denied by final, non-appealable action by such Governmental Entity or an
Application therefor shall have been withdrawn at the request of a
Governmental Entity; provided, however, that no party shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.1.2 if such denial shall
be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to
perform or observe the covenants of such party set forth in this Agreement;

 



 

11.1.3. By either BMBC or RBPI (provided, in the case of RBPI, that it
shall not be in breach of any of its obligations under Section 8.1), if the
Requisite RBPI Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained by reason of
the failure to obtain the required vote at a duly held meeting of such
shareholders and at any adjournment or postponement thereof required by this
Agreement;

 



 



 

 



   



 

11.1.4. By either BMBC or RBPI (provided that the terminating party is not
then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein in a manner that would entitle the other party to
not consummate this Agreement) if there shall have been a breach of any of
such representations or warranties by the other party which breach of any of
such representations or warranties by the other party, either individually or
in the aggregate with other breaches by such other party, would result in, if
occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the condition set
forth in Section 9.2.1 or Section 9.3.1, as the case may be, to be satisfied,
which breach is not cured within thirty (30) days after receipt by such party
of written notice specifying the nature of such breach and requesting that it
be remedied; provided, that, if such breach cannot reasonably be cured within
such 30-day period but may reasonably be cured within sixty (60) days, and
such cure is being diligently pursued, no such termination shall occur prior
to the expiration of such sixty (60)-day period;

 



 

11.1.5. By either BMBC or RBPI (provided that the terminating party is not
then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein in a manner that would entitle the other party not
to consummate the agreement) if there shall have been a breach of any of the
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement on the part of the other
party, which breach of any of the covenants or agreements either individually
or in the aggregate with other breaches by such party, would result in, if not
cured by the Closing Date, the failure of the condition set forth in Section
9.2.2 or Section 9.3.2, as the case may be, to be satisfied, which breach is
not cured within thirty (30) days after receipt by such party of written
notice specifying the nature of such breach and requesting that it be
remedied; provided, that, if such breach cannot reasonably be cured within
such 30-day period but may reasonably be cured within sixty (60) days, and
such cure is being diligently pursued, no such termination shall occur prior
to the expiration of such sixty (60)-day period;

 



 

11.1.6. By either BMBC or RBPI if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the Termination Date, unless the failure of the
Closing to occur by such date shall be due to a material breach of this
Agreement by the party seeking to terminate this Agreement; provided, however,
if additional time is necessary in order to obtain any required Regulatory
Approvals, the Termination Date shall be automatically extended for one
additional three-month period;

 



 

11.1.7. In addition to and not in limitation of BMBC's termination rights
under Section 11.1.5, by BMBC prior to the Requisite RBPI Shareholder Approval
being obtained if (i) there shall have been a material breach of Section 6.10
and such breach shall not have been cured on or before the expiration of the
fifth (5th) Business Day after the occurrence of such breach; or (ii) the
Board of Directors of RBPI makes a RBPI Subsequent Determination;

 



 

11.1.8. By RBPI, at any time prior to the Requisite RBPI Shareholder
Approval being obtained, in the event that RBPI shall conclude, in good faith
after consultation with its legal and financial advisors, that it must agree
to endorse a Superior Proposal and terminate this Agreement in order to comply
with its fiduciary duties, provided that RBPI has complied with all of its
obligations under Section 6.10 of this Agreement.

 



 



 

 



   



 

11.1.9. By BMBC, if any Phase IIs, considered together or separately,
confirm the existence at or from the assessed property or properties of a
Release or Releases which (a) either violate an applicable Environmental Law
or are present in concentrations exceeding applicable standards under
applicable Environmental Laws and (b) are estimated by the environmental
consultant preparing the Phase II to cost more than the Environmental
Threshold to remediate in accordance with, and to ensure compliance with,
applicable Environmental Law; _provided_ , that to the extent any such Release
or Releases exist at or from any RBPI OREO, then BMBC shall, to the extent
requested by RBPI, engage in good faith negotiations regarding the mitigating
factors related to such Release and costs for a period of at least fifteen
(15) days prior to exercising BMBC's rights under this Section 11.1.9.

 



 

11.1.10. By RBPI, if the RPBI board of directors so determines by a
majority vote of its members, at any time during the five (5) Business Day
period commencing with the Determination Date, if both of the following
conditions are satisfied:

 



 

(A) the BMBC Determination Date Market Value shall be less than the
Initial BMBC Market Value multiplied by .80; and

 



 

(B) (A) the BMBC Ratio shall be less than (B) the Index Ratio, minus 0.20;
_subject_ , _however_ , to the following: if RBPI elects to exercise its
termination right pursuant to this Section 11.1.10, it shall give prompt
written notice thereof to BMBC and BMBC shall, for a period of five (5)
Business Days after its receipt of such notice, have the option of increasing
the Exchange Ratio (the "Additional Consideration"), by adjusting the Exchange
Ratio to an amount which, when multiplied by the BMBC Determination Date
Market Value equals the lesser of (x) $3.35 or (y) the product of the Index
Ratio and the Initial BMBC Market Value multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. If
within such five (5) Business Day period, BMBC delivers written notice to RBPI
that it intends to proceed by paying the Additional Consideration, as
contemplated by the preceding sentence, then no termination shall occur
pursuant to this Section 11.1.10 and this Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect in accordance with its terms (except that the Merger Consideration
shall have been so modified).

 



 

For purposes of this Section 11.1.10, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated below:

 



 

"BMBC Determination Date Market Value" shall be the average of the daily
closing sales prices of a share of BMBC Common Stock as reported on NASDAQ for
the twenty (20) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the
Determination Date.

 



 

"BMBC Ratio" means the quotient obtained by dividing BMBC Determination Date
Market Value by the Initial BMBC Market Value.

 



 

"Determination Date" shall mean the later of (i) the date on which the last
required approval of a Regulatory Authority is obtained with respect to the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement without regard to any requisite
waiting period (ii) the date of the RBPI Shareholders Meeting.

 



 

"Final Index Price" means the average of the daily closing sales prices of the
ABA NASDAQ Community Bank Index for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days
immediately preceding the Determination Date.

 



 

"Index" means the ABA NASDAQ Community Bank Index.

 



 



 

 



   



 

"Index Ratio" means the quotient obtained by dividing the Final Index Price by
the Initial Index Price.

 



 

"Initial Index Price" means the closing price of the ABA NASDAQ Community Bank
Index as of the Starting Date.

 



 

"Initial BMBC Market Value" means the closing price of BMBC Common Stock on
the Starting Date, adjusted as indicated in the last sentence of this Section
11.1.10.

 



 

"Starting Date" means the last trading day before the date of this Agreement.

 



 

If BMBC declares or effects a stock dividend, reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction between the date of this Agreement and the Determination Date, the
prices for BMBC Common Stock shall be appropriately adjusted for the purposes
of applying this Section 11.1.10.

 



 

 _11.2. Termination Fee; Liquidated Damages_

 



 

11.2.1. In recognition of the efforts, expenses and other opportunities
foregone by BMBC while structuring and pursuing the Merger, RBPI shall pay to
BMBC a termination fee equal to $5,000,000 ("Termination Fee"), by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by BMBC in the
event of any of the following: (a) in the event BMBC terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 11.1.7 or RBPI terminates pursuant to Section 11.1.8, RBPI
shall pay BMBC the Termination Fee within two (2) Business Days after receipt
of BMBC's notification of such termination; or (b) in the event that after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement, an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to the Board of Directors of
RBPI or has been made directly to RBPI shareholders generally (and not
withdrawn) and (i) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either BMBC or
RBPI pursuant to Section 11.1.3 or Section 11.1.6 (without the Requisite RBPI
Shareholder Approval having been obtained) or if this Agreement is terminated
by BMBC pursuant to Section 11.1.4 or Section 11.1.5, and (ii) prior to the
date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, RBPI
enters into any agreement to consummate, or consummates an Acquisition
Transaction (and such Acquisition Transaction relates to the Acquisition
Proposal referred to above), then RBPI shall, on the earlier of the date it
enters into such agreement and the date of consummation of such transaction,
pay BMBC the Termination Fee.

 



 

11.2.2. The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that if BMBC terminates
this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1.4 or Section 11.1.5 by reason of
RBPI's breach of the provisions of this Agreement contemplated by Section
11.1.4 or Section 11.1.5 that is not timely cured as provided in such
sections, the actual damages sustained by BMBC, including the expenses
incurred by BMBC preparatory to entering into this Agreement and in connection
with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, would be
significant and difficult to ascertain, gauged by the circumstances existing
at the time this Agreement is executed, and that in lieu of BMBC being
required to pursue its damage claims in costly litigation proceedings in such
event, the parties agree that RBPI shall pay a reasonable estimate of the
amount of such damages, which the parties agree is the sum of $1,800,000 (the
"Liquidated Damages Amount"), as liquidated damages to BMBC, which payment is
not intended as a penalty, within two (2) Business Days after BMBC's
notification of such termination. Any payment made under this Section 11.2.2
shall reduce on a dollar-for-dollar basis any payment that may be due under
Section 11.2.1.

 



 



 

 



   



 

11.2.3. The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that if RBPI terminates
this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1.4 or Section 11.1.5 by reason of
BMBC's breach of the provisions of this Agreement contemplated by Section
11.1.4 or Section 11.1.5 that is not timely cured as provided in such
sections, the actual damages sustained by RBPI, including the expenses
incurred by RBPI preparatory to entering into this Agreement and in connection
with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, would be
significant and difficult to ascertain, gauged by the circumstances existing
at the time this Agreement is executed, and that in lieu of RBPI being
required to pursue its damage claims in costly litigation proceedings in such
event, the parties agree that BMBC shall pay the Liquidated Damages Amount, as
liquidated damages to RBPI, which payment is not intended as a penalty, within
two (2) Business Days after RBPI's notification of such termination.

 



 

11.2.4. RBPI and BMBC each agree that the agreements contained in this
Section 11.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither party would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if a party fails promptly to pay any amounts
due under this Section 11.2, such party shall pay interest on such amounts
from the date payment of such amounts were due to the date of actual payment
at the rate of interest equal to the sum of (i) the rate of interest published
from time to time in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition (or any
successor publication thereto), designated therein as the prime rate on the
date such payment was due, plus (ii) 200 basis points, together with the costs
and expenses of the other party (including reasonable legal fees and expenses)
reasonably incurred in connection with such suit.

 



 

11.2.5. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, the parties agree that if RBPI pays or causes to be paid to BMBC
the Termination Fee in accordance with Section 11.2.1, or, if applicable, the
Liquidated Damages Amount in accordance with Section 11.2.2, or if BMBC pays
or causes to be paid to RBPI the Liquidated Damages Amount in accordance with
Section 11.2.3, neither paying party nor its subsidiary bank (nor any
successor in interest, Affiliate, shareholder, director, officer, employee,
agent, consultant or representative of such paying party or its subsidiary
bank) will have any further obligations or liabilities to the other party or
its subsidiary bank with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the payment of such amounts shall be the
receiving party's sole and exclusive remedy against the other party, its
subsidiary bank, and their respective Affiliates, representatives or
successors in interest; provided that nothing contained in this Agreement
shall limit either party's rights to recover any liabilities or damages
arising out of the other party's intentional misrepresentation or willful
breach of any provision of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the
parties agree that the fee payable under Section 11.2.1 shall not be required
to be paid more than once.

 



 



 

 



   



 

 _11.3. Effect of Termination._

 



 

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11.1, this Agreement shall
become void and of no effect without liability of any party (or any
shareholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative
of such party or any of its Affiliates) to the other party hereto, except as
provided in Section 11.2.5. The provisions of this Section 11.3, and Section
11.2, 12.1, 12.2, 12.4, 12.5, 12.6, 12.9, 12.10, 12.11 shall survive any
termination hereof pursuant to Section 11.1.

 



 

 _11.4. Amendment, Extension and Waiver._

 



 

Subject to applicable Law, at any time prior to the Effective Time (whether
before or after approval thereof by the shareholders of RBPI), the parties
hereto by action of their respective Boards of Directors, may (a) amend this
Agreement, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of any other party hereto, (c) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto, or (d) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any approval
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by the shareholders
of RBPI, there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any
amendment of this Agreement which reduces the amount, value or changes the
form of consideration to be delivered to RBPI's shareholders pursuant to this
Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party, but such
waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with such obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel
with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

 _12.6. Complete Agreement_ _._

 



 

This Agreement, including the exhibits and Schedules hereto and the documents
and other writings referred to herein or therein or delivered pursuant hereto,

In the event that any one or more provisions of this Agreement shall for any
reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, by any court
of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
shall not affect any other provisions of this Agreement and the parties shall
use their reasonable efforts to substitute a valid, legal and enforceable
provision which, insofar as practical, implements the purposes and intents of
this Agreement.

 



 

 _12.9. Governing Law_ _._

 



 

12.9.1. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of Pennsylvania,
without giving effect to its principles of conflicts of laws.

 



 

12.9.2. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY

ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. Each party
certifies and acknowledges that (i) no representative, agent or attorney of
any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party
would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver,
(ii) each party understands and has considered the implications of this
waiver, (iii) each party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (iv) each party
has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the
mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section 12.9.2_.

 



 

 _12.10. Interpretation._

 



 

When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections or Exhibits, such
reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The recitals hereto constitute an integral part of this
Agreement. References to Sections include subsections, which are part of the
related Section (e.g., a section numbered "Section 5.5.1" would be part of
"Section 5.5" and references to "Section 5.5" would also refer to material
contained in the subsection described as "Section 5.5.1"). The table of
contents, index and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The phrases "the date of this Agreement," "the date
hereof" and terms of similar import, unless the context otherwise requires,
shall be deemed to refer to the date set forth in the Recitals to this
Agreement. The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement. All documents and information set forth in BMBC's Securities
Documents shall be deemed to have been "made available" or "provided" to RBPI.

 



 



 

 



   



 

 _12.11. Disclosure Schedules._

 



 

12.11.1. The RBPI Disclosure Schedule and the BMBC Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed part of this Agreement and are fully incorporated into this
Agreement by reference. Any reference in a particular section or subsection of
either the RBPI Disclosure Schedule or the BMBC Disclosure Schedule shall only
be deemed a reference to, an exception to or a modification of (or, as
applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and
warranties or covenants, as applicable, of the relevant party that are
contained in the corresponding section or subsection of this Agreement, and
(b) any other section or subsection of the RBPI Disclosure Schedule or the
BMBC Disclosure Schedule, as applicable (and accordingly any other
representations, warranties or covenants of such party contained in the
corresponding section or subsection of this Agreement), but only if the
relevance of that reference as an exception to or a modification of (or a
disclosure for purposes of) such representations, warranties and covenants of
the relevant party, whether or not an explicit cross-reference appears, to
such other section or subsection is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure. Nothing in the RBPI Disclosure Schedule or the BMBC Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to or a
modification of a representation or a warranty unless such schedule identifies
the exception with reasonable particularity and describes the relevant facts
in reasonable detail.

 



 

12.11.2. During the period from the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, each party will promptly notify the other party in writing of
any matter hereafter arising which, if existing, occurring or known at the
date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described
in its Disclosure Schedule to Article 4 or Article 5, as applicable, or which
is necessary to correct any information in its Disclosure Schedule that has
been rendered materially inaccurate thereby. Each such notice shall include,
or be accompanied by, a proposed supplement or amendment to such Party's
Disclosure Schedule regarding such matter (a "Schedule Supplement"). Each such
Schedule Supplement shall be deemed to be incorporated into and to supplement
and amend RBPI Disclosure Schedule or BMBC Disclosure Schedule, as applicable,
as of the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date; provided, however, that
if the matter which is the subject of the Schedule Supplement constitutes or
relates to something that could provide BMBC with a right to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with Section 11.1.4 and BMBC does not elect to
terminate this Agreement prior to the earlier of (i) five (5) Business Days
after the expiration of the applicable cure period and (ii) the Termination
Date, then BMBC shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived any right to
terminate this Agreement on account of such matter. No investigation by a
party or its representatives shall be deemed to modify or waive any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the other party or its
subsidiary bank set forth in this Agreement, or the conditions to the
respective obligations of BMBC and RBPI to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 



 

 



   



 

 _12.12. Specific Performance; Jurisdiction._

 



 

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
the provisions contained in this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or was otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions thereof in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania or in any state court located in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a)
consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania or of any state court
located in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the event any dispute arises
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court and (c) agrees that
it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania or any state court
located in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency and adequacy of which are
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby,

other than (i) the Original Shares and (ii) any options, warrants or other
Rights to acquire any additional shares of RBPI Common Stock or any security
exercisable for or convertible into shares of RBPI Common Stock, set forth on
the signature page of this Agreement (collectively, "Options").

 



 

(c) Shareholder has full legal capacity (and, if applicable, corporate
power and authority) to enter into, execute and deliver this Agreement and to
perform fully Shareholder's obligations hereunder. This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by Shareholder and constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of Shareholder, enforceable against
Shareholder in accordance with its terms, except in each case as enforcement
may be limited by general principles of equity, whether applied in a court of
law or court of equity, and by bankruptcy, insolvency and similar Laws
affecting creditor's rights and remedies generally.

 



 

(d) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder,
the consummation by Shareholder of the transactions contemplated hereby or
compliance by Shareholder with any of the provisions hereof will conflict with
or result in a breach, or constitute a default (with or without notice or
lapse of time or both) under any provision of, any trust agreement, loan or
credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other agreement,
instrument or Law applicable to Shareholder or to Shareholder's property or
assets.

 



 

(e) No consent, approval or authorization of, or designation, declaration
or filing with, any Governmental Entity or other Person on the part of
Shareholder is required in connection with the valid execution and delivery of

Shareholder's spouse is necessary under any "community property" or other Laws
in order for Shareholder to enter into and perform its obligations under this
Agreement.

 



 

3. _Agreement to Vote Shares_. Shareholder agrees during the term of this Agreement to vote the Shares, and to cause any holder of record of Shares to vote (or execute a written consent or consents if shareholders of RBPI are requested to vote their shares through the execution of an action by written consent in lieu of any such annual or special meeting of shareholders of RBPI):

 



 

(a) in favor of the Merger, the Merger Agreement and any other matter
necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by Merger
Agreement, at every meeting (or in connection with any action by written
consent) of the shareholders of RBPI at which such matters are considered, at
every adjournment or postponement thereof or in any other circumstances upon
which their vote or other approval is sought; and

 



 



 

 



   



 

(b) against (1) any Superior Proposal or any action which is a component
of any Superior Proposal, (2) any Acquisition Proposal, (3) any action,
proposal, transaction or agreement which would reasonably be expected to
result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other
obligation or agreement of RBPI under the Merger Agreement or of Shareholder
under this Agreement, (4) any action, proposal, transaction or agreement that
would reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, discourage,
adversely affect or inhibit the timely consummation of the Merger or the
fulfillment of RBPI's conditions under the Merger Agreement and (5) change in
any manner the voting rights of any class of shares of RBPI (including any
amendments to the articles of incorporation or bylaws of RBPI).

This proxy and power of attorney is given to secure the performance of the duties of Shareholder under this Agreement. Shareholder shall take such further action or execute such other instruments as may be necessary to effectuate the intent of this proxy. This proxy and power of attorney granted by Shareholder shall be irrevocable during the term of this Agreement, shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest sufficient in Law to support an irrevocable proxy and shall revoke any and all prior proxies granted by Shareholder with respect to the Shares. The power of attorney granted by Shareholder herein is a durable power of attorney and shall survive the dissolution, bankruptcy, death or incapacity of Shareholder. The proxy and power of attorney granted hereunder shall terminate upon the termination of this Agreement.

 



 

5. _No Solicitation_.

Shareholder agrees that Shareholder will not, and will not permit any entity under Shareholder's control to, deposit any of the Shares in a voting trust, grant any proxies with respect to the Shares or subject any of the Shares to any arrangement with respect to the voting of the Shares other than agreements entered into with BMBC.

 



 



 

 



   



 

7. _Transfer and Encumbrance_. Shareholder agrees that during the term of this Agreement, Shareholder will not, directly or indirectly, transfer, sell, offer, exchange, assign, pledge or otherwise dispose of or encumber ("Transfer") any of the Shares or enter into any contract, option or other agreement with respect to, or consent to, a Transfer of, any of the Shares or Shareholder's voting or economic interest therein.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Shareholder may Transfer any of the Shares or enter into any agreement with respect to the Transfer of Shares by obtaining the prior written consent of BMBC. 

 



 

8. _Additional Shares_. Shareholder agrees that all shares of RBPI Common Stock that Shareholder purchases, acquires the right to vote or otherwise acquires beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of after the execution of this Agreement, including, without limitation, any RBPI Common Stock issued upon the exercise or conversion of any RBPI Option, shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement and shall constitute Shares for all purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

9. _Waiver of Appraisal and Dissenters ' Rights_. Shareholder hereby waives, and agrees not to assert or perfect, any rights of appraisal or rights to dissent from the Merger that Shareholder may have by virtue of ownership of the Shares.

11. _No Agreement as Director or Officer or Trustee_. Shareholder makes no agreement or understanding in this Agreement in Shareholder's individual capacity as a director or officer of RBPI or any of its subsidiaries (if Shareholder holds such office) or as a trustee of a trust, as applicable, and nothing in this Agreement: (a) will limit or affect any actions or omissions taken by Shareholder in Shareholder's capacity as such a director or officer, including in exercising rights under the Merger Agreement, and no such actions or omissions shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement or (b) will be construed to prohibit, limit or restrict Shareholder from exercising Shareholder's fiduciary duties as an officer or director of RBPI or its subsidiaries or as a trustee of a trust.

 



 

12. _No Ownership Interest_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in BMBC any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to any of the Shares. All rights, ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the Shares shall remain vested in and belong to Shareholder, and BMBC shall not have any authority to direct Shareholder in the voting of the Shares, except as otherwise set forth herein.

 



 

13. _Specific Performance_. Shareholder acknowledges that (i) it may be impossible to measure in money the damage to BMBC if Shareholder fails to comply with any of the obligations imposed by this Agreement, (ii) every such obligation is material and (iii) in the event of any such failure, BMBC will not have an adequate remedy at law or in damages. Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy, in addition to any remedies at law or damages, is the appropriate remedy for any such failure and will not oppose the granting of any such remedy relief on the basis that BMBC has an adequate remedy at law. Shareholder agrees that Shareholder will not seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond or other security in connection with BMBC's seeking or obtaining such equitable relief.

 



 

 



   



 

14. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended or supplemented, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived, except by an instrument in writing signed by both of the parties hereto. No waiver of any provisions hereof by either party shall be deemed a waiver of any other provisions hereof by such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party.

 



 

15. _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands, and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given (a) when delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt), (b) when received by the addressee if sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier (receipt requested), (c) on the date sent by e-mail of a PDF document (with confirmation of transmission) if sent during normal business hours of the recipient, and on the next Business Day if sent after normal business hours of the recipient, or (d) on the third day after the date mailed, by United States certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid.

EXHIBIT D

 



 

 _FORM OF_ _EMPLOYEE restrictive covenant AGREEMENT_

 



 

THIS EMPLOYEE RESTRICTIVE COVENANT AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is executed and
delivered as of _________________, 2017 (the ("Delivery Date"), by and among
Royal Bancshares of Pennsylvania, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation ("RBPI"),
Royal Bank America, a Pennsylvania chartered bank ("RBA"), and
_______________________ ("Employee").

 



 

BACKGROUND

 



 

RBPI has entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 30,
2017 ("Merger Agreement"), with Bryn Mawr Bank Corporation ("BMBC"), providing
for the merger of RBPI with and into BMBC, and the subsequent merger of RBA
with and into BMBC\'s wholly owned subsidiary, The Bryn Mawr Trust Company
(collectively, the "Merger"). Each of RBPI and RBA are entering into this
Agreement with Employee as a material inducement to BMBC to complete the
Merger. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings
ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement.

 



 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained
herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency
of which are hereby acknowledged, intending to be legally bound, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

 



     

1.

 |  

 _At-Will_ _Employment_ 

---|--- 
 



 

a. Upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, Employee shall devote
substantially all of Employee's business time, attention and energies and the
use of Employee's best efforts to advance the interest, business and welfare
of the Company Group, and Employee shall not take any action which is against
the best interest of the Company Group. Employee shall perform faithfully and
competently such duties as may be assigned to him or her by RBA (or, if RBA is
not Employee's then current employer, then by his or her then current employer
within the Company Group) (such employer, "Employer"). While an employee,
Employee will not accept any outside employment or assume any other business
affiliations or engage in any business activities except with the prior
written consent of Employer.

 



 

b. Upon execution of this Agreement, Employee's current compensation and
benefits will not be affected, and Employee will continue to be an employee of
Employer on an at-will basis. During such at-will employment, either Employee
or Employer may terminate the employment relationship, for any reason (whether
voluntarily or involuntarily) or for no reason, at any time, with or without
notice.

 



 



 

 



   



 

c. In consideration, and on the terms and conditions, of this Agreement,
including, but not limited to, the restrictive covenants set forth in Section
3, Employee shall receive the following compensation:

 



 

i. $____ within 5 business days of following the Delivery Date;

 



 

ii. $____ within 5 business days of the one year anniversary of the
Closing Date (the "Anniversary Date"), as long as Employee remains
continuously employed by the Company Group from the Delivery Date to
Anniversary Date; and

 



 

iii. As long as Employee remains continuously employed by the Company
Group from the Delivery Date to the Anniversary Date, a grant of BMBC
Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") having a value of $____ as of the Anniversary
Date, which shall be in the standard form for such RSUs then-used by the
Company Group and subject to a three-year cliff vesting provision.

 



     

2.

 |  

 _Clients_ _ and Customers_ 

---|--- 
 



 

Employee agrees that all clients for whom Employee or others perform services
while at the Company Group shall be considered clients of the Company Group,
and shall not be considered clients of Employee. All customers with whom
Employee has had business dealings during his or her employment with the
Company Group shall be considered customers of the Company Group, and shall
not be considered customers of Employee. In the event that Employee's
employment with the Company Group is terminated for any reason (whether
voluntarily or involuntarily), Employee shall have no rights in or to any
clients or customers of the Company Group.

 



     

3.

 |  

 _Restrictive Covenants_ 

---|--- 
 



 

a. Definitions. As used in this Agreement, the term "Restricted Period"
shall mean a period commencing on the Delivery Date and continuing for twelve
(12) months from the termination date of Employee's employment with Company
Group for any reason (whether voluntarily or involuntarily) or for no reason;
the term "Business" shall mean any business in which any member of the Company
Group is engaged at any time during Employee's employment with Company Group
(including prior to the Delivery Date) and also encompasses any field in which
any member of the Company Group is engaged in research and/or development at
any time during Employee's employment with Company Group (including prior to
the Delivery Date); and the term "Company Group" shall mean (i) collectively,
RBPI, RBA, each of their subsidiaries and affiliates, and all of their
successors and assigns (including, for the avoidance of doubt, from and after
the Closing Date, BMBC, The Bryn Mawr Trust Company, each of their
subsidiaries and affiliates, and all of their successors and assigns), and
(ii) where applicable, each such entity individually.

 



 



 

 



   



 

b. Confidentiality

 



 

i. Employee recognizes and acknowledges that the Proprietary Information
is a valuable, special and unique asset of the Company Group. As a result,
Employee shall not, without the prior written consent of Employer, for any
reason, either directly or indirectly, divulge to any third-party or use for
his or her own benefit, or for any purpose other than the exclusive benefit of
the Company Group, any confidential or proprietary business or technical
information of the Company Group or any knowledge, data or information of the
Company Group which is defined as a trade secret under applicable Law
(collectively "Proprietary Information"). Such Proprietary Information shall
include, but shall not be limited to, all knowledge and information concerning
the Company Group including, without limitation, the Company Group's
employees, clients, customers, business referral sources, fee arrangements
(for clients and business/referral sources), client contacts, prospect lists,
client lists, lists of business referral sources, products, services, methods
of operation, investment strategies and programs, terms of contracts with
vendors, sales, pricing, costs, financial condition, non-public personal
information about clients and employees, client financial information
including assets and investments, needs, goals, business systems, software and
marketing techniques and procedures and any other information of a similar
nature. Proprietary Information shall not include information or data that is
readily available to the general public so long as such information did not
become available to the general public as a direct or indirect result of
Employee's breach of his or her obligations under this Agreement. Failure to
mark any of the Proprietary Information as confidential or proprietary shall
not affect its status as Proprietary Information under the terms of this
Agreement.

 



 

ii. Employee shall exercise his or her best efforts to ensure the
continued confidentiality of all Proprietary Information of the Company Group
known by, disclosed to or made available to Employee, whether in connection
with this Agreement or any other past or present relationship with the Company
Group. Employee shall immediately notify Employer of any unauthorized
disclosure or use of any Proprietary Information of which Employee becomes
aware. Employee shall assist the Company Group to the extent necessary, both
during the term of his or her employment with Company Group and thereafter, in
procuring and protecting the Company Group's rights in and to any and all of
the Proprietary Information.

 



 

iii. In the event that Employee receives a request or is required by
applicable Law to disclose all or any part of the Proprietary Information to a
court, arbitral panel, Governmental Entity or other tribunal, Employee will
promptly notify Employer of the request, consult with and assist Employer in
seeking a protective order or request for other appropriate remedy. In the
event that such protective order or remedy is not obtained or that Employer
waives compliance if so requested with the terms hereof, Employee shall
disclose only that portion of the Proprietary Information which, in the
opinion of his or her counsel reasonably acceptable to Employer, is legally
required to be disclosed, and will exercise his or her reasonable best efforts
to assure that confidential treatment will be accorded said Proprietary
Information by the party(ies) receiving the same. Employer shall be provided
an opportunity by Employee to review the Proprietary Information prior to its
disclosure by Employee to the extent permitted by Law.

 



 

iv. Upon the cessation of Employee's employment with the Company Group or
at any other time upon request of the Company Group, Employee shall deliver to
the Company Group any and all Company Group property including documents
(including, but not limited to, the Company Group information and documents
stored on Employee's computer, including any documents, files, reports or
other information received or made by Employer in connection with Employee's
employment with the Company Group, regardless of whether or not such
information is Proprietary Information) and equipment (including, but not
limited to, access cards, company credit cards, cell phones and computer
equipment).

 



 



 

 



   



 

c. Non-Solicitation. Employee shall not, during the Restricted Period,
directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of Employer:

 



 

i. on Employee's own behalf or on behalf of any Person other than the
Company Group, directly or indirectly, solicit, entice, induce, canvas, call
on, provide services to, contract with, or accept Business from, any customer
or client, or prospective customer or prospective client, of the Company Group
or any Person that was a customer or client of the Company Group at any time
within two (2) years prior to the termination of Employee's employment with
the Company Group for the purpose of engaging in any Business;

 



 

ii. influence or attempt to influence any Person engaged in Business with
the Company Group to terminate or modify any written or oral agreement or
course of dealing with the Company Group; or

 



 

iii. influence or attempt to influence any Person who is then employed or
retained by the Company Group as an employee, officer, director, consultant or
agent or has served in any such capacity on behalf of the Company Group within
two (2) years prior to the time of the solicitation to terminate or modify
his, her or its employment, consulting, agency or other arrangement with the
Company Group, or employ or retain, or arrange to have any other Person employ
or retain, any such current or former Company Group employee, officer,
director, consultant or agent.

 



 

d. Non-Disparagement. During Employee's term of employment and thereafter,
Employee agrees to take no action which is intended, or would reasonably be
expected, to harm the Company Group, its employees, directors or officers, or
its or their reputation or which would reasonably be expected to lead to
unwanted or unfavorable publicity about the Company Group or such individuals.

 



 

e. Conflicts; Remedies. Employee acknowledges that the Company Group is
and will be engaged in highly competitive businesses and that the Proprietary
Information, as well as its respective business techniques and programs, are
of great significance in enabling it to compete and participate in the various
markets in which it is active. Employee further acknowledges that the Company
Group does conduct business on a global basis, and that its products and
services are or will be distributed throughout the entire world. Employee
acknowledges and agrees that the restrictions contained in this Agreement are
reasonable and necessary in order to protect the legitimate interests of the
Company Group and that any violation thereof would result in irreparable
injury to the Company Group. Consequently, Employee acknowledges and agrees
that, in the event of any violation thereof, the Company Group shall be
authorized and entitled to obtain from any court of competent jurisdiction
injunctive and equitable relief, including, without limitation, specific
performance, temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent
injunction or other interim or conservative relief, as well as an equitable
accounting of all profits and benefits arising out of such violation, which
rights and remedies shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights or
remedies to which the Company Group may be entitled at law or in equity and,
in the event the Company Group is required to enforce the terms of this
Agreement through court proceedings, the Company Group shall be entitled to
reimbursement of all legal fees, costs and expenses incident to enforcement of
any such term, in whole or in part and/or such term as may be modified by a
court of competent jurisdiction. Employee will not seek, and waives any
requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond or proving actual damages
in connection with the Company Group's or its or their successors or assigns
seeking or obtaining injunctive or equitable relief in connection with
Employee's covenants or other obligations under this Agreement. If, despite
the foregoing waivers, a court would nonetheless require the posting of a
bond, the parties agree that a bond in the amount of $1,000 would be a fair
and reasonable amount, particularly in light of the difficulty in quantifying
what would be the actual loss caused by an injunction.

 



 



 

 



   



 

f. Scope; Tolling. If any court of competent jurisdiction construes any of
the restrictive covenants set forth in this Agreement, or any part thereof, to
be unenforceable because of the duration, scope or geographic area covered
thereby, such court shall have the power to reduce the duration, scope or
geographic area of such provision and, in its reduced form, such provision
shall then be enforceable and shall be enforced. The parties agree to enter
into any and all amendments to this Agreement in order to effectuate the
intent of the immediately preceding sentence. In the event of any breach or
violation of a restriction contained in this Agreement, the period therein
specified shall abate during the time of such violation, and that portion
shall not begin to run until such violation has been fully and finally cured.

 



 

g. Acknowledgement EMPLOYEE REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT THE KNOWLEDGE,
SKILLS AND ABILITIES EMPLOYEE POSSESSES AT THE DELIVERY DATE ARE SUFFICIENT TO
PERMIT EMPLOYEE, IN THE EVENT OF TERMINATION OF HIS OR HER EMPLOYMENT BY
COMPANY Group FOR ANY REASON (whether voluntary or involuntary) or for no
reason, TO EARN, FOR A PERIOD OF TWELVE MONTHS FROM SUCH TERMINATION, A
LIVELIHOOD SATISFACTORY TO EMPLOYEE WITHOUT VIOLATING ANY PROVISION HEREOF,
FOR EXAMPLE, BY USING SUCH KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS AND ABILITIES, OR SOME OF THEM,
IN THE SERVICE OF NON-CUSTOMERS OR NON-CLIENTS OF THE COMPANY GROUP. EMPLOYEE
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT EMPLOYEE'S COVENANTS CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE GIVEN
IN CONSIDERATION OF the willingness of EMPLOYER to make valuable benefits
available to Employee, including, but not limited to, (a) Employee's continued
employment with EMPLOYER, (b) the payment set forth in Section 1(c)(i) of this
Agreement, (c) THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE ADDITIONAL PAYMENT SET FORTH IN SECTION
1(c)(ii) AND THE RSU GRANT SET FORTH IN SECTION 1(c)(iii), (D) valuable
opportunities, compensation and/or benefits, (E) the expense, time and effort
involved in providing Employee with specialized and unique training, (f) the
access employer is providing Employee to certain trade secrets, and
confidential and proprietary information related to the business of the
Company Group, (g) the access employer is providing Employee to its clients,
customers, prospective clients and other business relationships, (h) and other
good and valuable consideration. Employee further acknowledges that HIS OR HER
ability to earn a livelihood without violating this Agreement is a material
condition of THIS AGREEMENT AND HIS OR HER cONTINUED employment with employer.
Employee, RBPI and employer acknowledge that Employee's rights have been
limited by this Agreement only to the extent reasonably necessary to protect
the legitimate interests of THE Company GROUP.

 



 



 

 



   



 

h. Developments, Intellectual Property Disclosure and Cooperation. All
developments, including inventions whether patentable or otherwise, trade
secrets, discoveries, improvements, original works of authorship, ideas,
software, data compilations, processes, forms and trade secrets, which either
directly or indirectly relate to or may be useful in the Business
(collectively, the "Developments") which Employee, either by himself or
herself, or in conjunction with any other Person or Persons, shall conceive,
make, develop or acquire during his or her employment shall become and remain
the sole and exclusive property of the Company Group. Employee will make full
and prompt disclosure to Employer of every Development. Employee will assign
to Employer, or its nominee, every Development and execute all assignments or
other instruments or documents and do all other things necessary and proper to
confirm the Company Group's right and title in and to every Development,
without payment by the Company Group to Employee of any royalty, license fee
or additional compensation.

 



 

i. Prior Inventions. Employee further represents and warrants that he or
she has submitted to Employer a list of all developments, including inventions
whether patentable or otherwise, trade secrets, discoveries, improvements,
original works of authorship, ideas, software, data compilations, processes,
forms and trade secrets which were made by Employee prior to the date hereof
(collectively the "Prior Inventions"), which belong to Employee, which relate
to the Business, products or research and development, and which are not
assigned to Employer hereunder as of the Delivery Date or, if no such list has
been submitted, Employee represents that there are no such Prior Inventions.

 



 

j. Advise Employer of New Affiliation or Employment. In the event of a
cessation of Employee's employment with the Company Group, and during the
Restricted Period, you agree to disclose to Employer the name and address of
any new business affiliation or employer within ten (10) days of your
accepting such position. If you fail to notify Employer of such information,
the Restricted Period shall be extended by a period equal to the period of
nondisclosure of such employment information.

 



 

k. Third-Party Beneficiaries. All Company Group members are express third-
party beneficiaries of this Agreement.

 



 

l. Survival of Covenants It is expressly understood and agreed that the
covenants and undertakings in this Agreement shall survive the termination of
Employee's employment for any reason (voluntarily or involuntarily) or for no
reason. The existence of any claim or cause of action that Employee may have
against the Company Group or any other Person, including but not limited to,
any claim under this Agreement, shall not constitute a defense or bar to the
enforcement of any of the covenants and undertakings contained in this
Agreement.
