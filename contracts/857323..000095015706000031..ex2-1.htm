ARTICLE  II

 

 

_Effect  of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the_

 

_Constituent  Corporations; Exchange of Certificates_

 

 

SECTION  2.01. _Effect  on Capital Stock._   (a)  _Cancellation  and
Conversion of Shares_.  At the  Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part  of  the holder of any shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the  Company (the " _Company  Common
Stock_ " and,  together with the Company Preferred Stock, the " _Company 
Capital Stock_ ")  or any  shares of capital stock of Acquisition Co:

 

 

(i)  _Cancellation  of Treasury Stock and Stock Owned by Guarantor, Parent
or Acquisition  Co._   Each  share of Company Common Stock that is owned by
the Company, Guarantor, Parent  or  Acquisition Co or owned by any direct or
indirect subsidiary of such persons,  in  each case, immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall automatically be  canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall  be  delivered or deliverable in
exchange therefor.

 

 

(ii)  _Conversion  of Company Common Stock._   Each  share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to  the  Effective
Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with  Section 2.01(a)(i)
and the Appraisal Shares), including the shares of  Company Restricted Stock,
shall, subject to Section 2.02(h), be converted  into the right to receive
$35.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger  Consideration_ ").  At 
the Effective Time all such shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall 
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each 
holder  of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented  any  such shares (a " _Certificate_ ")  shall  cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive  the  Merger
Consideration.

 

 

(iii)  _Conversion  of Acquisition Co Common Stock._   Each  share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Acquisition Co  (" _Acquisition 
Co Common Stock_ ")  issued  and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted  into  one share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving  Corporation.

 

 

(b)  _Appraisal  Rights._   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares  (" _Appraisal  Shares_ ")  of  Company Common Stock
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective  Time and that are
held by any person who is entitled to demand and properly  demands appraisal
of such Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies  in all  respects
with, Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_")  shall  not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided  in Section
2.01(a), but rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be  entitled to
payment of

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 


 

the  fair  value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that if  any such holder shall fail to perfect
or otherwise shall waive, withdraw  or lose  the right to appraisal under
Section 262, then the right of such holder to  be paid the fair value of such
holder's Appraisal Shares shall cease and such  Appraisal Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective  Time  into, and to have
become exchangeable solely for, the right to receive the  Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(a). The Company shall  serve prompt
notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for  appraisal of any
shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the  right  to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect  to 
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without 
the  prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or
settle  or  offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the 
foregoing.

 

 

SECTION  2.02. _Exchange  of Certificates._   (a)  _Paying  Agent._  
Prior to  the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company
reasonably  acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying 
Agent_ ")  for  the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of
Certificates. Parent  shall provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide, to the Paying  Agent immediately following the Effective Time all
the cash necessary to  pay for  the shares of Company Common Stock converted
into the right to receive cash  pursuant to Section 2.01(a) (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange  Fund_ ").

 

 

(b)  _Exchange  Procedure._   As soon  as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall  mail  to each holder of record of a
Certificate that immediately prior to the  Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose  shares were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration  pursuant to Section 2.01(a),
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall  specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the  Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying  Agent and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent  may  reasonably specify) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the  surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon  surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together  with  such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may  reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate  shall  be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which  the 
shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate 
shall  have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.01, and  the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the
event  of a  transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the  stock transfer books of the Company, payment may be made
to a person other  than  the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if  such  Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for  transfer and the person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or  other  taxes required by reason of the
payment to a person other than the registered  holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of Parent that  such  tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated  by  this Section 2.02,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the  Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender  the  amount of
cash, without interest, into which the shares of Company Common  Stock 

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4  

 

 

 

 

 


 

theretofore  represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant
to  Section 2.01. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the cash payable
upon  surrender of any Certificate.

 

 

(c)  _No  Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._   The  Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II  upon the
surrender of Certificates representing shares of Company Common  Stock 
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining  to such shares of Company Common Stock, _subject_ ,  _however_
,  to the  Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any dividends or make
any other  distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that
may have  been  declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company
Common Stock in  accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the
date of this  Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. At the
close of  business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock
transfer  books  of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no
further registration  of  transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of shares  of  Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective  Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any certificates formerly representing  shares of Company Common Stock
are presented to the Surviving Corporation  or the  Paying Agent for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided  in  this Article
II.

 

 

(d)  _Termination  of Exchange Fund._   Any  portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of  Company Common Stock for nine
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered  to the Surviving
Corporation, upon demand, and any holder of Company Common  Stock who has not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall  thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim  for  Merger Consideration.

 

 

(e)  _No  Liability._   None of  Guarantor, Parent, Acquisition Co, the
Company, the Paying Agent or any of  their  respective affiliates shall be
liable to any person in respect of any cash  from  the Exchange Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable  abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been 
surrendered prior to three years after the Effective Time (or immediately 
prior  to such earlier date on which Merger Consideration in respect of
such  Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any 
Governmental Entity), any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in 
respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable 
Law,  become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims  or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 

 

(f)  _Investment  of Exchange Fund._   The  Paying Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed  by  Parent on a daily
basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such  investments shall
be paid to Parent. If for any reason (including losses)  the  cash in the
Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the  payment
obligations to be made in cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder (but  subject
to Sections 2.02(d) and 2.02(e)), Parent shall promptly deposit cash  into
the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the 
amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment  obligations.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(g)  _Lost  Certificates._   If any  Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of  an  affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost,  stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting  by such person of a bond
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation  may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with  respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such  lost,  stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration.

 

 

(h)  _Withholding._   Parent,  the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent may withhold from the sum  payable  to any person under this
Agreement, and pay to the appropriate taxing  authorities, any amounts which
any of them may be required to withhold under  the  Internal Revenue Code of
1986 (the " _Code_ "),  or  any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
law. Any sum which is withheld  and  paid to a taxing authority as permitted
by this Section will be deemed for  purposes of this Article II to have been
paid to the person with regard to  whom  it is withheld.

 

 

ARTICLE  III

 

 

_Representations  and Warranties of the Company_

 

 

The  Company represents and warrants to Parent , Acquisition Co and
Guarantor  that,  except as identified in the Company SEC Documents filed by
the Company with  the  SEC and publicly available prior to the date of this
Agreement (the " _Filed  Company SEC Documents_ ")  (other  than
disclosures in "Certain Factors That May Effect Future Performance," "Risk 
Factors" and "Forward Looking Information" sections of the Filed Company SEC 
Documents and any other disclosures included in any such Company SEC
Documents  that are predictive or forward-looking in nature) or in the letter
(it being  understood that each section or schedule of such letter qualifies
the  correspondingly numbered representation, warranty or covenant hereof to
the  extent specified therein and such other representations, warranties or
covenants  to the extent a matter in such section or schedule is disclosed in
such a  way as  to make its relevance to such other representation, warranty
or covenant  readily  apparent), dated as of the date of this Agreement,
from the Company to Parent  and Acquisition Co (the " _Company  Disclosure
Letter_ "):

 

 

SECTION  3.01. _Organization,  Standing and Power._   Each of  the Company
and each of its subsidiaries (the " _Company  Subsidiaries_ ")  is  duly
organized, validly existing and, where such concept is applicable, in  good 
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and 
has  full corporate or similar power and authority and possesses all
governmental  franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals
necessary to  enable  it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and
assets and to conduct  its  businesses as presently conducted, other than
such franchises, licenses,  permits, authorizations and approvals the failure
of which to possess,  individually or in the aggregate, (i) does not and
would not reasonably be  expected to impair in any material respect the
ability of the Company to  perform  its obligations under this Agreement, or
prevent or materially impede the  consummation by the Company of the

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Merger  or  the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)
has not had  and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. The  Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified to do
business in each  jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the
ownership or leasing  of its  properties makes such qualification necessary,
except such jurisdictions  where  the failure to be so qualified, (i) does
not and would not reasonably be  expected to impair in any material respect
the ability of the Company to  perform  its obligations under this
Agreement, or prevent or materially impede the  consummation by the Company
of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated  by this Agreement and
(ii) has not had and would not reasonably be expected  to have a Material
Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent  true, complete and
accurate copies of the Company Certificate and the By-laws  of  the Company,
as amended through the date of this Agreement (as so amended,  the "
_Company  By-laws_ "),  and  the comparable charter and organizational
documents of each material Company  Subsidiary (including each material
Company Subsidiary not wholly owned directly  or indirectly by the Company),
in each case as amended through the date of  this  Agreement. Neither the
Company nor GTECH Corporation is in violation of the  provisions of their
respective governing documents. No material Company  Subsidiary (excluding
GTECH Corporation which is the subject of the preceding  sentence) is in
violation of the provisions of its governing documents in  any  material
respect and no other Company Subsidiary (excluding GTECH Corporation  which
is the subject of the preceding sentence) is in violation of the  provisions
of its governing documents in a manner that is material to the  Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

 

SECTION  3.02. _Company  Subsidiaries; Equity Interests._   (a)  Schedule
3.02(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and  complete list
of each Company Subsidiary and its jurisdiction of organization  and, with
respect to each Company Subsidiary not directly or indirectly  wholly-owned
by the Company, the class and percentage of the outstanding  shares  of
capital stock or other ownership interests of such Company Subsidiary  held
by  the Company, by any other Company Subsidiary and by any other person.
All  the  outstanding shares of capital stock of each Company Subsidiary
have been  duly  authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable, have  not  been issued in violation of any preemptive or
similar rights, purchase option,  call or right of first refusal and, other
than directors' qualifying shares, are  owned by the Company and/or by one or
more Company Subsidiaries, free and  clear  of all pledges, liens, charges,
mortgages, encumbrances and security interests  of any kind or nature
whatsoever (collectively, " _Liens_ ").

 

 

(b)  Except for its interests in the Company Subsidiaries, the Company does
not  own,  directly or indirectly, any capital stock, membership interest,
partnership  interest, joint venture interest or other equity interest in
any  person.

 

 

SECTION  3.03. _Capital  Structure._   (a) The  authorized capital stock
of the Company consists of 200,000,000 shares of  Company Common Stock and
20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value  $0.01 per share, of the
Company (" _Company  Preferred Stock_ ").  At  the close of business on

Company Common Stock were issued 

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7  

 

 

 

 

 


 

and  outstanding (which number includes 960,521 shares of Company Common
Stock,  assuming all unvested shares are vested, subject to transfer
restrictions  or  subject to forfeiture back to the Company or repurchase by
the Company (the  " _Company  Restricted Stock_ ")),  and  0 shares of
Company Common Stock were held by the Company in its treasury,  (ii)

other than the  issuance of Company Common Stock upon conversion of
Convertible Debentures  and  issuances pursuant to the exercise of Company

any purchase option, call option, right of first refusal,  preemptive right,
subscription right or any similar right under any provision  of  the DGCL,

Company is a party or otherwise bound. Other than the Convertible 
Debentures, there are not any bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness 
of  the Company having the right to vote (or convertible into, exchangeable
for  or  exercisable for securities having the right to vote) on any matters
on which  holders of Company Common Stock may vote (" _Voting  Company Debt_
").  As of  the Capitalization Date, there are outstanding Company Stock
Options to acquire  7,719,241 shares of Company Common Stock at a weighted

or rights, (ii) the  Company or a Company Subsidiary is the sole and
exclusive owner of, and the  Company and the Company Subsidiaries have the

Intellectual Property of any other person  for the use of such Intellectual
Property in the conduct of the business  of the  Company and the Company
Subsidiaries that is material to the conduct of the  business of the Company
and the Subsidiaries as presently conducted, except  for  so-called "shrink-
wrap" license agreements relating to computer software  licensed to the
Company or a Company Subsidiary in the ordinary course of  business. The

Co or any of their respective "affiliates" or "associates" is, or has been

Representatives) any  information with respect to any Takeover Proposal;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that at  any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company  Board  may, in response to a written
Takeover Proposal that the Company Board  determines, in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel and financial  advisors, constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior  Proposal, and which
Takeover Proposal did not result from a breach of this  Section 5.02, and
subject to compliance with Section 5.02(b), (c) and  (d), (x) furnish
information with respect to the Company and the Company  Subsidiaries to the
person making such Takeover Proposal (and its  Representatives) pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement not less  restrictive of the other party,
in any material respect, than the Mutual  Confidentiality Agreement, dated
December 9, 2005, between Guarantor and  the Company (the "
_Confidentiality  Agreement_ ")  and  (y) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the person making such  Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal;  _provided  further_ , 
_however_ ,  that, subject  to the right of the Company to withhold such 
portions of documents or information relating to pricing or other matters 
that  are highly sensitive if the exchange of such documents (or portions
thereof)  or  information, as reasonably determined by the Company's counsel
in consultation  with counsel to Parent, would be reasonably likely to result
in antitrust  difficulties for the Company (or any of its affiliates), 
the  Company shall promptly provide to Parent any non-public information
that  is  provided to the person making such Company Takeover Proposal or
its  Representatives which was not previously provided to Parent or
Acquisition  Co.  Without  limiting the foregoing, it is understood that
any violation of the restrictions  set forth in the preceding sentence by any
director, officer or employee  of the  Company or any Company Subsidiary or
any Representative of the Company or  any  Company Subsidiary shall be
deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.02(a)  by the Company. The Company
shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated  any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any persons conducted  heretofore with
respect to any Takeover Proposal. The Company also shall,  if it  has not
already done so, promptly request that each person that has heretofore 
executed a confidentiality agreement within the 12 months prior to the date 
of this Agreement in connection with its consideration of any Takeover
Proposal,  return or destroy all confidential information or data heretofore
furnished  to  any person by or on behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

 

For  purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Takeover  Proposal_ " means 
any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person (other than Parent or its 
affiliates) relating to, or that is reasonably likely to lead to, any direct 
or  indirect acquisition, in one transaction or a series of transactions,
including  by way of any merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer,
stock  acquisition, asset acquisition, binding share exchange, business
combination,  recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture or
similar  transaction, of (A) assets or businesses that constitute or
represent 20%  or more of the total revenue or assets of the Company and the
Company  Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) 20% or more of the
outstanding  shares of Company Common Stock or of any class of capital stock
of, or other  equity or voting interests in, one or more of the Company
Subsidiaries which,  in  the aggregate, directly or indirectly hold the
assets or businesses referred  to  in

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 

 

 

 


 

clause (A)  above, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by
this  Agreement.

 

 

(b)  The  Company Board shall not (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse
to  Parent or Acquisition Co, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify in
a  manner  adverse to Parent or Acquisition Co, the recommendation or
declaration of  advisability by the Company Board of this Agreement or the
Merger or resolve  or  agree to take any such action (any such action or any
such resolution or  agreement to take such action being referred to herein as
an " _Adverse  Recommendation Change_ "),  unless at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the  Company Board determines in
good faith, after receipt of advice from its  outside  legal counsel, that
the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely  to result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law,  (ii) recommend, adopt
or approve any Takeover Proposal or propose publicly  to recommend, adopt or
approve any Takeover Proposal or resolve or agree  to take  any such action
or (iii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any  letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,  acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture  agreement, partnership
agreement or other agreement (each, an " _Acquisition  Agreement_ ") 
constituting or related to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely 
to  lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement)
or  resolve or agree to take any such action. Notwithstanding anything in
this  Section 5.02(b) to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company  Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may, in response to a
Superior Proposal  that did not result from a breach of Section 5.02(a),
cause the Company to  terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f) in
order to  concurrently enter into an Acquisition Agreement; _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that  the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.01(f),  and any purported termination pursuant to Section
8.01(f) shall be void and  of no force or effect, unless the Company shall
have complied with all the  provisions of this Section 5.02, including the
notification provisions in  this Section 5.02, and with all applicable
requirements of  Section 6.07(b) in connection with such Superior Proposal;
and _provided_ _further_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the Company shall not
exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant  to  Section 8.01(f)
until after the fifth business day following Parent's  receipt of written
notice (a " _Notice  of Superior Proposal_ ")  from  the Company advising
Parent that the Company Board has received a Superior  Proposal, specifying
the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal,  identifying the
person making such Superior Proposal and stating that the  Company Board
intends to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant  to
Section 8.01(f) (it being understood and agreed that, prior to any such 
termination taking effect, (i) any amendment to the price or any other
material  term of a Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior
Proposal  and  a new five business day period and (ii) the Company Board
shall discuss with  Parent and take into account any changes to the terms of
this Agreement proposed  by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal or
otherwise).

 

 

(c)  For  purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Superior  Proposal_
" means  any written offer made by a third party that the Company Board
reasonably  determines to be bona fide for a transaction that (a) if
consummated, would  result in such third party (or in the case of a direct
merger between such  third  party and the Company, the

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 

 

 

 


 

stockholders  of such third party) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more
than 50% of  the  voting power of the Company Common Stock or all or
substantially all the  assets  of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, for consideration  consisting of cash and/or securities
payable to holders of shares of Company  Common Stock that the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation  with its financial advisors, to
have a higher value per share of Company  Common  Stock than the
consideration payable in the Merger, taking into account any  changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to  such  Superior
Proposal or otherwise and (b) the Company Board reasonably  believes in good
faith is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into  account all
financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such offer  and 
transaction.

 

 

(d)  In  addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs
(a) and  (b) of this Section 5.02, the Company promptly (but in any event
within  24 hours of the receipt thereof) shall advise Parent orally and in
writing  of any Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry the Company reasonably
believes  is  reasonably likely to lead to a Takeover Proposal, the material
terms and  conditions of such Takeover Proposal or inquiry and the identity
of the person  making any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry. The Company
shall, unless the  Company Board determines, after receipt of advice from its
outside legal  counsel, that such action would be reasonably likely to result
in a breach  of  its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, keep Parent
reasonably informed  on a  current basis of the status and material details
of any such Takeover Proposal  or inquiry.

 

 

(e)  Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall  prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a  position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the  Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the Company's
stockholders  if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after
receipt of advice  from its outside legal counsel, failure so to disclose
would be inconsistent  with applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that
in  no event shall the Company or the Company Board or any committee
thereof  take,  agree or resolve to take any action prohibited by  Section
5.02(b).

_Additional  Agreements_

 

 

SECTION  6.01. _Preparation  of Proxy Statement and Other Filings; Company
Stockholders  Meeting._   (a) As  promptly as practicable following the
date of this Agreement, the Company  shall  prepare and file with the SEC
the Proxy Statement in preliminary form, and  each  of the Company and
Parent shall, and shall cause their respective affiliates  to,  prepare and
file with the SEC, to the extent required under applicable Law,  and  all
other documents required to be filed by them with the SEC in connection 
with  the Merger (the " _Other  Filings_ ").  Parent and the Company will,
and will cause their respective affiliates to,  cooperate with each other in
the preparation of the Proxy Statement and the  Other Filings. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing,

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(i) the  Company and Parent will, and will cause their respective affiliates
to, provide  each other with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on the Proxy  Statement and the Other Filings and (ii) Parent and the Company
will  provide each other the information relating to it and its affiliates
required  by  the Securities Act and the Exchange Act to be set forth in the
Proxy Statement  and Other Filings. The Company and Parent shall cause the
Proxy Statement  and  each Other Filing to be made by it or its affiliates
to comply as to form  and  substance in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of  (i) the Exchange Act and (ii) the rules and
regulations of the  NYSE.

 

 

(b)  The  Company agrees that none of the information supplied or to be
supplied by  the  Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement  and  the Other Filings will, at the date it is first filed
with the SEC, the date  it  is first mailed to the stockholders of the
Company and at the time of the  Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material  fact or  omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary  in  order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under  which they are made, not
misleading. Parent and Acquisition Co agree that  none  of the information
supplied or to be supplied by Parent or Acquisition Co  for  inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement and the Other  Filings
will, at the date it is first filed with the SEC, the date it is  first 
mailed to the stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Company 
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or 
omit to  state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order  to  make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which  they  are made, not misleading. For purposes of the foregoing,
it is understood  and  agreed that information concerning or related to the
Company or any Company  Subsidiary will be deemed to have been supplied by
the Company and information  concerning or related to Parent, Acquisition Co
or their respective affiliates  and the financing for the Merger will be
deemed to have been supplied by  Parent.  If at any time prior to the
Company Stockholders Meeting any event or  circumstances relating to the
Company, any Company Subsidiary, Parent,  Acquisition Co or any affiliate of
Parent or Acquisition Co, or their respective  officers or directors, should
be discovered by any party that should be set  forth in an amendment or a
supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Other  Filings, then the Company or
Parent shall promptly inform the other party  and,  after consultation with
such party, file such amendment or supplement with  the  SEC. The Company
shall not mail any Proxy Statement, or any amendment or  supplement thereto,
to which Parent reasonably objects.

 

 

(c)  Each  of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts,
after  consultation with the other party, to resolve all SEC comments with
respect  to  the Proxy Statement or the Other Filings as promptly as
practicable after  receipt thereof. Each of the Company and Parent shall as
soon as reasonably  practicable notify the other party of the receipt of any
comments from or  other  correspondence with the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Proxy Statement  or  the Other Filings and any request by the
SEC or its staff for amendments  or  supplements to the Proxy Statement or
the Other Filings or for additional  information and shall supply the other
party with copies of all correspondence  between it and any of its
Representatives or affiliates, on the one hand,  and  the SEC or its staff,
on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement  or  Other Filings.
If at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder  Approval there
shall

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 


 

occur  any  event that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy  Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare and mail to its
stockholders  such  an amendment or supplement. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts  to  cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Company's stockholders as promptly  as practicable after filing with the SEC.

 

 

(d)  The  Company shall, as promptly as practicable following the date of
this Agreement,  duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders  (the " _Company  Stockholders Meeting_ ")  for  the purpose
of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company shall,  through the
Company Board, recommend to its stockholders that they give the  Company
Stockholder Approval, except to the extent that the Company Board  shall 
have withdrawn or modified its approval or recommendation of this Agreement 
or  the Merger as permitted by Section 5.02(b). Without limiting the
generality  of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations
pursuant to the  first  sentence of this Section 6.01(d) shall not be
affected by the commencement,  public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company of any  Takeover Proposal.

 

 

SECTION  6.02. _Access  to Information; Confidentiality._   The  Company
shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to, afford to Parent, 
Acquisition Co and its financing sources and to their respective officers, 
employees and Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours 
during the period prior to the Effective Time to all their respective 
properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records, but only 
to  the extent that such access does not unreasonably interfere with the
business  or  operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and,
during such  period,  the Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries to, furnish  promptly to Parent (a) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration  statement and other document filed or furnished by it
during such period  pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state
securities laws and  (b) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel  as Parent may reasonably request (including
unaudited monthly consolidated  balance sheets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries for each month  then  ended and related consolidated statements
of earnings, cash flows and  stockholders' equity (which the Company will use
reasonable best efforts to  furnish within fifteen days after the end of each
month); _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the Company may withhold (i) any
document or information to the extent that  such document or information is
subject to the terms of a confidentiality  agreement with a third party (
_provided_   that the  Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain waivers under such  agreements or implement requisite procedures to
enable reasonable access  without  violating such agreement), (ii) any
document or information to the extent  that the disclosure thereof would
result in the loss of attorney-client  privilege ( _provided_   that the 
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to put in place an arrangement 
to  permit such disclosure without loss of attorney-client privilege), 
(iii) any document or information to the extent required by applicable law  (
_provided_   that the  Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
enable the provision of  reasonable access without violating such law) or
(iv) such portions of  documents or information relating to pricing or other
matters that are highly  sensitive if the exchange of such documents (or
portions thereof) or  information, as reasonably determined by the Company's
counsel in

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 


 

consultation  with counsel to Parent, would be reasonably likely to result in
antitrust  difficulties for the Company (or any of its affiliates). If any
material  is  withheld by the Company or a Company Subsidiary pursuant to
the proviso to  the  preceding sentence, such party shall inform Parent as
to the general nature  of  what is being withheld. All information exchanged
pursuant to this  Section 6.02 shall be subject to the Confidentiality 
Agreement.

 

 

SECTION  6.03. _Reasonable  Best Efforts; Notification._   (a) Upon  the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, unless, 
to  the extent permitted by Section 5.02(b), the Company Board approves or 
recommends a Superior Proposal, each of the parties shall use its reasonable 
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause 
to  be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing,
all  things  necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most  expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the
other transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, including, to the extent
consistent with  its  obligation to use its reasonable best efforts, (i)
obtaining necessary  actions or nonactions, waivers and Consents from
Governmental Entities that  are  required to be obtained to satisfy the
conditions set forth in  Section 7.01(b) and Section 7.02(e)(i) and (e)(ii)
and making all necessary  registrations and filings (including filings with
Governmental Entities,  if any)  and taking all reasonable steps as may be
necessary to obtain a Consent or  waiver from any Governmental Entity that is
required to be obtained to satisfy  the conditions set forth in Section
7.01(b) and Section 7.02(e)(i) and  (e)(ii) and (ii) executing and delivering
of any additional instruments  necessary to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement and to fully carry out
the purposes of this Agreement. In  connection with and without limiting the
foregoing, the Company shall, and  Parent shall cause its affiliates to, duly
file with the U.S. Federal Trade  Commission (the " _FTC_ ")  and  the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust  Division_
")  the  notification and report form (the " _HSR  Filing_ ")  required
under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated  by this 
Agreement and duly make, or cause to be made, the filings and authorizations 
(the " _Other  Antitrust Filings_ ")  required under the Merger Regulation
of the European Community (the " _EC  Merger Regulation_ ")  with  respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The HSR Filing  and  the
Other Antitrust Filings shall be made as promptly as practicable after  the 
date of this Agreement and shall be in compliance with the requirements of 
the  HSR Act or the EC Merger Regulation. Each of Parent and the Company
shall  cooperate with the other, and Parent shall cause its affiliates to
cooperate  with the Company, to the extent necessary to assist the other in
preparation  of  its HSR Filing and the Other Antitrust Filings and to
request early termination  of the waiting period required by the HSR Act and
the EC Merger  Regulation.

 

 

(b)  The  Company shall, and Parent shall cause its affiliates to, (i)
respond as  promptly as practicable under the circumstances to any inquiries
received  from  the FTC or the Antitrust Division for additional information
or documentation  and to all inquiries and requests received from any

waiting period under  the HSR Act or EC Merger Regulation without the prior
written consent of  the  other parties hereto (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed)  and (iii) not enter into any agreement

42  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Governmental  Entity not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement  without  the prior written consent of the other parties hereto.
Parent and the Company  shall, and Parent shall cause its affiliates to, from
the date hereof until  the  Outside Date, use their respective reasonable
best efforts to avoid the entry  of, or to have lifted, vacated or
terminated, any injunction, decree, order  or  judgment that would restrain,
prevent or delay the Closing (a " _Legal  Impediment_ ").

 

 

(c)  For  purposes of this Section 6.03, "reasonable best efforts" shall,
if  requested by Parent in writing, require the Company or any Company
Subsidiary  to, prior to the Outside Date, (i) propose, negotiate, offer to

consent  decree,  hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of  any  shares, assets or businesses of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries,  (ii) otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to
take any action which it  is capable of taking and, if the offer is accepted,

respect to, or ability to retain,  any  of the shares, assets or businesses
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries  and (iii) amend or to agree to
amend any Lottery Contract as a condition to  obtaining any waiver or
Consent, provided, however, that the consummation  of  each such action or
transaction contemplated by clauses (i) - (iii)  shall be expressly
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and the  other  transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

 

(d)  For  purposes of this Section 6.03, "reasonable best efforts" shall not
require  Parent or any of its affiliates to (i) propose, negotiate, offer to
commit  or effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the
sale,  divestiture or disposition of any shares, assets or businesses of
Parent  or any  of its affiliates, (ii) otherwise offer to take or offer to

take such action,  that limits freedom of action with respect to, or ability
to retain, any  shares,  assets or businesses of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, or  (iii) amend or to agree to amend any Lottery Contract or
any other lottery  contract as a condition to obtaining any waiver or
Consent. For purposes  of this  Agreement, "reasonable best efforts" shall
not require Parent or any of its  affiliates to hold the Guarantor
Stockholders Meeting to approve the Rights  Offering before Guarantor's next
ordinary general meeting of stockholders  expected to occur in April 2006.

 

 

(e)  In  addition, each of Parent and the Company shall, subject to

opportunity to attend and  participate thereat and (iii) furnish the other
party with copies of all  correspondence, filings and written communications
(and memoranda setting  forth  the substance thereof) between it and its

respective  Representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or
members or  their  respective staffs on the other hand, in each case with
respect to this Agreement  and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, _provided_   that no  party shall be required hereunder to
furnish to the other party hereto any  proprietary information or personal
information regarding the officers,  directors, employees, partners,
shareholders of it or any of its affiliates  if  such information is
submitted on a confidential basis to any Government Entity  or members of
their respective staffs, whether contained in the applicable  personal
disclosure forms, business entity forms or otherwise. 

 

 

(f)  From  and after the date hereof, the Company and (subject to Section
6.03(d)) Parent  shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take,
or to cause to  be  taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably  necessary (a) to obtain or retain, and to cause the
Company Subsidiaries  to  obtain or retain, all Permits under the Gaming
Laws required in order for  the  Company Subsidiaries involved in the gaming

substantially in the manner in which such  businesses are conducted as of the
date of this Agreement, and (b) in order  for the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to obtain, prior to December  29,  2006 (or such later date to

agreement (as amended)), all Permits the obtaining of which  are closing
conditions under the Kaufvertrag dated December 5, 2004 between  Messrs. Paul
and Michael Gauselmann, on the one hand, and GTECH Corporation  on  the

Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby may 
delay  the obtaining of such Permits beyond the date which they would
otherwise  have  been obtained and may delay the obtaining of such Permits
beyond December  29,  2006 (or such later date to which such deadline shall
be extended pursuant  to  the terms of such agreement (as amended)),
including (i) cooperating with  the  other parties hereto in making all
filings or submissions necessary to obtain  such Permits and in connection
with any investigation or other inquiry,  including any proceeding initiated

informed of any substantive communication  received by it from, or given by
it to, any Governmental Entity, or in  connection with a proceeding by any
private party, in each case in connection  with the obtaining of such
Permits; and (iii) giving the other parties hereto  the opportunity to review
and approve any substantive communication proposed  to  be given by it to,

Benefit Agreements at the benefit levels  in  effect on the date of this
Agreement, other than the Company Stock Plans,  or  (ii) provide or cause to
be provided benefits to each Company Employee  that, taken as a whole, have a
value that is not less favorable in the aggregate  than the benefits provided

benefit accruals and early retirement  subsidies, each Company Employee's
service with the Company or any Company  Subsidiary (as well as service with
any predecessor employer of the Company  or  any Company Subsidiary, to the
extent service with the predecessor employer  is  recognized by the Company

as service with Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries;  _provided_
,  _however_ ,  that  such service need not be recognized to the extent
that such recognition would  result in any duplication of benefits

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46  

 

 

 

 

 


 

or  service credit under a newly established plan for which prior service
is  not  taken into account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Surviving
Company  and its  subsidiaries shall only be required to provide credit for

existing  condition limitations, exclusions and actively-at-work requirements

extent that  such  pre-existing condition limitations would have been
applicable under the  comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to
the commencement of  participation therein. Surviving Corporation shall
recognize, or cause to  be  recognized, the dollar amount of all expenses
incurred by each Company Employee  (and his or her eligible dependents)
during the calendar year in which the  commencement of participation begins
for purposes of satisfying such year's  deductible and co-payment limitations
under the relevant welfare benefit  plans  in which they will be eligible to

SECTION  6.06. _Indemnification._   (a)  Parent and the Company agree that
all rights to indemnification and exculpation  from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective  Time (and rights for
advancement of expenses) now existing in favor of the  current or former
directors or officers of the Company and the Company  Subsidiaries as
provided in their respective certificates of incorporation  or  bylaws (or
comparable organizational documents) and any indemnification or  other 
agreements of the Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries as in effect on 
the  date of this Agreement shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in
the  Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and shall survive
the  Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their  terms. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all
such  obligations in accordance with their terms.

 

 

(b)  In  the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors  or  assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
person and is not  the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or  merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all its properties  and assets to any person (including by dissolution),
then, and in each such  case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made

assume and honor the obligations  set forth in this Section 6.06.

 

 

(c)  For  six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation  to maintain in effect directors' and officers'
liability insurance covering each  person currently covered by the Company's
current directors' and officers' liability insurance policy for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the  Effective Time on terms with respect to
such coverage and amounts no less  favorable than those of such policy in
effect on the date of this Agreement;  _provided_   that the  Surviving
Corporation may substitute therefor policies of a reputable insurance 
company the material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no 
less  favorable to such directors and officers than the

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  

 

 

 

 

 


 

insurance  coverage otherwise required under this Section 6.06(c); _provided_
,  _however_ ,  that  the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to
make annual premium payments  for such insurance to the extent such premiums
exceed 300% of the annual  premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company
for such insurance (such  300%  amount, the " _Maximum  Premium_ ").  If 
such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained 
at an  annual premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, the Surviving
Corporation  shall  maintain the most advantageous policies of directors'
and officers' insurance  obtainable for an annual premium equal to the
Maximum Premium. The Company  represents to Parent that the Maximum Premium
is the amount set forth in  Schedule 6.06(c) of the Company Disclosure
Letter. The Surviving Company  may satisfy in full its obligation under this
Section 6.06(c) by acquiring  a tail directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy (a) that covers  each person currently covered by the
Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance policy for
acts or omissions occurring prior to the  Effective Time on terms with
respect to such coverage and amounts no less  favorable than those of such
policy in effect on the date of this Agreement,  and  (b) in respect of
which the premium for a period until the sixth  anniversary of the Effective
Time is prepaid at the commencement of such  period.  At the request of
Parent, the Company shall cooperate with Parent to obtain  such  a tail
policy effective as of the Effective Time.

fees and expenses incurred in connection with  the  Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be  paid  by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is  consummated.

 

 

(b)  In  the event that

 

 

(i)  (A) a Takeover Proposal has been publicly proposed by any person
(other  than Parent or any of its affiliates) or any such person has publicly
announced  (and has not subsequently publicly withdrawn) an intention
(whether or not  conditional) to make a Takeover Proposal, or any such
Takeover Proposal or  intention otherwise becomes publicly known to the
stockholders of the Company,  (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by
either Parent or the Company  pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii) and (C) within
12 months after  such termination, the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries enters into  a  definitive agreement providing for, or
consummates, any Takeover Proposal  (other  than with Parent or any of its
affiliates) ( _provided_   that  solely for purposes of this Section
6.07(b)(i)(C) and  Section 6.07(b)(ii)(C), the term "Takeover Proposal" shall
have the meaning  set forth in the definition of Takeover Proposal contained
in  Section 5.02(a) except that all references to 20% shall be deemed 
references to 50%),

 

 

(ii)  (A)  a Takeover Proposal has been proposed to the Company or any of
its  Representatives, or publicly proposed, by any person (other than Parent
or  any  of its affiliates) or any such person has indicated to the Company
or any  of its  Representatives, or publicly announced (and has not
subsequently withdrawn)  an  intention (whether or not conditional) to make
a Takeover

Proposal,  (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8.01(b)(i)  (but  only if the Company Stockholders Meeting has not been held
by the date that  is  prior to the date of such termination) or 8.01(d) (but
only as a result of  a  willful and intentional breach by the Company) and
(C) within 9 months  after such termination, the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries enters  into a definitive agreement providing for, or
consummates, any Takeover Proposal  (other than with Parent or any of its
affiliates),

 

 

(iii)  this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(c), 
or

 

 

(iv)  this  Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to  Section
8.01(f),

 

 

then  the  Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee. The "
_Company_ _Termination  Fee_ " shall  be equal to $163,000,000. The Company
Termination Fee shall be paid by wire  transfer of same day funds to an

Section 8.01(f), prior to or  concurrently with such termination and (z) in
the case of a payment as a  result of any event referred to in Section
6.07(b)(i)(C) or Section  6.07(b)(ii)(C), upon the first to occur of such
events. The Company acknowledges  that the agreements contained in this
Section 6.07(b) are an integral part  of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these  agreements, Parent would not enter
into this Agreement.

 

 

(c)  In  the event that

 

 

(i)  (A)  this Agreement is terminated (1) by Parent or the Company pursuant

conditions set forth in Sections 7.01 or 7.02, other than the conditions  set
forth in Section 7.02(c) and Section 7.02(i) and any condition to deliver 
a  certificate pursuant to Section 7.02, would have been satisfied on the
date  of  termination if the Closing had occurred on such date) or  (2)
by  the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(e) as a result of the occurrence
of  any  event which would give rise to the failure of the condition set
forth in  Section 7.02(c), _provided_   the  condition set forth in Section
7.02(c) is not or would not be satisfied solely  due to the  failure of the
condition set forth in Section 7.02(i) to be satisfied and  (B) the 
primary  cause of the failure  of  the  condition set forth in Section
7.02(i) to be satisfied is not  as a  result of any action  or  failure to
act by the Company, which action or failure to act constitutes  a  breach of
this Agreement;

 

 

(ii)  (A)  this Agreement is terminated (1) by Parent or the Company
pursuant to  Section 8.01(b)(i) as a result of the failure of the condition
set 

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 


 

forth  in  Section 7.02(c) to be satisfied (which shall be deemed to occur
if all  conditions set forth in Sections 7.01 or 7.02, other than the
conditions  set forth in Section 7.02(c) and any condition to deliver a
certificate pursuant  to Section 7.02, would have been satisfied on the date
of termination if  the  Closing had occurred on such date) or  (2) by  the
Company pursuant to Section 8.01(e) or by Parent pursuant to Section 
8.01(d), in each case, as a result of the occurrence of any event which
would  give rise to the failure of the condition set forth in Section
7.02(c), (B)  the condition set forth in Section 7.02(c) is not or would not
be satisfied  due  to  the failure of the Rights Offering to be consummated
and  (C) the  primary  cause of the failure  of the Rights Offering to be
consummated  is not  as a  result of any action  or  failure to act by
the Company, which action or failure to act constitutes  a  breach of this
Agreement; or

 

 

(iii)  (A)  this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
8.01(d) as a result  of the occurrence of any event which would give rise to
the failure of the  condition set forth in Section 7.02(i) or as a result of
the occurrence of  any event which would give rise to the failure of the
condition set forth  in  Section 7.02(c), _provided_   the  condition set
forth in Section 7.02(c) is not or would not be satisfied solely  due to
the  failure of the condition set forth in Section 7.02(i) to be satisfied,
and  (B) the  primary  cause of the failure of the condition set forth in
Section 7.02(i) is not  as a  result of any action  or  failure to act by
the Company, which action or failure to act constitutes  a  breach of this
Agreement;

 

 

then,  if,  and only if, the Company makes a demand for the Parent
Termination Fee in  writing (a) within six business days in the case of a
termination by Parent  or  (b) concurrent with such termination in the case
of a termination by the  Company, Parent shall pay to the Company the Parent

conditions of  Section 5.02(b).

ARTICLE  IX

enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and  assets  and to
conduct its businesses as presently conducted, other than such  franchises,
licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals the failure of  which  to
possess, individually or in the aggregate, do not and would not reasonably 
be  expected to (i) impair in any material respect the ability of Guarantor
to  perform its obligations under this Agreement or (ii) prevent or
materially  impede the consummation the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated  by  this Agreement (including the Acquisition Financing).

 

 

(b)  _Authority;  Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_.  Guarantor has
all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and  deliver  this
Agreement, the Pre-Underwriting Agreement and the Capital Securities 
Backstop Letter and to perform its obligations thereunder. The execution 
and  delivery by Guarantor of this Agreement, the Pre-Underwriting Agreement
and  the  Capital Securities Backstop Letter and the performance by it of

than, in connection with  the  Rights Offering, the requisite approval of
the Guarantor board of directors  and  the Guarantor Stockholder Approval).
Guarantor has duly executed and delivered  this Agreement, the Pre-
Underwriting Agreement and the Capital Securities  Backstop Letter, and this
Agreement, the Pre-Underwriting Agreement and the  Capital Securities
Backstop Letter constitute the legal, valid and binding  obligations of
Guarantor, enforceable against Guarantor in accordance with  their 
respective terms.

 

 

(c)  _No  Conflicts_.  The  execution and delivery by Guarantor of this
Agreement, the Pre-Underwriting  Agreement and the Capital Securities
Backstop Letter, do not, and the  consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby  and  thereby and compliance with the terms
hereof and thereof will not (subject  with  respect to clause (i) the
requisite approval of the Guarantor board of directors  in connection with
the Rights Offering and the Guarantor Stockholder Approval),  conflict with,
or result in any violation of or default (with or without  notice  or lapse
of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, 
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a material
benefit  under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or  assets of Guarantor or any of its affiliates under, any
provision of (i)  the  charter or organizational documents of Guarantor or
any of its affiliates,  (ii) any Contract to which Guarantor or any of its
affiliates is a party or  by which any of their respective properties or
assets is bound or (iii) subject  to the filings and other matters

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60  

 

 

 

 

 


 

referred  to in Section 4.04(b), any Judgment or Law applicable to Guarantor
or any  of its  affiliates or their respective properties or assets, other
than, in the case  of  clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any such items that,
individually or in the  aggregate, do not and would not reasonably be
expected to (i) impair in any  material respect the ability of Guarantor to
perform its obligations under  this  Agreement, the Pre-Underwriting
Agreement and the Capital Securities Backstop  Letter or (ii) prevent or
materially impede the consummation of the Merger  or  the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Pre-Underwriting  Agreement and the
Capital Securities Backstop Letter.

 

 

(d)  _No  Consents_.  No  Consent of, or registration, declaration or
filing with, or permit from,  any  Governmental Entity is required to be
obtained or made by or with respect  to  Guarantor or any of its
subsidiaries in connection with the execution, delivery  and performance of
this Agreement, the Pre-Underwriting Agreement and the  Capital Securities
Backstop Letter or the consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby
and thereby, other than the filings and other matters  referred to in Section
4.04(b).

 

 

SECTION  9.02. _Guarantor  Covenants_.  (a)  Guarantor hereby absolutely
and unconditionally guarantees to the Company  and  the express third party
beneficiaries hereof, as a primary obligor and not  merely as a surety, the
payment and performance when due of all of the  covenants, agreements and
obligations of Parent and Acquisition Co, and their  respective successors
and assigns, contained in this Agreement (the " _Guaranteed  Obligations_
",  and  such guarantee, the " _Guarantee_ ").

 

 

(b)  The  Guarantee is an absolute, unconditional and continuing guarantee
of the full  and  punctual payment and performance when due of the
Guaranteed Obligations,  and not  of their collectibility only, and is in no
way conditioned upon any requirement  that the Company or any other person
first attempt to collect such Guaranteed  Obligations from Parent or
Acquisition Co or resort to any security or other  means of collecting
payment or performance. Should Parent or Acquisition  Co  default in the
payment or performance of any Guaranteed Obligation, Guarantor's  obligations
hereunder shall become immediately due and (if applicable) payable.  Claims
under the Guarantee may be made on one or more occasions. All payments  of 
money made by Guarantor in performance and satisfaction of its obligations 
hereunder shall be made in lawful money of the United States, in immediately 
available funds, unless payment by another means is authorized by the 
Agreement.

 

 

(c)  Guarantor hereby waives notice of acceptance of this Guarantee and
notice  of the  Guaranteed Obligations, waives presentment, demand for
payment, protest,  notice  of dishonor or non-payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations, notice of acceleration  or intent to accelerate the Guaranteed
Obligations, and any other notice  to  Guarantor, and waives (subject to the
following sentence) to the fullest  extent  permitted by law, defenses
generally, and neither the Company nor any other  person is obligated to file
any suit or take any action, or provide any notice  to, Parent, Acquisition
Co, Guarantor, or others, except as expressly provided  in this Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Guarantor  agrees that the
obligation of Guarantor hereunder shall not be released or  discharged, in
whole or in part, or otherwise affected by: (i) the failure  of  the Company
or any other person to assert any claim or demand or to enforce  any  right
or

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

61  

 

 

 

 

 


 

remedy  against Parent or Acquisition Co with respect to the Guaranteed
Obligations;  (ii) any extensions or renewals of the Guaranteed Obligations;
(iii) any  rescissions, waivers, amendments or modifications of the
Agreement; (iv)  the  adequacy of any means available to the Company or any
other person to claim  payment or performance of the Guaranteed Obligations;
(v) except as otherwise  provided herein, the addition or release of any
person or entities primarily  or  secondarily liable for the Guaranteed
Obligations (including Guarantor) or  (vi)  any other act or omission that
might in any means or to any extent vary the  risk  of Guarantor or
otherwise operate as a release or exchange of Guarantor,  all of  which may
be done without notice to Guarantor. However, Guarantor reserves  the  right
to assert defenses that Parent or Acquisition Co may have to payment  or 
performance of the Guaranteed Obligations, other than defenses arising from 
the  bankruptcy, insolvency or similar rights of Parent or Acquisition Co,
or  defenses related to Parent's or Acquisition Co's capacity to enter into
this  Agreement.

 

 

(d)  Guarantor agrees that the Guarantee shall continue to be effective, or
be  reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment or performance,
or  any  part thereof, of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or
must  otherwise be restored or returned by the Company or any other person
entitled  thereto upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation
or  reorganization of Parent or Acquisition Co or upon or as a result of
the  appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or
similar  officer for, Parent or Acquisition Co or any substantial part of its
property,  or otherwise, all as though such payments or performance had not
been  made.

 

 

(e)  Guarantor will use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the
Merger,  the  other transactions contemplated hereby and the Acquisition
Financing as soon  as  practicable following the date hereof, including
using its reasonable best  efforts to cause all conditions to the Acquisition
Financing to be satisfied  as  soon as reasonably practicable after the date
of this Agreement. Guarantor  will  use its reasonable best efforts (x) to
perform in all material respects all  of its covenants and obligations under
the Pre-Underwriting Agreement and  the  Capital Securities Backstop Letter
and (y) to cause all of its  representations and warranties under the Pre-
Underwriting Agreement and the  Capital Securities Backstop Letter to be true
and correct in all material  respects. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing and subject to  Section 6.03, (i) the board of directors of
Guarantor will take all  corporate action necessary to consummate the Rights
Offering in accordance  with  the terms of the Pre-Underwriting Agreement,
(ii) Guarantor will prepare,  file and distribute any filings relating to the
Guarantor Stockholder Approval  and the Guarantor Stockholders Meeting, (iii)
Guarantor will use its reasonable  best efforts to obtain the Guarantor
Stockholder Approval and any other Consent  required to consummate the Rights
Offering and (iv) as soon as practicable  after  obtaining the Guarantor
Stockholder Approval, Guarantor will use its reasonable  best efforts to
commence and consummate the Rights Offering in accordance  with  the terms
of the Pre-Underwriting Agreement.

 

 

(f)  Guarantor (a) hereby appoints The Corporation Trust Company,
Corporation  Trust  Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware, as its
authorized agent  (the " _Authorized  Agent_ ")  upon  whom process may
be served in any suit, action or proceeding arising out  of or  based upon
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

62  

 

 

 

 

 


 

hereby  which may be instituted in any Delaware court and  (b)  agrees that
service of process upon such Authorized Agent shall be deemed  in  every
respect effective service of process upon Guarantor in any such suit  or 
proceeding.  Guarantor hereby represents and warrants that the Authorized
Agent has accepted  such appointment and has agreed to act as such agent for
service of process,  and  Guarantor agrees to take any and all action,
including the filing of any  and all  documents that may be necessary to
continue such appointment in full force  and  effect as aforesaid.

court.  Each party further agrees that service of any process, summons,
notice or  document by U.S. registered mail to such party's respective
address set forth  above shall be effective service of process for any
action, suit or proceeding  in Delaware with respect to any matters to which
it has submitted to  jurisdiction in this Section 10.10. Each party
irrevocably and  unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue
of any action,  suit  or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated  hereby in any Delaware State court and hereby
further irrevocably and  unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or
claim in any such court  that  any such action, suit or proceeding brought

SECTION  10.11. _Waiver  of Jury Trial._   Each  party hereto hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable  Law,  any right it
may have to a trial by jury in respect of any suit, action or  other 
proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection 
with  this Agreement. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no
representative,  agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise,  that such party would not, in the event of any
action, suit or proceeding,  seek  to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b)
acknowledges that it and the other  parties hereto have been induced to enter
into this Agreement, by, among  other  things, the mutual waiver and
certifications in this  Section 10.11.

 

 

SECTION  10.12. _Remedies_.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement (including  Section 6.07 and Section 8.02) other than the last
sentence of this  Section 10.12, the parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur,  damages would be difficult to determine and would be an
insufficient remedy  and  no other adequate remedy would exist at law or in
equity, in each case in  the  event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in  accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached (or any party  hereto threatens such a breach). It is
accordingly agreed that in the event  of a  breach or threatened breach of
this Agreement, the other parties hereto shall  be  entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement  and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in  addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.  Each
party hereto irrevocably waives any defenses based on adequacy of any 
other  remedy, whether at law or in equity, that might be asserted as a bar
to the  remedy of specific performance of any of the terms or provisions
hereof or  injunctive relief in any action brought therefor by any other
party hereto.  The  Company acknowledges that if, and only if, Parent pays
to the Company the  Parent  Termination Fee after a demand therefor by the
Company, then such amount  shall  constitute the Company's sole and
exclusive remedy for the termination of this  Agreement regardless of the
circumstances giving rise to such termination,  the  Company shall have no
further rights, directly or indirectly, against any  Parent  or any of its
affiliates, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort  or  otherwise in
respect of this Agreement and the Company shall not be able  to  assert any
claim against Parent or its affiliates in respect of this  Agreement.
