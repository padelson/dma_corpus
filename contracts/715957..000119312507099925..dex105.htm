PURCHASE PRICE

Section 2.1 _Purchase Price_. The purchase price for the Assets (the "
_Purchase Price_ ") shall be Four Billion Seven Hundred Fifty Seven Million
dollars ($4,757,000,000) (the " _Unadjusted Purchase Price_ "), adjusted as
provided in Section 2.3.

 

Section 2.2 _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

(a) At least thirty (30) days prior to the Target Closing Date, Seller shall
prepare and deliver to Purchaser, using and based upon the best information
available to Seller, a schedule setting forth the following items:

(i) the Unadjusted Purchase Price as set forth in Section 2.1;



 

9 (ii) the liabilities associated with the Assets as of the Closing (as required
for the allocations under clause (iii)); and

(iii) an allocation of the sum of the Unadjusted Purchase Price under
clause (i) and the aggregate amount of such liabilities under clause (ii)
that are includable in the Purchasers tax basis in the Assets among the
classes of the Assets as of the Closing, which allocations shall be made in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder and shall be consistent with the Allocated Values established
pursuant to Section 3.4.

Seller shall at Purchasers request make reasonable documentation available to
support the proposed allocation. As soon as reasonably practicable, but not
later than fifteen (15) days following receipt of Sellers
proposed allocation schedule, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a written
report containing any changes that Purchaser proposes to be made in such
schedule (and specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail). The
Parties shall undertake to agree on a final schedule no later than six (6)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date. In the event the Parties cannot reach
agreement by that date, the Sellers allocation shall be used pending
adjustment under the following paragraph.

 

(b) Within thirty (30) days after the determination of the Purchase Price
under Section 8.4(b), the schedule described in Section 2.2(a) shall be
amended by Seller and delivered to Purchaser to reflect the Purchase Price
following final adjustments. Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller in the
preparation of the amended schedule. If the Sellers amendments to the
schedule are not objected to by Purchaser (by written notice to Seller
specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail) within thirty (30) days
after delivery of Sellers adjustments to the schedule, it shall be deemed
agreed upon by the Parties. In the event that the Parties cannot reach an
agreement within twenty (20) days after Seller receives notice of any
objection by Purchaser, then, any Party may refer the matters in dispute to
Ernst and Young LLP or another mutually acceptable independent appraiser (the "
_Independent Appraiser_ ") to assist in determining the fair value of each
separate class of Assets solely for the purposes of the allocation described
in this Section 2.2. The Independent Appraiser shall be instructed to deliver
to Purchaser and Seller a written determination of the valuation and any
revisions to the schedule within thirty (30) days after the date of referral
thereof to the Independent Appraiser. Purchaser and Seller agree to accept
the Independent Appraisers determinations as to the appropriate adjustments
to the schedule. The Independent Appraiser may determine the issues in dispute
following such procedures, consistent with the provisions of this Agreement,
as it reasonably deems appropriate in the circumstances and with reference to
the amounts in issue. The Parties do not intend to impose any particular
procedures upon the Independent Appraiser, it being the desire and direction
of the Parties that any such disagreement shall be resolved as expeditiously
and inexpensively as reasonably practicable. The Independent Appraiser shall
act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed
aspects of the allocation schedule submitted by any Party and may not award
damages, interest, or penalties to any Party with respect to any matter.
Seller and Purchaser each shall bear its own legal fees and costs of
presenting its case. Seller shall bear one-half and Purchaser shall bear one-
half of the costs and expenses of the Independent Appraiser.



 

10 (c) The allocations set forth in the schedule described in this Section 2.2
shall be used by Seller and Purchaser as the basis for reporting asset values
and other items, including preparing Internal Revenue Service Form 8594, Asset
Acquisition Statement (which Form 8594 shall be completed, executed and
delivered by such parties as soon as practicable after the Closing but in no
event later than 15 days prior to the date such form is required to be filed).

to assert, in connection with any audit or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes, any asset values or other items inconsistent with the amounts set forth
in the schedule described in this Section 2.2.

Accounting Principles and shall be consistent with Sellers current
accounting recognition practices.

(b) Should Purchaser or its Affiliates receive after Closing any proceeds or
other income to which Seller is entitled under Section 2.4(a), Purchaser shall
fully disclose, account for and promptly remit the same to Seller.

(c) Should Purchaser pay after Closing any Property Costs for which Seller is
responsible under Section 2.4(a), Seller shall reimburse Purchaser promptly
after receipt of Purchasers invoice, accompanied by copies of the relevant
vendor or other invoice and proof of payment. Within forty-five (45) days
following Closing, Seller shall provide notice to its vendors related to the
EandP Business to promptly send any pre-Effective Date invoices. 

(d) Seller shall have no further entitlement to amounts earned from the sale
of oil, gas and other hydrocarbons produced from or attributable to the
Properties and other income earned with respect to the Assets (except any
applicable Excluded Assets), and no further responsibility for Property Costs
incurred with respect to the Assets, to the extent such amounts have not
been received or paid, respectively, on or before the Cut-Off Date.

Section 2.5 _Procedures_.

(a) For purposes of allocating production (and accounts receivable with
respect thereto), under Section 2.3 and Section 2.4, (i) liquid hydrocarbons
shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the Properties when they pass
through the pipeline flange connecting into the storage facilities on the
platform serving the applicable Lease or Unit or, if there are no
such storage facilities, when they pass through the LACT meters or similar
meters at the point of entry into the pipelines through which they are
transported from that platform, and (ii) gaseous hydrocarbons shall be deemed
to be "from or attributable to" the Properties when they pass through the
delivery point sales meters or similar meters at the point of entry into the
pipelines through which they are transported from the platform serving the
applicable Lease or Unit. Seller shall utilize reasonable interpolative
procedures to arrive at an allocation of production when exact meter readings
are not available.

Surface use fees, insurance premiums and other Property Costs that are paid
periodically shall be prorated based on the number of days in the applicable
period falling on or before, or after, the Effective Date, or the Closing
Date, as applicable. Production Taxes and similar Taxes measured by units of
production, and severance Taxes, shall be prorated based on the amount of
hydrocarbons actually produced, purchased or sold, as applicable, on or
before, and after, the Effective Date, or the Closing Date, as applicable.

(b) After Closing, Purchaser shall handle (and Seller shall cooperate with the
handling of) all joint interest audits and other audits of Property Costs
covering periods for which Seller is in whole or in part responsible under
Section 2.4, provided that Purchaser  



 

15  shall not agree to any adjustments to previously assessed costs for which
Seller is liable, or any compromise of any audit claims to which Seller would
be entitled, without the prior written consent of Seller, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld. Purchaser shall provide Seller with a copy of all
applicable audit reports and written audit agreements received by Purchaser
and relating to periods for which Seller is partially responsible.

ARTICLE 3\.

TITLE MATTERS

Section 3.1 _Company s Title_. Seller represents and warrants to Purchaser
that Sellers title (i) to the Units and Wells shown on Exhibit A-2, Part 1,
(ii) to the ownership interests in the Leases containing proved undeveloped
locations (the " _PUD Leases_ ") shown on Exhibit A-2, Part 2 and (iii) to
the Leases shown on Exhibit A-1 and as calculated in Section 3.2(a), as of the
date hereof is, and as of the Closing Date shall be, Defensible Title as
defined in Section 3.2. This representation and warranty, the provisions of
this Article 3 and the special warranty in the Conveyances provide Purchasers
exclusive remedy with respect to any Title Defects.

Section 3.2 _Definition of Defensible Title_.

(a) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Defensible Title_ " means that
title of Seller which, subject to Permitted Encumbrances:

(i) Entitles the Seller to receive, (A) in the case of any Unit, Well or PUD
Lease, throughout the duration of the productive life of such Unit, Well or
PUD Lease (after satisfaction of all royalties, overriding royalties,
nonparticipating royalties, net profits interests or other similar burdens on
or measured by production of oil and gas), not less than the "net
revenue interest" share shown in Exhibit A-2 of all oil, gas and other
minerals produced, saved and marketed from such Unit or Well or PUD Lease,
and, (B) in the case of any Lease listed on Exhibit A-1 not covered by clause
(A) above, throughout the duration of the productive life of such Lease, not
less than the net revenue interest share of all oil, gas and other minerals
produced, saved and marketed from such Lease calculated by subtracting from
the working interest for such Lease shown on Exhibit A-1 the proportionate
share of any royalty, overriding royalty, nonparticipating royalty, net
profits interest, or other similar burdens measured by production of oil and
gas attributable to such working interest, in any case, except (1) decreases
in connection with those operations in which Seller may elect after the date
hereof to be a nonconsenting co-owner, (2) decreases resulting from reversion
of interest to co-owners with respect to operations in which such co-owners
elect, after the date hereof, not to consent, (3) decreases resulting from the
establishment or amendment, after the date hereof, of pools or units, (4)
decreases required to allow other working interest owners to make up past
underproduction or pipelines to make up past under deliveries and (5) as
otherwise expressly stated in Exhibit A-2;



 

16 (ii) Obligates Seller to bear a percentage of the costs and expenses for the
maintenance and development of, and operations relating to, any Unit, Well,
Lease or PUD Lease not greater than the "working interest" shown in Exhibit
A-1 or Exhibit A-2 without increase throughout the productive life of such
Unit, Well, Lease or PUD Lease, except as stated in Exhibit A-1 or Exhibit
A-2 and except increases resulting from contribution requirements with respect
to defaulting co-owners under applicable operating agreements or applicable
Law and increases that are accompanied by at least a proportionate increase
in Sellers net revenue interest (in the case of each Lease, as calculated in
Section 3.2(a)(i)(B)); and

(iii) Is free and clear of liens, encumbrances, obligations or defects, other
than Permitted Encumbrances.

(b) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Title Defect_ " means any lien,
charge, encumbrance, obligation or defect including without limitation a
discrepancy in net revenue interest or working interest that causes a breach
of Sellers representation and warranty in Section 3.1. As used in this
Agreement, the term " _Title Benefit_ " shall mean any right, circumstance or
condition that operates to increase the net revenue interest of Seller in any
Unit or Well above that shown on Exhibit A-2, without causing a greater than
proportionate increase in Sellers working interest above that shown in
Exhibit A-2.

Section 3.3 _Definition of Permitted Encumbrances_. As used herein, the term "
_Permitted Encumbrances_ " means any or all of the following:

(a) Lessors royalties and any overriding royalties, reversionary
interests and other burdens to the extent that they do not, individually or
in the aggregate, reduce Sellers net revenue interests below that shown in
Exhibit A-2 or increase Sellers working interests above that shown in Exhibit
A-2 without a corresponding increase in the net revenue interest;

(b) All leases, unit agreements, pooling agreements, operating agreements,
production sales contracts, division orders and other contracts, agreements
and instruments applicable to the Assets, including provisions for penalties,
suspensions or forfeitures contained therein, to the extent that they do not,
individually or in the aggregate, reduce Sellers net revenue interests below
that shown in Exhibit A-1 or Exhibit A-2 or increase Sellers working
interests above that shown in Exhibit A-2 without a corresponding increase in
the net revenue interest; 

(c) Rights of first refusal, preferential purchase rights and similar rights
with respect to the Assets;

(d) Third-party consent requirements and similar restrictions which are not
applicable to the sale of the Assets contemplated by this Agreement or
with respect to which waivers or consents are obtained from the appropriate
Persons prior to the Closing Date or the appropriate time period for asserting
the right has expired or which need not be satisfied prior to a transfer;

(e) Liens for Taxes or assessments not yet delinquent or, if delinquent, being
contested in good faith by appropriate actions;



 

17 (f) Materialmans, mechanics, repairmans, employees,
contractors, operators and other similar liens or charges arising in the
ordinary course of business for amounts not yet delinquent (including any
amounts being withheld as provided by Law), or if delinquent, being contested
in good faith by appropriate actions;

(g) All rights to consent, by required notices to, filings with, or other
actions by Governmental Authorities in connection with the sale or conveyance
of oil and gas leases or rights or interests therein if they are customarily
obtained subsequent to the sale or conveyance;

(h) Rights of reassignment arising upon final intention to abandon or release
the Assets, or any of them;

(i) Easements, rights-of-way, covenants, servitudes, permits, surface leases
and other rights in respect of surface operations to the extent they do not,
individually or in the aggregate, reduce Sellers net revenue interest below
that shown on Exhibit A-2 or increase Sellers working interest beyond that
shown on Exhibit A-1 or Exhibit A-2 without a corresponding increase in net
revenue interest;

(j) Calls on production under existing Contracts; provided that the holder of
such right must pay an index-based price for any production purchased by
virtue of such call on production;

(k) Any termination of Sellers title to any mineral servitude or any Property
held by production as a consequence of the failure to conduct operations,
cessation of production or insufficient production over any period except to
the extent Seller has knowledge thereof as of the date hereof;

(l) All rights reserved to or vested in any Governmental Authorities to
control or regulate any of the Assets in any manner or to assess Tax with
respect to the Assets, the ownership, use or operation thereof, or revenue,
income or capital gains with respect thereto, and all obligations and duties
under all applicable Laws of any such Governmental Authority or under any
franchise, grant, license or permit issued by any Governmental Authority;

(m) Any lien, charge or other encumbrance on or affecting the Assets which is
expressly waived, assumed, bonded or paid by Purchaser at or prior to Closing
or which is discharged by Seller at or prior to Closing;

(n) any lien or trust arising in connection with workers compensation,
unemployment insurance, pension or employment laws or regulations;

(o) The matters described in Schedule 4.5; 

(p) Any matters shown on Exhibit A-1 (only relating to working interests) or
Exhibit A-2; and

(q) Any other liens, charges, encumbrances, defects or irregularities which do
not, individually or in the aggregate, materially detract from the value of
or materially interfere with the use or ownership of the Assets subject
thereto or affected thereby (as currently used or owned) and which would be
accepted by a reasonably prudent purchaser engaged in the business of owning
and  



 

18  operating oil and gas properties, including, without limitation, the absence
of any lease amendment or consent by any royalty interest or mineral
interest holder authorizing the pooling of any leasehold interest, royalty
interest or mineral interest and the failure of Exhibits A-1 and A-2 to
reflect any lease or any unleased mineral interest where the owner thereof was
treated as a non-participating co-tenant during the drilling of any well.

Section 3.4 _Allocated Values_. Schedule 3.4 sets forth the agreed allocation
of the Unadjusted Purchase Price among the Assets for purposes of Sellers
title representation in this Article 3\. The " _Allocated Value_ " for any
Unit, Well, Lease or PUD Lease equals the portion of the Unadjusted Purchase
Price that is allocated to such Unit, Well, Lease or PUD Lease on Schedule
3.4, increased or decreased by a share of each adjustment to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price under Section 2.3(c), (d), (e) and (g). The share of each
adjustment allocated to a particular Unit, Well, Lease or PUD Lease shall be
obtained by allocating that adjustment among the various Assets on a pro rata
basis in proportion to the Unadjusted Purchase Price allocated to each such
Asset on Schedule 3.4. Seller has accepted such Allocated Values for purposes
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, but otherwise
makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of such values.

Section 3.5 _Notice of Title Defects; Defect Adjustments_.

(a) To assert a claim arising out of a breach of Section 3.1, Purchaser must
deliver a claim notice or notices to Seller on or before a date which is at
least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the " _Title Claim
Date_ "). Each such notice shall be in writing and shall include:

(i) a description of the alleged Title Defect(s);

(ii) the Units, Wells, Leases or PUD Leases affected;

(iii) the Allocated Values of the Units, Wells, Leases or PUD Leases subject
to the alleged Title Defect(s);

(iv) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as any
title attorney or examiner hired by Seller) to verify the existence of the
alleged Title Defect(s); and

(v) the amount by which Purchaser reasonably believes the Allocated Values
of those Units, Wells, Leases or PUD Leases are reduced by the alleged Title
Defect(s) and the computations and information upon which Purchasers belief
is based.

Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived all breaches of Section 3.1 of which
Seller has not been given notice on or before the Title Claim Date.

(b) Should Purchaser discover any Title Benefit on or before the Title Claim
Date, Purchaser shall as soon as practicable, but in any case by the
Title Claim Date, deliver to Seller a notice including:

(i) a description of the Title Benefit;



 

19 (ii) the Units, Wells, Leases or PUD Leases affected;

(iii) the Allocated Values of the Units, Wells, Leases or PUD Leases subject
to such Title Benefit; and

(iv) the amount by which the Purchaser reasonably believes the Allocated Value
of those Units, Wells, Leases or PUD Leases is increased by the Title
Benefit, and the computations and information upon which Purchasers belief is
based.

Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deliver to Purchaser
a similar notice on or before the Title Claim Date with respect to each Title
Benefit discovered by Seller. Seller shall be deemed to have waived all Title
Benefits of which no Party has given notice on or before the Title Claim
Date, except to the extent Purchaser has failed to give a notice which it was
obligated to give under this Section 3.5(b).

(c) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at
Sellers sole cost, to cure or remove on or before sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date any Title Defects of which Seller has been advised by Purchaser.
No reduction shall be made in the Unadjusted Purchase Price with respect to a
Title Defect for purposes of Closing if Seller has provided notice at least
six (6) Business Days prior to the Closing Date of Sellers intent to attempt
to cure the Title Defect. If the Title Defect is not cured as agreed by Seller
and Purchaser or if Seller and Purchaser cannot agree, and it is determined by
the Title Arbitrator that such Title Defect is not cured at the end of the
sixty (60) day post-Closing period, the adjustment required under this Article
3 shall be made pursuant to Section 8.4(b). Sellers election to attempt to
cure a Title Defect shall not constitute a waiver of Sellers right to
dispute the existence, nature or value of, or cost to cure, the Title Defect.

(d) With respect to each Unit, Well, Leases or PUD Lease affected by Title
Defects reported under Section 3.5(a), the Unit, Well, Leases or PUD Lease
shall be assigned at Closing, subject to all uncured Title Defects, and the
Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount (the " _Title Defect
Amount_ ") equal to the reduction in the Allocated Value for such Unit, Well,
Leases or PUD Lease caused by such Title Defects, as determined pursuant to
Section 3.5(g). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
3.5(d), no reduction shall be made in the Unadjusted Purchase Price with
respect to any Title Defect that is (i) older than ten (10) years and, except
for unreleased production payments or similar interest or other unreleased
encumbrances, a Title Defect Amount of less than Twenty-Five Million Dollars
($25,000,000), (ii) involves a counterparty no longer in existence or in
bankruptcy or receivership or (iii) consists of an alleged defect in
the authorization, execution, delivery, acknowledgement, or approval of any
instrument in Sellers chain of title for which Seller at its election
executes and delivers to Purchaser a separate written indemnity agreement, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, under which Seller
agrees to fully, unconditionally and irrevocably indemnify and hold harmless
Purchaser and its successors and assigns from any and all Damages arising out
of or resulting from such Title Defect.



 

20 (e) With respect to each Unit, Well, Lease or PUD Lease affected by Title
Benefits reported under Section 3.5(b) (or which Purchaser should have
reported under Section 3.5(b)), the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be
increased by an amount (the " _Title Benefit Amount_ ") equal to the increase
in the Allocated Value for such Unit, Well, Lease or PUD Lease caused by such
Title Benefits, as determined pursuant to Section 3.5(h), but in no event will
the aggregate adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price as a result of
Title Benefits exceed the aggregate adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase
Price due to Title Defects.

(f) This Article 3 shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
be the exclusive right and remedy of Purchaser with respect to Sellers breach
of its warranty and representation in Section 3.1. Except as provided in
Article 3 and the Conveyances, Purchaser releases, remises and forever
discharges Seller and its Affiliates and all such parties stockholders,
officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and representatives from any
and all suits, legal or administrative proceedings, claims, demands, damages,
losses, costs, liabilities, interest or causes of action whatsoever, in law
or in equity, known or unknown, which Purchaser might now or subsequently may
have, based on, relating to or arising out of, any Title Defect or other
deficiency in title to any Asset.

(g) The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title Defect shall be determined
as follows:

(i) if Purchaser and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

(ii) if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge which is
undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be
the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from Sellers
interest in the affected Unit, Well or Lease;

(iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the net revenue
interest for any Unit, Well or PUD Lease and (B) the net revenue interest or
percentage stated on Exhibit A-2 or, in the case of a Lease, as calculated
pursuant to Section 3.2(a)(i)(B), then the Title Defect Amount shall be the
product of the Allocated Value of such Unit, Well or PUD Lease multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the net revenue interest or
percentage ownership decrease and the denominator of which is the net revenue
interest or percentage ownership stated on Exhibit A-2 or, in the case of a
Lease, as calculated pursuant to Section 3.2(a)(i)(B), provided that if the
Title Defect does not affect the Unit, Well or PUD Lease throughout its
entire productive life, the Title Defect Amount determined under this Section
3.5(g)(iii) shall be reduced to take into account the applicable time period
only;

(iv) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or
charge upon or other defect in title to the affected Unit, Well or Lease of a
type not described in subsections (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Title Defect
Amount shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the
Unit, Well, Lease or PUD Lease so affected, the portion of Sellers interest
in the Unit, Well or Lease affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of
the Title Defect, the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the
life of the affected Unit, Well, Lease or PUD Lease, the values placed upon
the Title Defect by Purchaser and Seller and such other factors as are
necessary to make a proper evaluation;



 

21 (v) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 3, (A)
an individual claim for a Title Defect for which a claim notice is given
prior to the Title Claim Date shall only generate an adjustment to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price under this Article 3 if the Title Defect Amount with
respect thereto exceeds Five Million dollars ($5,000,000), (B) the aggregate
Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon any
given Unit, Well, Lease or PUD Lease shall not exceed the Allocated Value of
such Unit, Well or Lease and (C) there shall be no adjustment to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price for Title Defects unless and until the aggregate
Title Defect Amounts that are entitled to an adjustment under Section
3.5(g)(v)(A) and for which Claim Notices were timely delivered exceed Fifteen
Million dollars ($15,000,000), and then only to the extent that such aggregate
Title Defect Amounts exceed Fifteen Million dollars ($15,000,000);

(vi) if a Title Defect is reasonably susceptible of being cured, the Title
Defect Amount determined under subsections (iii) or (iv) above shall not be
greater than the amount that can reasonably be shown to be the reasonable cost
and expense of curing such Title Defect; and

(vii) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder, or for which Purchaser otherwise
receives credit in the calculation of the Purchase Price.

(h) The Title Benefit Amount for any Title Benefit shall be the product of the
Allocated Value of the affected Unit or Well multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the net revenue interest increase and the denominator of
which is the net revenue interest stated on Exhibit A-2 or, in the case of a
Lease, as calculated pursuant to Section 3.2(a)(i)(B), provided that if the
Title Benefit does not affect a Unit, Well, Lease or PUD Lease throughout the
entire life of the Unit, Well, Lease or PUD Lease, the Title Benefit Amount
determined under this Section 3.5(h) shall be reduced to take into account
the applicable time period only. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Article 3, an individual claim for a Title Benefit which is reported
under Section 3.5(b) (or which Purchaser should have reported under Section
3.5(b)) prior to the Title Claim Date shall only generate an adjustment to the
Unadjusted Purchase Price under this Article 3 if the Title Benefit Amount
with respect thereto exceeds Five Million dollars ($5,000,000).

(i) Seller and Purchaser shall attempt to agree on all Title Defect Amounts
and Title Benefit Amounts by five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree by that date, then subject
to Section 3.5(c), Sellers good faith estimate shall be used to determine the
Closing Payment pursuant to Section 8.4(a), and the Title Defect Amounts and
Title Benefit Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved by
arbitration pursuant to this Section 3.5(i). During the 10-day period
following the Closing Date, Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts in
dispute shall be submitted to a title attorney  



 

22  with at least 10 years experience in oil and gas titles in the state in
which the Units or Wells (or majority of Units and Wells) in question
are located as selected by mutual agreement of Purchaser and Seller or absent
such agreement during the 10-day period, by the Houston office of the American
Arbitration Association (the " _Title Arbitrator_ "). Likewise, if by the end
of the sixty (60) day post-Closing cure period under Section 3.5(c), Seller
has failed to cure any Title Defects which it provided notice that it would
attempt to cure, and Seller and Purchaser have been unable to agree on the
Title Defect Amounts for such Title Defects, the Title Defect Amounts in
dispute shall be submitted to the Title Arbitrator. The Title Arbitrator shall
not have worked as an employee or outside counsel for either Party or its
Affiliates during the five (5) year period preceding the arbitration or have
any financial interest in the dispute. The arbitration proceeding shall be
held in Houston, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the
extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section. The Title
Arbitrators determination shall be made within 45 days after submission of
the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon the Parties,
without right of appeal. In making his determination, the Title Arbitrator
shall be bound by the rules set forth in Section 3.5(g) and 3.5(h) and may
consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator
are necessary or helpful to make a proper determination. Additionally, the
Title Arbitrator may consult with and engage disinterested third Persons to
advise the arbitrator, including title attorneys from other states and
petroleum engineers. The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the
limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Title Defect Amounts and
Title Benefit Amounts submitted by any Party and may not award damages,
interest or penalties to any Party with respect to any matter. Seller and
Purchaser shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its
case. Purchaser shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title
Arbitrator, and Seller shall be responsible for the remaining one-half of the
costs and expenses.

Section 3.6 _Consents to Assignment and Preferential Purchase Rights_.

(a) Promptly after the date hereof, Seller shall prepare and send (i) notices
to the holders of any required consents to assignment that are set forth on
Schedule 4.12 requesting consents to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) notices to the holders of any applicable preferential
rights to purchase or similar rights that are set forth on Schedule 4.12
in compliance with the terms of such rights and requesting waivers of such
rights. Any preferential purchase right must be exercised subject to all terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including the successful Closing
of this Agreement pursuant to Article 8\. The consideration payable under
this Agreement for any particular Asset for purposes of preferential purchase
right notices shall be the Allocated Value for such Asset. Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such consents to assignment and
waivers of preferential rights to purchase or similar rights (or the exercise
thereof) to be obtained and delivered prior to Closing, provided that Seller
shall not be required to make payments or undertake obligations to or for the
benefit of the holders of such rights in order to obtain the required consents
and waivers. Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller in seeking to obtain such
consents to assignment and waivers of preferential rights. 

(b) In no event shall there be transferred at Closing any Asset for which a
consent requirement has not been satisfied and for which transfer is
prohibited or a fee is payable (unless the same has been paid by Purchaser or
is the responsibility of Seller under Section 6.11) without the consent. In
cases in which the Asset subject to such a requirement is a Contract
and Purchaser is assigned  



 

23  the Lease(s) to which the Contract relates, but the Contract is not
transferred to Purchaser due to the unwaived consent requirement, Purchaser
shall continue after Closing to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the consent so that such Contract can be transferred to Purchaser upon receipt
of the consent, the Contract shall be held by Seller for the benefit of
Purchaser, Purchaser shall pay all amounts due thereunder, and Purchaser
shall be responsible for the performance of any obligations under such
Contract to the extent that Purchaser has been transferred the Assets
necessary to perform under such Contract until such consent is obtained. In
cases in which the Asset subject to such a requirement is a Lease and the
third Person consent to the transfer of the Lease is not obtained by Closing,
Purchaser may elect to treat the unsatisfied consent requirements as a Title
Defect and receive the appropriate adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase
Price under Section 2.3 by giving Seller written notice thereof in accordance
with Section 3.5(a), except that such notice may be given up to six (6)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date. If an unsatisfied consent
requirement with respect to which an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase
Price is made under Section 3.5 is subsequently satisfied prior to the date of
the final adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price under Section 8.4(b),
Seller shall be reimbursed in that final adjustment for the amount of any
previous deduction from the Unadjusted Purchase Price, the Lease, if not
previously transferred to Purchaser under the first sentence of this Section
3.6(b), shall be transferred, and the provisions of this Section 3.6 shall no
longer apply to such consent requirement.

(c) If any preferential right to purchase any Assets is exercised prior to
Closing, the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the Allocated Value for such
Assets, the affected Assets shall not be transferred at Closing, and the
affected Assets shall be deemed to be deleted from Exhibits A-1 through A-6 to
this Agreement, as applicable, for all purposes.

(d) Should a third Person fail to exercise or waive its preferential right to
purchase as to any portion of the Assets prior to Closing and the time for
exercise or waiver has not yet expired, then subject to the remaining
provisions of this Section 3.6, such Assets shall be included in the
transaction at Closing, there shall be no adjustment to the Purchase Price at
Closing with respect to such preferential right to purchase, and Seller shall,
at its sole expense, continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the waiver of the preferential purchase rights and shall continue to be
responsible for the compliance therewith.

(e) Should the holder of the preferential purchase right validly exercise the
same (whether before or after Closing), then:

(i) Seller shall convey the affected Assets to the holder on the terms and
provisions set out in the applicable preferential right provision. If the
affected Assets were previously transferred to Purchaser at
Closing, Purchaser agrees to transfer the affected Assets back to Seller on
the terms and provisions set out herein to permit Seller to comply with this
obligation (or, if Seller so requests, shall transfer the affected Assets
directly to the holder on the terms and provisions set out in the applicable
preferential purchase right provision);

(ii) Pursuant to Section 2.3(b), Seller shall credit Purchaser with the
Allocated Value of any Asset transferred pursuant to Section 3.6(e)(i);



 

24 (iii) Seller shall be entitled to the consideration paid by such holder;

(iv) If the affected Assets were previously transferred to Purchaser at
Closing, Purchase Price adjustments calculated in the same manner as the
adjustments in Section 2.3(g) shall be calculated for the period from the
Closing Date to the date of the reconveyance and the net amount of such
adjustment, if positive, shall be paid by Purchaser to Seller and, if
negative, by Seller to Purchaser;

(v) If the affected Assets were previously transferred to Purchaser at
Closing, Seller shall assume all obligations assumed by Purchaser with
respect to such Assets under Section 12.1, and shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Purchaser from all Damages incurred by Purchaser caused by or
arising out of or resulting from the ownership, use or operation of such
Asset from the Closing Date to the date of the reconveyance, excluding,
however, any such Damages resulting from any violation of any Law caused by
the actions of, or implementation of policies or procedures of, Purchaser,
breach of any contract by Purchaser after Closing, or gross negligence or
willful misconduct of Purchaser after Closing; and

(vi) In the event that the value of any Property operated by Seller is
materially impaired by the exercise of a preferential purchase right with
respect to a Property also operated by Seller on which infrastructure is used
by the first Property without the benefit of an agreement for such use which
would survive the transfer of title to the third party preferential right
holder, Purchaser may claim such material impairment as a Title Defect.

of the EandP Business in a manner consistent with recent practices; (b) since

temporary employees or consultants, there are no employment agreements with
any individuals who are (i) employed by Seller who are rendering services

Services, Inc. but who are rendering services primarily with respect to the
Assets. Seller has no collective bargaining agreements.

(b) _Employee Benefits_.

(i) Schedule 4.4(b)(i) lists all of the Employee Plans.

(ii) All Employee Plans subject to ERISA and the Code comply with ERISA, the
Code and, as applicable, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, the Age

intended to be qualified under Section 401 of the Code have filed for or
received favorable determination letters with respect to such qualified status
from the Internal Revenue Service. The determination letter for each such
Employee Plan remains in effect, and, to Sellers knowledge, any amendment
made, or event relating to such an Employee Plan subsequent to the date of
such determination letter, has not materially and adversely affected the
qualified status of the Employee Plan.

the last day of the current plan year of any Title IV Plan or other Employee
Plan subject to Section 412 of the Code. The PBGC has not instituted

(b) Seller has not received written notice of any pending claim against it
(which remains outstanding) from any applicable taxing authority
for assessment of material Taxes with respect to the Assets; and

(c) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.6, none of the Assets are deemed

Sellers knowledge, Sellers ownership and operation of the Assets is in
compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws, except such failures to

or absence of naturally occurring radioactive material (" _NORM_ "),
asbestos, mercury, drilling fluids and chemicals, and produced waters and

which vehicles, computers and software shall then be included in the Assets at

with Section 2.3(d).

Section 6.11 _Seismic Licenses_. Until the Cut-Off Date, Seller and Purchaser

the name of Purchaser, or approval for transfer of the existing licenses, for

event shall Seller be obligated to (i) make any payment except in accordance
with the Post-Closing Purchase Price adjustment procedures set forth in
Section 8.4, and (ii) pay more than Twenty-five Million dollars ($25,000,000)

following Closing, if so requested by Seller.



 

38 Section 6.12 _Further Assurances_. After Closing, Seller and Purchaser each

any Party with respect to any matter. Seller and Purchaser shall each bear

specified by Purchaser in writing.

ARTICLE 9\.

TAX MATTERS

Section 9.1  _Liability for Taxes_.

(a) _Taxes with Respect to Assets_. Seller shall be responsible for filing any
Tax Return (as defined in Section 4.6(a)) with respect to Taxes attributable
to the Assets for a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date,
and, except with respect to Sellers income Tax Returns, Purchaser shall be
responsible for filing any other Tax Return with respect to the Assets.
Subject to Section 9.1(c) and (d), from and after Closing, Seller shall be
liable for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser from and against,
all Taxes with respect to the Assets attributable to any taxable period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date, including income Taxes arising as a
result of Sellers gain on the sale of the Assets as contemplated by this
Agreement. From and after Closing, Purchaser shall be liable for, and shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and against, all
such Taxes attributable to any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date
and shall reimburse Seller or its Affiliates for any such money paid
by Seller or its Affiliates with respect to such Taxes no later than seven
(7) calendar days after the Purchasers receipt of notice from Seller of
Purchasers liability therefor. If a taxable period includes the Closing Date,
any Taxes with respect to the Assets allocable to any taxable period
beginning on or prior to the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date
which is allocable to the portion of such period occurring on or prior to the
Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Period_ ") and determined as described in
Section 9.1(b) shall be the liability of Seller and any other Taxes with
respect to the Assets shall be the liability of Purchaser.

(b) _Straddle Period Taxes_. Whenever it is necessary for purposes of this
Agreement to determine the portion of any Taxes with respect to any Asset for
a taxable period beginning on or prior to and ending after the Closing Date
which is allocable to the Pre-Closing Period or any taxable period beginning
on or prior to the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date which is
allocable to the portion of such period occurring after the Closing Date (the
" _Post-Closing Period_ "), the determination shall be made as follows: any
Taxes allocable to the Pre-Closing Period that are based on or related to
income, gains or receipts will be computed (by an interim closing of the
books) as if such taxable period ended as of the Closing Date and any other
Pre-Closing Period Taxes (except production Taxes and other Taxes measured by
units of production, and severance Taxes) will be prorated based upon the
number of days in the applicable period falling on or before, or after, the
Closing Date. To the extent necessary, Seller shall estimate Taxes based on
the Sellers liability for Taxes with respect to the same or similar items of
income, gain, loss, deduction and credit or other items (collectively " _Tax
Items_ ") in the immediately preceding year. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, any ad valorem or property Taxes paid or payable with
respect to the Assets shall be allocated to the taxable period applicable to
the ownership of the Assets regardless of when such Taxes are assessed.



 

44 (c) _Period After Effective Date_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, in the event Closing occurs after the Effective Date, from
and after Closing, Purchaser shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and hold
harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and against, any Taxes (including
Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Period, but excluding production Taxes
and other Taxes measured by units of production, and severance Taxes) that are
allocable to the period from but excluding the Effective Date to and including
the Closing Date, and shall reimburse Seller or its Affiliate for any such
amount paid by it no later than 7 calendar days after the Purchasers receipt
of notice from Seller of Purchasers liability therefor; provided, however,
that Purchaser shall not be obligated under this Section 9.1(c) for any Taxes
attributable to Sellers gain on the sale of Assets as contemplated by this
Agreement. The amount of Taxes allocable to the time period described in the
previous sentence will be determined in a manner similar to and consistent
with the determination of Pre-Closing Period Taxes under Section 9.1(b).

(d) _Production Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, production Taxes and other Taxes measured by units of production,
and severance Taxes, shall not be subject to Section 9.1 and responsibility
therefor and payment thereof shall be exclusively addressed by Sections
1.3(xv), 2.3, 2.4 and 8.4.

Section 9.2 _Contest Provisions_.

(a) Each of Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand (the "
_Tax Indemnified Person_ "), shall notify the chief tax officer (or other
appropriate person) of Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be (the " _Tax
Indemnifying Person_ "), in writing within ten (10) days of receipt by the Tax
Indemnified Person of written notice of any pending or threatened audits,
adjustments, claims, examinations, assessments or other proceedings (a " _Tax
Audit_ ") which are likely to affect the liability for Taxes of such other
party. If the Tax Indemnified Person fails to give such timely notice to the
other party, it shall not be entitled to indemnification for any Taxes arising
in connection with such Tax Audit if such failure to give notice materially
adversely affects the other partys right to participate in the Tax Audit. 

(b) If such Tax Audit relates to any taxable period, or portion thereof,
ending on or before the Closing Date or for any Taxes for which only Seller
would be liable to indemnify Purchaser under this Agreement, Seller shall have
the option, at its expense, to control the defense and settlement of such Tax
Audit. If such Tax Audit relates to any taxable period, or portion
thereof, beginning after the Closing Date or for any Taxes for which only
Purchaser would be liable under this Agreement, Purchaser shall, at its
expense, control the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit to the extent
that such Tax Audit relates to Tax Items for which Purchaser is liable to
indemnify Seller under Section 9.1.

(c) If such Tax Audit relates to Taxes for which both Seller and Purchaser
could be liable under this Agreement, to the extent practicable, such Tax
Items will be distinguished and each Party will have the option to control the
defense and settlement of those Taxes for which it is so liable. If such Tax
Audit relates to a taxable period, or portion thereof, beginning on or before
and ending after the Closing Date and any Tax Item cannot be identified as
being a liability of only one party or cannot be separated from a Tax Item for
which the other party is liable, Seller, at its expense, shall have the
option to control the defense and settlement of the  



 

45  Tax Audit, provided that such party defends the items as reported on the
relevant Tax Return and provided further that no such matter shall be
settled without the written consent of both parties, not to be unreasonably
withheld.

(d) Any party whose liability for Taxes may be affected by a Tax Audit shall
be entitled to participate at its expense in such defense and to employ
counsel of its choice at its expense and shall have the right to consent to
any settlement of such Tax Audit (not to be unreasonably withheld) to the

(whether by payment, credit, offset or otherwise, and together with any
interest thereon) after the Closing by Purchaser or its Affiliates in respect
of any Taxes for which Seller is liable or required to indemnify Purchaser
under Section 9.1. Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller and Sellers

ARTICLE 10\.

EMPLOYMENT MATTERS 

Section 10.1 _Employees_. " _Company Offshore Employees_ " shall mean all
those individuals other than Executives or Managing Directors (i) who, as of
the Closing Date are (x) employed by Seller who are rendering services
primarily with respect to the Assets or (y) employed by Dominion Resources
Services, Inc. but who are rendering services primarily with respect to the
Assets or (z) individuals who, as of the Closing Date, are employed pursuant
to the college recruiting program of the Seller or its Affiliates with respect
to the Assets, (ii) who are not U.S. Temporary Employees, and (iii) who
accept an offer of employment or continued employment with Purchaser or its
Affiliates. Seller shall provide Purchaser and its Affiliates not later than
thirty (30) days after the execution of this Agreement a list of Company
Offshore Employees to whom Purchaser and its Affiliates must offer employment
or continued employment in accordance with Section 10.2. In no event shall the
number of employees on the list exceed two hundred eighty-five (285) unless
Purchaser approves a higher number. From the date hereof through a date
eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date, neither Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates will, directly or indirectly, solicit or offer employment to any
other employee of Seller or its Affiliates without the prior written consent
of Seller. Individuals who are otherwise Company Offshore Employees but who on
the Closing Date are not actively at work due to a leave of absence
covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, or due to any other
authorized leave of absence, shall nevertheless be treated as Company Offshore
Employees; _provided, however_ , that an individual shall not be considered a
Company Offshore Employee if such individual as of the Closing Date is
receiving benefits under the Dominion Resources, Inc. Long-Term Disability
Plan.



 

47 Section 10.2 _Continued Employment_.

(a) Purchaser and its Affiliates agree to employ or continue the employment of
Company Offshore Employees. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall cause
the Purchaser or its Affiliate who is the employer of such employees to
employ or continue the employment of such employees for a period of at least
twelve (12) months following the Closing Date (i) at levels of total
compensation (base pay and payroll practices) and benefits, including the
amounts provided under Section 10.11, that are comparable, in the aggregate,
to the compensation (base pay and payroll practices) and benefits (as noted
under the Plans and Programs on Schedule 4.4(b)(i)) in effect as of the
Closing Date and (ii) at a work location no more than 50 miles from the
individuals work location as of the Closing Date. In determining
comparability for the 12 month period following the Closing, in no event will
the base pay and annual incentive bonus opportunity for each such employee be
less than his or her base pay and annual incentive bonus opportunity with
Seller as of the Closing Date. In determining comparability, any long term
incentive opportunity, retention plans or retention programs, Six Sigma and
Spot Cash Programs listed on Part II of Schedule 4.4(b)(i), Equity-Based
Programs listed on Part III of Schedule 4.4(b)(i) and amounts paid or payable
from the Success Pool listed on Part V of Schedule 4.4(b)(i) shall be
excluded.

(b) Purchaser and its Affiliates may offer to employ or continue the
employment of any Executive; _provided_ , _however_ , that any offer to an
Executive must include the terms and conditions specified on Schedule 10.2(d).
Purchaser and its Affiliates may offer to employ or continue the employment of
any Managing Director; provided, however, that any offer to a Managing
Director must include the terms and conditions specified on Schedule
10.2(c)(ii).

(c) If the employment of any Company Offshore Employee is terminated, other
than for cause under the severance plan on Schedule 10.2(c)(i) or resigns by
reason of the relocation, without his or her consent, of his or her work
location more than 50 miles from the individuals work location as of the
Closing Date within twelve (12) months of the Closing Date, Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall provide, or cause to be provided, the terminated Company
Offshore Employee with whichever of the following results in the greater
value to such Company Offshore Employee: (i) salary continuation and health
benefits until the end of the twelve (12) month period following the Closing
Date, or (ii) severance benefits which are comparable, in the aggregate, to
the severance benefits set out on Schedule 10.2(c)(i) and which, with respect
to salary continuation, health benefits, outplacement services and annual
incentive plan payment are no less than the benefits set out on Schedule
10.2(c)(i).

(d) If a Company Offshore Employee receives compensation and benefits under
DEPIs Special Severance Program but is subsequently employed by Purchaser or
its Affiliates within twelve (12) months of the Closing Date, then Purchaser
or its Affiliates shall pay promptly to Seller an amount equal to the
compensation and benefits paid by Seller and its Affiliates to such employee
under DEPIs Special Severance Program in connection with the termination of
such employees employment with Seller and its Affiliates. Purchaser, however,
will have no obligation to repay Seller for any amount of compensation and
benefits paid by Seller and its  



 

48  Affiliates to Company Offshore Employees to whom Purchaser makes a
Qualifying Offer, including employees who retire before the Closing Date. If
an Executive or Managing Director is employed by Purchaser or its Affiliates
within twenty four (24) months of the Closing Date, then Purchaser or its
Affiliates shall pay promptly to Seller an amount equal to the aggregate of
the cash severance and other severance related compensation and benefits
provided to such Executive or Managing Director by Seller and its Affiliates,
if any, in connection with the termination of such Executives or Managing
Directors employment with Seller and its Affiliates.

Section 10.3 _Plan Participation_. Effective as of the day after the Closing
Date, all Company Offshore Employees shall cease to accrue additional
benefits for any periods after the Closing Date, Company Offshore Employees
shall be entitled to such benefits, if any, from Employee Plans sponsored by
Seller or any of their ERISA Affiliates for Company Offshore Employees ("
_Company s U.S. Benefit __Plans_ ") provided to similarly situated employees
employed by an entity ceasing to be an ERISA Affiliate of Seller (including
continued benefits under flexible spending arrangements if applicable
continuation coverage is elected) and Seller shall, if applicable, provide all
Company Offshore Employees with appropriate notice of such cessation of
participation and accruals in accordance with Section 204(h) of ERISA and
Code Section 4980F (and the related regulations), at least forty-five (45)
days in advance of the Closing Date. Except as is set forth in this Section
10.3, Section 10.2(c), Section 10.2(d), Section 10.4, Section 10.6 and
Section 10.9, after the Closing Date, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall have
no liability with respect to any Company U.S. Benefit Plan.

Section 10.4 _Participation in Purchaser Plans_. As of the day after the
Closing Date, all Company Offshore Employees shall, if applicable, be eligible
to participate in and, if elected, shall commence participation in the
employee benefit plans (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA),
programs, policies, contracts, fringe benefits, or arrangements (whether
written or unwritten) of Purchaser or its Affiliates covering
similarly situated employees primarily engaged with respect to operations in
the U.S. (collectively, " _Purchaser U.S. Employee Plans_ "). Purchaser and
its Affiliates shall, to the extent permissible under any Purchaser U.S.
Employee Plan (provided that Purchaser and its Affiliates shall use
reasonable efforts to remove any restrictions including restrictions in any
insurance policy), waive all limitations as to pre-existing condition
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to such Company Offshore
Employees and their spouses and dependents, if applicable, under the Purchaser
U.S. Employee Plans other than, but only to the extent of, limitations or
waiting periods that were in effect with respect to such employees under the
Companys U.S. Benefit Plans that have not been satisfied as of the Closing
Date. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall, to the extent permissible under any
Purchaser U.S. Employee Plan (provided that Purchaser and its Affiliates shall
use reasonable efforts to remove any restrictions under any Purchaser U.S.
Employee Plan or related insurance policy), provide each such Company Offshore
Employee with credit for any year-to-date co-payments and deductibles paid as
of the Closing Date in satisfying any deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under the Purchaser U.S. Employee Plans. Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall accept or cause to be accepted transfers from Sellers health
care spending account plan and dependent care flexible spending account plan
included in the Companys U.S. Benefit Plans of each such Company Offshore
Employees unused account balance as of the day after the Closing Date and
credit such employee with such amounts under the applicable Purchaser U.S.
Employee Plans. In the event the plan years under the Purchaser U.S. Employee
Plans  



 

49  and Companys U.S. Benefit Plans do not end on the same date, such credits
and transfers set forth in the preceding sentence shall be applied under
the Purchaser U.S. Employee Plans for the plan year which includes the
Closing Date; _provided, however_ , that if there are less than six (6) months
remaining in the plan year which includes the Closing Date, such credits and
transfers shall be applied to the plan year which begins next following the
Closing Date.

Section 10.5 _Service Credit_. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall cause to be
provided to each Company Offshore Employee credit for prior service with
Seller or its Affiliates for all purposes (including vesting, eligibility,
benefit accrual and/or level of benefits) in all Purchaser U.S. Employee
Plans, including fringe benefit plans, vacation and sick leave policies,
severance plans or policies, and matching contributions under defined
contribution plans, other than for benefit accrual under defined benefit
pension plans subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code and
retiree medical plans maintained or provided by Purchaser or its wholly-owned
subsidiaries or Affiliates in which such Company Offshore Employees are
eligible to participate after the Closing Date. Under Purchasers vacation
plan, each Company Offshore Employee initially shall be entitled to vacation
which is the greater of (i) the amount of vacation such Company Offshore
Employee was entitled to under Sellers vacation plan or (ii) ten (10) days
of vacation plus one additional day of vacation for each year of industry
experience; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Company Offshore Employee
initially shall be entitled to more than twenty-five (25) days of vacation
per year. As part of the first payment referenced in Section 10.6 below,
Purchaser or its Affiliates shall make a one time cash payment in lieu of
vacation for those days a Company Offshore Employee is entitled to under
Sellers vacation plan in excess of twenty-five (25) days but not more than
thirty (30) days.

Section 10.6  _Vacation and Leave_. Purchaser agrees to pay, or cause its
Affiliates to pay, each Company Offshore Employee for the employees earned
but unused vacation as of the Closing Date, as determined under Sellers time-
off policies. Purchaser will pay each Company Offshore Employee one-half of
this amount on the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing Date, and the
balance will be paid twelve (12) months after the Closing Date. As of the
Closing Date, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall provide each Company Offshore
Employee with ten (10) days of sick leave and fifty (50) days of Wellness Bank
credit. Vacation and leave afforded herein shall be used in accordance with,
and will be subject to, Purchasers personnel policies.

Section 10.7 _Defined Contribution Plan_. To the extent allowable by law,
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall take any and all necessary action to cause
the trustee of a tax qualified defined contribution plan of Purchaser or one
of its Affiliates, if requested to do so by a Company Offshore Employee, to
accept a direct "rollover" of all or a portion of such employees
distribution from Sellers tax qualified defined contribution plan (excluding
securities, but including plan loans).

Section 10.8 _Vesting_. As of the Closing Date, Seller shall take all
necessary action to cause the tax qualified defined contribution and defined
benefit pension plans maintained by the Seller to fully vest the Company
Offshore Employees in their account balances and/or accrued benefits under
such plans.



 

50 Section 10.9 _Welfare Benefit Plans; Workers  Compensation; Other Benefits_.
With respect to each Company Offshore Employee (including any beneficiary or
the dependent thereof), Seller shall retain all liabilities and obligations
arising under any Seller welfare benefit plans and workers compensation
benefits to the extent that such liability or obligation relates to claims
incurred (whether or not reported or paid) on or prior to the Closing Date.
For purposes of this Section 10.9, a claim shall be deemed to be incurred when
(i) with respect to medical, dental, health related benefits, accident and
disability (but not including workers compensation benefits and wage
continuation/replacement type benefits), the medical, dental, health related,
accident or disability services with respect to such claim are performed,
(ii) with respect to life insurance, when the death occurs and (iii) with
respect to workers compensation benefits when the injury or condition giving
rise to the claim occurs on or prior to the Closing Date. Subject to Section
10.1, with respect to each Company Offshore Employee receiving workers
compensation benefits, for purposes of this Section 10.9, Seller or its
Affiliate employing such Company Offshore Employee shall be responsible for
claims incurred on or prior to the Closing Date, including payments made after

wage continuation/replacement benefits for sickness/disability due to such
employees after the Closing Date only to the extent provided for by the
Purchaser U.S. Employee Plans. Effective as of the Closing Date, Seller or
its Affiliate employing such Company Offshore Employee shall be responsible
for providing coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act (" _COBRA_ ") to any Company Offshore Employee, his or her spouse
or dependent person as to whom a "qualifying event" as defined in Section
4890B of the Code has occurred on or prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser and
its Affiliates shall be responsible for providing COBRA coverage to any
Company Offshore Employee, his or her spouse or dependent person as to whom a
"qualifying event" occurs after the Closing Date. Purchaser and its Affiliates
agree to assume responsibility for payments and benefits provided by or
committed to by Seller or its Affiliates to Company Offshore Employees with
respect to (i) relocation costs and reimbursements, (ii) appliance loans,

continue any of these programs.

any time on or after the Closing Date, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be

regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _WARN Act_ ") and for taking all
remedial measures, including, without limitation, the payment of all amounts,
penalties, liabilities, costs and expenses if such notices are not provided.

Section 10.11 _Postretirement Benefits_. Seller shall retain any and all
liabilities, assets and obligations which relate to service of any Company

of Seller and Dominion Resource Services, Inc. as of the Closing Date.
Purchaser and its Affiliates undertake no obligation to provide postretirement
medical or life insurance. All postretirement benefits shall be determined by
the Purchaser U.S. Employee Plans. On the sixth month and twelfth month
anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser will make a cash payment to each
active Company Offshore Employee in an amount equal to the individualized,
incremental value of the benefit the employee would have accrued during the
preceding six (6) month period under the Sellers postretirement benefit plans
for which the employee would have been eligible, less the cash value of the
postretirement benefits provided to the employee under Purchasers U.S.
Benefit Plans during the same period. These cash payments to Company Offshore
Employees shall be determined using methodologies and actuarial assumptions
provided by Purchaser to Seller and in the aggregate shall be not less than

indemnity, Sellers representations and warranties qualified by "Material
Adverse Effect," but not "material" or materiality generally, shall be deemed
to have been made without the "Material Adverse Effect" qualification);

(iii) caused by, arising out of or resulting from the Retained Seller
Obligations;

 



 

55 (iv) caused by, arising out of or resulting from claims for injury or death to
any natural person attributable to or arising out of Sellers ownership or
operation of the Assets or any part thereof prior to the Effective Date;

(v) caused by, arising out of or resulting from claims (whether brought by a
Governmental Authority, an individual pursuant to a qui tam or false claims
act proceeding, or otherwise) that Seller failed to pay, missed a payment of,
or made an error in the payment of, royalties (including minimum royalties,
rentals, shut-in payments and overriding royalties) during Sellers period of
ownership or operation of the Assets or any part thereof prior to
the Effective Date to the extent attributable to Sellers failure to pay,
consistent with then current industry practices prevailing in the Gulf of
Mexico, royalties owing with respect to Sellers share of production from
specific Properties; 

(vi) consisting of Environmental Liabilities for which Seller is required to
indemnify Purchaser pursuant to Section 12.2(g);

(vii) related to off-site disposal of Hazardous Substances from the Assets
prior to the Effective Date; or

(viii) constituting fines, civil, criminal or regulatory penalties that may be
levied by a Governmental Authority for a violation of Environmental Laws with
respect to the Assets which occurred prior to the Effective Date.

even if such Damages are caused in whole or in part by the negligence
(whether sole, joint or concurrent), strict liability or other legal fault of
any Indemnified Person, invitees or third parties, and whether or not caused
by a pre-existing condition or the unseaworthiness of any vessel or
unairworthiness of any aircraft of a Party whether chartered, owned or
provided by Seller Group or Purchaser Group.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
from and after Closing, Sellers and Purchasers exclusive remedy against each
other with respect to breaches of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements of the Parties contained in Articles 4, 5 and 6 (excluding
Section 6.5, which shall be separately enforceable by Seller pursuant to
whatever rights and remedies are available to it outside of this Article 12)
and the affirmations of such representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in the certificates delivered by each Party at Closing
pursuant to Sections 8.2(f) or 8.3(d), as applicable, is set forth in this
Section 12.2. Except for the remedies contained in this Section 12.2, and any
other remedies available to the Parties at law or in equity for breaches of
provisions of this Agreement other than Articles 4, 5 and 6 (excluding Section
6.5), upon Closing, Seller and Purchaser each release, remise and forever
discharge the other and their or its Affiliates and all such Persons
stockholders, officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and
representatives from any and all suits, legal or administrative proceedings,
claims, demands, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, interest, or causes of
action whatsoever, in law or in equity, known or unknown, which such Parties
might now or subsequently may have, based on, relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or Sellers ownership, use or operation of the Assets, or the
condition, quality, status or nature of the Assets, including rights to
contribution under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980, as amended, breaches of statutory and implied
warranties, nuisance or other tort actions, rights to punitive damages, common
law rights of contribution, any rights under insurance



 

56  policies issued or underwritten by the other Party or any of its Affiliates
and any rights under agreements between Seller and any Affiliate of
Seller, even if caused in whole or in part by the negligence (whether sole,
joint, concurrent or otherwise), strict liability or other legal fault of any
released Person, invitees or third parties, and whether or not caused by a
pre-existing condition or the unseaworthiness of any vessel or
unairworthiness of any aircraft of a Party whether chartered owned or provided
by Seller Group or Purchaser Group, but excluding, however, any remaining
balance owed by Seller to any other Affiliate at the end of the Closing Date
for provision of goods or services, or employment-related costs, or other
ordinary course of business expenses, with respect to the ownership or
operation of the Assets. Without limiting the generality of the
preceding sentence, Purchaser agrees that from and after Closing its only
remedy with respect to Sellers breach of its covenants and agreements in
Article 6 shall be the indemnity of Seller in Section 12.2(b), as limited by
the terms of this Article 12\.

(d) " _Damages_ ," for purposes of this Article 12, shall mean the amount of
any actual liability, loss, cost, expense, claim, award or judgment incurred
or suffered by any Indemnified Person arising out of or resulting from the
indemnified matter, whether attributable to personal injury or death, property
damage, contract claims, torts or otherwise, including reasonable fees and
expenses of attorneys, consultants, accountants or other agents and experts
reasonably incident to matters indemnified against, and the costs of
investigation and/or monitoring of such matters, and the costs of enforcement
of the indemnity; _provided_ , _however_ , that "Damages" shall not include
any adjustment for Taxes that may be assessed on payments under this Article
12 or for Tax benefits received by the Indemnified Person as a consequence of
any Damages. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Purchaser nor Seller shall
be entitled to indemnification under this Section 12.2 for, and Damages shall
not include, (i) loss of profits, whether actual or consequential, or other
consequential damages suffered by the Party claiming indemnification, or any
punitive damages (other than loss of profits, consequential damages or
punitive damages suffered by third Persons for which responsibility
is allocated between the Parties), (ii) any increase in liability, loss,
cost, expense, claim, award or judgment to the extent such increase is caused
by the actions or omissions of any Indemnified Person after the Closing Date
or (iii) except with respect to claims for any Retained Seller Obligations or
breach of Sections 6.9, 6.10 or 6.11, any liability, loss, cost, expense,
claim, award or judgment that does not individually exceed Five Million
Dollars ($5,000,000).

(e) Any claim for indemnity under this Section 12.2 by any current or former
Affiliate, director, officer, employee or agent must be brought and
administered by the applicable Party to this Agreement. No Indemnified Person
other than Seller and Purchaser shall have any rights against either Seller or
Purchaser under the terms of this Section 12.2 except as may be exercised on
its behalf by Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, pursuant to this Section
12.2(e). Each of Seller and Purchaser may elect to exercise or not exercise
indemnification rights under this Section on behalf of the other
Indemnified Persons affiliated with it in its sole discretion and shall have
no liability to any such other Indemnified Person for any action or inaction
under this Section.

(f) Without prejudice to those Sections, this Section 12.2 shall not apply in
respect of title matters, which are exclusively covered by Article 3, Tax
matters other than Section 4.6, which are exclusively covered by Article 2
and Article 9, or claims for Property Costs, which are covered exclusively by
Section 2.3, Section 2.4 and Section 8.4.



 

57 (g) (i) Purchaser may at its option notify Seller in writing on or before
ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date of any matter disclosed by a
Phase I Investigation conducted by Purchaser pursuant to Section 6.1 which
Purchaser in good faith believes may constitute an Adverse Environmental
Condition (an " _Environmental Concern_ "). If the existence of such Adverse
Environmental Condition is suspected to exist in connection with the Phase I
Investigation but can only be determined through further investigation or
testing of soil, groundwater, or other materials or information (a "
_Potential Adverse Environmental Condition_ "), Purchaser shall conduct a
Phase II environmental assessment with respect thereto within the timeframe
provided below and notify Seller in writing in accordance with the procedure
described below of any item or information resulting from that Phase II
environmental assessment that the Purchaser believes in good faith constitutes
an Adverse Environmental Condition. Purchaser agrees that it is not permitted
to conduct a Phase II environmental assessment prior to Closing.

(ii) If Purchaser delivers timely notice of an Environmental Concern as
described above or of an alleged Adverse Environmental Condition confirmed
through a Phase II environmental assessment as described below and Seller
confirms to its reasonable satisfaction that such Environmental Concern or
alleged Adverse Environmental Condition may constitute an Adverse
Environmental Condition or it is determined by the Environmental Arbitrator
(defined below) that such Environmental Concern or alleged Adverse
Environmental Condition may constitute an Adverse Environmental Condition (an
" _Agreed Environmental Concern_ "), Seller shall provide indemnification
pursuant to, and subject to the limitations applicable to, Section 12.2(b)(vi)
to the extent, and only to the extent, of the Environmental Liabilities that
arise from or relate thereto.

(iii) Except for such disclosure to Seller, Purchaser and Seller shall
maintain the results of any environmental assessment and all findings in
connection therewith strictly confidential, subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. Such notice shall include a reasonably detailed
description of the Environmental Concern, including the relevant excerpt from
the Phase I Investigation or Phase II environmental assessment, as
appropriate.

(iv) With respect to any Potential Adverse Environmental Condition, Purchaser,
within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date may conduct a Phase II
environmental assessment with respect thereto. Purchaser must notify Seller on
or before one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date of the
existence of any alleged Adverse Environmental Conditions, including a
copy of the relevant Phase II environmental assessment reports.

(v) If Purchaser and Seller do not agree on the existence of an Environmental
Concern or an Adverse Environmental Condition, the matter shall be submitted
to a nationally recognized independent environmental consulting firm mutually
acceptable to both the Purchaser and Seller (the " _Environmental Arbitrator_
") for review and final determination. The  



 

58  Environmental Arbitrator shall conduct the arbitration proceedings in
Houston, Texas in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict
with the terms of this Section. The Environmental Arbitrators determination
shall be made within thirty (30) days after submission of the matters in
dispute and shall be final and binding on all Parties, without right of
appeal. In determining whether an Environmental Concern or Adverse
Environmental Condition exists, the Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by
the terms of Section 12.2(g) and the defined terms contained in this
Agreement. The Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited
purpose of determining whether an Environmental Concern or Adverse
Environmental Condition exists. Seller and Purchaser shall each bear its
own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Seller shall bear one-
half and Purchaser shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the
Environmental Arbitrator.

(vi) Purchaser shall not conduct (or have conducted on its behalf) any
material remediation operations with respect to any claimed Damages relating
to a breach of Sellers representation or warranty pursuant to Section 4.7,
any claim relating to the subject matter of such representations or warranty
or under any Claim related to this Section 12.2(g), without first
giving Seller notice of the remediation with reasonable detail at least
thirty (30) days prior thereto (or such shorter period of time as shall be
required by any Governmental Authority or required to respond to an emergency
situation). Seller shall have the option (in its sole discretion) to conduct
(or have conducted on its behalf) such remediation operations. If Seller shall
not have notified Purchaser of its agreement to conduct such remediation
operations within such specified period, then Purchaser may conduct (or have
conducted on its behalf) such operations. Purchaser and Seller agree that any
remediation activities undertaken with respect to the Assets, whether
conducted by Purchaser or Seller, for which Seller may have responsibility
shall be reasonable in extent and cost effective and shall be designed or
implemented in such a manner as to achieve the least stringent risk-based
closure or remediation standard applicable to the property in question
under Environmental Laws, subject to the approval of any Governmental
Authority with jurisdiction over such remediation activities, and as necessary
to permit the continued use of the property in the same manner and for the
same purposes for which it was being used at the Closing Date. All
remediation activities conducted by Seller under this Agreement shall be
conducted to the extent reasonably possible so as not to substantially
interfere with Purchasers operation of the Assets.

 

(h) The Parties shall treat, for Tax purposes, any amounts paid under this
Article 12 as an adjustment to the applicable Purchase Price. 

Section 12.3 _Indemnification Actions_. All claims for indemnification under
Section 12.2 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) For purposes of this Article 12, the term " _Indemnifying Person_ " when
used in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person having an
obligation to indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such Damages
pursuant to this Article 12, and the term " _Indemnified Person_ " when used
in connection with particular Damages shall mean a Person having the right to
be indemnified with respect to such Damages pursuant to this Article 12
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, those Persons identified in Section
12.2(e)).



 

59 (b) To make claim for indemnification under Section 12.2, an Indemnified
Person shall notify the Indemnifying Person of its claim, including the
specific details of and specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the
" _Claim Notice_ "). In the event that the claim for indemnification is based
upon a claim by a third Person against the Indemnified Person (a " _Claim_
"), the Indemnified Person shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the
Indemnified Person has actual knowledge of the Claim and shall enclose a copy
of all papers (if any) served with respect to the Claim; provided that the
failure of any Indemnified Person to give notice of a Claim as provided in
this Section 12.3 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations
under Section 12.2 except to the extent such failure results in insufficient
time being available to permit the Indemnifying Person to effectively defend
against the Claim or otherwise prejudices the Indemnifying Persons ability to
defend against the Claim. In the event that the claim for indemnification is
based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement that was inaccurate or breached.

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the
Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Person whether it admits or denies its
obligation to defend the Indemnified Person against such Claim under this
Article 12\. If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the Indemnified Person
within such thirty (30) day period regarding whether the Indemnifying Person
admits or denies its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person, it shall be
conclusively deemed obligated to provide such indemnification hereunder. The
Indemnified Person is authorized, prior to and during such thirty (30) day
period, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem
necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying
Person and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Person.

(d) If the Indemnifying Person admits its obligation, it shall have the right
and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Claim.
The Indemnifying Person shall have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. If requested by
the Indemnifying Person, the Indemnified Person agrees to cooperate in
contesting any Claim which the Indemnifying Person elects to contest
(provided, however, that the Indemnified Person shall not be required to bring
any counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person). The Indemnified
Person may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any
Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Person pursuant to this Section 12.3(d)
provided that the Indemnified Person may file initial pleadings as described
in the last sentence of paragraph (c) above if required by court or
procedural rules to do so within the thirty (30) day period in paragraph (c)
above. An Indemnifying Person shall not, without the written consent of the
Indemnified Person, settle any Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment
with respect thereto that (i) does not result in a final resolution of the
Indemnified Persons liability with respect to the Claim (including, in the
case of a settlement, an unconditional written release of the Indemnified
Person from all further liability in respect of such Claim) or (ii) may
materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Person (other than as a result
of money damages covered by the indemnity).



 

60 (e) If the Indemnifying Person does not admit its obligation or admits its
obligation but fails to diligently defend or settle the Claim, then the
Indemnified Person shall have the right to defend against the Claim (at the
sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person, if the Indemnified Person is
entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of the Indemnified
Persons choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Person to admit
its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Person and assume the defense of
the Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If
the Indemnifying Person has not yet admitted its obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Person, the Indemnified Person shall send written notice to the
Indemnifying Person of any proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Person
shall have the option for ten (10) days following receipt of such notice to
(i) admit in writing its obligation for indemnification with respect to such
Claim and (ii) if its obligation is so admitted, assume the defense of the
Claim, including the power to reject the proposed settlement. If the
Indemnified Person settles any Claim over the objection of the Indemnifying
Person after the Indemnifying Person has timely admitted its obligation for
indemnification in writing and assumed the defense of the Claim, the
Indemnified Person shall be deemed to have waived any right to indemnity with
respect to the Claim.

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice to (i) cure the Damages complained of, (ii) admit its obligation to
provide indemnification with respect to such Damages or (iii) dispute the
claim for such Damages. If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the
Indemnified Person within such thirty (30) day period that it has cured the
Damages or that it disputes the claim for such Damages, the Indemnifying
Person shall be conclusively deemed obligated to provide indemnification
hereunder.

Section 12.4 _Casualty and Condemnation_. If, after the date of this Agreement
but prior to Closing Date, any portion of the Assets is destroyed by fire or
other casualty or is expropriated or taken in condemnation or under right of
eminent domain, Purchaser shall nevertheless be required to close. In the
event that the amount of the costs and expenses associated with repairing or
restoring the Assets affected by such casualty, and the Allocated Value
determined in the same manner as a Title Defect in accordance with Section
3.5(g) for any Unit(s), Well(s), Lease(s) or PUD Lease(s) taken exceeds
Fifteen Million dollars ($15,000,000), Seller must elect by written notice to
Purchaser prior to Closing either (i) to cause the Assets affected by any
casualty to be repaired or restored, at Sellers sole cost, as promptly as
reasonably practicable (which work may extend after the Closing Date), (ii) to
indemnify Purchaser through a document to be delivered at Closing reasonably
acceptable to Seller and Purchaser, against any costs or expenses that
Purchaser reasonably incurs to repair or restore the Assets subject to any
casualty or (iii) to treat the costs and expenses associated with repairing
or restoring the Assets affected by such casualty or the Allocated Value for
any Unit(s), Well(s), Lease(s) or PUD Lease(s) taken as a breach of Sellers
representation under Section 3.1 but without regard to the limitations in
Section 3.5(g). In each case, Seller shall retain all rights to insurance and
other claims against third Persons with respect to the casualty or taking
except to the extent the Parties otherwise agree in writing.



 

61 Section 12.5 _Limitation on Actions_.

(a) The representations and warranties of the Seller and Purchaser in Articles
4 (excluding Section 4.19 and the last sentence of Section 4.16) and 5 and
the covenants and agreements of the Parties in Article 6, (excluding Section
6.5) and the corresponding representations and warranties given in the
certificates delivered at Closing pursuant to Sections 8.2(f) and 8.3(d), as
applicable, shall survive the Closing for a period of six (6) months. The
representations and warranties of Seller in Section 4.19 and the last sentence
of Section 4.16 shall terminate at Closing. 

The remainder of this Agreement shall survive the Closing without time limit
except as may otherwise be expressly provided herein.
Representations, warranties, covenants and agreements shall be of no further
force and effect after the date of their expiration, provided that there shall
be no termination of any bona fide claim asserted pursuant to this Agreement
with respect to such a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement prior
to its expiration date.

(b) The indemnities in Section 12.2(a)(iii), Section 12.2(a)(iv), Section
12.2(b)(i) and Section 12.2(b)(ii) shall terminate as of the termination date
of each respective representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is
subject to indemnification, except in each case as to matters for which a
specific written claim for indemnity has been delivered to the Indemnifying
Person on or before such termination date. The indemnities in Section
12.2(a)(i), Section 12.2(a)(ii), Section 12.2(a)(v), Section 12.2(b)(iii) (to
the extent related to Section 12.1(a), Section 12.1(b) and Section 12.1(d))
and Section 12.4 shall continue without time limit. The indemnities in Section
12.2(b)(iii) (to the extent related to Section 12.1(c), Section 12.1(e),
Section 12.1(f), Section 12.1(g), Section 12.1(h) and Section 12.1(i)),
Section 12.2(b)(iv), Section 12.2(b)(v), Section 12.2(b)(vi), Section
12.2(b)(vii) and Section 12.2(b)(viii) shall terminate one (1) year after the
Closing, except in each case as to matters which a specific written claim for
indemnity has been delivered to the Indemnifying Person on or before such
termination date. 

(c) Seller shall not have any liability for any indemnification under Section
12.2 until and unless the aggregate amount of the liability for all Damages
for which Claim Notices are delivered by Purchaser exceeds Fifty Million
dollars ($50,000,000), and then only to the extent such Damages exceed Fifty
Million dollars ($50,000,000). This Section shall not limit indemnification
for the Retained Seller Obligations or for a breach of those covenants
contained in Sections 6.9, 6.10 and 6.11, nor shall Damages for those matters
count toward the Fifty Million dollars ($50,000,000) deductible
described above.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this
Agreement, Seller shall not be required to indemnify Purchaser under this
Article 12 for aggregate Damages in excess of Five Hundred Million dollars
($500,000,000); provided, however, that this Section 12.5(d) shall not limit
Sellers liability (i) with respect to the Retained Seller Obligations, (ii)
for a breach of those covenants contained in Sections 6.9, 6.10 and 6.11 or
(iii) with respect to Section 12.4.

(e) The amount of any Damages for which an Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnity under this Article 12 shall be reduced by the amount of insurance
proceeds realized by the Indemnified Person or its Affiliates with respect to
such Damages (net of any collection costs, and excluding the proceeds of any
insurance policy issued or underwritten by the Indemnified Person or its
Affiliates).

Either Party may change its address for notice by notice to the other in the
manner set forth above. All notices shall be deemed to have been duly given
at the time of receipt by the Party to which such notice is addressed.

Section 13.3  _Sales or Use Tax, Recording Fees and Similar Taxes and Fees_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article 9, Purchaser shall bear
any sales, use, excise, real property transfer or gain, gross receipts, goods
and services, registration, capital, documentary, stamp or transfer Taxes,
recording fees and similar Taxes and fees incurred and imposed upon, or with
respect to, the property transfers or other transactions contemplated hereby.
Should Seller or any Affiliate of Seller pay prior to Closing, or should
Seller or any continuing Affiliate of Seller pay after Closing, any amount for
which Purchaser is liable under this Section 13.3, Purchaser shall, promptly
following receipt of Sellers invoice, reimburse the amount paid. If such
transfers or transactions are exempt from any such taxes or fees upon the
filing of an appropriate certificate or other evidence of exemption, Purchaser
shall timely furnish to Seller such certificate or evidence. 

Section 13.4 _Expenses_. Except as provided in Section 6.6 and in Section
13.3, all expenses incurred by Seller in connection with or related to the
authorization, preparation or execution of this Agreement, and the Exhibits
and Schedules hereto and thereto, and all other matters related to the
Closing, including without limitation, all fees and expenses of counsel,
accountants and financial advisers employed by Seller, shall be borne solely
and entirely by Seller, and all such expenses incurred by Purchaser shall be
borne solely and entirely by Purchaser.

Section 13.5 _Replacement of Bonds, Letters of Credit and Guarantees_. The
Parties understand that none of the bonds, letters of credit and guarantees,
if any, posted by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller with any Governmental
Authority or third Person and relating to the Assets are to be transferred to
Purchaser. On or before Closing, Purchaser shall obtain, or cause to be
obtained in the name of Purchaser, replacements for such bonds, letters of
credit and guarantees, and shall cause, effective as of the Closing, the
cancellation or return to Seller of the bonds, letters of credit and
guarantees posted by Seller and such Affiliates. Purchaser may also provide
evidence that such replacements are not necessary as a result of existing
bonds, letters of credit or guarantees that Purchaser has previously posted as
long as such existing bonds, letters of credit or guarantees are adequate to
secure the release of those posted by Seller.



 

64 Section 13.6 _Records_.

(a) Within ten (10) days after the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver or cause
to be delivered to Purchaser any Records that are in the possession of Seller
or its Affiliates, subject to Section 13.6(b).

(b) Seller may retain the originals of those Records relating to Tax
and accounting matters and provide Purchaser, at its request, (i) with copies
of such Records that pertain to non-income Tax matters solely related to the
Assets or (ii) if such Records are necessary for Purchaser to adequately
prepare Tax Returns or to contest a Tax Audit pursuant to Article 9 with
respect to any taxable period falling partly in the Pre-Closing Period and
partly in the Post-Closing Period, with copies of such Records that are
required by Purchaser for such Tax Records or Tax Audit. Seller may retain
copies of any other Records.

(c) Purchaser, for a period of seven (7) years following the Closing, shall:

(i) retain the Records,

(ii) provide Seller, its Affiliates, and their respective officers, employees
and representatives with access to the Records during normal business hours
for review and copying at Sellers expense and

(iii) provide Seller, its Affiliates, and their respective officers,
employees and representatives with access, during normal business hours, to
materials received or produced after Closing relating to

(A) Sellers obligations under Article 9 (including to prepare Tax Returns and
to conduct negotiations with Tax Authorities), or

(B) any claim for indemnification made under Section 12.2 of this Agreement
(excluding, however, attorney work product and attorney-client communications
with respect to any such claim being brought by Purchaser under this
Agreement)

for review and copying at Sellers expense and to the Purchasers personnel
for the purpose of discussing any such matter or claim.
