Time").   SECTION 1.3. CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS. At
the Effective Time and without any further action on the part of the Company

notwithstanding the foregoing, the Closing may occur on any other date agreed
upon by the parties. The date on which the Closing occurs pursuant to the

immediately  prior to, and contingent upon, the consummation of the Merger.
Immediately  following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
pay to the  holders thereof all accrued or declared but unpaid dividends
thereon (the  "Preferred Dividends") in full, in cash and in accordance with
Article  IV.B.6(a) of the Certificate of Incorporation and Section 2.5 of
this  Agreement.   ARTICLE II - EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK 
OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS   SECTION 2.1. EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. As

"Stockholders") of the shares of the Common Stock, Class A Common Stock,
Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Redeemable Preferred
Stock (collectively, the "Company Stock") or any shares of the capital stock
of MergerCo:   (a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of  MergerCo issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time 
shall by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the 
holder thereof, be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share  of
common stock, par value $0.01   3    per share, of the Surviving
Corporation following the Merger, and such  shares shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of  the Surviving Corporation.   (b)
Each share of Company Stock that is owned by the Company,  by any wholly
owned Subsidiary (as defined in Section 11.7) of the  Company, by Parent, by
MergerCo, or by any other wholly owned subsidiary  of Parent shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to  exist, and no cash
or other consideration shall be delivered or  deliverable in exchange
therefor.   (c) Each share of Redeemable Preferred Stock issued and 
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted  into
the right to receive that portion of the Merger Consideration (as  defined in
Section 2.1(e)) equal to the Redeemable Liquidation Preference  Amount (as
defined in the Certificate of Incorporation), calculated as of  the Effective
Time net to the holder thereof in cash, payable to the  holder thereof,
without any interest thereon, upon surrender and exchange  of the Certificate
(as defined in Section 2.1(f)) representing such share  of Redeemable
Preferred Stock or the delivery of an affidavit as described  in Section
3.1(h).   (d) Each share of Common Stock and Class A Common Stock (as 
defined in Section 11.7), whether restricted or unrestricted, issued and

doubt, taking into account the conversion of all shares of Series A 
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 1.6),  other
than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and the 
Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 3.2(a)), shall be converted into 
the right to receive an amount equal to (i) the Merger Consideration less 
(A) the Escrow Amount (as defined in Section 3.1(a)) and less (B) the 
aggregate Redeemable Liquidation Preference Amount paid to the holders of 
the Redeemable Preferred Stock, divided by (ii) (A) the aggregate number  of
shares of Common Stock and Class A Common Stock outstanding as of the 
Effective Time (for the avoidance of doubt, taking into account the 
conversion of all shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B  Preferred
Stock pursuant to Section 1.6), plus (B) the aggregate number of  shares of
Class A Common Stock then issuable upon the exercise of all  Vested Options
(as defined in Section 2.2(a)) outstanding as of the  Effective Time pursuant
to Section 2.2(a) (the "Price Per Common Share"),  subject to any applicable
Tax, net to the holder thereof in cash, payable  to the holder thereof,
without any interest thereon, upon surrender and  exchange of the Certificate
representing such share of Common Stock or  Class A Common Stock or the
delivery of an affidavit as described in  Section 3.1(h).   (e) The "Merger
Consideration" means the amount equal to   (i) $283,000,000,   (ii) plus
the sum of (A) the aggregate amount of the  Company\'s and each of its
Subsidiaries\' cash and cash equivalents as  shown on   4    the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet (as defined in Section 2.6(a))  (the
"Estimated Cash Amount") and (B) the Aggregate Option Exercise  Price
Proceeds (as defined in Section 2.2(a)), and   (iii) less the sum of (A) the

11.7) of the Company  and its Subsidiaries outstanding as of the Effective
Time, (B) all  Company Expenses (as defined in Section 2.4), (C) the
aggregate  amount of Preferred Dividends payable upon the conversion of the

as provided in  Sections 2.1(c) and (d) above, shall no longer be outstanding
and shall  automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and each  certificate ("Certificate") previously evidencing such shares
shall  thereafter represent only the right to receive that portion of the
Merger  Consideration applicable to the shares underlying such Certificate.
The  holders of Certificates previously evidencing shares of Company Stock 
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have  any
rights with respect to the Company Stock except as otherwise provided  herein
or by law and, upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance  with the
provisions of Section 3.1, shall only represent the right to  receive the
applicable Merger Consideration in exchange for their shares  of Company
Stock.   SECTION 2.2. COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS AND RELATED MATTERS.   (a)
Vested Options. Any unexercised option to purchase shares  of Class A Common
Stock (an "Option") that is outstanding and vested  immediately prior to the
Effective Time under the Company\'s 2002 Stock  Option and Grant Plan, as
amended (the "Plan"), shall be converted into  the right to receive cash in
accordance with this Section 2.2(a) and shall  not, for the avoidance of
doubt, be entitled to receive any Merger  Consideration. The Company hereby
agrees that, prior to the Effective  Time, the Company Board will take all
actions necessary to accelerate the  vesting of Options held by employees of
the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries who have executed a contribution
agreement in a form  reasonably acceptable to the Company so that each such
employee shall  hold, as of the Effective Time, that number of vested Options
set forth  next to such employee\'s name on Schedule 2.2(a) (all such vested
Options  as of the Effective Time, the "Vested Options"). At the Effective
Time,  the Company shall pay to each holder of Vested Options (each an 
"Optionholder" and collectively, the "Optionholders") an amount in cash  for
each share of Class A Common Stock then issuable upon exercise of such 
Vested Options equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the Price Per Common 
Share over (ii) the exercise price for each such Vested Option. The 
aggregate amount of the exercise prices of all Vested Options as of the 
Effective Time is referred to herein as the "Aggregate Option Exercise  Price
Proceeds." The   5    aggregate amount of cash paid to the Optionholders
pursuant to this  Section 2.2(a) is referred to herein as the "Total Option
Proceeds."   (b) Unvested Options. All Options that are unvested as of the 
Effective Time shall terminate at the Effective Time in accordance with  the
Plan and the Company shall take all such actions as may be necessary  to
effect such termination.   (c) All consideration to be received by the
Optionholders  pursuant to this Section 2.2 and Section 2.7 (as well as any
amounts paid  to the Optionholders pursuant to Section 3.1) shall be treated
as  compensation by the Company and shall be net of any applicable Taxes
(as  defined in Section 4.8(f)(ii)).   SECTION 2.3. PAYMENTS AT CLOSING FOR
OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS. At (and subject to the occurrence of) the Effective
Time, Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, funds to the Surviving
Corporation in an amount equal to the Outstanding Indebtedness to enable the
Surviving Corporation to repay all such Outstanding Indebtedness as of the
Effective Time. Parent and MergerCo will cooperate with any reasonable
request of the Company in connection with the repayment of such Outstanding
Indebtedness and shall take such commercially reasonable actions as may be
reasonably requested to facilitate such repayment and to facilitate the
release, in connection with such repayment, of any mortgage, pledge, lien,
conditional sale agreement, security title or other encumbrance
(collectively, "Encumbrances") securing such Outstanding Indebtedness. The
Company shall obtain full and final releases from each Person who holds any
Encumbrance securing any Outstanding Indebtedness or otherwise related to any
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, such release to be reasonably
acceptable to Parent and effective as of the Effective Time. No later than
three Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver
a calculation, in reasonable detail, to Parent setting forth the amount to
be provided by Parent to the Company pursuant to this Section 2.3.  
SECTION 2.4. PAYMENTS AT CLOSING FOR COMPANY EXPENSES. Immediately following
(and subject to the occurrence of) the Effective Time, Parent shall provide,
or cause to be provided, funds to the Surviving Corporation in an amount
equal to all outstanding fees and expenses of the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries in connection with the negotiation and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that have not been paid on or
prior to the Closing Date (the "Company Expenses") as are set forth in the
written notice described in the immediately following sentence. No later than
three Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall notify Parent in
writing of the amount to be provided by Parent pursuant to this Section 2.4
to the Surviving Corporation and shall provide copies of all supporting
invoices and any other supporting documentation as may be requested by
Parent.   SECTION 2.5. PAYMENTS AT CLOSING FOR PREFERRED
DIVIDENDS. Immediately following (and subject to the occurrence of) the
Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, funds to the
Surviving Corporation to enable the Surviving   6   Corporation to pay
in cash, immediately following the Effective Time by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, to each holder of Series B Preferred Stock, such
holder\'s pro rata portion of the aggregate Preferred Dividends. No later
than three Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver
a calculation, in reasonable detail, to Parent setting forth the amount to
be provided by Parent pursuant to this Section 2.5.   SECTION 2.6. WORKING
CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT.   (a) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date,  the Company shall, at the Company\'s expense, prepare, or
cause to be  prepared, in good faith and deliver to Parent (i) an estimated 
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the 
"Estimated Closing Balance Sheet") prepared using (i) the accounting 
principles, procedures, policies and methods used in preparing the Base 
Balance Sheet (as defined in Section 4.5(a)(ii)), including the types of 
adjustments used in preparing such Base Balance Sheet as set forth in the 
notes thereto and (ii) the accounting principles and methodologies  reflected
in Schedule 2.6(a) ((i) and (ii), the "Balance Sheet  Principles") and a
calculation, in reasonable detail based upon such  Estimated Closing Balance
Sheet, setting forth the estimated amount of Net  Working Capital (as defined
in Section 11.7) as of immediately prior to  the scheduled Closing (the
"Estimated Net Working Capital"), the Estimated  Cash Amount and the
Estimated Underage (as defined in Section 2.6(b)) and  (ii) a certificate of
the chief financial officer of the Company  certifying that the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet and such calculations  were prepared in accordance with
this Section 2.6(a). The Company shall  give, and shall cause its advisers to
give, Parent and its advisers  reasonable access to such books, records and
personnel of the Company  (including the work papers of the Company and its
accountants relating to  the preparation of the Estimated Closing Balance
Sheet and such  calculations) as may be necessary to enable Parent and its
advisers to  review the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and such calculations
prior to  the Closing.   (b) The "Estimated Underage" shall mean an amount
equal to the  excess of $7,253,000 (the "Working Capital Target") over the
Estimated Net  Working Capital; provided, however, that if the amount of any
such excess  is less than $1,000,000, then, subject to Section 2.7, the
Estimated  Underage shall be deemed to be zero for purposes of calculating
the Merger  Consideration in Section 2.1(e).   SECTION 2.7. POST CLOSING
ADJUSTMENT.   (a) Within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date,
Parent  shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver, or cause to be 
delivered, to the Stockholders\' Representative (i) a consolidated balance 
sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Final Closing Balance 
Sheet") prepared using the Balance Sheet Principles and a calculation, in 
reasonable detail based upon such Final Closing Balance Sheet, setting  forth
the amount of Net Working Capital (the "Closing Working   7    Capital"),
the amount of cash and cash equivalents reflected thereon (the  "Closing Cash
Amount") and the Closing Underage (as defined in Section  2.7(b)), each as of
immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) a  certificate of an executive
officer of Parent certifying that the Final  Closing Balance Sheet and such
calculations were prepared in accordance  with this Section 2.7(a). The Final
Closing Balance Sheet and the related  calculations of Closing Working
Capital, Closing Cash Amount and Closing  Underage are referred to as the
"Closing Statement." Parent shall give,  and shall cause its advisers to
give, the Stockholders\' Representative and  its advisers reasonable access
to such books, records and personnel of  Parent and Surviving Corporation
(including the work papers of Parent and  Surviving Corporation and their
accountants relating to the preparation of  the Final Closing Balance Sheet
and related calculations) as may be  necessary to enable the Stockholders\'
Representative and its advisers to  review the Final Closing Balance Sheet
and such calculations during the  Review Period (as defined below). The
preparation of the Closing Statement  shall be for the sole purpose of
determining the Closing Underage and  Closing Cash Amount. The Stockholders\'
Representative shall have fifteen  (15) days following its receipt of the
Closing Statement (the "Review  Period") to review the same. On or before the
expiration of the Review  Period, the Stockholders\' Representative shall
deliver to Parent a written  statement accepting or objecting to the
calculation of any portion of the  Closing Working Capital, Closing Underage
or Closing Cash Amount set forth  on the Closing Statement; provided that the
Stockholders\' Representative  may dispute the calculation of the Closing
Working Capital, Closing  Underage or Closing Cash Amount as set forth in the
Closing Statement only  on the basis that such calculation was not made in
accordance with the  Balance Sheet Principles or on the basis of arithmetic
error. In the event  that the Stockholders\' Representative shall object to
the Closing  Statement, such statement shall include a detailed itemization
of the  Stockholders\' Representative\'s objections and the reasons therefor.
If the  Stockholders\' Representative does not deliver such statement to
Parent  within the Review Period, the Stockholders\' Representative shall be
deemed  to have accepted the Closing Statement.   (b) The "Closing
Underage" shall mean (i) if the Estimated  Underage was deemed to be zero
above, then an amount equal to the Working  Capital Target minus the Closing
Working Capital; provided, however, that  if the absolute value of such
difference is less than $1,000,000, then the  Closing Underage shall be
deemed to equal zero and (ii) if the Estimated  Underage was not deemed to be
zero in accordance with Section 2.6(b)  above, then the excess of the Working
Capital Target over the sum of (A)  the Closing Working Capital and (B) the
Estimated Underage.   (c) The Closing Underage and Closing Cash Amount set
forth on  the Closing Statement, as accepted or deemed accepted under Section
2.7(a)  or as finally determined in accordance with Section 2.7(d) below,
shall  constitute the "Final Closing Underage" and "Final Cash Amount" for 
purposes of determining any adjustment to the Merger Consideration for all 
purposes under this Agreement and such Closing Underage and Closing Cash 
Amount shall be deemed final, binding and non-appealable.   8    (d) In
the event that the Stockholders\' Representative shall  timely object to the
Closing Statement pursuant to Section 2.7(a), Parent  and the Stockholders\'
Representative shall promptly meet and in good faith  attempt to resolve such
objections. In the event that the Stockholders\'  Representative and Parent
are not able to resolve such objections (or any  portion thereof) as may be
raised with respect to the Closing Statement,  within the thirty (30) day
period following the receipt by Parent of the  Stockholders\'
Representative\'s written statement objecting to Parent\'s  calculation of
the Closing Working Capital, Closing Underage and/or  Closing Cash Amount, as
applicable, the unresolved matter(s) shall be  submitted to KPMG LLP (the
"Accounting Referee") (provided that the  personnel of KPMG used in the
review shall be reasonably acceptable to  Parent) immediately following the
expiration of such 30-day period for  review and resolution, with
instructions to complete the same as promptly  as practicable, but in any
event within thirty (30) days of its  engagement. In making such
determination, the Accounting Referee may only  consider those items and
amounts as to which Parent and the Stockholders\'  Representative have
disagreed within the time period and on the terms  specified above and must
resolve such matter(s) in accordance with the  terms and provisions of this
Agreement; provided that the determination of  the Accounting Referee will
neither be more favorable to Parent than  reflected in the Closing Statement
nor more favorable to the Stockholders\'  Representative than reflected in
its dispute notice. Such Accounting  Referee shall deliver a written report
setting forth the resolution of  each disputed item on its own calculation of
the Closing Working Capital,  Closing Underage and Closing Cash Amount as
determined in accordance with  the terms of this Agreement as soon as
practicable following the  submission of the matter to such firm, which
calculation, absent manifest  error, shall be binding and conclusive on the
parties and not subject to  appeal and may be enforced in any court having
jurisdiction. The fees and  costs of the Accounting Referee, if one is
required, shall be borne  proportionally by (i) the holders of Common Stock
and Class A Common Stock  including, for the avoidance of doubt, any holder
of any shares of Common  Stock received upon the conversion of the Series A
Preferred Stock or  Series B Preferred Stock as contemplated by this
Agreement and the  Optionholders (each a "Common Equity Holder" and
collectively, the "Common  Equity Holders") and (ii) Parent on the other
hand, on the basis, for each  such party, of the ratio of (A) the positive
difference between the amount  of Closing Underage submitted by such party
and the determination of the  actual Closing Underage made by the Accounting
Referee to (B) the  difference between the Closing Underage amounts submitted
by each party.   (e) In the event that the Final Closing Underage, as 
calculated in accordance with Section 2.7, is a positive amount, (i) the 
first $1,000,000 (or such lesser amount equal to the remaining balance in 
the Working Capital Escrow Account after deduction for any amounts paid to 
Parent out of the Working Capital Escrow Account on account of any Closing 
Cash Shortfall) of such amount shall be paid to Parent out of the Working 
Capital Escrow Account and (ii) any Final Closing Underage in excess of 
$1,000,000 (or such lesser amount paid to Parent out of the Working  Capital
Escrow Account) shall be paid by the Common Equity Holders to  Parent in cash
pursuant to the  9   Indemnification Agreement. In the event that the Final
Cash Amount is less  than the Estimated Cash Amount (such amount, the
"Closing Cash  Shortfall"), (i) the first $100,000 of such amount shall be
paid to Parent  out of the Working Capital Escrow Account and (ii) any
Closing Cash  Shortfall in excess of $100,000 shall be paid by the Common
Equity Holders  to Parent in cash pursuant to the Indemnification Agreement.
In the event  that the Final Closing Underage, as calculated in accordance
with Section  2.7, is a negative amount, then Parent shall pay, or cause to
be paid, to  the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 3.1(a)) an amount in
cash equal  to the absolute value of the Final Closing Underage, and the
Exchange  Agent shall distribute such amount proportionally to the Common
Equity  Holders based on each such Common Equity Holder\'s proportional
interest in  the Aggregate Common Equity Holder Consideration (as defined in
Section  11.7). In the event that the Final Cash Amount is greater than the 
Estimated Cash Amount, Parent shall pay to the Exchange Agent an amount in 
cash equal to such overage, and the Exchange Agent shall distribute such 
amount proportionally to the Common Equity Holders based on each such  Common
Equity Holder\'s proportional interest in the Aggregate Common  Equity Holder
Consideration. Any payment made under this Section 2.7(e)  shall be made via
wire transfer of immediately available funds within five  (5) Business Days
of the final determination of the Final Closing Underage  and Final Cash
Amount.   SECTION 2.8. WITHHOLDING OF TAXES. Parent and Company shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Article II amounts as may be required to be deducted
and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or
under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law; provided that Parent
and the Company shall give prior written notice to the Stockholders\'
Representative before making any such deduction or withholding. To the extent
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the applicable holder in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made.   ARTICLE III - PAYMENT FOR
SHARES; DISSENTING SHARES   SECTION 3.1. PAYMENT FOR SHARES OF COMPANY
STOCK.   (a) At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall  cause
to be deposited, with a mutually agreeable exchange agent (the  "Exchange
Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company  Stock for
exchange through the Exchange Agent, the Merger Consideration  less (i) the
Escrow Amount and less (ii) the sum of (x) the Aggregate  Option Exercise
Price Proceeds and (y) the Total Option Proceeds. At the  Effective Time,
Parent shall cause to be delivered to a mutually  acceptable nationally
recognized escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent") an  amount of cash equal to
$15,000,000 (the "Escrow Amount"), such deposit to  constitute an escrow fund
(the "Escrow Fund"). The Escrow Fund shall be  governed by the terms of an
escrow   10    agreement to be entered into by and among Parent, the
Stockholders\'  Representative and the Escrow Agent, such escrow agreement to
be  substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Escrow 
Agreement"). The Escrow Fund shall be held in escrow and shall be  available
to satisfy certain obligations of the Common Equity Holders as  set forth in
Sections 2.7 and 9.2 of this Agreement. Each of the parties  to this
Agreement hereby acknowledges and agrees that (i) $1,000,000 of  the Escrow
Fund will be available solely for the payment to Parent of any  Final Closing
Underage due to Parent, if any, under Section 2.7 (the  "Working Capital
Escrow Account") and (ii) $100,000 of the Working Capital  Escrow Account
will be available for the payment of any Closing Cash  Shortfall, and shall
not, under any circumstances, be available to satisfy  any Parent/MergerCo
Indemnified Party\'s (as defined in Section 9.2(a))  claim for any Loss under
Article IX. The Parent/MergerCo Indemnified  Parties\' right to seek
indemnification from the Escrow Fund under Article  IX shall be limited to
$14,000,000. No interest shall be paid or shall  accrue on any amount
pursuant to this Article III except as earned from  the Escrow Fund
itself.   (b) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time,  Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver or mail to each holder of  record
of a Certificate or Certificates that immediately prior to the  Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Company Stock (i) a form  of letter of
transmittal reasonably acceptable to the Company which shall  specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the  Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to  the Exchange
Agent and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the  Certificates in
exchange for the applicable portion of the Merger  Consideration.   (c)
Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the  Exchange Agent
together with such letter of transmittal, properly  completed and duly
executed, and such other documents as may be required  pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be  entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the portion of the Merger  Consideration that such holder
has the right to receive in respect of the  shares of Company Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate. Any  Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. No interest will  be paid or accrued on any of the
Merger Consideration payable to holders  of Certificates.   (d) Until
surrendered in accordance with this Section 3.1,  each such Certificate
(other than Certificates representing shares of  Company Stock to be canceled
in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and  Dissenting Shares) shall represent
solely the right to receive the Merger  Consideration relating thereto. If
the Merger Consideration (or any  portion thereof) is to be delivered to any
person other than the person in  whose name the Certificate formerly
representing shares of Company Stock  surrendered therefor is registered, it
shall be a condition to such right  to receive such Merger Consideration that
the Certificate so surrendered  shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and  that the person surrendering such shares of
Company Stock shall pay to the  Exchange Agent any Transfer Taxes (as defined
in Section   11    7.14(e) or other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger  Consideration to a person other than the registered
holder of the  Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the  Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable.   (e) Promptly following the date that is 180 days after the 
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the Surviving 
Corporation all cash, Certificates and other documents in its possession 
relating to the Merger, and the Exchange Agent\'s duties shall terminate. 
Thereafter, each holder of a Certificate formerly representing shares of 
Company Stock may surrender such Certificate to the Surviving Corporation 
and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar laws) 
receive in consideration therefor the Merger Consideration relating 
thereto.   (f) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the 
Company shall be closed and thereafter, there shall be no further 
registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock on the stock transfer 
books of the Surviving Corporation of any shares of Company Stock that  were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. On or after the 
Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company 
Stock presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall  be
surrendered and canceled in return for the payment of the Merger 
Consideration relating thereto, as provided in this Article III.   (g) None
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange  Agent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or affiliates shall be  liable to any person in
respect of any cash delivered to a public official  pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If  any Certificate
shall not have been surrendered prior to seven years after  the Effective
Time, or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any  shares of
Redeemable Preferred Stock, Common Stock or Class A Common Stock  would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental  entity, any
such shares shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws,  become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all  claims or
interests of any Person (as defined in Section 11.7) previously  entitled
thereto.   (h) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or 
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person 
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange 
Agent will issue the applicable Merger Consideration in exchange for such 
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.   (i) Upon receipt of any payment
from Parent pursuant to  Section 2.7(e), the Exchange Agent shall promptly
distribute all such  amounts to the Common Equity Holders based on each such
Common Equity  Holder\'s proportional interest in the Aggregate Common Equity
Holder  Consideration.   12    (j) The Exchange Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation  shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Merger Consideration or  other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder of Company  Stock or Options such amounts as the Exchange Agent,
Parent or the  Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to  the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
United  States federal, state or local Tax laws and shall instead pay such
amount  to the applicable Governmental Authority (as defined in Section 4.4).
To  the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent, Parent
or  the Surviving Corporation, such amounts withheld shall be treated for
all  purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
Company  Stock or Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was  made by the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation.   (k)
The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect  fully the appropriate
effect of any stock split, split-up, reverse stock  split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of  securities convertible into
Redeemable Preferred Stock, Common Stock or  Class A Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification  or other like change with
respect to the Redeemable Preferred Stock,  Common Stock or Class A Common
Stock having a record date occurring on or  after the date hereof and prior
to the Effective Time.   SECTION 3.2. APPRAISAL RIGHTS.   (a)
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the  contrary, any shares of
Company Stock (collectively, the "Dissenting  Shares") that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective Time and that are held by
stockholders of the Company (i) who  have not executed the Written Consent
(as defined in Section 7.1(a)) or  otherwise have not consented to or
approved the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement, (ii) who shall
have demanded properly in writing  appraisal for such shares in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL (the  "Appraisal Rights Provisions") and (iii)
who have not effectively  withdrawn, lost or failed to perfect their rights
to appraisal will not be  converted as described in Section 2.1, but at the
Effective Time, by  virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the holder  thereof, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and shall
represent  the right to receive only those rights provided under the
Appraisal Rights  Provisions; provided, however, that all shares of Company
Stock held by  stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who
effectively shall  have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such
shares of Company  Stock under the Appraisal Rights Provisions shall
thereupon be deemed to  have been canceled and retired and to have been
converted, as of the  Effective Time, into the right to receive the
applicable Merger  Consideration, without interest, in the manner provided in
Section 2.1.  Persons who have perfected statutory rights with respect to
Dissenting  Shares as aforesaid will not be paid by the Surviving Corporation
as  provided in this Agreement and will have only such rights as are
provided  by the Appraisal Rights Provisions with respect to such Dissenting
Shares.  The Company shall   13     give Parent and MergerCo prompt
notice of any demands received by the  Company for the exercise of appraisal
rights with respect to shares of  Company Stock, withdrawals of such demands,
and any other instruments  served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company, and Parent shall  have the right to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with  respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except
with the prior  written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably  withheld), make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer
to settle,  any such demands.   (b) Each dissenting stockholder who becomes
entitled under the  Appraisal Rights Provisions to payment for Dissenting
Shares shall receive  payment therefor after the Effective Time from the
Surviving Corporation  (but only after the amount thereof shall have been
agreed upon or finally  determined pursuant to the Appraisal Rights
Provisions), and such shares  of Company Stock shall be canceled.   ARTICLE

(provided that this clause (i) shall not apply to the  term "Company Material
Adverse Effect" as used in Section 4.4), (ii)  changes in general economic or

applicable to, binding upon or enforceable against the Company or any of its

breaches, conflicts, defaults or terminations that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect; or (iv) require from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
any notice to, declaration or filing with, or consent or approval of any
federal, state, local or foreign government, any governmental, regulatory or
administrative authority, agency, bureau or commission or any court,
tribunal, or judicial or arbitral body (a "Governmental Authority") or other
third party except, in the case of this clause (iv), for notices,
declarations, filings, consents or approvals the failure of which to make or
obtain would not, individually or in aggregate, reasonably be expected to (A)
prevent, impair or delay the consummation of the Merger or (B) have an
adverse impact on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in any
material respect.   17    SECTION 4.5. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED

controls over  financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the  reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial

reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary  to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and  that

for a period of three years following the Closing Date, anywhere in North 
America or any other geographic region or location in which the business  of
the Company and its Subsidiaries has been conducted in a material  manner
during the prior 12 months, engage or participate in, conduct,  advise, own,
manage, operate, control or invest in or consult with any  Person whose
business (including the business of any subsidiary or  controlled Affiliate
of such Person) derives at least 25% of its aggregate  gross revenue from
developing, marketing, or providing genetic or  diagnostic testing services
that are competitive with the testing services  provided by the Company and
its Subsidiaries (i) as of the Closing Date  and (ii) following the Closing
Date, also any additional genetic or  diagnostic testing services
subsequently developed by the Company in  neurology or endocrinology (a
"Competitive Person"); provided that Behrman  and its Affiliates shall be
permitted to make non-controlling, passive  investments in a Competitive
Person if such investment, in the aggregate  for Behrman and its Affiliates,
constitutes less than five percent of all  of the outstanding capital stock,
equity interests and other securities of  such Person (taking into account
any warrants, options, convertible  securities or similar interests and
rights to acquire such securities and  interests, whether or not actually
exercised or converted).   (b) Behrman acknowledges and agrees that the
restrictive  covenants and other agreements contained in this Section 7.7 are
an  essential part of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions 
contemplated hereby. It is the intention of the parties hereto that if any 
of the restrictions or covenants contained herein are held to cover a 
geographic area or to be for a length of time that is not permitted by 
Applicable Laws, or is in any way construed to be too broad or to any  extent
invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be null, void and  of no
effect, but to the extent such provision would then be valid or  enforceable
under Applicable Laws, such provision shall be construed and  interpreted or
reformed to provide for a restriction or covenant having  the maximum
enforceable geographic area, time period and other provisions  as shall be
valid and enforceable under Applicable Laws.   SECTION 7.8. OFFICERS\' AND

Time, the Surviving Corporation shall  purchase an extended reporting period
endorsement under the Company\'s  existing directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance coverage (or  otherwise obtain similar insurance) for the
Company\'s directors and  officers at the Effective Time in a form reasonably
acceptable to the  Company that shall provide such directors and officers
with coverage for  six (6) years following the Effective Time on terms not
materially less  favorable to the insured persons than the directors\' and
officers\'  liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company,
so long  as the aggregate cost is not more than $500,000. In the event that
the  cost for such coverage exceeds $500,000, the Surviving Corporation
shall  enter into any agreement to spend up to that amount to purchase such 
lesser coverage as may be obtained with such amount. Parent shall, and  shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policy in full  force and
effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.   (c) Subject to
Applicable Laws, the obligations under this  Section 7.8 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to  materially adversely affect
any Indemnified Party (as defined in Section  7.8(d)) to whom this Section
7.8 applies without the consent of such  Indemnified Party (it being
expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties  to whom this Section 7.8
applies shall be third party beneficiaries of  this Section 7.8 and shall be
entitled to enforce the covenants contained  herein).   (d) For the
purposes of this Section 7.8, "Indemnified Party"  means any person who is
now, or has been at any time prior to the date  hereof, or who becomes prior
to the Effective Time, an individual entitled  to indemnification pursuant to
the charter or by-laws of the Company or  one of its Subsidiaries or the
terms of the existing directors and  officers\' insurance policy of the
Company as in effect at the Effective  Time.   SECTION 7.9. EMPLOYEE
BENEFIT ARRANGEMENTS.   (a) Parent and MergerCo shall ensure that, except as
set forth  in Schedule 7.9(a), all persons who were employed by the Company
and its  Subsidiaries immediately preceding the Closing Date, including those
on  vacation, leave of absence or disability (the "Company Employees"),
will  be employed by the Company as an at-will employee immediately after
the  Closing Date, at not less than the same base rate of pay in effect for 
such employee immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided that such 
Company Employee executes Parent\'s form of Agreement Relating to 
Confidential Information, Intellectual Property and Additional Covenants  and
agrees to be bound by   41    the Parent Code of Conduct and Corporate
Policies applicable to all  employees of Parent. During the period commencing
on the date of this  Agreement through the Closing, neither the Company nor
any of its  Subsidiaries shall effectuate a "mass layoff" or "plant closing"
within  the meaning of WARN or any similar foreign, state or local law
affecting  any site of employment or facility of the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries. Within five (5) business days prior to the Closing, the 
Company shall provide Parent with a list setting forth the number of 
employees terminated from each site of employment of the Company and each  of
its Subsidiaries during the 90-day period ending on the Closing Date  for
reasons qualifying as an "employment loss" under WARN or any similar 
foreign, state or local law, and the date of each such termination. For a 
period of 90 days after the Closing, Parent shall not cause the Company to 
effectuate a "mass layoff" as that term is defined in WARN, or comparable 
conduct under any applicable foreign, state or local law, affecting any 
facility, site of employment, operating unit of the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries without complying with WARN or other Applicable Law.   (b) Each
of Parent and MergerCo acknowledges that consummation  of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will constitute a  change in control of the
Company (to the extent such concept is  applicable) for purposes of the
Company Plans. From and after the Closing,  as applicable, Parent, MergerCo
and the Surviving Corporation will honor  in accordance with their terms all
cash bonus plans, stock option and  stock incentive plans, employment
agreements, consulting agreements,  change-of-control agreements and
severance agreements or other plans  between the Company and its Subsidiaries
and any officer, director or  employee of the Company or such Subsidiary in
effect prior to the Closing  Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
provision of this Agreement shall  be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for
any period of time for, or  preclude the ability of Parent or any affiliate
to terminate the  employment or service of any Company Employee for any
reason or (ii)  require Parent or any affiliate to continue any Company Plan
or prevent  the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the
Closing Date.   (c) For a period of six (6) months following the Effective 
Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue 
to provide Company Employees with employee benefits, programs and 
arrangements (other than deferred compensation plans or equity plans) that 
are no less favorable in the aggregate than either (i) those in effect for 
Company Employees immediately preceding the Effective Time or (ii) those 
provided to similarly situated employees by Parent, as determined in 
Parent\'s sole discretion. Subject to the requirements of Applicable Law  and
unless such recognition of service would result in a duplication of 
benefits, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,  treat,
and cause the applicable benefit plans to treat, the service of  Company
Employees with the Company or the Subsidiaries of the Company  attributable
to any period before the Effective Time as service rendered  to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation for purposes of eligibility to  participate, vesting
and for other appropriate purposes, including, but  not limited to,
applicability of minimum   42    waiting periods for participation,
excluding for these purposes benefit  accrual under any defined benefit
pension plan. Without limiting the  foregoing, Parent shall not, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation not  to, treat any Company Employee as a
"new" employee for purposes of any  exclusions under any health or similar
plan of Parent or the Surviving  Corporation for a pre-existing medical
condition, and any deductibles and  co-pays paid under any of the Company\'s
or any of the Subsidiaries\' health  plans shall be credited towards
deductibles and co-pays under the health  plans of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, other than limitation or  waiting periods that are already in
effect with respect to such Company  Employee and have not been satisfied as
of the Closing Date and to the  extent such co-payments and deductibles would
be credited under any  Company Plan. Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, to  make appropriate arrangements with its insurance
carrier(s) to ensure such  results.   (d) Within 5 Business Days after the
date hereof, the Company  shall deliver to Parent a schedule ("Schedule
7.9(d)") setting forth, with  respect to each employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries that will  exercise or cash out Options pursuant to Section 2.2,
(i) such employee\'s  estimated compensation subject to social security taxes
for calendar year  2006, (ii) the portion of such compensation projected to
have been paid to  such employee as of the Closing Date, and (iii) the
estimated amount of  such employee\'s proceeds from the exercise or cash out
of the Options  pursuant to Section 2.2 , such Schedule 7.9(d) to be
reasonably acceptable  to Parent Such Schedule 7.9(d) shall be revised as
necessary as part of  the determination of the amount of Net Working
Capital.   SECTION 7.10. NOTICE OF CERTAIN MATTERS. From the date hereof to
the Closing Date, Parent and the Company shall promptly advise the other
party in writing upon acquiring knowledge of any event, circumstance,
occurrence or fact that would cause any of the conditions set forth in
Sections 8.1 and 8.3, in the case of Parent, and Sections 8.1 and 8.2, in the
case of the Company, not to be satisfied on or prior to the time in which
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1.   SECTION 7.11.
BOOKS AND RECORDS. Parent and MergerCo shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and each Subsidiary to, until the seventh anniversary of the
Closing Date, retain all books, records and other documents pertaining to the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries in existence on the Closing Date
and to make the same available for inspection and copying by the Stockholders
or any of the representatives of such Stockholders at the expense of such
Stockholders during the normal business hours of Parent, MergerCo, the
Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary, as applicable, upon reasonable
request and upon reasonable notice.   SECTION 7.12. TERMINATION OF CERTAIN
AGREEMENTS. Immediately prior to and contingent upon the Effective Time, the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, terminate all
Affiliate Arrangements, except for those set forth on Schedule 4.19(b), and,
in each case, any amounts, liabilities or obligations owed or existing
thereunder   43   shall have been terminated or repaid or satisfied and
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be fully and irrevocably released from
any liability or obligation thereunder, except to the extent any such amounts
are Company Expenses.   SECTION 7.13. FURTHER ACTION. Each of the parties
hereto shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to
be taken all appropriate action, do or cause to be done all things necessary,
proper or advisable and execute and deliver such documents and other papers,
as may be required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   SECTION 7.14. TAX MATTERS.   (a) Pre Closing Taxes, Tax
Returns and Tax Proceedings. From the date of this Agreement until Closing,
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall: (i) duly and timely file or cause to
be filed (taking into account all valid extensions) all Tax Returns required
to be filed on or prior to the Closing Date, and all such Tax Returns shall
be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice, except as otherwise
required by law, (ii) timely pay or cause to be paid all Taxes required to be
paid (taking into account all valid extensions) on or prior to the Closing
Date and (iii) promptly notify Parent of any Tax Proceeding arising during
such period (or any significant developments with respect to any ongoing Tax
Proceeding) with respect to any Tax or Tax Return.   (b) Closing Date;
Straddle Period Tax Returns. To the extent permitted under applicable law,
the Parties shall treat the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable year
of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Tax purposes. In the case
of any taxable period that begins on or prior to and ends after the Closing
Date (a "Straddle Period"), the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by
income or receipts of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries that is
allocable to the pre-Closing portion of such Straddle Period ("Pre-Closing
Portion") or the post-Closing portion of such Straddle Period ("Post-Closing
Portion") shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of
the close of business on the Closing Date, and other Taxes for a Straddle
Period shall be prorated between, and allocated to, the Pre-Closing Portion
and the Post-Closing Portion based on the number of days included in each
such portion relative to the total number of days included in such
Straddle Period.   (c) Tax Return Preparation.   (i) Following the
Closing, Parent shall prepare and  file, or shall cause to be prepared and
filed, all Tax Returns of the  Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
required to be filed after the  Closing Date. To the extent that the Common
Equity Holders have an  indemnification obligation pursuant to Section 9.2 of
this Agreement, (A)  such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with prior  practice unless such prior practice has been determined to be
incorrect or  a contrary treatment is required by applicable law (or judicial
or  administrative interpretations thereof); (B) Parent shall provide the 
Stockholders\' Representative with copies of such   44    Tax Return and
a statement calculating related indemnification obligation  of and/or amount
due from the Common Equity Holders at least 30 days prior  to the due date
for filing such Tax Return (giving effect to applicable  extensions); and (C)
the Stockholders\' Representative shall have the right  to provide comments
and proposed amendments in writing for 15 days  following receipt thereof.
The failure of the Stockholders\' Representative  to propose any changes to
any such Tax Return within such 15 days shall be  deemed to be an indication
of its approval thereof. Parent and  Stockholders\' Representative shall
attempt in good faith mutually to  resolve any dispute regarding such Tax
Returns prior to such due date for  filing thereof. If Parent and
Stockholders\' Representative cannot reach an  agreement regarding such
dispute, the dispute shall be presented to the  Accounting Referee the
determination of which shall be binding upon both  parties, provided,
however, that Parent and Stockholders\' Representative  shall require the
Accounting Referee to use its best effort to ensure that  such determination
is made within ten (10) days but in no event later than  five (5) days prior
to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return. If  the Accounting Referee
cannot make its determination within such time  frame, Parent shall file the
Tax Return as originally proposed subject  only to those adjustments mutually
agreed by Parent and Stockholders\'  Representative. To the extent necessary,
amendments to any such Tax Return  shall be filed based on the Accounting
Referee determination.   (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained  in this Agreement, each party shall be responsible for its own
costs and  expenses incurred in connection with this Section 7.14(c);
provided,  however, that all costs and expenses of the Accounting Referee
shall be  paid 50% by the Common Equity Holders and 50% by Parent.   (iii)
With respect to each Tax Return filed following  the Closing by or on behalf
of the Surviving Corporation and any of its  Subsidiaries for a Straddle
Period (a "Straddle Period Tax Return") or for  any period ending on or
before the Closing Date (a "Pre-Closing Tax  Return"), no later than three
(3) days prior to the due date of such Tax  Return, the Common Equity Holders
shall pay to Parent, in immediately  available funds, an amount equal to the
amount of Taxes (including  disputed amounts) for such Straddle Period that
are allocable to the  Pre-Closing Portion of the Straddle Period and all
Taxes for periods  included in any Pre-Closing Tax Return all as determined
in accordance  with the provisions of Section 7.14(h) of this Agreement (but
only to the  extent such amounts have not been taken into account in
determining Net  Working Capital). Nothing contained in Section 7.14
(including all  subsections thereof) shall be interpreted as (A) limiting
the  Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Parties\' rights to indemnification from
the  Common Equity Holders pursuant to Section 9.2 or (B) increasing the
amount  for which the Common Equity Holders are liable pursuant to Section
9.2.   (iv) Except as set forth in Section 7.14(h) with respect  to Special
Items, Parent shall not amend any Tax Returns of the Company or  its  
45    Subsidiaries filed for any taxable period or portion thereof ending
on or  prior to the Closing Date without the prior written consent of the 
Stockholders\' Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably 
withheld, conditioned or delayed).   (d) Cooperation. Following the Closing,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Stockholders\' Representative shall
(i) cooperate fully in preparing for any Tax Proceedings with any
Governmental Authority or with respect to any matters with respect to Taxes
of or relating to the Company or the Subsidiaries and (ii) make available to
the other Party and to any Governmental Authority as reasonably requested all
information, records, and documents relating to Tax matters of or relating to
the Company or the Subsidiaries. Each Party shall keep any information
obtained under this Section 7.14(d) confidential except (x) as may be
necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund
or the conduct of any Tax Proceeding or (y) with the consent of the other
Parties.   (e) Transfer Taxes. Parent shall bear and be liable for and hold
the holders of Company Stock and Options harmless against any transfer, value
added, excise, stock transfer, stamp, recording, registration and any similar
Taxes ("Transfer Taxes") that become payable in connection with the Merger
and other transactions contemplated hereby. The parties hereto
shall cooperate in filing such forms and documents as may be necessary to
permit any such Transfer Tax to be assessed and paid on or prior to the
Closing Date in accordance with any available pre-sale filing procedure, and
to obtain any exemption or refund of any such Transfer Tax.   (f) Tax
Proceedings.   (i) Subject to this Section 7.14(f), Parent shall have  the
right to control any Tax Proceedings with respect to the Surviving 
Corporation and any of its Subsidiaries.   (ii) If a Governmental Authority
commences a Tax  Proceeding which, if successful, would result in
indemnification  obligation of the Common Equity Holders pursuant to Section
9.2 of this  Agreement (an "Indemnified Tax Claim"), Parent shall, promptly
upon  receipt of a written notice regarding such Tax Proceeding, inform the 
Stockholders\' Representative thereof. The failure of Parent to timely 
notify Stockholders\' Representative in accordance with the immediately 
preceding sentence shall not relieve the Common Equity Holders of their 
obligation to pay such liability for Taxes unless and only to the extent 
that the failure timely to provide such notification materially prejudices 
the ability of Common Equity Holders and the Stockholders\' Representative 
to contest such liability for Taxes.   (iii) The Stockholders\'
Representative shall have the  right to control any such Tax Proceeding with
respect to a Pre-Closing Tax  Return but only with respect and to the extent
of the Indemnified Tax  Claim. The Stockholders\' Representative shall notify
Parent in writing if  it elects not to so control within ten (10)  
46    days of being notified about the Tax Proceeding. The Stockholders\' 
Representative shall act diligently and in good faith and shall bear its  own
costs and expenses with respect thereto; provided that the  Stockholders\'
Representative shall not enter into any settlement  agreement, compromise or
otherwise dispose of such Indemnified Tax Claim  without the prior written
consent of Parent (which consent shall not be  unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Parent shall be entitled  to participate at its own
cost and expense in any such Tax Proceeding  (including, without limitation,
by attending meetings, reviewing documents  and submissions prior to being
made and receiving copies of  correspondences with any Governmental
Authority).   (iv) Parent shall diligently and in good faith control  any
Tax Proceedings related to an Indemnified Tax Claim with respect to a 
Straddle Period Tax Return and with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Return if 
Stockholders\' Representative elects not to control pursuant to Section 
7.14(f)(iii) including any compromise or settlement thereof; provided that 
Parent shall not enter into any settlement agreement, compromise or 
otherwise dispose of an Indemnified Tax Claim without the prior written 
consent of the Stockholders\' Representative (which consent shall not be 
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Stockholders\' 
Representative shall be entitled to participate at its own cost and  expense
in any such Tax Proceeding (including, without limitation, by  attending
meetings, reviewing documents and submissions prior to being  made and
receiving copies of correspondences with any Governmental  Authority).  
(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this  Agreement in
the event of a conflict between the provisions of this  Section 7.14 and any
other provision of this Agreement (including, without  limiting to, the
provisions of Section 9.2(d)) this Section 7.14 shall  govern and
control.   (h) Tax Treatment of Special Items. Notwithstanding anything  to
the contrary in this Agreement:   (i) Parent shall have the sole discretion
as to the  manner in which the Special Items are reflected in any Tax Return,
any  related statement or calculation or any amendment thereof.   (ii)
Parent shall have the sole control over any Tax  Proceeding regarding any or
all of the Special Items and shall have the  authority to settle, dispose or
compromise such Tax Proceeding as it  relates to such Special Items without
the consent of Stockholders\'  Representative. In addition, the
Stockholders\' Representative shall not  have the right to participate in any
such Tax Proceedings to the extent  related to the Special Items.   (iii)
The obligations of the Stockholders\'  Representative and/or the Common
Equity Holders with respect to the  payment and/or reimbursement of any Taxes
pursuant to Sections  7.14(c)(iii) and 9.2(a)(iii) shall be calculated  
47    by determining the Taxes for any applicable period without taking 
into account the Tax treatment of the Special Items.   (iv) For the for the
avoidance of doubt, nothing  contained in this Section 7.14(h) shall be
interpreted as limiting  the Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Parties\' rights to
indemnification  from the Common Equity Holders pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i)
or  Section 9.2(a)(ii) (including, without limitation, breach of the 
representation under Section 4.9(f)).   ARTICLE VIII - CONDITIONS TO THE

Holder and (v) the matter set forth in Schedule 9.1.   "Excluded Taxes"
shall mean (a) any Taxes of the Company or any of  its Subsidiaries arising
from transactions (other than transactions  contemplated in this Agreement)
outside the ordinary course of business  that occur on the Closing Date but
after the Effective Time and (b) the  aggregate amount of the employer\'s
share of payroll taxes payable by the  Company and its Subsidiaries as a
result of the exercise or cash out of  the Options pursuant to Section
2.2.   (b) The Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Parties\' indemnification 
rights pursuant to Section 9.2(a) shall be limited as follows:   (i) The
Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Parties shall not be  entitled to any
indemnification until the aggregate dollar amount of all  Losses that would
otherwise be indemnifiable pursuant to Section 9.2(a)  exceeds $1,400,000
(the "Deductible"), and then only to the extent that  aggregate Losses exceed
such Deductible. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  this Section 9.2(b)(i) shall
not apply to (x) claims made under Section  9.2(a)(i) with respect to the
Excluded Representations and Warranties,  Section 9.2(a)(ii) with respect to
claims for a breach of Section 7.7 only  and Section 9.2(a)(iv) and (y)
claims in respect of the matter set forth  in Schedule 9.1.   (ii) The
Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Parties shall not  be entitled to indemnification
for indemnifiable Losses hereunder in  excess of the aggregate amount of the
Escrow Fund. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, and subject to Section
9.2(b)(iii) below, this Section  9.2(b)(ii) shall not apply to claims made
under Section 9.2(a)(i) with  respect to the Excluded Representations and
Warranties, Section 9.2(a)(ii)  with respect to claims for a breach of
Section 7.7 only and Section  9.2(a)(iv).   (iii) Notwithstanding any other
provision of this  Agreement, and in accordance with the terms of the
Indemnification  Agreement, the Common Equity Holders hereby agree to
severally indemnify  and hold harmless the Parent/MergerCo Indemnified
Parties for  indemnifiable Losses under Section 9.2(a)(i) with respect to
Excluded  Representations and Warranties, Section 9.2(a)(ii) with respect
to  breaches of Section 7.7 only and Section 9.2(a)(iv) in excess of the 
Escrow Fund; provided that, with respect to indemnifiable Losses   52   
under such Sections, claims for indemnification shall be made first  against
the Escrow Fund, and then only after the Escrow Fund is fully  exhausted or
previously released, a Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Party may  seek recourse
directly against the Common Equity Holders for  indemnification
hereunder.   (iv) In no event shall any Common Equity Holder be  obligated
to indemnify a Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Party for any Loss  pursuant to
this Article IX in excess of such Common Equity Holder\'s pro  rata portion
of such Loss, which pro rata portion shall, except as set  forth in the
Indemnification Agreement, be equal to such Common Equity  Holder\'s pro rata
portion of the Aggregate Common Equity Holder  Consideration, nor shall any
Common Equity Holder be obligated to  indemnify a Parent/MergerCo Indemnified
Party hereunder for any amount in  excess of such Common Equity Holder\'s pro
rata portion of the Aggregate  Common Equity Holder Consideration.   (v)
Except as set forth below, no indemnification shall  be payable to a
Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Party with respect to claims  asserted by such
Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Party after the date that is  six months after
the Closing Date (the "Indemnification Cut-Off Date");  provided that any
matter as to which a claim has been asserted by timely  notice that is
pending or unresolved at the end of any applicable  limitation period under
this Article IX shall continue to be covered by  this Article IX
notwithstanding any applicable statute of limitations  (which the parties
hereby waive solely with respect to such circumstances)  or the expiration
date described in the immediately preceding sentence of  this Section
9.2(b)(v) until such matter is finally terminated or  otherwise resolved by
the parties under this Agreement or by a court of  competent jurisdiction and
any amounts payable hereunder are finally  determined and paid.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 9.2(b)(v)  shall not apply to
claims by a Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Party under (A)  Section 9.2(a)(i)
only with respect to the Excluded Representations and  Warranties, for which
claims may be made forever, or the Tax  Representations and Warranties, for
which claims may be made until the  expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations, (B) Section  9.2(a)(ii), for which claims may be made any time
during such time as the  particular covenant is required to be performed
under this Agreement, (C)  Section 9.2(a)(iii), for which claims may be made
until 90 days following  the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations, (D) Section  9.2(a)(iv), for which claims may be made until the
expiration of the  applicable statute of limitations, and (E) Section
9.2(a)(v), for which  claims may be made until the date that is three years
after the Closing  Date.   (c) The amount of any Loss subject to
indemnification under this Section 9.2 shall be calculated net of any
insurance proceeds received by the Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Party on
account of such Loss. The Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery for such   53   Loss
recovery under any insurance policies covering such Loss. In the event that
an insurance recovery is received by any Parent/MergerCo Indemnified
Party with respect to any Loss for which any such Person has been
indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the
recovery shall be made promptly to the Person or Persons that provided such
indemnity payments to such Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Party. The
indemnifying party shall be subrogated to all rights of the Parent/MergerCo
Indemnified Party in respect of any Loss borne by the indemnifying party.  
(d) A Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Party shall give the
Stockholders\' Representative written notice of any Third-Party Claim (as
defined in Section 11.7) in respect of which such Parent/MergerCo Indemnified
Party may request indemnification hereunder or as to which the Deductible may
be applied as soon as is practicable and in any event within thirty (30) days
of the time that such Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Party receives written
notice of such claim or proceeding; provided, however, that the failure to so
notify the Stockholders\' Representative shall not affect the rights of the
Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Parties to indemnification hereunder except to
the extent that the Common Equity Holders are prejudiced by such failure and
such failure results in a lack of actual notice to the Stockholders\'
Representative. Within 30 days after receipt of such notice, the
Stockholders\' Representative shall have the right to elect, at its option
and through counsel of its own choosing, to assume the defense or settlement
of any such Third-Party Claim at its own expense. If the Stockholders\'
Representative elects to assume the defense of any such Third-Party Claim,
the Stockholders\' Representative shall promptly, but in any event within 10
Business Days of the receipt of notice from the Parent/MergerCo Indemnified
Party of such Third-Party Claim, notify the Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Party
of its intention to do so; provided that (i) counsel to be utilized by the
Stockholders\' Representative in respect of such Third-Party Claim and
related proceeding shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent (it being agreed
that Goodwin Procter LLP is reasonably acceptable to Parent), (ii) subject to
the control of the prosecution and defense of such Third-Party Claim by the
Stockholders\' Representative and its counsel, the
Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Party and its counsel shall be kept fully
informed as to all material aspects of such Third-Party Claim and related
proceedings and shall have the right to participate fully in the prosecution
and defense of such Third-Party Claim at its own expense, (iii) the
Stockholders\' Representative and its counsel shall promptly provide to
Parent and its counsel all material information related to such Third-Party
Claim and related proceedings (including copies of written information), (iv)
Parent and MergerCo and their counsel shall have their views regarding such
Third-Party Claim considered in good faith by the Stockholders\'
Representative and its counsel and (v) Parent and its counsel shall have the
right to consent, such consent not be unreasonably withheld, to the
settlement or compromise of such Third-Party Claim and related
proceedings. Subject to Applicable Laws, a Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Party
shall provide and shall cause the Company to provide, as applicable, upon
reasonable notice, the Stockholders\' Representative and its counsel with
reasonable access to its records and personnel reasonably relating to any
such claim, assertion, event or proceeding during normal business hours and
shall   54   otherwise cooperate with any reasonable request of the
Stockholders\' Representative in the defense or settlement thereof; provided
that (A) that such cooperation does not unduly interfere with the business of
the cooperating party, (B) the requesting party shall reimburse the other
party promptly for all reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by such other party in connection with any such request and
(C) such other party shall not be required to permit any of the foregoing
activities that would (x) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of
third parties, or any trade secrets of either party or of any of their
respective Affiliates unrelated to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, unless such disclosed trade secrets are protected by an agreement
of the third party plaintiff or an order of the court, (y) violate any
obligations of either party or their respective Affiliates to any third party
with respect to confidentiality or (z) reasonably be expected, in the opinion
of counsel, to have the effect of causing the waiver of any attorney-client
privilege. Subject to Applicable Laws, if the Stockholders\' Representative
elects to direct the defense of any such claim or proceeding,
the Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Party shall not pay, or permit to be paid,
any part of any claim or demand arising from such asserted liability unless
the Stockholders\' Representative consents in writing to such payment or
unless the Stockholders\' Representative, subject to the last sentence of
this Section 9.2(d), withdraws from the defense of such asserted liability or
unless a final judgment from which no appeal may be taken by or on behalf of
the Common Equity Holders is entered against the Parent/MergerCo Indemnified
Party for such liability. If the Stockholders\' Representative receiving
notice of a Third-Party Claim does not elect to defend such Third-Party Claim
or if the Stockholders\' Representative fails to defend in good faith or if,
after commencing or undertaking any such defense, the Stockholders\'
Representative fails to prosecute in good faith or withdraws from such
defense, the Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Party shall have the right, in
addition to any other right or remedy it may have hereunder, to undertake the
defense or settlement thereof, at the Common Equity Holders\' expense;
provided, however, that the Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Party shall not
settle, compromise or discharge, or admit any liability with respect to, any
such Third-Party Claim without the written consent of the Stockholders\'
Representative (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).   (e) No Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to indemnification hereunder for any Loss arising from a breach of
any representation, warranty or covenant set forth herein (and the amount of
any Loss incurred in respect of such breach shall not be included in the
calculation of any limitations on indemnification set forth herein) to the
extent that such liability is accrued in the Estimated Net Working Capital or
the Closing Working Capital.   (f) Subject to Section 9.5, no breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein shall give
rise to any right on the part of Parent, MergerCo or a Parent/MergerCo
Indemnified Party, after the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby.   55    (g) The Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Parties shall not
be  entitled to indemnification for any consequential, exemplary or
punitive  damages or any multiple of damages unless such damages are
assessed  against any of the Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Parties in a Third-
Party  Claim. Parent, MergerCo and each Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Party
shall  use commercially reasonable efforts, to the extent within their
control,  to mitigate any Losses for which they reasonably believe
indemnification  will be available pursuant to this Agreement.   (h) Any
Loss for which any Parent/MergerCo Indemnified Party  is entitled to
indemnification under this Section 9.2 shall be determined  without
duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving  rise to such
Loss constitutes a breach of more than one representation,  warranty,
covenant or agreement.   SECTION 9.3. INDEMNIFICATION BY PARENT AND
MERGERCO.   (a) Subject to the other terms and conditions of this 
Agreement, Parent and MergerCo agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify, 
defend and hold harmless the holders of any Company Stock or Options and  any
of their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders,  agents and
Affiliates (each a "Company Indemnified Party") from and  against any Losses
arising from, relating to or resulting from (i) any  inaccuracy in or breach
of any representation or warranty of Parent or  MergerCo herein or any
certificate or document delivered by Parent or  MergerCo pursuant to this
Agreement without regard to any Parent Material  Adverse Effect or
materiality qualifications, (ii) any breach of or  failure to perform any
covenant or agreement of Parent or MergerCo  contained herein or (iii) acts
of fraud by Parent or MergerCo or any of  their employees.   (b) The
Company Indemnified Parties\' indemnification rights  pursuant to Section
9.3(a) shall be limited as follows:   (i) The Company Indemnified Parties
shall not be  entitled to any indemnification until the aggregate dollar
amount of  all Losses that would otherwise be indemnifiable pursuant to
Section  9.3(a) exceeds the Deductible, and then only to the extent that 
aggregate Losses exceed such Deductible. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, this
Section 9.3(b)(i) shall not apply to claims made  under Section
9.3(a)(iii).   (ii) The Company Indemnified Parties shall not be  entitled
to indemnification for indemnifiable Losses hereunder in  excess of the
aggregate amount of the Escrow Fund. Notwithstanding  the foregoing, this
Section 9.3(b)(ii) shall not apply to claims  made under Section
9.3(a)(iii).   (iii) No indemnification shall be payable to a Company 
Indemnified Party with respect to claims asserted by such Company 
Indemnified   56    Party after the Indemnification Cut-Off Date;
provided that any  matter as to which a claim has been asserted by timely
notice that  is pending or unresolved at the end of any applicable
limitation  period under this Article IX shall continue to be covered by
this  Article IX notwithstanding any applicable statute of limitations 
(which the parties hereby waive solely with respect to such  circumstances)
or the expiration date described in the immediately  preceding sentence of
this Section 9.3(b)(iii) until such matter is  finally terminated or
otherwise resolved by the parties under this  Agreement or by a court of
competent jurisdiction and any amounts  payable hereunder are finally
determined and paid. Notwithstanding  the foregoing, this Section 9.3(b)(iii)
shall not apply to claims by  a Company Indemnified Party under (A) Section
9.3(a)(ii), for which  claims may be made any time during such time as the
particular  covenant is required to be performed under this Agreement and
(B)  Section 9.3(a)(iii), for which claims may be made until the  expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations.   (c) The amount of any Loss
subject to indemnification under  this Section 9.3 shall be calculated net of
any insurance proceeds  received by the Company Indemnified Party on account
of such Loss. The  Company Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to  seek recovery for such Loss recovery under any
insurance policies covering  such Loss. In the event that an insurance
recovery is received by any  Company Indemnified Party with respect to any
Loss for which any such  Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund
equal to the  aggregate amount of the recovery shall be made promptly to the
Person or  Persons that provided such indemnity payments to such Company
Indemnified  Party. The indemnifying party shall be subrogated to all rights
of the  Company Indemnified Party in respect of any Loss borne by the
indemnifying  party.   (d) A Company Indemnified Party shall give Parent
and MergerCo  written notice of any Third-Party Claim in respect of which
such Company  Indemnified Party may request indemnification hereunder or as
to which the  Deductible may be applied as soon as is practicable and in any
event  within thirty (30) days of the time that such Company Indemnified
Party  receives written notice of such claim or proceeding; provided,
however,  that the failure to so notify Parent and MergerCo shall not affect
the  rights of the Company Indemnified Parties to indemnification hereunder 
except to the extent that Parent and MergerCo are actually prejudiced by 
such failure and such failure results in a lack of actual notice to Parent 
and Merger Co. Within 30 days after receipt of such notice, Parent and 
MergerCo shall have the right to elect, at its option and through counsel  of
their own choosing, to assume the defense or settlement of any such  Third-
Party Claim at their own expense. If Parent and MergerCo elect to  assume the
defense of any such Third-Party Claim, Parent and MergerCo  shall promptly,
but in any event within 10 Business Days of the receipt of  notice from the
Company Indemnified Party of such Third-Party Claim,  notify the Company
Indemnified Party of its intention to do so; provided  that (i) counsel to be
utilized by Parent and MergerCo in respect of   57    such Third-Party
Claim and related proceeding shall be reasonably  acceptable to the Company
Indemnified Party (it being agreed that Skadden,  Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom
LLP is reasonably acceptable to the Company  Indemnified Party), (ii) subject
to the control of the prosecution and  defense of such Third-Party Claim by
Parent and MergerCo and their  counsel, the Company Indemnified Party and its
counsel shall be kept fully  informed as to all material aspects of such
Third-Party Claim and related  proceedings and shall have the right to
participate fully in the  prosecution and defense of such Third-Party Claim
at its own expense,  (iii) Parent and MergerCo and their counsel shall
promptly provide to the  Company Indemnified Party and its counsel all
material information related  to such Third-Party Claim and related
proceedings (including copies of  written information), (iv) the Company
Indemnified Party and its counsel  shall have their views regarding such
Third-Party Claim considered in good  faith by Parent and MergerCo and their
counsel and (v) the Company  Indemnified Party and its counsel shall have the
right to consent, such  consent not be unreasonably withheld, to the
settlement or compromise of  such Third-Party Claim and related proceedings.
Subject to Applicable  Laws, a Company Indemnified Party shall provide, upon
reasonable notice,  Parent and MergerCo and their counsel with reasonable
access to its  records and personnel reasonably relating to any such claim,
assertion,  event or proceeding during normal business hours and shall
otherwise  cooperate with any reasonable request of Parent and MergerCo in
the  defense or settlement thereof; provided that (A) that such cooperation 
does not unduly interfere with the business of the cooperating party, (B) 
the requesting party shall reimburse the other party promptly for all 
reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by such 
other party in connection with any such request and (C) such other party 
shall not be required to permit any of the foregoing activities that would 
(x) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties, or any 
trade secrets of either party or of any of their respective Affiliates 
unrelated to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless such 
disclosed trade secrets are protected by an agreement of the third party 
plaintiff or an order of the court, (y) violate any obligations of either 
party or their respective Affiliates to any third party with respect to 
confidentiality or (z) reasonably be expected, in the opinion of counsel,  to
have the effect of causing the waiver of any attorney-client privilege. 
Subject to Applicable Laws, if Parent and MergerCo elect to direct the 
defense of any such claim or proceeding, the Company Indemnified Party  shall
not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of any claim or demand  arising from
such asserted liability unless Parent and MergerCo consent in  writing to
such payment or unless Parent and MergerCo, subject to the last  sentence of
this Section 9.3(d), withdraw from the defense of such  asserted liability or
unless a final judgment from which no appeal may be  taken by or on behalf of
Parent or MergerCo is entered against the Company  Indemnified Party for such
liability. If Parent or MergerCo receiving  notice of a Third-Party Claim
does not elect to defend such Third-Party  Claim or if Parent and MergerCo
fail to defend in good faith or if, after  commencing or undertaking any such
defense, Parent and MergerCo fail to  prosecute in good faith or withdraw
from such defense, the Company  Indemnified Party shall have the right, in
addition to any other   58    right or remedy it may have hereunder, to
undertake the defense or  settlement thereof, at Parent\'s and MergerCo\'s
expense; provided, however,  that the Company Indemnified Party shall not
settle, compromise or  discharge, or admit any liability with respect to, any
such Third-Party  Claim without the written consent of Parent and MergerCo
(which consent  will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).   (e) No
Company Indemnified Party shall be entitled to  indemnification hereunder for
any Loss arising from a breach of any  representation, warranty or covenant
set forth herein (and the amount of  any Loss incurred in respect of such
breach shall not be included in the  calculation of any limitations on
indemnification set forth herein) to the  extent that such liability is
accrued in the Estimated Net Working Capital  or the Closing Working
Capital.   (f) Subject to Section 9.5, no breach of any representation, 
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein shall give rise to any 
right on the part of the Company or a Company Indemnified Party, after the 
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, to rescind this 
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.   (g) The Company
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to  indemnification for any
consequential, exemplary or punitive damages or  any multiple of damages
unless such damages are assessed against any of  the Company Indemnified
Parties in a Third-Party Claim. The Company and  each Company Indemnified
Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts,  to the extent within their
control, to mitigate any Losses for which they  reasonably believe
indemnification will be available pursuant to this  Agreement.   (h) Any
Loss for which any Company Indemnified Party is  entitled to indemnification
under this Section 9.3 shall be determined  without duplication of recovery
by reason of the state of facts giving  rise to such Loss constitutes a
breach of more than one representation,  warranty, covenant or agreement.  
SECTION 9.4. TREATMENT OF INDEMNITY PAYMENTS. Unless otherwise required by
Applicable Law, all payments made by the Common Equity Holders, Parent or
MergerCo (or any of their respective Affiliates), as the case may be, to or
for the benefit of the other parties pursuant to Sections 2.7 or this Article
IX shall be treated as adjustments to the Merger Consideration for
tax purposes, and such agreed treatment shall govern for purposes of this
Agreement.   SECTION 9.5. REMEDIES EXCLUSIVE.   (a) The Company, Behrman
Capital and Behrman on one hand, and  Parent and MergerCo, on the other hand,
hereby acknowledge and agree that  prior to the Closing, none of them shall
have any right or remedy to take  any action in respect of,   59    and
none of them shall have any liability to the other in respect of, any  breach
by the Company, Behrman Capital, Behrman, Parent or MergerCo, as  applicable,
of any representations or warranties contained herein or any  failure to
comply with any of the covenants, conditions or agreements  contained herein,
except (i) to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  Section 10.1 hereof, in
which event, no party shall thereupon have  obligation or liability to the
parties whatsoever hereunder (ii) to seek  specific performance or injunctive
relief and (iii) any cause of action or  liability for fraud.   (b) From
and after the Closing, the rights of the parties to  indemnification relating
to this Agreement or the transactions  contemplated hereby shall be strictly
limited to those contained in this  Article IX, and such indemnification
rights shall be the sole and  exclusive remedies of the parties subsequent to
the Closing Date with  respect to any matter in any way relating to this
Agreement or arising in  connection herewith. To the maximum extent permitted
by law, the parties  hereby waive all other rights and remedies with respect
to any matter in  any way relating to this Agreement or arising in connection
herewith,  whether under any laws at common law or otherwise. Except as
provided in  this Article IX, no claim, action or remedy shall be brought or
maintained  by any party against any other party, and no recourse shall be
brought or  granted against any of them, by virtue of or based upon any
alleged  misstatement or omission respecting an inaccuracy in or breach of
any of  the representations, warranties or covenants of any of the parties
hereto  set forth or contained in this Agreement, except to the extent set
forth  in Section 11.11; provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything to
the  contrary in this Agreement, no party waives any rights to pursue a
claim  for fraud or any remedy therefor or to seek specific performance for
a  breach of a covenant or agreement to be performed by it before or after 
the Effective Time.   ARTICLE X - TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER  
SECTION 10.1. TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Effective Time, whether before or after the execution of the Written
Consent:   (a) by the mutual written consent of Parent (on behalf of 
itself and MergerCo) and the Company;   (b) by either of the Company, on the
one hand, or Parent (on  behalf of itself and MergerCo), on the other hand,
by written notice to  the other:   (i) if any Governmental Authority of
competent  jurisdiction shall have issued an injunction or taken any other 
action that permanently restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits  the
consummation of the Merger, and such injunction shall have  become final and
non-appealable; or   60    (ii) if the consummation of the Merger shall
not have  occurred on or before the 60th day following the date of this 
Agreement; provided, however, that (A) subject to clause (i) above,  such
date shall automatically be extended in the event that any  request for
additional information is pending on such date in  connection with the
required approval under the HSR Act to the date  on which such approval is
granted and (B) the right to terminate  this Agreement under this Section
10.1(b)(ii) shall not be available  to any party whose failure to comply with
any provision of this  Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of the  Merger to occur on or before such date.   (c) by the
Company, if the Company is not then in material  breach of any term of this
Agreement, upon written notice to Parent, upon  a material breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of Parent or  MergerCo contained in this
Agreement, provided that such breach is not  capable of being cured or has
not been cured within thirty (30) days after  the giving of notice thereof by
the Company to Parent such that the  conditions set forth in Sections 8.1 or
8.3 cannot be satisfied at or  prior to the date set forth in Section
10.1(b)(ii); or   (d) by Parent (on behalf of itself and MergerCo), if
neither  Parent nor MergerCo is then in material breach of any term of this 
Agreement, upon written notice to Company, upon a material breach of any 
representation, warranty or covenant of the Company contained in this 
Agreement, provided that such breach is not capable of being cured or has 
not been cured within thirty (30) days after the giving of notice thereof  by
Parent or MergerCo to the Company such that the conditions set forth in 
Sections 8.1 and 8.2 cannot be satisfied at or prior to the date set forth 
in Section 10.1(b)(ii).   SECTION 10.2. EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event
of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1, this Agreement
shall forthwith become null and void and have no effect, without any
liability on the part of Parent, MergerCo or the Company and their respective
directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members or stockholders
and all rights and obligations of any party hereto shall cease, except for
the agreements contained in Sections 7.3, 7.5, Section 9.5(a), this Section
10.2 and Article XI; provided, however, that nothing contained in this
Section 10.2 shall relieve any party from liabilities or damages arising out
of any willful breach by such party of this Agreement.   SECTION 10.3.
AMENDMENT. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto at any
time before or after the execution of the Written Consent; provided, however,
that after the execution of the Written Consent, no amendment shall be made
that by law requires further approval by the stockholders without obtaining
the approval of the Stockholders\' Representative.   SECTION 10.4.
EXTENSION; WAIVER. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the  
61   performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in a written instrument signed on behalf of the party against which such
waiver or extension is to be enforced. Waiver of any term or condition of
this Agreement by a party shall not be construed as a waiver of any
subsequent breach or waiver of the same term or condition by such party, or a
waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement by such party.
