**AGREEMENT  AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION**

 

 

**THIS  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION** (the  " ** _Agreement_** ") 
is  made and entered into as of this 5th  day of  February, 2007, by and

BANK OF THE SOUTH** ,  a  Georgia bank with its main office in

**WHEREAS** ,  the  respective boards of directors of GCG and United deem it
advisable and in the  best interests of each such entity and their respective
shareholders that GCG  merge with United (the " ** _Merger_** "),  with 
United being the surviving corporation, in a transaction valued at $216.6 
million based on the thirty (30) day average closing price for United's
common  stock, $1.00 par value per share, (" ** _United  Stock_** ")  of 
$32.35 as of February 2, 2007, consisting of a combination of United Stock 
and  cash. The Merger is conditioned upon the terms and conditions
hereinafter set  forth (including, without limitation, the purchase price
adjustment provision  of  _Article  XI_ )  and as  set forth in the
Agreement and Plan of Merger attached hereto as _Exhibit  A_   and 
incorporated herein by reference (the " ** _Merger  Agreement_** ");  and 

 

 

**WHEREAS,**   the  respective boards of directors of GCG and United deem it
advisable and in the  best interests of each such entity and their respective
shareholders that the  Bank merge with United's Georgia banking subsidiary,
United Community Bank  (" ** _UCB  Georgia_** "),  with  UCB Georgia being
the surviving bank (the " ** _Bank  Merger_** "),  all  upon the terms
hereinafter set forth and as set forth in the Agreement and  Plan  of Merger
attached hereto as _Exhibit  B_   and  incorporated herein by reference
(the " ** _Bank  Merger Agreement_** ");  and

 

 

**WHEREAS,**   the  boards of directors of the respective entities believe
that the merger of GCG  and United and their subsidiary banks and the
operating effectiveness and  synergies produced thereby will enhance and
strengthen the franchises and future  prospects of both companies and each of
the banks;

 

 

**NOW,  THEREFORE** ,  for and  in consideration of the premises and the
mutual covenants and agreements herein  contained, and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy  of which as legally
sufficient consideration are hereby acknowledged, the  parties hereto agree
as follows:

the manner set forth in the Bank Merger  Agreement.

 

 

**2.2 ****_Payment  of Purchase Price_**. **** Pursuant  to the terms and

those then currently provided by United to its other similarly situated 
employees. No GCG Employee shall be provided vacation benefits at a level
less  than he or she had attained with GCG immediately prior to the Closing

Employee Benefit  plans with respect to those GCG Employees whose waiting
periods had commenced  under any such plans prior to the Closing Date. United

under United's Employee  Benefit plans, to the extent such restrictions or
limitations would not apply  to  the GCG Employees under GCG's existing
Employee Benefit plans.

amount credited to their accounts under the Gwinnett Commercial Group, Inc. 
401(k) and

Employee  Stock Ownership Plan (" ** _GCG  401(k) Plan_** ")  through a
rollover contribution into either the United Community Banks, Inc.  Profit
Sharing Plan (the " ** _United  401(k) Plan_** ")  or a  separate third
party individual retirement account, or to take a cash  distribution from the
GCG 401(k) Plan, _provided,  that_   GCG's  Board of Directors shall adopt
resolutions to terminate the GCG 401(k) Plan  prior to the Closing Date. For
purposes of any vesting determinations (but  not  benefit accruals) in
connection with the United 401(k) Plan, service with GCG  prior to the
Closing Date shall be counted. For purposes of eligibility to  participate in
any "Profit Sharing Contribution" or receive any "Matching  Contribution"
(each as defined in the United 401(k) Plan) under the United  401(k) Plan,
the one (1) year waiting period in the United 401(k) Plan shall  be  applied
to all GCG Employees and only compensation earned for periods after  the 
Closing Date shall be counted; _provided,  that_ the  GCG  Employees' prior
service with GCG shall also be credited for purposes of such  waiting periods
under the United 401(k) Plan. For calendar year 2007, prior  to  the Closing
Date GCG shall make any necessary employer contributions to the  GCG  401(k)
Plan due such GCG Employees for compensation paid by GCG during calendar 
year 2007.

 

 

**3.13 ****_Directors  and Officers Insurance Coverage_**. **** Prior  to 
Closing, GCG shall purchase for, and on behalf of, its current and former 
officers and directors, extended coverage under the current directors' and 
officers' liability insurance policy maintained by GCG to provide for 
continued coverage of such insurance for a period of three (3) years from
the  Closing Date, unless United's directors' and officers' liability
insurance  policy provides for coverage for such former officers and
directors for actions  taken prior to the Merger.

 

 

**3.14 ****_Governance  of United_**. **** Following  the Closing Date,
United shall take all action necessary to (i) increase  the size of United's
Board of Directors from 11 members to 12 members, and  (ii) cause John D.
Stephens to be named as a director of  United.

has it maintained  or contributed to, an employee pension benefit plan as
defined in Section 3(2)  of ERISA that is or was subject to Title IV of
ERISA.

 

 

(d) Each  ERISA Plan has been operated and administered in accordance with,
and has been  amended to comply in all material respects with (unless such
amendment is not  yet required), all applicable laws, rules and regulations,
including, without  limitation, ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code (the " **
_Code_** "),  and  the regulations issued under ERISA and the Code. With
respect to each ERISA  Plan, other than routine claims for benefits submitted
in the ordinary course  of  the benefits process, no litigation or
administrative or other proceeding is  pending or, to the knowledge of GCG,
threatened involving such ERISA Plan or  any  of its fiduciaries. With
respect to each ERISA Plan, neither GCG nor any of  its  directors,
officers, employees or agents, nor any " _party  in interest_ " or  "
_disqualified  person_ " (as  such terms are defined in Section 3(14) of
ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code)  has been engaged in or been a party to
any transaction relating to the ERISA  Plan which would constitute a breach
of fiduciary duty under ERISA or a " _prohibited  transaction_ " (as  such
term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code),  unless
such transaction is specifically permitted under

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-18  -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Sections  407 or 408 of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code or a class or
administrative  exemption issued by the Department of Labor. Each ERISA Plan
that is a group  health plan within the meaning of Section 607(l) of ERISA
and Section 4980B  of  the Code is in material compliance with the
continuation coverage requirements  of Section 501 of ERISA and Section 4980B
of the Code.

 

 

(e) Of  the  ERISA Plans, only the GCG 401(k) Plan is an " _employee 
pension benefit plan_ " within  the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA. With
respect to the GCG 401(k) Plan,  except as set forth on the Disclosure
Memorandum: (i) the GCG 401(k) Plan  constitutes a qualified plan within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code  and the trust is exempt from federal
income tax under Section 501(a) of the  Code; (ii) the GCG 401(k) Plan has
been maintained and operated in compliance  in  all material respects with
all applicable provisions of Sections 409 and 4975  of  the Code and
Sections 406 and 408 of ERISA and the regulations and rulings  thereunder;
(iii) all contributions required by such plan have been made or  will  be
made on a timely basis; and (iv) no termination, partial termination or 
discontinuance of contributions has occurred without a determination by the 
IRS  that such action does not affect the tax-qualified status of such 
plan.

 

 

(f) As  of the  Closing Date, with respect to each ERISA Plan, GCG will have
provided adequate  reserves, or insurance or qualified trust funds, to
provide for all payments  and  contributions required, or reasonably
expected to be required, to be made under  the provisions of such ERISA Plan
or required to be made under applicable laws,  rules and regulations, with
respect to any period prior to the Closing Date  to  the extent reserves are
required under GAAP, based on an actuarial valuation  satisfactory to the
actuaries of GCG representing a projection of claims  expected to be incurred
under such ERISA Plan.

 

 

(g) Except  as  disclosed on the Disclosure Memorandum, GCG does not provide
and has no  obligation to provide benefits, including, without limitation,
death, health  or  medical benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to
current or former  employees of GCG beyond their retirement or other
termination of service with  GCG other than: (i) coverage mandated by
applicable Law; (ii) benefits under  the  GCG 401(k) Plan; or (iii) benefits
the full cost of which is borne by the  current or former employee or his
beneficiary.

 

 

(h) Except  as  set forth in the Disclosure Memorandum, neither this
Agreement nor any  transaction contemplated hereby will: (i) entitle any
current or former  employee, officer or director of GCG to severance pay,
unemployment compensation  or any similar or other payment, (ii) accelerate
the time of payment or vesting  of, or increase the amount of compensation or
benefits due any such employee,  officer or director, or (iii) cause the
payment of any "excess parachute  payment" (as defined in Section 280G of the
Code).

 

 

(i) Each  plan  or agreement listed pursuant to _Section  4.5.2_   that
is  subject to Section 409A of the Code has been administered and operated
in  compliance, in all material respects, with Section 409A and the
regulations  and  rulings thereunder.

 

 

**4.5.3   ****_Employment  and Labor Matters_**.  Except  as described in
the Disclosure Memorandum, GCG is not, and has not been, a  party  to any
collective bargaining agreement or

agreement  of any kind with any union or labor organization or to any
agreement with any  of  its employees which is not terminable at will or
upon ninety (90) days notice  at  the election of, and without cost or
penalty to, GCG. GCG has not received  at  any time in the past five (5)
years, any demand for recognition from any union,  and no attempt has been
made, or will have been made as of the Closing Date,  to  organize any of
its employees. GCG has complied in all material respects with  all
obligations under the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, the Age 
Discrimination in Employment Act, as amended, and all other federal, state 
and  local labor laws and regulations applicable to employees. Except as
described  in  the Disclosure Memorandum, (i) there are no unfair labor
practice charges  pending or threatened against GCG, and (ii) there are, and
in the past three  (3)  years there have been, no charges, complaints,
claims or proceedings, pending,  threatened against, or involving, as the
case may be, GCG with respect to any  alleged violation of any wage and hour
laws, age discrimination act laws,  employment discrimination laws or any
other claims arising out of any employment  relationship as to any of GCG's
employees or as to any person seeking employment  therefrom, and no such
violations exist.

 

 

**4.5.4   ****_Related  Party Transactions_**.  Except  for: (a) loans and
extensions of credit made on substantially the same terms,  including
interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for 
comparable transactions by GCG with other persons who are not affiliated
with  GCG, and which do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or
present  other unfavorable features; (b) deposits, all of which are on terms
and  conditions identical to those made available to all customers of GCG at
the  time  such deposits were entered into; and (c) transactions
specifically described  in  the Disclosure Memorandum, there are no
contracts with or commitments to present  or former five percent (5%) or
greater shareholders, directors, officers, or  employees involving the
expenditure of more than $60,000 as to any one  individual, including with
respect to any business directly or indirectly  controlled by any such
person, or $100,000 for all such contracts or commitments  in the aggregate
for all such individuals (other than contracts or commitments  relating to
services to be performed by any officer, director or employee as  a

As  an  inducement to GCG to enter into this Agreement and to consummate
the  transactions contemplated hereby, United represents, warrants, covenants
and  agrees as follows:

 

 

**6.1 ****_Corporate  Status_**. **** United  is  a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the  laws of the State
of Georgia. United is entitled to own or lease its properties  and to carry
on its business in the places where such properties are now owned,  leased or
operated and such business is now conducted.

 

 

**6.2 ****_Authority_**.  Subject  to the required regulatory approvals and
notice filing, as stated in  _Section  4.6.1_ ,  and the  approval of GCG
shareholders, the execution, delivery and performance of this  Agreement and
the other transactions contemplated or required in connection  herewith will
not, with or without the giving of notice or the passage of time,  or both:

 

 

(a) violate  any provision of federal or state law applicable to United, the
violation of  which could be reasonably expected to have an adverse effect on
the business,  operations, properties, assets, financial condition or
prospects of  United;

 

 

(b) violate  any provision of the articles of incorporation or bylaws of
United;

 

 

(c) conflict  with or result in a breach of any provision of, or termination
of, or constitute  a default under any instrument, license, agreement, or
commitment to which  United is a party, which, singly or in the aggregate,
could reasonably be  expected to have an adverse effect on the business,
operations, properties,  assets, financial condition or prospects of United;
or

 

 

(d) constitute  a violation of any order, judgment or decree to which United
is a party, or  by  which United or any of its assets or properties are
bound.

 

 

Assuming  this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding obligation of GCG,
this  Agreement constitutes the valid and binding obligation of United, and
is  enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as limited by laws
affecting  creditors' rights generally and by the discretion of courts to
compel specific  performance.

share,  of  which 42,990,645 shares are issued and outstanding as of the
date hereof,  exclusive of 33,834 shares issuable to participants in United's
Deferred  Compensation Plan and 1,436,362 shares reserved for issuance upon
the exercise  of outstanding options and vesting of restricted stock (the "

shareholders.

 

 

(b) Except  for the United Stock Options and Awards, United does not have
outstanding any  securities which are either by their terms or by contract
convertible or  exchangeable into United Stock or Preferred Stock, or any
other securities  or  debt, of United, or any preemptive or similar rights
to subscribe for or to  purchase, or any options or warrants or agreements or
understandings for the  purchase or the issuance (contingent or otherwise)
of, or any calls, commitments  or claims of any character relating to, its
capital stock or securities  convertible into its capital stock. United is
not subject to any obligation  (contingent or otherwise) to repurchase or

securities or debt,  of United, which have been purchased or redeemed by
United have been purchased  or redeemed in accordance with all applicable
federal, state and local laws,  rules, and regulations, including, without
limitation, all federal and state  securities laws and rules and regulations
of any securities exchange or system  on which such stock, securities or debt
are, or at such time were, traded,  and  no such purchase or redemption has
resulted or will, with the giving of notice  or lapse of time, or both,

any agreement, note, mortgage, bond, security  agreement, loan agreement or
other contract or commitment of  United.

" ** _Peer  11.8(a) Variation "_**),  subject to the following provisions of
this _Section  11.8(a)_.  If GCG  elects to exercise its termination right
pursuant to the immediately preceding  sentence, it shall give prompt written
notice of such election to United. During  the Decision Period, United may
elect to adjust the Merger Consideration by  paying additional shares of

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-33  -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

United  Stock and/or cash, as determined by United in its sole discretion, by
increasing  the Stock Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Merger Agreement)
and/or the Cash  Exchange Rate (as defined in the Merger Agreement) as
necessary to cause the  Merger Consideration to be increased by the result
determined by subtracting  the  Stock Consideration from the product of the
Stock Consideration multiplied  by  the factor equal to 1.00 plus the lesser
of (i) the United Decrease minus 1.10  or (ii) the United Decrease minus the
Peer 11.8(a) Variation. Such adjustment,  if any, shall be reflected in the
payment of the adjusted Merger Consideration  as provided in accordance with
the Merger Agreement. If United decides to make  such adjustment within the
Decision Period, it shall give prompt written notice  to GCG of such
adjustment, whereupon GCG shall have no right to terminate the  Agreement
pursuant to this _Section  11.8(a)_   and this  Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms. 

 

 

(b) If  the  Average Closing Price of United is greater than $32.33, during
the Election  Period United may elect to adjust the Merger Consideration if
the United Change  minus 1.00 (the " ** _United  Increase_** ")  is 
greater than 0.10 and the United Increase is greater than the Peer Change
minus  1.00 (the **_" Peer  11.8(b) Variation_**"),  subject to the
following provisions of this _Section  11.8(b)_.  If  United elects to
adjust the Merger Consideration pursuant to the immediately  preceding
sentence, United shall give prompt written notice of such election  to  GCG,
and this Agreement may be terminated prior to the Closing Date by GCG.  If 
United makes an election under this _Section  11.8(b)_ ,  United  may
adjust the Merger Consideration by paying less shares of United Stock and/or 
cash, as determined by United in its sole discretion, by decreasing the
Stock  Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and/or the Cash
Exchange  Rate (as defined in the Merger Agreement) as necessary to cause the
Merger  Consideration to be decreased by the result determined by subtracting
from  the  Stock Consideration the product of the Stock Consideration
multiplied by the  factor equal to 1.00 minus the lesser of (i) the United
Increase minus 0.10  or  (ii) the United Increase minus the Peer 11(b)
Variation. Such adjustment, if  any, shall be reflected in the payment of the
adjusted Merger Consideration  as  provided in accordance with the Merger
Agreement. If United does not decide  to  make such adjustment within the
Election Period, GCG shall have no right to  terminate the Agreement pursuant
to this _Section  11.8(b)_   and this  Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect in accordance with its terms.
