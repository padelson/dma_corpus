AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "Agreement") is dated as of the 30th
day of November, 2016, by and between CenterState Banks, Inc., a Florida
corporation ("CenterState"), and Gateway Financial Holdings of Florida, Inc. a
Florida corporation ("GFHF" and, together with CenterState, the "Parties" and
each a "Party"). 

 

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Parties have determined that it is in
the best interests of their respective companies and their respective
shareholders to consummate the business combination transaction provided for
in this Agreement in which GFHF will, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge with and into CenterState (the
"Merger"), with CenterState as the surviving company in the Merger (sometimes
referred to in such capacity as the "Surviving Company");

 

WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of CenterState to enter into this
Agreement, all of the directors of GFHF have entered into voting agreements
(each a "Voting Agreement"), substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit A, dated as of the date hereof, with CenterState, pursuant to which
each such director has agreed, among other things, to vote all of the GFHF
Common Stock owned by such director in favor of the approval of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, subject to the terms of the Voting
Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger; and

 

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and this Agreement
is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization for purposes of
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, the Parties agree as
follows: 

 

ARTICLE I 
THE MERGER

 

1.1The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the Florida Business Corporation Act (the "FBCA"), at the
Effective Time, GFHF shall merge with and into CenterState. CenterState shall
be the Surviving Company in the Merger and shall continue its existence as a
corporation under the laws of the State of Florida. As of the Effective Time,
the separate corporate existence of GFHF shall cease. 

 

1.2Effective Time. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
simultaneously with the Closing, the Parties shall execute, and CenterState
shall cause to be filed with the Department of State of the State of Florida
and the Secretary of State of the State of

   

Florida, articles of merger as provided in the FBCA (the "Articles of
Merger"). The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Articles of
Merger are filed or such other time as may be specified in such Articles of
Merger (the "Effective Time"); provided, however, that the Effective Time
shall occur no earlier than April 1, 2017.

 

1.3Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in the FBCA. 

 

1.4Conversion of Stock. By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of GFHF, CenterState or the holders of any of the following securities,
at the Effective Time:

 

(a)CenterState Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of CenterState ("CenterState Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01, of the
Surviving Company. 

 

(b)Treatment of GFHF Common Stock. Subject to Sections 1.4(c), 1.4(d), 1.4(e),
1.4(f), and 8.1(a)(viii) and any applicable withholding Tax, at the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Parties or holders of any securities of GFHF or of CenterState, each share of
common stock, par value $5.00 per share, of GFHF (the "GFHF Common Stock")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any
Cancelled Shares and any Dissenting Shares (collectively, the "Exchangeable
Shares" and each an "Exchangeable Share") shall be automatically converted
into the right to receive, at the election of the holder thereof in accordance
with, and subject to, the terms, conditions and procedures set forth in this
Article I (including the proration procedures in Section 1.4(c)), the
following consideration (collectively, the "Merger Consideration"), in each
case without interest: (i) (such election, a "Cash Election") $18.00 in cash
(the "Cash Election Consideration"), or (ii) (such election, a "Stock
Election") 0.95 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of
CenterState Common Stock (such number of shares of CenterState Common Stock,
the "Stock Election Consideration"). From and after the Effective Time, all
such GFHF shares of Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each applicable
holder of such shares of GFHF Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor
upon the surrender of such shares of GFHF Common Stock in accordance with
Article II, including the right to receive, pursuant to Section 2.2(g), cash
in lieu of fractional shares of CenterState Common Stock, if any, into which
such shares have been converted pursuant to this Section 1.4(b), together with
the amounts, if any, payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d).

 

(c)Election and Proration Procedures.

 

(i)An election form in such form as CenterState shall reasonably specify and
as shall be reasonably acceptable to GFHF (the "Election Form") shall be
mailed on a date to be mutually agreed by the Parties that is not more than
forty-five (45) days nor less than thirty (30) days prior to the anticipated
Closing Date or on such other date as the Parties shall mutually agree (the
"Mailing Date") to each holder of record of GFHF Common Stock as of the close
of business on the fifth (5th) Business Day prior to the Mailing Date (the
"Election Form Record Date").

   

(ii)CenterState shall make available one or more Election Forms as may
reasonably be requested from time to time by all Persons who become holders
(or beneficial owners) of GFHF Common Stock between the Election Form Record
Date and the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Election
Deadline, and GFHF shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information
reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein.

 

(iii)Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) to specify
(y) the number of shares of such holder's GFHF Common Stock with respect to
which such holder makes a Cash Election (each such share, a "Cash Election
Share"), and (z) the number of shares of such holder's GFHF Common Stock with
respect to which such holder makes a Stock Election (each such share, a "Stock
Election Share"). Any shares of GFHF Common Stock with respect to which the
Exchange Agent has not received an effective, properly completed Election Form
(including duly executed transmittal materials included with the Election
Form), accompanied by any GFHF Certificates to which such Election Form
relates, or by an appropriate customary guaranty of delivery of the related
GFHF Certificates from a member of any registered national securities exchange
or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States, on or before 5:00
p.m., Eastern Time, on the twenty-fifth (25th) day following the Mailing Date
(or such other time and date as the Parties shall agree) (the "Election
Deadline") (other than shares of GFHF Common Stock to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 1.4(d) and other than Dissenting Shares) shall be
deemed to be "No Election Shares," and the holders of such No Election Shares
shall be deemed to have made a Stock Election with respect to such No Election
Shares, subject to the proration procedure in subsection (iv) below. The
Parties shall cooperate to issue a press release reasonably satisfactory to
each of them announcing the date of the Election Deadline not more than
fifteen (15) Business Days before, and at least five (5) Business Days prior
to, the Election Deadline.

 

(iv)Not later than ten (10) Business Days after the Election Deadline, unless
the Effective Time has not yet occurred, in which case as soon after the
Effective Time as is reasonably practicable, CenterState shall cause the
Exchange Agent to effect the following prorations to the Merger Consideration:

 

(A)If the Cash Election Amount is greater than the Available Cash Election
Amount, then each Cash Election Share shall, instead of being converted into
the Cash Election Consideration, be converted into the right to receive (1) an
amount of cash (without interest) equal to the product of the Cash Election
Consideration, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
Available Cash Election Amount and the denominator of which shall be the Cash
Election Amount (such fraction, the "Cash Fraction"), and (2) a number of
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of CenterState Common
Stock equal to the product of the Stock Election Consideration multiplied by a
fraction equal to one (1) minus the Cash Fraction.

 

(B)If the Available Cash Election Amount is greater than the Cash Election
Amount, then (1) the Exchange Agent shall select first from among the No
Election Shares by a pro rata selection process, and then (if necessary) from
among the remaining Stock Election Shares, by a pro rata selection process, a
sufficient number of Stock Election Shares to instead receive the Cash
Election Consideration such that the Cash Election Amount equals as closely as
practicable but does not exceed the Available Cash Election Amount, and each
share

   

of GFHF Common Stock that would have been a Stock Election Share but for the
adjustment pursuant to this subsection (B) shall automatically be deemed to be
a Cash Election Share; (2) each Cash Election Share shall be converted into
the right to receive the Cash Election Consideration; and (3) each Stock
Election Share remaining after the adjustment process pursuant to this
subsection (B) shall be converted into the right to receive CenterState Common
Stock pursuant to Section 1.4(b). The pro rata selection process to be used
by the Exchange Agent shall consist of such equitable proration processes that
shall be mutually determined by CenterState and GFHF before the Effective
Time.

 

(v)Any election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall
have actually received a properly completed Election Form (including duly
executed transmittal materials included with the Election Form), accompanied
by any GFHF Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to which such Election Form
relates, or by an appropriate customary guaranty of delivery of the related
GFHF Certificates from a member of any registered national securities exchange
or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States, by the Election
Deadline. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the authorized Person
properly submitting such Election Form, by written notice received by the
Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form
is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of GFHF Common Stock
represented by such Election Form shall become No Election Shares, except to
the extent a subsequent election is properly made with respect to any or all
of such shares of GFHF Common Stock prior to the Election Deadline. Subject to
the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall
have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or
change has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in
the Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent
regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of CenterState,
GFHF, or the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any Person
of any defect in an Election Form.

 

(d)Cancelled Shares. All shares of GFHF Common Stock that are owned by GFHF
or CenterState (other than (i) shares of GFHF Common Stock held in trust
accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a
fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties
(any such shares, "Trust Account Common Shares") and (ii) shares of GFHF
Common Stock held, directly or indirectly, by GFHF or CenterState in respect
of a debt previously contracted (any such shares, "DPC Common Shares")) shall
be cancelled and shall cease to exist (any such shares, the "Cancelled
Shares"), and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

 

(e)Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of GFHF Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a shareholder
who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and
who is entitled to demand and properly demands the fair value of such shares
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Sections
607.1301 to 607.1333 of the FBCA (the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be
converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, but instead the holder of such Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the
provisions of Sections 607.1301 to 607.1333 of the FBCA (and at the Effective
Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist), unless and until such
holder shall have failed to perfect such holder's right to

   

receive, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to demand or
receive, the fair value of such shares of GFHF Common Stock under such
provisions of the FBCA. If any shareholder dissenting pursuant to Sections
607.1301 to 607.1333 of the FBCA and this Section 1.4(d) shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such holder's
shares of GFHF Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as if they had been
converted into and become Exchangeable Shares as of the Effective Time,
eligible to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section
1.4(b), without any interest thereon. GFHF shall give CenterState (i) prompt
notice of any written notices to exercise dissenters' rights in respect of any
shares of GFHF Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such notices and any
other instruments served pursuant to the FBCA and received by GFHF relating to
dissenters' rights and (ii) the opportunity to participate in negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for fair value under the FBCA. GFHF shall
not, except with the prior written consent of CenterState, voluntarily make
any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such
demand for payment. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to
the Exchange Agent pursuant to Article II to pay for shares of GFHF Common
Stock for which dissenters' rights have been perfected shall be returned to
CenterState upon demand. 

 

(f)Share Adjustment. If the number of shares of CenterState Common Stock or
GFHF Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a stock split, stock combination, stock dividend or similar
recapitalization with respect to such stock, and the record date therefor
shall be prior to the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration shall be
proportionately adjusted as necessary to preserve the relative economic
benefit to the Parties.

 

(g)Entitlement to Merger Consideration. All of the Exchangeable Shares of
GFHF Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time,
and each certificate previously representing any such shares of GFHF Common
Stock (each, a "Certificate") and non-certificated shares of GFHF Common Stock
represented by book-entry ("Book-Entry Shares") shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which the shares of
GFHF Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares have
been converted pursuant to this Section 1.4.

 

1.5Stock Options. Each valid option to purchase shares of GFHF Common Stock
(each, a "GFHF Stock Option"), outstanding and unexercised immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, become fully vested and
be converted into an option to purchase that number of shares of CenterState
Common Stock as shall equal the product obtained by multiplying the Stock
Election Consideration (the "Option Exchange Ratio") by that number of shares
of GFHF Common Stock which such option entitled the holder thereof to purchase
(rounded to the nearest whole share), and at an exercise price equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing the exercise price per share of the GFHF Stock
Option by the Option Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest cent); provided
however, that in the event that the Merger Consideration is modified as a
result of the application of Section 1.4(f), then the Option Exchange Ratio
shall be appropriately adjusted in order to reflect the impact of such
modification to the Merger Consideration. 

 

1.6Incorporation Documents and Bylaws of the Surviving Company. At the
Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of CenterState in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the articles of incorporation
of the Surviving Company until thereafter

   

amended in accordance with applicable law. The bylaws of CenterState in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Company until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law
and the terms of such bylaws. 

 

1.7Directors and Officers. The directors of the Surviving Company immediately
following the Effective Time shall consist of the directors of CenterState
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and such directors shall hold office
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their
earlier death, resignation or removal. The officers of the Surviving Company
immediately following the Effective Time shall consist of the officers of the
CenterState immediately prior to the Effective Time, and such officers shall
hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified,
or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

 

1.8The Bank Merger. Except as provided below, immediately after the Effective
Time and sequentially but in effect simultaneously on the Closing Date,
Gateway Bank of Florida ("GBF"), Gateway Bank of Central Florida ("GBCF") and
Gateway Bank of Southwest Florida ("GBSW"), each a Florida state-chartered
bank and wholly owned first-tier subsidiary of GFHF, shall be merged (the
"Bank Merger") with and into CenterState Bank of Florida, N.A., a national
banking association and wholly owned first-tier subsidiary of CenterState
("CenterState Bank of Florida, N.A." or "CenterState Bank, N.A."), in
accordance with the provisions of applicable federal and state banking laws
and regulations, and CenterState Bank, N.A. shall be the surviving bank (the
"Surviving Bank"). GFHF, GBF, GBCF, and GBSW are collectively referred to as
the "GBF Entities" and GBF, GBCF, and GBSW are collectively referred to as the
"GBF Banks". The Bank Merger shall have the effects as set forth under
applicable federal and state banking laws and regulations, and the Boards of
Directors of the Parties shall cause the Boards of Directors of GBF, GBCF,
GBSW and CenterState Bank, N.A., respectively, to approve a separate merger
agreement (the "Bank Merger Agreement") in substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B, and cause the Bank Merger Agreement to be executed and
delivered as soon as practicable following the date of execution of this
Agreement. Each of CenterState and GFHF also shall approve the Bank Merger
Agreement in their capacities as sole shareholders of CenterState Bank, N.A.
and the GBF Banks, respectively. The directors of the Surviving Bank
immediately following the Effective Time shall consist of the directors of
CenterState Bank, N.A. immediately prior to the Effective Time, and such
directors shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal. The officers
of the Surviving Bank immediately following the Effective Time shall consist
of the officers of CenterState Bank, N.A. immediately prior to the Effective
Time, plus such officers of the GBF Banks hired by CenterState, N.A. in the
Bank Merger, and such officers shall hold office until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified or their earlier death, resignation
or removal. As provided in the Bank Merger Agreement, the Bank Merger may be
abandoned at the election of CenterState Bank, N.A. at any time, whether

ARTICLE II 

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

 

2.1Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, CenterState shall appoint its
transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, pursuant to an
agreement (the "Exchange Agent Agreement") to act as exchange agent (the
"Exchange Agent") hereunder. 

 

2.2Delivery of Merger Consideration. 

 

(a) At or before the Effective Time, CenterState shall deposit, or shall cause
to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent stock certificates representing the
number of shares of CenterState Common Stock and cash sufficient to deliver
the Merger Consideration payable under the terms hereof (together with, to the
extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of shares of CenterState
Common Stock as set forth in Section 2.2(g) in accordance with this Article
II), and CenterState shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay such
consideration in accordance with this Agreement.

 

(b)Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five (5)
Business Days after the Closing Date, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of GFHF Common Stock whose shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 1.4(b), including any cash in lieu of fractional shares of CenterState
Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any dividends
or distributions to which such holder is entitled, (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to each Certificate shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificate
(or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificate)) to the Exchange Agent and
which shall be substantially in such form and have such other provisions as
shall be prescribed by the Exchange Agent Agreement (the "Letter of
Transmittal") and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering a Certificate in
exchange for the Merger Consideration to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor. 

 

(c)Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate or Certificates,
accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a holder of GFHF
Common Stock will be entitled to receive promptly after the Effective Time the
Merger Consideration, including any dividends that are payable to CenterState
shareholders of record as of any date on or after the Closing Date and cash in
lieu of fractional shares of CenterState Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor in respect of the shares of GFHF Common Stock
represented by its Certificate or Certificates. Until so surrendered, each
such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes,
only the right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration,
including any cash in lieu of fractional shares of CenterState Common Stock to
be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate
and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to Section 1.4(b), in accordance with the provisions of this Article II. 

 

(d)Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.4(b), no dividends or other
distributions with respect to CenterState Common Stock shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of
CenterState Common Stock represented

   

thereby, in each case unless and until the surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
payable with respect to the whole shares of CenterState Common Stock
represented by such Certificate and not paid or (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with
respect to shares of CenterState Common Stock represented by such Certificate
with a record date after the Effective Time (but before such surrender date)
and with a payment date subsequent to the issuance of the CenterState Common
Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares.

 

(e)In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing GFHF
Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of GFHF, the
shares of CenterState Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of
CenterState Common Stock comprising the Merger Consideration shall be issued
or paid in exchange therefor to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate formerly
representing such GFHF Common Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment or issuance
shall pay any transfer or other similar taxes required by reason of the
payment or issuance to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of CenterState that the tax has
been paid or is not applicable. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the
earlier of (x) the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time and (y) the
expiration or termination of the Exchange Agent Agreement, CenterState) shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash consideration or cash in lieu
of fractional shares of CenterState Common Stock otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of GFHF Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange
Agent or CenterState, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold
under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law, with
respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so
withheld by the Exchange Agent or CenterState, as the case may be, and timely
paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of shares of GFHF Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or CenterState, as the case may be. 

 

(f)After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer
books of GFHF of the shares of GFHF Common Stock that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle
transfers of GFHF Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented
for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
CenterState Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II. 

 

(g)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
fractional shares of CenterState Common Stock shall be issued or upon the
surrender of Certificates for exchange, no dividend or distribution with
respect to CenterState Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any
fractional share, and such fractional share interests

   

shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
shareholder of CenterState. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional
share, CenterState shall pay to each former shareholder of GFHF who otherwise
would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded
to the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying (i) the Average Closing
Stock Price by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all
shares of GFHF Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and
rounded to the nearest one thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of
CenterState Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 1.4. 

 

(h)In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, mutilated or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed and, if reasonably
required by CenterState or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a
bond in such amount as CenterState may determine is reasonably necessary as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen,
mutilated or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA. Neither GFHF, nor its Subsidiaries, nor to
the Knowledge of GFHF, any administrator or fiduciary of any of its or its
Subsidiaries' Benefit Plans (or any agent of any of the foregoing), has
engaged in any transaction, or acted or failed to act in any manner with
respect to any of its Benefit Plans that could subject it to any direct or
indirect Liability (by indemnity or otherwise) for breach of any fiduciary,
co-fiduciary, or other duty under ERISA. No oral or written representation or
communication with respect to any aspect of the Benefit Plans of GFHF or its
Subsidiaries has been made to employees of GFHF or any of its Subsidiaries
that is not in conformity with the written or otherwise preexisting terms and
provisions of such plans.

Section 4980B or other applicable Law.

 

(vii)Except as Previously Discussed, no Benefit Plan exists and there are no
other Contracts, plans, or arrangements (written or otherwise) to which GFHF
or its Subsidiaries is a party covering any employee of GFHF or its
Subsidiaries that, individually or collectively, as a result of the execution
of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (whether alone or in connection with any other event(s)), would
reasonably be expected to, (A) result in any material severance pay upon any
termination of employment, (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or
result in any material payment or material funding (through a grantor trust or
otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, materially increase the amount
payable, require the security of material benefits under or result in any
other material obligation pursuant to, any such Company Plans, contracts,
plans, or arrangements, or (C) result in the payment of any amount that would,
individually or in combination with any other such payment, result in the loss
of a deduction under Code Section 280G or be subject to an excise tax under
Section 4999 of the Code.

(as defined for purposes of Code Section 409A) is in documentary compliance
with, and has been operated and administered in compliance with Code Section
409A and the applicable guidance issued thereunder, and no Benefit Plan
provides any compensation or benefits which could subject, or have subjected,
a covered service provider to gross income inclusion or tax

   

pursuant to Code Section 409A. Neither GFHF nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any indemnification obligation pursuant to any Benefit Plan or any Contract to

marketable title to all material real property owned by them free and clear of
all Liens, except Permitted Liens and other standard exceptions commonly found

benefit of employees who are full time employees of GFHF or any of its
Subsidiaries on the Closing Date ("Covered Employees") that provide employee
benefits and compensation opportunities which, in the aggregate, are
substantially comparable to the employee benefits and compensation
opportunities that are made available on a uniform and non-discriminatory
basis to similarly situated employees of CenterState or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable; provided, however, that in no event shall any Covered Employee be
eligible to participate in any closed or frozen plan of CenterState or its
Subsidiaries. CenterState shall give the Covered Employees full credit for
their prior service with GFHF and its Subsidiaries (i) for purposes of
eligibility (including initial participation and eligibility for current
benefits) and vesting under any qualified or non-qualified employee benefit
plan maintained by CenterState and in which Covered Employees may be eligible
to participate and (ii) for all purposes under any welfare benefit plans,
vacation plans, severance plans and similar arrangements maintained by
CenterState.

 

(b)With respect to any employee benefit plan of CenterState that is a health,
dental, vision or other welfare plan in which any Covered Employee is eligible
to participate, for the plan year in which such Covered Employee is first
eligible to participate, CenterState or its applicable Subsidiary shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause any pre-existing condition
limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such CenterState or
Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect to such Covered Employee and his or
her covered dependents to the extent such condition was or would have been
covered under the GFHF Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) recognize any
health, dental, vision or other welfare expenses incurred by such Covered
Employee and his or her covered dependents in the year that includes the
Closing Date (or, if later, the year in

   

which such Covered Employee is first eligible to participate) for purposes of
any applicable copayment, deductibles and annual out-of-pocket expense
requirements under any such health, dental, vision or other welfare plan. 

 

(c)Prior to the Effective Time, GFHF shall take, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to take, all actions requested by CenterState that may be
necessary or appropriate to (i) cause one or more GFHF Benefits Plans to
terminate as of the Effective Time, or as of the date immediately preceding
the Effective Time, (ii) cause benefit accruals and entitlements under any
GFHF Benefit Plan to cease as of the Effective Time, or as of the date
immediately preceding the Effective Time, (iii) cause the continuation on and
after the Effective Time of any contract, arrangement or insurance policy
relating to any GFHF Benefit Plan for such period as may be requested by
CenterState, or (iv) facilitate the merger of any GFHF Benefit Plan into any
employee benefit plan maintained by CenterState or an CenterState Subsidiary.
All resolutions, notices, or other documents issued, adopted or executed in
connection with the implementation of this Section 6.5(c) shall be subject to
CenterState's reasonable prior review and approval, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If CenterState requires GFHF
to terminate a medical plan having a flexible spending arrangement ("FSA")
under Code Section 125, each GBF Entity may continue its FSA through the
Effective Date.

 

(d)Nothing in this Section 6.5 shall be construed to limit the right of
CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date,
GFHF and its Subsidiaries) to amend or terminate any GFHF Benefit Plan or
other employee benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or termination is
permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, nor shall anything in this
Section 6.5 be construed to require CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries
(including, following the Closing Date, GFHF and its Subsidiaries) to retain
the employment of any particular Covered Employee for any fixed period of time
following the Closing Date, and, except as otherwise provided pursuant to
Section 7.2(e), the continued retention (or termination) by CenterState or any
of its Subsidiaries of any Covered Employee subsequent to the Effective Time
shall be subject in all events to CenterState's or its applicable Subsidiary's
normal and customary employment procedures and practices, including customary
background screening and evaluation procedures, and satisfactory employment
performance. 

 

(e)For purposes of this Agreement, "GFHF Benefit Plans" means any "employee
benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, and all other benefit
plans, arrangements or agreements, including any other employment, consulting,
bonus, incentive or deferred compensation, vacation, stock option or other
equity-based, severance, termination, retention, change of control, profit-
sharing, insurance, split-dollar insurance, fringe benefit or other similar
plan, program, agreement or commitment, whether written or unwritten, whether
or not subject to ERISA, or whether formal or informal, for the benefit of any
employee, former employee, director or former director of GFHF or any of its
Subsidiaries entered into, maintained or contributed to by GFHF or any of its
Subsidiaries or to which GFHF or any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to
contribute, or with respect to which GFHF or any of its Subsidiaries has any
liability, direct or indirect, contingent or otherwise (including any
liability arising out of an indemnification, guarantee, hold harmless or
similar agreement) or otherwise providing benefits to any current, former or
future employee, officer or director of GFHF or any of its Subsidiaries or to
any beneficiary or dependent thereof.

   

(f)If, within six (6) months after the Effective Time, any Covered Employee is
terminated by CenterState or its Subsidiaries other than "for cause" or as a
result of unsatisfactory job performance, then CenterState shall pay severance
to such Covered Employee in an amount equal to two weeks of base salary for
each twelve months of such Covered Employee's prior employment with GFHF each
GBF Bank; provided, however, that in no event will the total amount of
severance for any single Covered Employee be less than four weeks of such base
salary nor greater than twenty-six weeks of such base salary. Any severance
to which a Covered Employee may be entitled in connection with a termination
occurring more than six (6) months after the Effective Time will be as set
forth in the severance policies of CenterState and its Subsidiaries as then in
effect.

 

(g)At the Effective Time, CenterState shall assume the obligations of GFHF
under each GFHF Stock Option outstanding at the Effective Time and, except
with respect to the adjustments described in Section 1.5, each such GFHF Stock
Option shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms, including with
respect to vesting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and any provision of such
GFHF Stock Option relating to exercise of the option following termination of
employment, in the case of any option to purchase shares of CenterState Common
Stock resulting from the conversion of a GFHF Stock Option pursuant to Section
1.5 that is held by a Covered Employee who is terminated by CenterState within
twelve (12) months after the Effective Time other than "for cause", such
option shall, at the election of such Covered Employee, be redeemed by
CenterState for cash in an amount equal to the difference between the value of
such number of shares of CenterState Common Stock subject to such option at
the closing price per share of CenterState Common Stock on the immediately
preceding trading day and the exercise price of such option with respect to
such number of shares.

 

(h)At the Effective Time, all accrued and unused sick time for all employees
of GFHF and its Subsidiaries and all accrued and unused vacation time for all
employees of GFHF and its Subsidiaries shall be accorded such treatment as set
forth in Section 6.5(h) of the CSFL Disclosure Schedule. Section 6.5(h) of
the GFHF Disclosure Schedule sets forth accrued sick time payment information
as of November 18, 2016.

 

(i)Prior to the Effective Time, GFHF shall (i) cause the termination of all
salary continuation and supplemental executive retirement plans, programs and
agreements between GFHF and/or the GBF Banks and any officer or employee, and
(ii) pay all amounts due its officers, directors and employees pursuant to the
change in control provisions applicable under any GFHF Benefit Plan. Section
6.5(i) of the GFHF Disclosure Schedule sets forth all payments to be made by
GFHF pursuant to this Section 6.5(i). 

 

6.6Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance. 

 

(a)For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time,
CenterState shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, the present and former directors, officers and
employees of GFHF and its Subsidiaries and all such directors, officers and
employees of GFHF and its Subsidiaries serving as fiduciaries under any of the
respective benefit plans of the GBF Entities (the "Indemnified Parties")
against all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses
and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, settlements or
liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal,

   

administrative or investigative (each, a "Claim"), arising out of or
pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Person is or was a director,
officer, employee or fiduciary of GFHF and its Subsidiaries or any such
benefit plan or is or was serving at the request of GFHF and its Subsidiaries
as a director, officer, manager, employee, trustee or agent of any other
corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other business or non-profit enterprise (including any employee benefit plan),
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
(including with respect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement), and provide advancement of expenses to the Indemnified
Parties (provided that the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay advances if it shall be determined that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to applicable
Law). CenterState shall not take any action to limit or terminate the DandO
Insurance described in Section 6.6(d).

 

(b)In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 6.6(a), from and after
the Effective Time, CenterState shall, and shall cause CenterState Bank of
Florida, N.A. to, honor, assume and maintain in effect, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of each Indemnified Person as provided in the
respective articles of incorporation, bylaws or comparable governing documents
of GFHF and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, as in effect on the date of this
Agreement.

 

(c)Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
6.6 shall promptly notify CenterState upon learning of any Claim, provided
that failure to so notify shall not affect the obligation of CenterState under
this Section 6.6 unless, and only to the extent that, CenterState is actually
and materially prejudiced in the defense of such Claim as a consequence. In
the event of any such Claim (whether arising before or after the Effective
Time), (i) CenterState shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and
CenterState shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, unless such
Indemnified Party is advised in writing by counsel that the defense of such
Indemnified Party by CenterState would create an actual or potential conflict
of interest (in which case, CenterState shall not be obligated to reimburse or
indemnify any Indemnified Party for the expenses of more than one such
separate counsel for all Indemnified Parties, in addition to one local counsel
in the jurisdiction where defense of any Claim has been or is to be asserted),
(ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter,
(iii) CenterState shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its
prior written consent and CenterState shall not settle any Claim without such
Indemnified Party's prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and (iv) CenterState shall
have no obligation hereunder in the event that a federal or state banking
agency or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that
indemnification of an Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is
prohibited by applicable laws and regulations.

 

(d)For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, CenterState
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide director's and
officer's liability insurance ("DandO Insurance") that serves to reimburse the
present and former officers and directors of GFHF or its Subsidiaries
(determined as of the Effective Time) with respect to claims against such
directors and officers arising from facts or events occurring before the
Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated hereby), which
insurance will contain at least the same

   

coverage and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to
the Indemnified Party, as the coverage currently provided by GFHF and its
Subsidiaries; provided, however, that (i) if CenterState is unable to maintain
or obtain the insurance called for by this Section 6.6(d), then CenterState
will provide as much comparable insurance as is reasonably available, (ii)
officers and directors of GFHF or its Subsidiaries may be required to make
application and provide customary representations and warranties to the
carrier of the DandO Insurance for the purpose of obtaining such insurance, and
(iii) in satisfaction of its obligations under this Section 6.6(d),
CenterState may require GFHF to purchase, prior to but effective as of the
Effective Time, tail insurance providing such coverage prior to Closing.
Whether or not CenterState or GFHF shall procure such coverage, in no event
shall GFHF expend, or CenterState be required to expend, for such tail
insurance a premium amount in excess of an amount equal to 200% of the annual
premiums paid by GFHF for DandO Insurance in effect as of the date of this
Agreement (the "Maximum DandO Tail Premium"). If the cost of such tail
insurance exceeds the Maximum DandO Tail Premium, then GFHF or CenterState, as
applicable, shall obtain tail insurance coverage or a separate tail insurance
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the
Maximum DandO Tail Premium.

 

(e)If CenterState or any of its successors and assigns (i) shall consolidate
with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its property and assets to
any individual, corporation or other entity, then, in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of CenterState and
its Subsidiaries shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.6.

 

(f)These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to
benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her
heirs representatives or administrators. After the Effective Time, the
obligations of CenterState under this Section 6.6 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party unless
the affected Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification. If any Indemnified Party makes any claim for
indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section 6.6 that is
denied by CenterState, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that
the Indemnified Party is entitled to such indemnification or advancement of
expense, then CenterState or the Surviving Entity shall pay such Indemnified
Party's costs and expenses, including legal fees and expenses, incurred in
connection with enforcing such claim against CenterState. If any Indemnified
Party makes any claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under the
Section 6.6 that is denied by CenterState, and a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that the Indemnified Party is not entitled to such
indemnification or advancement of expense, the Indemnified Party shall pay
CenterState's or the Surviving Entity's costs and expenses, including legal
fees and expenses, incurred in connection with defending such claim against
the Indemnified Party.

 

(g)Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.6 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

   

6.7No Solicitation. 

 

(a)GFHF agrees that, except as expressly permitted by Section 6.7(b), from the
date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, it will not, and
will cause its Subsidiaries and its Subsidiaries' officers, directors, and
employees (the "GFHF Individuals") not to, and will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause GFHF's and its Subsidiaries' agents, advisors,
accountants, legal counsel, and financial advisors (the "GFHF
Representatives") not to, initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate
inquiries or proposals with respect to, or engage in any discussions or
negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or nonpublic information
or data concerning its and its Subsidiaries' business, properties or assets
("GFHF Confidential Information") to, or have any discussions with, any Person
relating to, any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that this Section
6.7 shall not prohibit any GFHF Representative from informing any Person of
the restrictions contained in this Section 6.7 (including by providing a copy
hereof to such Person) or from contacting any Person who has made an
Acquisition Proposal for the purpose of requesting clarification of the terms
and conditions thereof so as to determine whether the Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably expected to result in a Superior Proposal
(provided, as to foregoing, that GFHF shall not provide any confidential or
non-public information on GFHF or its Subsidiaries or CenterState or its
Subsidiaries). GFHF will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any Persons other than CenterState with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and will use its commercially reasonable efforts, subject
to applicable law, to enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement
relating to such an Acquisition Proposal. It is understood that any breach of
the provisions of this Section 6.7 by any GFHF Representative shall constitute
a breach by GFHF. 

 

(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.7(a), at any time
from the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the GFHF Shareholder
Approval, in the event GFHF receives an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal and
the Board of Directors of GFHF determines in good faith that there is a
reasonable likelihood that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is
reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal, GFHF may, and may permit
its Subsidiaries and the GFHF Individuals and the GFHF Representatives to, (i)
negotiate the terms of, and enter into, a confidentiality agreement with terms
and conditions no less favorable to GFHF than the Confidentiality Agreement,
(ii) furnish or cause to be furnished GFHF Confidential Information to the
Person or Persons making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to such
confidentiality agreement, and (iii) negotiate and participate in such
negotiations or discussions with the Person or Persons making such Acquisition
Proposal concerning such Acquisition Proposal, if the Board of Directors of
GFHF determines in good faith (following consultation with counsel) that
failure to take such actions would or would be reasonably likely to result in
a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law. 

 

(c)The Board of Directors of GFHF shall not (nor shall any committee thereof)
withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to CenterState, the GFHF Board
Recommendation or make or cause to be made any third party or public
communication proposing or announcing an intention to withdraw or modify in
any manner adverse to CenterState the GFHF Board Recommendation (any such
action, a "Change in Recommendation"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
GFHF Board concludes in good faith

   

(after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors) that an
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (after consultation
with its legal advisors) that failure to do so could be inconsistent with its
fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of GFHF under applicable Laws, the
GFHF Board may at any time prior to the GFHF Shareholder Approval (i) effect a
Change of Recommendation or (ii) terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; provided,
however, that the Board of Directors of GFHF may not make a Change in
Recommendation, or terminate this Agreement, with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal unless (i) GFHF shall not have breached this Section 6.7 and (ii) (A)
the Board of Directors of GFHF determines in good faith (after consultation
with counsel) that such Superior Proposal has been made and has not been
withdrawn and continues to be a Superior Proposal after taking into account
all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be offered by
CenterState under this Section 6.7(c); (B) GFHF has given CenterState at least
three (3) days' prior written notice of its intention to take such action set
forth above (which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of
any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the Person making such
Superior Proposal) and has contemporaneously provided an unredacted copy of
the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the Person making such
Superior Proposal; and (C) before effecting such Change in Recommendation,
GFHF has negotiated, and has caused its representatives to negotiate, in good
faith with CenterState during such notice period to the extent CenterState
wishes to negotiate, to enable CenterState to revise the terms of this
Agreement such that it would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal. In the event of any material change to the
terms of such Superior Proposal, GFHF shall, in each case, be required to
deliver to CenterState a new written notice, the notice period shall
recommence and GFHF shall be required to comply with its obligations under
this Section 6.7 with respect to such new written notice. 

 

(d)GFHF will advise CenterState in writing within twenty-four (24) hours
following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal and the substance thereof
(including the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal), and
will keep CenterState apprised of any related developments, discussions and
negotiations (including the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal)
on a current basis. 

 

(e)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
contained in this Section or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit GFHF,
its Subsidiaries, or their respective Boards of Directors or any committees
thereof, from complying with their respective disclosure obligations under
applicable Law.

 

(f)As used in this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings set forth
below: 

 

"Acquisition Proposal" means a tender or exchange offer, proposal for a
merger, consolidation or other business combination involving GFHF or any of
its Significant Subsidiaries or any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner
in a single transaction or series of transactions more than fifty percent
(50%) of the voting power in, or more than twenty percent (20%) of the fair
market value of the business, assets or deposits of, GFHF or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

"Superior Proposal" means a written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of
Directors of GFHF concludes in good faith to be more favorable from a
financial point of view to its shareholders than the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, (i) after receiving the advice of its
financial advisors (who shall be a nationally recognized investment banking
firm, CenterState acknowledging that Hovde Group is a nationally recognized
investment banking firm), (ii) after taking into account the likelihood of
consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth therein and (iii)
after taking into account all legal (with the advice of outside counsel),
financial (including the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory and
other aspects of such proposal and any other relevant factors permitted under
applicable law; provided, however, that for purposes of the definition of
"Superior Proposal," the references to twenty percent (20%) in the definition
of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to fifty percent
(50%). 

 

6.8Notification of Certain Matters. Each of the Parties shall give prompt
written notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it
that (a) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other
facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material Adverse
Effect with respect to it or (b) would cause or constitute a material breach
of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
herein, provided that any failure to give such notice in accordance with the
foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a
violation of this Section 6.8 or the failure of a condition contained in
Article VII unless the underlying breach would independently result in a
failure of a condition set forth in Article VII.. Each of the Parties shall
promptly inform the other in writing upon receiving notice of any material
Action by any Governmental Entity or third party against, or threatened
against, it or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets,
properties, or any of their respective directors, officers or employees in
their individual capacities as such. 

 

6.9Correction of Information. Each of GFHF and CenterState shall promptly
correct and supplement in writing any information set forth in the Schedules
to this Agreement furnished under this Agreement so that such schedules shall
be correct and complete in all material respects at all times prior to
Closing, without taking into account any Material Adverse Effect qualification
contained in Article VII, and shall include all facts necessary to make such
information correct and complete in all material respects at all times;
provided, however, that in each case, such disclosure shall not be deemed to
cure any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or any
failure of a condition under Article VII, or to otherwise limit or affect in
any way the remedies available hereunder to any Party receiving such notice. 

 

6.10System Integration. From and after the date hereof, GFHF shall cause each
GBF Bank and its directors, officers and employees to, and shall make all
commercially reasonable efforts (without undue disruption to either business)
to cause each GBF Bank's data processing consultants and software providers
to, cooperate and assist each GBF Bank and CenterState Bank of Florida, N.A.
in connection with an electronic and systematic conversion of all applicable
data of each GBF Bank to the CenterState system following the Effective Time,
including the training of each GBF Bank employee without undue disruption to
each GBF Bank's business, during normal business hours and at the expense of
CenterState (not to include each GBF Bank's standard employee payroll). 

   

6.11Coordination; Integration. Subject to applicable law and regulation,
during the period from the date hereof until the Effective Time, GFHF shall
cause the Chief Executive Officer of each GBF Bank or his designee to assist

basis, relating to the development, coordination and implementation of the
post-Merger operating and integration plans of CenterState Bank of Florida,
N.A., as the resulting institution in the Bank Merger.

 

6.12Non-Competition and Non-Disclosure Agreement. Concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and effective upon Closing, GFHF has
caused each non-employee director of GFHF and each GBF Bank to execute and
deliver the Non-Competition and Non-Disclosure Agreement in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit C (collectively, the "Director Restrictive Covenant
Agreements").

 

6.13Claims Letters. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and effective upon the Closing, GFHF has caused each director of
GFHF and each GBF Bank to execute and deliver the Claims Letter in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit D.

 

6.14Tax Treatment. Each of the Parties undertakes and agrees to use
reasonable efforts to cause the Merger, and to use commercially reasonable
efforts to take no action which would cause the Merger not, to qualify as a
"Reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code for federal
income tax purposes.

 

6.15Redemption of GFHF Preferred Stock. At or prior to the Closing, GFHF
shall redeem all of its issued and outstanding shares of Series B Preferred
Stock for an amount not to exceed $2,596,000 plus accrued and unpaid dividends
through the date of redemption. 

 

6.16Failure to Fulfill Conditions. In the event that either Party determines
that a condition to its obligation to complete the Merger cannot be fulfilled
and that it will not waive that condition, it will promptly notify the other
Party.

 

6.17Banking Office. Following consummation of the Merger, the Surviving Bank
shall take such action with regard to the banking office as Previously

Burdensome Regulatory Condition or commitments, conditions, restrictions or

ARTICLE VIII 
TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

 

8.1Termination. 

 

(a)This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after the GFHF Shareholder Approval: 

 

(i)by mutual consent of GFHF and CenterState in a written instrument
authorized by the Board of Directors of each of GFHF and CenterState;

 

(ii)by either GFHF or CenterState, if any Governmental Entity that must grant
a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger or the Bank
Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any Governmental
Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final and nonappealable
order, injunction or decree permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or
making illegal the consummation of the Merger or the Bank Merger; provided,
however, that a Party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(a)(ii) if such denial is attributable to the
failure of such Party to perform any covenant in this Agreement required to be
performed prior to the Effective Time;

 

(iii)by either GFHF or CenterState, if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the date that is two hundred seventy (270) days
following the date of this Agreement, unless the failure of the Closing to
occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the Party seeking to
terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of
such Party set forth in this Agreement;

 

(iv)by either GFHF or CenterState (provided that the terminating Party is not
then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein), if there shall have been a breach of any of the
covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth
in this Agreement on the part of GFHF, in the case of a termination by
CenterState, or CenterState, in the case of a termination by GFHF, which
breach, either individually or in the aggregate, would result in, if occurring
or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.2 (in the case of a termination by CenterState) or Section 7.3 (in
the case of a termination by GFHF), and which is not cured within twenty (20)
days following written notice to the Party committing such breach or by its
nature or timing cannot be cured within such time period;

 

(v)by CenterState if (i) the Board of Directors of GFHF (or any committee
thereof) shall have failed to make the GFHF Board Recommendation or shall have
made a Change in Recommendation, or (ii) GFHF shall have materially breached
any of the provisions set forth in Section 6.7, which breach shall not have
been cured within five (5) Business Days of such breach;

 

(vi)by GFHF prior to obtaining the GFHF Shareholder Approval in order to enter
into an agreement relating to a Superior Proposal in accordance with Section
6.7; provided, however, that GFHF has (i) not materially breached the
provisions of Section 6.7

   

which breach shall not have been cured within five (5) Business Days of such
breach;, and (ii) complied with its payment obligation under Section 8.4(a);

 

(vii)by either GFHF or CenterState, if the provisions of Section 8.1(a)(v) are
not applicable and the shareholders of GFHF fail to provide the GFHF
Shareholder Approval at a duly held meeting of shareholders or at an
adjournment or postponement thereof; and

 

(viii)By the Board of Directors of GFHF, if the GFHF Board of Directors so
determines at any time during the five (5) day period commencing on the
Determination Date, if, and only if, both of the following conditions are
satisfied:

 

(a)the number obtained by dividing the Average Closing Price by the Initial
CenterState Market Price (the "CenterState Ratio") is less than 0.825; and

 

(b)the CenterState Ratio is less than the number obtained by (1) dividing the
Final Index Price by the Initial Index Price and (2) subtracting 0.175 from
such quotient (the "Index Ratio"), subject, however, to the following three
sentences: 

 

If GFHF elects to exercise its termination right under this Section
8.1(a)(viii), it shall give prompt written notice thereof to CenterState.
Within five (5) Business Days following its receipt of such notice,
CenterState shall have the option to pay an additional amount in cash for each
Stock Election Share (the "Additional Cash") equal to the lesser of the
following:

 

(x) Additional Cash = SEC(IR * ICSMP - ACP)

 

or

 

(y) Additional Cash = SEC(0.825 * ICSMP - ACP)

 

ACP = Average Closing Price

 

IR = Index Ratio

 

SEC = Stock Election Consideration

 

CSR = CenterState Ratio

 

ICSMP = Initial CenterState Market Price

 

If CenterState so elects, it shall give written notice to GFHF of such
election to pay the Additional Cash for each Stock Election Share within the
five (5) Business Day period following its receipt of notice of termination
from GFHF, whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant to this
Section 8.1(a)(viii) and this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms (except that CenterState shall be obligated to
pay the Additional Cash for each Stock Election Share).

connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger, this Agreement, and the other

incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated,
provided that nothing contained herein shall limit either Party's rights to
recover any liabilities or damages arising out of the other Party's willful
and material breach of any provision of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, CenterState shall reimburse GFHF for its reasonable documented out
of pocket expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement if this Agreement is terminated (i) by GFHF or CenterState
pursuant to (a) Section 8.1(a)(ii) or (b) Section 8.1 (a)(iv) or (ii) by GFHF
pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(iii). If any legal action or other proceeding

addition to any other relief to which such prevailing Party may be entitled.

 

8.4Termination Fees.

 

(a)In recognition of the efforts, expenses and other opportunities foregone by

terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(v) or Section 8.1(a)(vi), then (i) in

CenterState an amount equal to the Termination Fee. 

 

(b)If this Agreement is terminated by either Party under Section 8.1(a)(vii),
and prior to the GFHF Shareholder Meeting there has been publicly announced an
Acquisition Proposal, then if within twelve (12) months of such termination
GFHF or any GBF Bank either (i) enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal or (ii) consummates such Acquisition
Proposal, GFHF shall, within three (3) Business Days after the first to occur
of the foregoing, pay CenterState the Termination Fee set forth in Section
8.4(a)(i) by wire transfer of same-day funds. For purposes of the immediately
preceding clauses (i) and (ii), the references to twenty percent (20%) in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to fifty
percent (50%). 

 

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, other than in
the case of a willful and material breach of this Agreement, the payment of
the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.4 shall fully discharge the
paying Party from, and be the sole and exclusive remedy of the other Party
with respect to, any and all losses that may be suffered by such other Party
based upon, resulting from or arising out of the circumstances giving rise to
such termination of this Agreement. In no event shall a Party be required to
pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. The Parties agree that the

may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any amendment of
this Agreement that requires further approval under applicable law. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the Parties. 

 

8.6Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parties,
by action taken or authorized by their respective Board of Directors, may, to
the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the other Party, (b) waive any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement on the part
of the other Party or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in this Agreement on the part of the Party. Any
agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
Party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance
with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a
waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

delivered to the other Party a schedule (each a "Disclosure Schedule") that
sets forth, among other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or
appropriate either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained
in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or
warranties of the disclosing Party contained in Article III or Article IV, as
applicable; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, (a) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect and (b) the mere
inclusion of an item as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not
be deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or
material fact, event or circumstance. For purposes of this Agreement,

vesting, settlement or exercise of equity rights as permitted by the Merger
Agreement; and (e) such transfers as CenterState may otherwise permit in its
sole discretion. Any transfer or other disposition in violation of the terms
of this Section 2 shall be null and void. 

 

3.Representations and Warranties of Shareholder. Shareholder represents and
warrants to and agrees with CenterState as follows:

 

    



 |  

(a)

 |  

Shareholder has all requisite capacity and authority to enter into and perform
his, her or its obligations under this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(b)

 |  

This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Shareholder, and
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by CenterState,
constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of Shareholder
enforceable against Shareholder in accordance with its terms, except as may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium,
reorganization or similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting the rights of creditors generally and subject to general principles
of equity. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(c)

 |  

The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder does not, and the
performance by Shareholder of his, her or its obligations hereunder and the
consummation by Shareholder of the transactions contemplated hereby will not,
violate or conflict with, or constitute a default under, any agreement,
instrument, contract or other obligation or any order, arbitration award,
judgment or decree to which Shareholder 

---|---|--- 

      



 |  |  

is a party or by which Shareholder is bound, or any statute, rule or
regulation to which Shareholder is subject or, in the event that Shareholder
is a corporation, limited liability company, partnership, trust or other
entity, any charter, bylaw or other organizational document of Shareholder. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(d)

 |  

Shareholder is the beneficial owner of the Shares. Shareholder does not own,
of record or beneficially, any shares of capital stock of GFHF other than the
Shares or any other securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable
for such capital stock, other than any GFHF Stock Options. Shareholder has
the right to vote the Shares, and none of the Shares is subject to any voting
trust or other agreement, arrangement or restriction with respect to the
voting of the Shares, except as contemplated by this Agreement. The Shares do
not include shares over which Shareholder exercises control in a fiduciary
capacity for any other person or entity that is not an Affiliate of
Shareholder, and no representation by Shareholder is made with respect
thereto. 

---|---|--- 

 

4.No Solicitation. From and after the date hereof until the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7 hereof, Shareholder, in his, her or its
capacity as a shareholder of GFHF, shall not, nor shall Shareholder in such
capacity authorize any shareholder, member, partner, officer, director,
advisor or representative of Shareholder or any of his, her or its affiliates
to (and, to the extent applicable to Shareholder, such Shareholder shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to not permit any of his, her or its
representatives or affiliates to), (a) initiate, solicit, induce or knowingly
encourage, or knowingly take any action to facilitate the making of, any
inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes, or could reasonably be expected
to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (b) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal, or furnish, or otherwise
afford access, to any person (other than CenterState) any information or data
with respect to GFHF or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, (c)
enter into any agreement, agreement in principle, letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding or similar arrangement with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal, (d) solicit proxies with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other
than the Merger and the Merger Agreement) or otherwise encourage or assist any
party in taking or planning any action that would compete with, restrain or
otherwise serve to interfere with or inhibit the timely consummation of the
Merger in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, or (e) initiate a
shareholders' vote or action by consent of GFHF's shareholders with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal. For avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and
agree that nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict Shareholder or
any of his, her or its affiliates who is or becomes during the term hereof a
member of the Board of Directors or an officer of GFHF or any of its
Subsidiaries from acting, omitting to act or refraining from taking any
action, solely in such person's capacity as a member of the Board of Directors
or as an officer of GFHF (or as an officer or director of any of its
Subsidiaries) consistent with his or her fiduciary duties in such capacity
under applicable law.

 

5.Irrevocable Proxy. Subject to the last sentence of this Section 5, by
execution of this Agreement, Shareholder does hereby appoint CenterState with
full power of substitution and resubstitution, as Shareholder's true and
lawful attorney and irrevocable proxy, to the full extent of Shareholder's
rights with respect to the Shares, to vote each of such Shares that
Shareholder shall be entitled to so vote with respect to the matters set forth
in Section 1 hereof at any meeting of the shareholders of GFHF, and at any
adjournment or postponement thereof, and in connection with any action of the
shareholders of GFHF taken by written consent. Notwithstanding the

  foregoing, the holder of such proxy shall not exercise such proxy on any
matter other than as set forth in Section 1. Shareholder intends this proxy
to be irrevocable and coupled with an interest hereafter until the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of Section 7 hereof and hereby revokes
any proxy previously granted by Shareholder with respect to the Shares.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, this irrevocable
proxy shall automatically terminate upon the termination of this Agreement. 

 

6.Specific Performance; Remedies; Attorneys' Fees. Shareholder acknowledges
that it is a condition to the willingness of CenterState to enter into the
Merger Agreement that Shareholder execute and deliver this Agreement and that
it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to CenterState if
Shareholder fails to comply with the obligations imposed by this Agreement and
that, in the event of any such failure, CenterState will not have an adequate
remedy at law or in equity. Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that injunctive
relief or other equitable remedy is the appropriate remedy for any such
failure and will not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that
CenterState has an adequate remedy at law. In addition, CenterState shall
have the right to inform any third party that CenterState reasonably believes
to be, or to be contemplating, participating with Shareholder or receiving
from Shareholder assistance in violation of this Agreement, of the terms of
this Agreement and of the rights of CenterState hereunder, and that
participation by any such thirty party with Shareholder in activities in
violation of Shareholder's agreement with CenterState set forth in this
Agreement may give rise to claims by CenterState against such third party. In
any legal action or other proceeding relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby or if the enforcement of any provision of
this Agreement is brought against either Party, the prevailing Party in such
action or proceeding shall be entitled to recover all reasonable expenses
relating thereto (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, court
costs and expenses incident to arbitration, appellate and post-judgment
proceedings) from the Party against which such action or proceeding is
brought, in addition to any other relief to which such prevailing Party may be
entitled.

 

7.Term of Agreement; Termination. The term of this Agreement shall commence
on the date hereof. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement by the
written consent of the parties hereto, and this Agreement shall be
automatically terminated upon: (i) termination of the Merger Agreement, or
(ii) the consummation of the Merger. Upon such termination, no party shall
have any further obligations or liabilities hereunder; provided, however, that
such termination shall not relieve any party from liability for any breach of
this Agreement prior to such termination.

 

8.Entire Agreement; Amendments. This Agreement supersedes all prior
agreements, written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended,
supplemented or modified, and no provision hereof may be modified or waived,
except by an instrument in writing signed by each party hereto. No waiver of
any provision hereof by either party shall be deemed a waiver of any other
provision hereof by any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a
continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party. 

 

9.Severability. In the event that any one or more provisions of this
Agreement shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect by any court of competent

  jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provisions of this Agreement, and the parties shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to substitute a valid, legal and enforceable
provision which, insofar as practical, implements the purpose and intents of
this Agreement. 

 

10.Capacity as Shareholder. This Agreement shall apply to Shareholder solely
in his, her or its capacity as a shareholder of GFHF, and it shall not apply
in any manner to Shareholder in any capacity as a director, officer or
employee of GFHF or in any other capacity.

 

11.Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to any
applicable conflicts of law principles or any other principle that could
require the application of the law of any other jurisdiction. 

 

12.WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.
EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 12.

 

13.Waiver of Appraisal Rights; Further Assurances. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, Shareholder hereby waives any rights of appraisal or rights to
dissent from the Merger or to demand fair value for his, her or its Shares in
connection with the Merger, in each case, that Shareholder may have under
applicable law. Shareholder further agrees not to commence or participate in,
and to take all actions necessary to opt out of any class in any class action
with respect to, any claim, derivative or otherwise, against CenterState, GFHF
or any of their respective successors relating to the negotiation, execution
or delivery of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement or the consummation of
the Merger. From time to time prior to the termination of this Agreement, at
CenterState's request and without further consideration, Shareholder shall
execute and deliver such additional documents and take all such further action
as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to effect the actions and
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

 

14.Disclosure. To the extent such information is required to be included,
Shareholder hereby permits CenterState to publish and disclose in the Proxy
Statement and Form S-4 (including, without limitation, all related documents
and schedules filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission) his, her or
its identity and ownership of shares of Common Stock and the nature of
Shareholder's commitments, arrangements and understandings pursuant to this
Agreement.

  15.Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Executed counterparts
may be delivered by facsimile or other electronic transmission.

 

[Signature page follows.] 

  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, CenterState has caused this Agreement to be duly executed,
and Shareholder has duly executed this Agreement, all as of the day and year
first above written.

among the Banks with respect to the subject matter hereof. 

 

The provisions of this Agreement are intended to be interpreted and construed
in a manner so as to make such provisions valid, binding and enforceable. In
the event that any provision of this Agreement is determined to be partially
or wholly invalid, illegal or unenforceable, then such provision shall be
deemed to be modified or restricted to the extent necessary to make such
provision valid, binding and enforceable, or, if such provision cannot be
modified or restricted in a manner so as to make such provision valid, binding
and enforceable, then such provision shall be deemed to be excised from this
Agreement and the validity, binding effect and enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected or impaired in any manner.

 

No waiver, amendment, modification or change of any provision of this
Agreement shall be effective unless and until made in writing and signed by
the Banks. No waiver, forbearance or failure by any Bank of its rights to
enforce any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver or estoppel
of such Bank's right to enforce any other provision of this Agreement or a
continuing waiver by such Bank of compliance with any provision hereof.

 

Except to the extent Federal law is applicable hereto, this Agreement shall be
governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the
State of Florida without regard to principles of conflicts of laws.

 

This Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the Banks' respective successors and permitted assigns.

  Unless otherwise expressly stated herein, this Agreement shall not benefit or
create any right of action in or on behalf of any person or entity other than
the Banks.

 

This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (including by facsimile or
optically‑scanned electronic mail attachment), each of which shall be deemed
to be original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have signed this Plan of Merger and Merger
Agreement effective as of the date and year first set forth above.

NON-COMPETITION AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

 

This Non-Competition and Non-Disclosure Agreement (the "Agreement"), is
entered into as of the 30th day of November, 2016, by and between CenterState
Banks, Inc., a Florida corporation ("CenterState"), and ____________________,
an individual resident of the State of Florida ("Director").

 

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of
November 30, 2016 (the "Merger Agreement") by and between CenterState and
Gateway Financial Holdings of Florida, Inc., a Florida corporation ("GFHF"),
GFHF will merge with and into CenterState (the "Merger"), as a result of which
Gateway Bank of Florida, Gateway Bank of Central Florida, and Gateway Bank of
Southwest Florida, each a Florida state-chartered bank and wholly owned
subsidiary of GFHF (collectively, the "GBF Banks"), will merge with and into
CenterState Bank of Florida, N.A., a national banking association and wholly
owned subsidiary of CenterState ("CenterState Bank, N.A.");

 

WHEREAS, Director is a shareholder of GFHF and, as a result of the Merger and
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Director is
expected to receive significant consideration in exchange for the shares of
GFHF Common Stock (as defined in the Merger Agreement) held by Director;

 

WHEREAS, prior to the date hereof, Director has served as a member of the
Board of Directors of GFHF, and, therefore, Director has knowledge of the
Confidential Information and Trade Secrets (each as hereinafter defined);

 

WHEREAS, as a result of the Merger, CenterState will succeed to all of the
Confidential Information and Trade Secrets, for which CenterState, as of the
Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), will have paid valuable
consideration and desires reasonable protection; and

 

WHEREAS, it is a material prerequisite to the consummation of the Merger that
certain directors of GFHF, including Director, enter into this Agreement;

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of these premises and the mutual covenants
and undertakings herein contained, CenterState and Director, each intending to
be legally bound, covenant and agree as follows:

 

1.Restrictive Covenants. 

 

(a)Director acknowledges that (i) CenterState has separately bargained for the
restrictive covenants in this Agreement; and (ii) the types and periods of
restrictions imposed by the covenants in this Agreement are fair and
reasonable to Director and such restrictions will not prevent Director from
earning a livelihood.

  (b)Having acknowledged the foregoing, solely in the event that the Merger is
consummated, Director covenants and agrees with CenterState as follows:

 

(i)From and after the Effective Time, Director will not disclose or use any
Confidential Information or Trade Secret for so long as such information
remains Confidential Information or a Trade Secret, as applicable, for any
purpose, except for any disclosure that is required by applicable law or court
order. In the event that Director is required by law or court order to
disclose any Confidential Information, Director will: (i) if and to the
extent permitted by such law or court order provide CenterState with prompt
notice of such requirement prior to the disclosure so that CenterState may
waive the requirements of this Agreement or seek an appropriate protective
order at CenterState's sole expense; and (ii) use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain assurances that any Confidential Information disclosed will
be accorded confidential treatment. If, in the absence of a waiver or
protective order, Director is nonetheless, in the opinion of his counsel,
required to disclose Confidential Information, disclosure may be made only as
to that portion of the Confidential Information that counsel advises Director
is required to be disclosed.

 

(ii)Except as expressly provided on Schedule I to this Agreement, for a period
beginning at the Effective Time and ending two (2) years after the Effective
Time, Director will not (except on behalf of or with the prior written consent
of CenterState), on Director's own behalf or in the service or on behalf of
others, solicit or attempt to solicit any customer of CenterState, CenterState
Bank, N.A., GFHF or any GBF Bank (each a "Protected Party"), including
actively sought prospective customers of any of the GBF Banks as of the
Effective Date, for the purpose of providing products or services that are
Competitive (as hereinafter defined) with those offered or provided by any
Protected Party.

 

(iii)Except as expressly provided on Schedule I to this Agreement, for a
period beginning at the Effective Time and ending two (2) years after the
Effective Time, Director will not (except on behalf of or with the prior
written consent of CenterState), either directly or indirectly, on Director's
own behalf or in the service or on behalf of others, act as a director,
manager, officer or employee of any business which is the same as or
essentially the same as the business conducted by any Protected Party and
which has an office located within the Restricted Territory.

 

(iv)For a period beginning at the Effective Time and ending two (2) years
after the Effective Time, Director will not on Director's own behalf or in the
service or on behalf of others, solicit or recruit or attempt to solicit or
recruit, directly or by assisting others, any employee of any Protected Party,
whether or not such employee is a full-time employee or a temporary employee
of such Protected Party, whether or not such employment is pursuant to a
written agreement and whether or not such employment is for a determined
period or is at will, to cease working for such Protected Party; provided that
the foregoing will not prevent the placement of any general solicitation for
employment not specifically directed towards employees of any Protected Party
or hiring any such person as a result thereof.

  (c)For purposes of this Section 1, the following terms shall be defined as set
forth below:

 

(i)"Competitive," with respect to particular products or services, shall mean
products or services that are the same as or similar to the products or
services of any Protected Party.

 

(ii)"Confidential Information" shall mean data and information:

 

(A)relating to the business of GFHF and its subsidiaries, including the GBF
Banks, regardless of whether the data or information constitutes a Trade
Secret;

 

(B)disclosed to Director or of which Director became aware as a consequence of
Director's relationship with GFHF and/or any of the GBF Banks;

 

(C)having value to GFHF and/or any of the GBF Banks and, as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
CenterState; and

 

(D)not generally known to competitors of GFHF or CenterState.

 

Confidential Information shall include Trade Secrets, methods of operation,
names of customers, price lists, financial information and projections,
personnel data and similar information; provided, however, that the terms
"Confidential Information" and "Trade Secrets" shall not mean data or
information that (x) has been disclosed to the public, except where such
public disclosure has been made by Director without authorization from GFHF or
CenterState, (y) has been independently developed and disclosed by others, or
(z) has otherwise entered the public domain through lawful means.

 

(iii)"Restricted Territory" shall mean each county in Florida where the GBF
Banks operate a banking office at the Effective Time and each county
contiguous to each of such counties.

 

(iv)"Trade Secret" shall mean information, without regard to form, including
technical or nontechnical data, a formula, a pattern, a compilation, a
program, a device, a method, a technique, a drawing, a process, financial
data, financial plans, product plans or a list of actual or potential
customers or suppliers, that is not commonly known by or available to the
public and which information:

 

(A)derives economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known
to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who
can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and

 

(B)is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to
maintain its secrecy.

  (d)Director acknowledges that irreparable loss and injury would result to
CenterState upon the breach of any of the covenants contained in this Section
1 and that damages arising out of such breach would be difficult to ascertain.
Director hereby agrees that, in addition to all other remedies provided at law
or in equity, CenterState may petition and obtain from a court of law or
equity, without the necessity of proving actual damages and without posting
any bond or other security, both temporary and permanent injunctive relief to
prevent a breach by Director of any covenant contained in this Section 1, and
shall be entitled to an equitable accounting of all earnings, profits and
other benefits arising out of any such breach. In the event that the
provisions of this Section 1 should ever be determined to exceed the time,
geographic or other limitations permitted by applicable law, then such
provisions shall be modified so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent
permitted by law. If such provision(s) cannot be modified to be enforceable,
the provision(s) shall be severed from this Agreement to the extent
unenforceable. The remaining provisions and any partially enforceable
provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

 

2.Term; Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time by the
written consent of the parties hereto, and this Agreement shall be
automatically terminated upon the earlier of (i) termination of the Merger
Agreement; (ii) two (2) years following the Effective Time or (iii) upon a
Change in Control of CenterState (as defined in Schedule I). For the avoidance
of doubt, the provisions of Section 1 shall only become operative upon the
consummation of the Merger but, in such event, shall survive the consummation
of the Merger until the earlier of (a) two (2) years after the Effective Time
or (b) upon a Change in Control of CenterState. Upon termination of this
Agreement, no party shall have any further obligations or liabilities
hereunder, except that termination of this Agreement will not relieve a
breaching party from liability for any breach of any provision of this
Agreement occurring prior to the termination of this Agreement.

 

3.Notices. Any notice, consent, demand, request or other communication given
to a party hereto in connection with this Agreement shall be in writing and
shall be deemed to have been given to such party (x) when delivered personally
to such party or (y) provided that a written acknowledgment of receipt is
obtained, five (5) days after being sent by prepaid certified or registered
mail or two (2) days after being sent by a nationally recognized overnight
courier, to the address (if any) specified below for such party (or to such
other address as such party shall have specified by ten (10) days' advance
notice given in accordance with this Section 3) or (z) in the case of
CenterState only, on the first business day after it is sent by facsimile to
the facsimile number set forth below (or to such other facsimile number as
shall have specified by ten (10) days' advance notice given in accordance with
this Section 2), with a confirmatory copy sent by certified or registered mail
or by overnight courier in accordance with this Section 2.
