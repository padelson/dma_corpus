extent not inconsistent with the foregoing _clause (A)_, the accounting
methods, policies, practices, procedures, conventions, categorizations,
definitions, principles, judgments, assumptions, techniques or estimation
methods with respect to financial statements, their classification or
presentation or otherwise (including with respect to the nature of accounts,

balance sheet included in the Audited Financial Statements, and (C) to the
extent not inconsistent with the foregoing _clauses (A)_ or _(B)_ , GAAP and,
(ii) not include any changes in assets or liabilities as a result of purchase
accounting adjustments or other changes arising from or resulting as a
consequence of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(d) The post-Closing purchase price adjustment as set forth in this _Section
3.03_ is not intended to permit the introduction of different accounting
methods, policies, practices, procedures, conventions, categorizations,
definitions, principles, judgments, assumptions, techniques or estimation
methods with respect to financial statements, their classification or
presentation or otherwise (including with respect to the nature of accounts,
level of reserves or level of accruals) for the _Working Capital Schedule_.

 



 

(e) The Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) shall (i) permit the Sellers and their respective
representatives to have reasonable access to the books, records and other
documents (including work papers, schedules, financial statements, memoranda,
etc.) pertaining to or used in connection with the preparation of the Closing
Statement and the Purchasers calculation of the Purchase Price and provide
the Sellers with copies thereof (as reasonably requested by the Sellers) and
(ii) provide the Sellers and their respective representatives reasonable
access to the Purchasers (including the Companys) employees and advisors
(including making certain relevant officer(s) and accountants available to
respond to reasonable written or oral inquiries of the Sellers or their
respective representatives). If a Seller disagrees with any part of the
Purchasers calculation of the Purchase Price as set forth on the Closing
Statement, such Seller shall, within sixty (60) days after the Sellers
receipt of the Closing Statement, notify the Purchaser in writing of such
disagreement by setting forth the Sellers calculation of the Purchase Price,
including each of the components thereof, and describing in reasonable detail
the basis for such disagreement (an " _Objection Notice_ "). If an Objection

 



       
 

 



 

Notice is delivered to the Purchaser, then the Purchaser and the Sellers shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve their disagreements with respect to the
computation of the Purchase Price. In the event that the Purchaser and the
Sellers are unable to resolve all such disagreements within thirty (30) days
after the Purchasers receipt of such Objection Notice, the Purchaser and the
Sellers shall submit such remaining disagreements to KPMG ( _provided_ that
any individual or individuals at KPMG assigned to resolve such disagreements
shall have no past or ongoing relationship in any capacity with the Purchaser,
its Affiliates or Subsidiaries, or the Sun Consultant and its controlled
Affiliates), or a nationally-recognized accounting firm as is acceptable to
the Purchaser and the Sellers (the " _Valuation Firm_ ").

 



 

(f) The Valuation Firm shall make a final and binding determination with
respect to the computation of the Purchase Price, including each of the
components thereof, to the extent such amounts are in dispute, in accordance
with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement and on _Exhibit
C_. The Purchaser and the Sellers shall cooperate with the Valuation Firm
during the term of its engagement and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Valuation Firm to resolve all remaining disagreements
with respect to the computation of the Purchase Price, including each of the
components thereof, as soon as practicable. The Valuation Firm shall consider
only those items and amounts in the Purchasers and the Sellers respective
calculations of the Purchase Price, including each of the components thereof,
that are identified as being items and amounts to which the Purchaser and the
Sellers have been unable to agree. In resolving any disputed item, the
Valuation Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value
for such item claimed by either party. The Valuation Firms determination of
the Purchase Price, including each of the components thereof, shall be based
solely on written materials submitted by the Purchaser and the Sellers (
_i.e._ , not on independent review) and on the definitions included herein.
The determination of the Valuation Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon
the parties hereto and shall not be subject to appeal or further review,
absent manifest error.

 



 

(g) The costs and expenses of the Valuation Firm in determining the Purchase
Price, including each of the components thereof, shall be borne by the
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, based upon the
percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party
bears to the amount actually contested by such party. For example, if the
Purchaser claims the Purchase Price are one thousand dollars ($1,000) less
than the amount determined by the Sellers, and the Sellers contest only five
hundred dollars ($500) of the amount claimed by the Purchaser, and if the
Valuation Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the Purchaser three
hundred dollars ($300) of the five hundred dollars ($500) contested, then the
costs and expenses of the Valuation Firm will be allocated sixty percent (60%)
( _i.e._ , 300 ÷ 500) to the Sellers, in the aggregate, and forty percent
(40%) ( _i.e._ , 200 ÷ 500) to the Purchaser. Prior to the Valuation Firms
determination of Purchase Price, (i) the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Sellers, on the other hand, shall each pay fifty percent (50%) of any retainer
paid to the Valuation Firm and (ii) during the engagement of the Valuation
Firm, the Valuation Firm will bill fifty percent (50%) of the total charges to
each of the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand. In
connection with the Valuation Firms determination of Purchase Price, the
Valuation Firm shall also determine, pursuant to the terms of the first and
second sentences of this _Section 3.03(g)_, and taking into account all fees
and expenses already paid by each of Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Sellers, on the other hand, as of the date of such determination, the
allocation of its fees and expenses between the Purchaser and the Sellers,
which such determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties
hereto.

 



 

(h) Within five (5) Business Days after the Purchase Price, including each of
the components thereof, is finally determined pursuant to this _Section
3.03_:

 



 

(i) if the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to this _Section
3.03_ are less than the Estimated Purchase Price, then the Purchaser and the
Sellers shall cause

 



      
 

 



 

the Escrow Agent to: (A) pay to the Purchaser from the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Funds an amount (which in no case shall exceed the amount of
the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds) (the " _Purchaser Adjustment
Amount_ ") equal to such deficiency, and (B) pay to the Sellers each Sellers
Allocation Percentage of the amount (if any) by which the amount of the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds is greater than the Purchaser
Adjustment Amount; and

 



 

(ii) if the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to this _Section
3.03_ are greater than the Estimated Purchase Price (the amount of such
deficiency, the " _Seller Adjustment Amount_ "), then (A) the Purchaser shall
pay to the Sellers the Seller Adjustment Amount, and (B) the Purchaser and the
Sellers shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay to the each Seller such Sellers
Allocation Percentage of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds.

 



 

All payments to be made pursuant to this _Section 3.03(h)_ shall (x) be
treated by all parties for tax purposes as adjustments to the Purchase Price
and (y) be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account(s) designated by the Purchaser or the Sellers, as applicable. The
payments described in _Section 3.03(h)(i)_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Purchaser for any and all claims arising under this Agreement
with respect to this _Section 3.03_.

thereunder.

Subsidiary of the Company or any other Person. Additionally, at least three
(3) Business Days prior to obtaining the Waived Benefits, and prior to seeking
the 280G Approval, the Company shall provide drafts of such waivers and such
equityholder approval materials to the Purchaser for its review and approval,
and shall, in its sole discretion, incorporate any reasonable comments made by
the Purchaser therein. In no event shall the Sellers be deemed in breach of
this Section 8.04 if any such Person refuses to waive any such rights or if
the equityholders fail to approve any Waived Benefits.

that a vote of the Companys stockholders who are entitled to vote was
solicited in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this _Section 8.04_

or their taking of any other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the transactions contemplated hereby, which order, decree, ruling
or any other action shall have become final and non-appealable;

 



 

(c) by the Purchaser, on the one hand, or by the Sellers, on the other hand,
if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before the date that is 180
calendar days after the date of this Agreement (the " _Termination Date_ ");
_provided_ that no termination may be made under this _Section 10.01(c)_ if
the failure to close shall have been caused by the action or inaction of the
terminating party; _provided_ , _further_ , if the Closing has not occurred by
the Termination Date solely because the applicable waiting period has not
expired or been terminated or any required governmental approvals have not
been obtained under the HSR Act or any Other Antitrust Regulations, including

Sellers, after providing written notice to the other party;

 



 

(d) by the Purchaser, upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part
of the Sellers set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or
warranty contained in _Article V_ or _Article VI_ shall be or have become
untrue, in either case, such that any of the conditions set forth in _Section
4.01(a)_ or _4.01(b)_ would not be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
if such breach is curable by the Sellers within thirty days of notice of such
breach through the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts and for so long
as the Sellers, or cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, continue to
exercise such

 



      
 

 



 

commercially reasonable efforts, the Purchaser may not terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 10.01(d)_; or

 



 

(e) by the Sellers, upon a breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of

11.01 _Acknowledgement by the Purchaser_. The representations and warranties
of the Sellers expressly and specifically set forth in _Article V_ and
_Article VI_, as qualified by the Disclosure Schedules, constitute the sole
and exclusive representations, warranties, and statements (including by
omission) of any kind or nature, whether written or oral, expressed or
implied, statutory or otherwise (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
relating to quality, quantity, condition, merchantability, fitness for a
particular purpose or conformity to samples) of any of the Sellers, the
Company or any of their respective Non-Recourse Parties as to any matter
concerning the Sellers, the Company, any of their respective Subsidiaries or

respect to the accuracy or completeness of any information provided to (or
otherwise acquired by) the Purchaser or any of its Non-Recourse Parties in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any statements, information,
documents, projections, forecasts or other material made available to the
Purchaser or any of its Non-Recourse Parties in certain "data rooms" or
presentations including "management presentations") and all other purported
representations and warranties or statements (including by omission) are
hereby disclaimed by the Sellers and each of their respective Non-Recourse
Parties and (i) each of Purchaser and its Non-Recourse Parties has and will
only rely on the representations and warranties of the Sellers expressly and
specifically set forth in _Article V_ or _Article VI_, (ii) each of the
Purchaser and its Non-Recourse Parties hereby expressly and irrevocably
acknowledges and agrees that he, she or it has not relied on any other
representations, warranties or statements (including by omission), and (iii)

with respect to their purported use of, or reliance on, any such
representations, warranties or statements (including by omission). Without in
any way limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser acknowledges
that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make projections,
forward looking statements and other forecasts and estimates, and certain
business plan information, that the

 



       
 

 



 

Purchaser is familiar with such uncertainties, that the Purchaser is taking
full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and
accuracy of any such projections, forward looking statements, forecasts,
estimates and business plan information provided to (or otherwise acquired by)
the Purchaser and its Non-Recourse Parties in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such projections, forward looking statements,
forecasts, estimates and business plan information).

 



 

11.02 _Notification_. From the date hereof until the Closing Date, each party
shall promptly notify the other parties in writing as promptly as possible and
in no event more than three (3) Business Days upon discovery of any
circumstance, fact, development, change, event, effect or occurrence that has
resulted in, or would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Change. Delivery of any such notice by any party shall have no effect on the
rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

 



 

11.03 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested by any
party hereto and at such requesting partys expense, any other party shall
execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents
and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or
other actions as such requesting party may reasonably deem necessary or
desirable to evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this

cause the Company or its Subsidiaries to provide the Retained Employees with
the base wages and cash bonus potential (but excluding any equity plan program
or arrangement) that are substantially the same or greater in the aggregate as
provided to the Retained Employees on the Closing Date for a period of at
least one (1) year following the Closing Date (or, if earlier, until the
termination of employment of the relevant employee); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this _Section 11.04(a)_ shall obligate the Purchaser or the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to continue the employment or services of
any such Retained Employee or any service provider, as the case may be, for
any specific period.

 



 

(b) _Employee Benefits_. As of the Closing Date and for a period of at least
one (1) year thereafter (or, if earlier, until the termination of employment
of the relevant employee), the Purchaser shall provide, or shall cause the
Company to provide, the Retained Employees with benefits (other than any
defined benefit, equity based compensation, nonqualified or deferred
compensation, and retiree welfare benefits) that are substantially similar in
the aggregate to the benefits (other than any defined benefit, equity based
compensation, nonqualified or deferred compensation, and retiree welfare
benefits) provided to the Retained Employees immediately prior to the Closing
Date.

 



 

(c) _Severance_. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this _Section
11.04_, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries
to, pay severance benefits to Retained Employees whose employment with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is involuntarily terminated without cause
within twelve (12) months following the Closing Date in amounts no less
favorable than the amount of severance benefits to which such persons would
have been entitled under the terms of the applicable Plan as in effect as of
the Closing Date or under applicable Law, whichever is greater.

 



 

(d) _Employee Service Credit_. The Purchaser (i) shall give, or cause the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to give, each Retained Employee credit
under any benefit plan or personnel

 



      
 

 



 

policies that cover the Retained Employee after the Closing Date for purposes
of eligibility, vesting and entitlement to vacation, sick leave and severance
benefits for the Retained Employees service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date, to the same extent recognized by the
Company or its Subsidiaries or any predecessor thereof as of the Closing Date
under the analogous Plan for the same purpose, and only to the extent that
such service credit does not result in the duplication of benefits or
compensation for the same period of service, (ii) in the year in which the
Closing Date occurs, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allow such
Retained Employees to participate in each plan providing health benefits
without regard to preexisting-condition limitations, waiting periods, evidence
of insurability or other exclusions or limitations not imposed on the Retained
Employee by the corresponding Plans or Canadian Employee Benefit Plans
immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (iii) if any Welfare Plan or
equivalent Canadian Employee Benefit Plan providing health benefits is
terminated prior to the end of the plan year that includes the Closing Date,
the Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to credit the Retained
Employee with any expenses that were covered by such Welfare Plan(s) for
purposes of determining deductibles, co-pays and other applicable limits under
any similar replacement plans.

 



 

(e) _Vacation Pay and Personal Holidays_. The Purchaser shall cause the
Company to continue to credit to each Retained Employee all vacation and
personal holiday pay that the Retained Employee is entitled to use but has not
used as of the Closing Date (including any earned vacation or personal holiday
pay to be used in future years), and shall assume all liability for the
payment of such amounts, but only to the extent that such amounts are
reflected in Working Capital.

 



 

(f) _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. The provisions of this _Section 11.04_
are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or
former employee, officer, director or consultant, or any other individual
associated therewith, or any other Person, shall be regarded for any purpose
as a third-party beneficiary of this _Section 11.04_. In no event shall the
terms of this Agreement be deemed to: (i) establish, amend or modify any Plan
or Canadian Employee Benefit Plan or any other compensation or benefit plan,
program, agreement, contract or arrangement; (ii) alter or limit the ability
of the Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to establish, amend, modify or terminate any Plan or Canadian
Employee Benefit Plan or any other benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement, contract or arrangement after the Closing Date; or (iii) confer
upon any Person any right to employment or service or continued employment or
continued service with the Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or to any particular term or condition of
employment or service, or constitute or create an employment agreement with
any employee, or limit the ability of the Purchaser or the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries after the Closing to terminate the employment or service of
any employee or service provider (including a Retained Employee) at any time
and for any or no reason.

13.04 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or delegated by either the Purchaser or the Sellers without the prior
written consent of the other party; _provided_ , that the Purchaser may assign
its rights under this Agreement to (i) one or more of its Affiliates without
the consent of the Sellers as long as Purchaser remains bound by all of its
obligations under this Agreement or (ii) its lenders as collateral security
for their obligations under any of their secured debt financing arrangements.

 



 

13.05 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is

 



      
 

 



 

held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable Law, such provision shall
be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Agreement.

 



 

13.06 _Construction_. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to
be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent,
and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. The
headings of the sections and paragraphs of this Agreement have been inserted
for convenience of reference only and shall in no way restrict or otherwise
modify any of the terms or provisions hereof. In the event a subject matter is
addressed in more than one (1) representation and warranty in _Article V_ or
_Article VI_, the Purchaser shall be entitled to rely only on the most
specific representation and warranty addressing such matter. The specification
of any dollar amount or the inclusion of any item in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules or exhibits
is not intended to imply that the amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the
items so included, or other items, are or are not material or threatened, and
no party shall use the fact of the setting of the amounts or the fact of the
inclusion of any item in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules, or exhibits
in any dispute or controversy between the parties hereto as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not set forth or included in this Agreement, the
Disclosure Schedules, or exhibits is or is not material or threatened for
purposes of this Agreement. In addition, matters reflected in the Disclosure
Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to
be reflected in the Disclosure Schedules. Such additional matters are set
forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other
matters of a similar nature. The information contained in this Agreement, in
the Disclosure Schedules, and exhibits hereto is disclosed solely for purposes
of this Agreement, and no information contained herein or therein shall be
deemed to be an admission by any party hereto to any third-party of any matter
whatsoever (including any violation of Law or breach of contract).

 



 

13.07 _Amendment and Waiver_. Except as provided herein, any provision of this
Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or exhibits hereto may be amended or
waived only in a writing signed by the Purchaser and the Sellers. No waiver of
any provision hereunder or any breach or default thereof shall extend to or
affect in any way any other provision or prior or subsequent breach or
default.

 



 

13.08 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement and the other agreements,
instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection
herewith (including the Confidentiality Agreement) contain the complete
agreement between the parties hereto and supersede any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or between the parties hereto, written or
oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way.

 



 

13.09 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. _Section 9.02_ shall be enforceable by
each of the current and former officers, directors, managers or similar
functionaries of the Company and its Subsidiaries and his or her heirs and
representatives. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, nothing
expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any
Person other than the parties to this Agreement, and, for purposes of _Section
9.02_, each of the current and former officers, directors, managers or similar
functionaries of the Company and its Subsidiaries and his or her heirs and
representatives, any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with
respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

13.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument
entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments hereto or
thereto, may be executed in one (1) or more counterparts, all of which shall
constitute one and the same instrument. Any such counterpart, to the extent
delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or
similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an " _Electronic
Delivery_ ") shall be treated in all manner and respects as

 



      
 

 



 

an original executed counterpart and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. At the request of any party hereto, each other party
hereto or thereto shall re execute the original form of this Agreement and
deliver such form to all other parties hereto. No party hereto shall raise the
use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that any
signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through
the use of Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a contract,
and each such party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such
defense relates to lack of authenticity.

 



 

13.11 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. All issues and questions concerning the
construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement
and the exhibits and schedules hereto, and all claims and disputes arising
hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, whether
purporting to sound in contract or tort, or at law or in equity, shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of Law or conflict of Law rules
or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than
the State of Delaware. The parties hereto hereby agree and consent to be
subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware or, to the extent such court declines jurisdiction, first to any
federal court, or second, to any state court, each located in Wilmington,
Delaware, and hereby waive the right to assert the lack of personal or subject
matter jurisdiction or improper venue in connection with any such suit, action
or other proceeding. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the parties
hereto (a) waives the defense of inconvenient forum, (b) agrees not to
commence any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or
any transactions contemplated hereby other than in any such court, and (c)
agrees that a final judgment in any such suit, action or other proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit or
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION, ACTION,
PROCEEDING, CROSS-CLAIM, OR COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY COURT (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR IN CONNECTION
WITH (i) THIS AGREEMENT OR THE VALIDITY, PERFORMANCE, INTERPRETATION,
COLLECTION OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR (ii) THE ACTIONS OF SUCH PARTY IN THE
NEGOTIATION, AUTHORIZATION, EXECUTION, DELIVERY, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE
OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

 



 

13.12 _Legal Representation_. Following consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP and McMillan LLP may serve as
counsel to each and any of the Sellers, the holder of the Non-Voting MRPS
Shares, and their respective Non-Recourse Parties, in connection with any
litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding such
representation or any continued representation of any other Person (including
Sun Capital Partners, Inc. and their respective Affiliates), and each of the
parties (on behalf of itself and each of its Non-Recourse Parties) hereto
consents thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom. The
decision to represent any of the Sellers, the holder of the Non-Voting MRPS
Shares, and their respective Non-Recourse Parties shall be solely that of
Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP and McMillan LLP. Any privilege attaching as a
result of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP or McMillan LLP representing the Company
and its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall remain in effect; _provided_ ,
that such privilege from and after the Closing shall be shared by the Sellers
and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and no such shared privilege may be
waived by (a) Sellers without the prior written consent of the Purchaser or
the Company or (b) the Purchaser or the Company without the prior written
consent of the Sellers; _provided_ , _however_ , that in any action or claim
arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
such privilege shall be controlled by Sellers. In furtherance of the
foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees to take the steps necessary to
ensure that any privilege attaching as a result of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP
or McMillan LLP representing the Company and

 



      
 

 



 

its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall survive the Closing, remain in effect and be shared by the
Sellers, the Company and its Subsidiaries. As to any privileged attorney
client communications between Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP and/or McMillan LLP
and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date
(collectively, the " _Privileged Communications_ "), the parties hereto,
together with any of their respective Affiliates, successors or assigns, agree
that no such party may use or rely on any of the Privileged Communications in
any action or claim against or involving any of the parties hereto or any of
their respective Non-Recourse Parties after the Closing. The Sellers further
agrees that, on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries, Morgan, Lewis and
Bockius LLP and/or McMillan LLP retention by the Company or any of its
respective Subsidiaries shall be deemed completed and terminated without any
further action by any Person effective as of the Closing.

 



 

13.13 _Consents_. The Purchaser agrees and acknowledges that the Sellers shall
have no liability whatsoever to the Purchaser (or, after the Closing, the
Company) (and the Purchaser, or after the Closing, the Company, shall not be
entitled to assert any claims) arising out of or relating to the failure to
obtain any consents listed on the Authorization Schedule or that are not
required to be listed on the Authorization Schedule that may have been or may
be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or because of the default, acceleration or termination of any such contract,
lease, license or other agreement as a result thereof. The Purchaser further
agrees that no covenant of the Sellers or the Company contained herein shall
be breached or deemed breached and no condition of the Purchaser shall be
deemed not to be satisfied as a result of the failure to obtain any consent
listed on the Authorization Schedule or that are not required to be listed on
the Authorization Schedule or as a result of any such default, acceleration or
termination or any lawsuit, action, claim, proceeding or investigation
commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out of or
relating to the failure to obtain any consent listed on the Authorization
Schedule or that are not required to be listed on the Authorization Schedule
or any such default, acceleration or termination; _provided_ that nothing in
this _Section 13.13_ is intended to prejudice or supersede any obligations or
requirements of the parties set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

13.14 _No Survival; Sources of Recovery_.

 



 

(a) The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this
Agreement shall terminate at the Closing or upon the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Article X_, except the covenants and agreements that
explicitly contemplate performance after the Closing shall survive the Closing
indefinitely (or until fully performed in accordance with this Agreement). The
parties acknowledge and agree that from and after the Closing they shall not
be permitted to make, and no party shall have any Liability or obligation with
respect to, any claims for any breach of any representation or warranty set
forth herein or any covenant or agreement herein that is to have been
performed by another party on or prior to the Closing. In furtherance of the
foregoing, from and after the Closing, each party hereby waives (on behalf of
itself, each of its Affiliates and each of its representatives), to the
fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of
action (including any statutory rights to contribution or indemnification) for
any breach of any representation or warranty or covenant or obligation to have
been performed prior to the Closing set forth herein or otherwise relating to
the Sellers, Company, any of their respective Subsidiaries or the subject
matter of this Agreement that such party may have against the other parties or
any of their Affiliates or any of their respective representatives arising
under or based upon any theory whatsoever, under any Law, contract, tort or
otherwise.

 



 

(b) The Purchaser hereby agrees and acknowledges that its right to any payment
to be made pursuant to _Section 3.03(h)(i)_ (together with the Purchasers
rights under the Escrow Agreement with respect to the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Amount) shall be the Purchasers sole and exclusive source
of recovery for any amounts owing to the Purchaser pursuant to _Section
3.03(h)(i)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except as expressly
provided in the foregoing _Sections 13.14(a)_ and _13.14(b)_ , none of the
Company, the Sellers, and each of their respective Affiliates, officers,
managers, employees or agents, shall have any liability, responsibility or
obligation arising under this Agreement or any exhibit or Schedule hereto, or
any ancillary agreement, certificate or other document entered into, made,
delivered, or made available in connection herewith, or as a result of any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, such _Sections 13.14(a)_ and
_13.14(b)_ being the sole and exclusive remedy for all claims, disputes and
losses arising hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith,
whether purporting to sound in contract or tort, or at law or in equity, or
otherwise.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or otherwise, the parties
to this Agreement agree on their own behalf and on behalf of their respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates that no Non-Recourse Party of a party to this
Agreement shall have any Liability relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated herein except to the extent agreed to in writing by
such Non-Recourse Party.

 



 

13.15 _Deliveries to the Purchaser_. The Purchaser agrees and acknowledges
that all documents or other items delivered in writing (including by
electronic mail) to the Purchaser or its representatives in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or uploaded and made available
in the online "data room" established by Intralinks for "Project Cover" on or
before the date that is one (1) Business Day prior to the date hereof shall be
deemed to have been delivered, provided or made available to the Purchaser or
its representatives for all purposes hereunder.

 



 

13.16 _Conflict Between Transaction Documents_. The parties hereto agree and
acknowledge that to the extent any terms and provisions of this Agreement are
in any way inconsistent with or in conflict with any term, condition or
provision of any other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby,
this Agreement shall govern and control.

 



 

13.17 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that money damages or legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for
any such damages. Therefore, it is accordingly agreed that each party shall be
entitled to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement,
or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of any other
party, in any court of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive
relief shall be granted in connection therewith. Any party seeking an
injunction, a decree or order of specific performance shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection therewith and any such remedy
shall be in addition and not in substitution for any other remedy to which
such party is entitled at law or in equity.

 



 

13.18 _Relationship of the Parties_. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed
to constitute the parties hereto as joint venturers, alter egos, partners or
participants in an unincorporated business or other separate entity, nor in
any manner create any principal-agent, fiduciary or other special relationship
between the parties hereto. No party shall have any duties (including
fiduciary duties) towards any other party hereto except as specifically set
forth herein.

 



 

13.19 _Prevailing Party_. Other than with respect to disputes arising pursuant
to _Section 3.03_, in any dispute arising out of or related to this
Agreement, any of the exhibits or schedules hereto, or any agreement,
document, instrument or certificate contemplated hereby, or any transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, the applicable adjudicating body shall award
to the prevailing party, if any, the costs and attorneys fees reasonably
incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the dispute and the
enforcement of its rights under this Agreement, any of the exhibits or
schedules hereto, or any agreement,

 



      
 

 



 

document, instrument or certificate contemplated hereby and, if the
adjudicating body determines a party to be the prevailing party under
circumstances where the prevailing party won on some but not all of the claims
and counterclaims, the adjudicating body may award the prevailing party an
appropriate percentage of the costs and attorneys fees reasonably incurred by
the prevailing party in connection with the adjudication and the enforcement
of its rights under this Agreement, any of the exhibits or schedules hereto,
or any agreement, document, instrument or certificate contemplated hereby or
thereby.
