action, suit, claim, investigation or other legal proceeding to enforce the Parent Guarantee may be brought and prosecuted against Parent Guarantor, irrespective of whether any such action, suit, claim, investigation or other legal proceeding is
brought against the Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person or whether Parent, Merger Sub and/or any other Person is joined in any such action, suit, claim, investigation or other legal proceeding. The liability of Parent Guarantor under the Parent

other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person shall not relieve Parent Guarantor of any liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies of the Company, whether express,
implied or available as a matter of law. The Company shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to the Guaranteed Obligation in the event that Parent, Merger Sub or Parent Guarantor becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar
proceeding, and the failure of the Company to so file shall not affect the Parent Guarantor&#146;s obligations hereunder. In the event that any payment to the Company in respect of the Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be returned
in the event of any insolvency proceeding, the Parent Guarantor shall remain liable hereunder with respect to the Guaranteed Obligation as if such payment has not been made. The Parent Guarantor irrevocably waives acceptance, presentment, demand,

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The corporation shall indemnify any person who was, is, or is threatened to be made a party to a proceeding (as hereinafter defined) by reason
of the fact that he or she (i)&nbsp;is or was a director or officer of the corporation or (ii)&nbsp;while a director or officer of the corporation, is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, partner, venturer,
proprietor, trustee, employee, agent, or similar functionary of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise, to the fullest extent permitted under the
Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. Such right shall be a contract right and as such shall run to the benefit of any director or officer who is elected and accepts the position of director or officer of
the corporation or elects to continue to serve as a director or officer of the corporation while this <U>Article VIII</U> is in effect. Any repeal or amendment of this <U>Article VIII</U> shall be prospective only and shall not limit the rights of
any such director or officer or the obligations of the corporation with respect to any claim arising from or related to the services of such director or officer in any of the foregoing capacities prior to any such repeal or amendment to this
<U>Article VIII</U>. Such right shall include the right to be paid by the corporation expenses incurred in investigating or defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition to the maximum extent permitted under the Delaware General
Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. If a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses hereunder is not paid in full by the corporation within sixty (60)&nbsp;days after a written claim has been received by the
corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim, and if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall also be entitled to be paid the expenses of prosecuting such
claim. It shall be a defense to any such action that such indemnification or advancement of costs of defense is not permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the corporation. Neither the
failure of the corporation (including its board of directors or any committee thereof, independent legal counsel, or stockholders) to have made its determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of, or advancement of
costs of defense to, the claimant is permissible in the circumstances nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its board of directors or any committee thereof, independent legal counsel, or stockholders) that such indemnification or
advancement is not permissible shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that such indemnification or advancement is not permissible. In the event of the death of any person having a right of indemnification under the foregoing
provisions, such right shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors, administrators, and personal representatives. The rights conferred above shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under
any statute, bylaw, resolution of stockholders or directors, agreement, or otherwise. As used herein, the term &#147;proceeding&#148; means any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
arbitrative, or investigative, any appeal in such an action, suit, or proceeding, and any inquiry or investigation that could lead to such an action, suit, or proceeding. </P>

law, (iii)&nbsp;under Section&nbsp;174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (iv)&nbsp;for any transaction in which the director derived an improper personal benefit. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing paragraph by the stockholders of
