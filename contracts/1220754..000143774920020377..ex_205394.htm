Company shall prepare and deliver to the Purchaser a statement setting forth

Capital Schedule. Following delivery of the Company\'s calculation of the

Company shall consider any reasonable comments provided by the Purchaser in

the Estimated Closing Cash Proceeds, the Estimated Closing Cash Proceeds

to the financial books, records and other documents (including workpapers,

and its Subsidiaries\') employees and advisors (including making the

available to respond to reasonable written or oral inquiries of the Seller or
its representatives); _provided_ , that neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide such access to the extent doing so
would reasonably be expected to (A) result in the waiver of any attorney-
client privilege or other legal privilege ( _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make alternative
arrangements to disclose such information in a manner that does not waive or
violate such privilege) or (B) contravene any applicable contracts or Laws. If
the Seller disagrees with any part of the Purchaser\'s calculation of the
Closing Cash Proceeds as set forth on the Closing Statement, the Seller shall,
within forty-five (45) days after the Seller\'s receipt of the Closing
Statement, notify the Purchaser in writing of such disagreement by setting
forth the Seller\'s calculation of the Closing Cash Proceeds, including each
of the components thereof, and describing in reasonable detail the basis for
such disagreement (an " _Objection Notice_ "). Any items not specifically
identified in the Objection Notice as being in dispute shall be deemed final
and conclusive and binding upon all parties in all respects. Any Objection
Notice may reference only disagreements based on mathematical errors or based
on amounts of Cash, Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses or Working Capital as
reflected on the Closing Statement not being calculated or prepared in
accordance with this Agreement and the Accounting Principles (if applicable).
**** If an Objection Notice is delivered to the Purchaser, then the Purchaser
and the Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve their disagreements
with respect to the computation of the Closing Cash Proceeds. The Purchaser
and the Seller acknowledge and agree that all discussions related to the
Objection Notice are without prejudice communications made in confidence with
the intent of attempting to resolve a litigious dispute and are subject to
settlement privilege. In the event that the Purchaser and the Seller are
unable to resolve all such disagreements within thirty (30) days after the
Purchaser\'s receipt of such Objection Notice or such longer period as the
Purchaser and the Seller may mutually agree in writing, the Purchaser and the
Seller shall submit such remaining disagreements to the purchase price
disputes group of AlixPartners, or, if such firm refuses or is otherwise
unable to act in such capacity, a nationally-recognized valuation or
accounting firm as is acceptable to the Purchaser and the Seller (the "
_Valuation Firm_ ") ( _provided_ any such valuation firm has a division or
group devoted to settling purchase price disputes).

  



  

 

 

 

\- 15 -

   

 



 

 

 

  



  

(f) The Valuation Firm shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator,
and make a final and binding determination with respect to the computation of
the Closing Cash Proceeds, including each of the components thereof, to the
extent such amounts are in dispute, in accordance with the guidelines and
procedures set forth in this Agreement and on _Exhibit_ _B_. The Purchaser and
the Seller shall cooperate with the Valuation Firm during the term of its
engagement and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Valuation Firm to resolve all remaining disagreements with respect to the
computation of the Closing Cash Proceeds, including each of the components
thereof, as soon as practicable. The Valuation Firm shall consider only those
line items and amounts in the Purchaser\'s and the Seller\'s respective
calculations of the Closing Cash Proceeds, including each of the components
thereof, that are in the Objection Notice and identified as being line items
and amounts to which the Purchaser and the Seller have been unable to agree.
In resolving any disputed line item, the Valuation Firm may not assign a value
to any line item in dispute other than either (A) the Purchaser\'s proposed
value for such disputed line item as set forth in the Closing Statement, or
(B) the Seller\'s proposed value for such disputed line item as set forth in
the Objection Notice ( _i.e._ , a "baseball arbitration"), based on whether
the Purchaser\'s or the Seller\'s proposed value of such disputed line item is
closer to the Valuation Firm\'s own calculations for such disputed line item.
Except as permitted on _Exhibit _ _B_ hereto in order to clarify or
understand any position or argument made by a party in a written submission,
the Valuation Firm\'s determination of the Closing Cash Proceeds, including
each of the components thereof, shall be based solely on written presentations
submitted by the Purchaser and the Seller which are in accordance with the
guidelines and procedures (including the definitions of each of the components
thereof) set forth in this Agreement ( _i.e._ , not on the basis of an
independent review). The determination of the Valuation Firm shall be
conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto and shall not be subject to
appeal or further review.

  



  

(g) The costs and expenses of the Valuation Firm in determining the
Closing Cash Proceeds, including each of the components thereof, shall be
borne by the Purchaser, on one hand, the Seller, on the other hand, based upon
the percentage which the portion of the aggregate contested amount not awarded
to each party bears to the aggregate amount actually contested by such party.
For example, if the Purchaser claims the Closing Cash Proceeds are one
thousand dollars ($1,000) less than the amount determined by the Seller, and
the Seller contests only five hundred dollars ($500) of the amount claimed by
the Purchaser, and if the Valuation Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by
awarding the Purchaser three hundred dollars ($300) of the five hundred
dollars ($500) contested, then the costs and expenses of the Valuation Firm
will be allocated sixty percent (60%) ( _i.e._ , 300 ÷ 500) to the Seller and
forty percent (40%) ( _i.e._ , 200 ÷ 500) to the Purchaser. Prior to the
Valuation Firm\'s determination of the Closing Cash Proceeds, (i) the
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand, shall each pay
fifty percent (50%) of any retainer paid to the Valuation Firm and (ii) during
the engagement of the Valuation Firm, the Valuation Firm will bill fifty
percent (50%) of the total charges to each of the Purchaser, on the one hand,
and the Seller, on the other hand. In connection with the Valuation Firm\'s
determination of the Closing Cash Proceeds, the Valuation Firm shall also
determine, pursuant to the terms of the first and second sentences of this
_Section _ _2.04(g)_ , and taking into account all fees and expenses already
paid by each of the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other
hand, as of the date of such determination, the allocation of its fees and
expenses between the Purchaser and the Seller, which such determination shall
be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto.

(h) Within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Cash Proceeds,
including each of the components thereof, is finally determined pursuant to
this _Section _ _2.04_ :

  



  

(i) if the Closing Cash Proceeds as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section _ _2.04_ are less than the Estimated Closing Cash Proceeds, then the
Purchaser and the Seller shall cause the Escrow Agent to: (A) pay to the
Purchaser solely and exclusively from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Funds an amount (which in no case shall exceed the amount of the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Funds) (the " _Purchaser Adjustment Amount_ ") equal
to such deficiency; and (B), if the Purchaser Adjustment Amount is less than
the amount of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds, following payment to
Purchaser of the amount required pursuant to clause (A), pay to the Seller, an
amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the amount of the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Funds is greater than the Purchaser Adjustment Amount; and

  



  

(ii) if the Closing Cash Proceeds as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 2.04_ are greater than the Estimated Closing Cash Proceeds, then the
Purchaser and the Seller shall cause the Escrow Agent to: (A) pay to the
Seller solely and exclusively from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds
an amount (which in no case shall exceed the amount of the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Funds) (the " _Seller Adjustment Amount_ ") equal to such
deficiency, and (B) pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to the amount (if
any) by which the amount of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds is
greater than the Seller Adjustment Amount.

  



  

(i) All payments to be made pursuant to _Section_ _2.04(h)_ shall (x) be
treated by all parties for Tax purposes as adjustments to the purchase price
to the extent permitted by applicable Law and (y) be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by the Purchaser or
the Seller, as applicable. Each party hereby agrees and acknowledges that its
right to any payment to be made pursuant to _Section _ _2.04(h)_ shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of such party for any and all claims arising under
this Agreement with respect to this _Section _ _2.04_.

  



  

2.05 _Withholding_. The Purchaser and its agents shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
Person in such amounts as the Purchaser or such other Person is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or any other applicable provision of Law. The Purchaser or such other Person
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Seller with notice as
soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event at least five (5) Business
Days, prior to withholding any amounts pursuant to this _Section_ _2.05_ , and
shall work in good faith with the Seller to minimize any such withheld
amounts. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and are timely paid over
to the applicable Tax authority in accordance with applicable Law, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

6.08 _Financing_. Purchaser has delivered to the Company true and
complete, fully executed copies of (a) executed commitment letter(s) (as the
same may be amended in accordance with _Section 8.0_ _7_ , the " _Financing
Commitments_ "), pursuant to which the lenders party thereto have agreed,
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to provide or cause to be
provided the debt amounts set forth therein (the " _Financing_ ") (which may
include up to $600,000,000 in bridge financing to be utilized in the event and
to the extent the placement of high yield debt securities in a comparable
amount (the " _High-Yield Financing_ ") is not consummated) and (b) the fee
letter referred to in the Financing Commitment (provided that fee amounts,
market flex and other terms may be redacted in a customary manner (but none of
which redacted provisions adversely affect the availability of, impose
additional conditions on, impair the validity of, or prevent or delay the
consummation of, the Financing at the Closing)). As of the date of this
Agreement, none of the Financing Commitments has been amended or modified and
no such amendment or modification is contemplated (except as permitted by
_Section 8.07_ ), and the respective commitments contained in the Financing
Commitments have not been withdrawn or rescinded. As of the date of this

constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser and, to the
knowledge of Purchaser, the other parties thereto (except to the extent that
enforceability may be limited by the applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,

conditions precedent related to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing other than as set forth in or contemplated by the Financing

of Purchaser, any other party thereto. As of the date of this Agreement,
assuming the satisfaction of the conditions contained in _Sections 3.01_ and
_3.02_ , Purchaser does not have any reason to believe that it will be unable
to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition to be satisfied by it and
contained in the Financing Commitments. Purchaser has fully paid any and all
commitment fees or other fees required by the terms of the Financing
Commitments to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement. Subject to the
terms and conditions of the Financing Commitments and subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions contained in _Sections 3.01_ and _3.02_ , the
aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Financing Commitments will be
sufficient for Purchaser to consummate the purchaser referred to in _Section
2.01_ of this Agreement upon the terms contemplated by this Agreement and pay
all related fees and expenses (the " _Required Amounts_ "). Purchaser
expressly acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not subject to any condition or
contingency with respect to any financing or funding by any third party.

  



  

6.09 _Sufficiency of Funds_. Parent has sufficient cash on hand or from
other sources to pay the Reverse Termination Fee.

  



  

6.10 _Solvency_. Assuming that the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
are solvent as of immediately prior to the Closing, and that the
representations and warranties set forth in Articles IV and V are true and
correct in all respects as of the Closing, immediately after giving effect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (i) the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries will be able to pay their respective debts as they become due

required to pay their respective debts (including a reasonable estimate of the
amount of all contingent liabilities) and (ii) the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries will have adequate capital to carry on their respective
businesses.

Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (" _Section 280G Payments_ "), a
written agreement waiving such Person\'s right to receive some or all of such
payment or benefit (the " _Waived Benefits_ "), to the extent necessary so

Date). The Seller shall provide drafts of all disclosure documents, waivers,

the right of each Person described in _Section_ _7.03(a)_ to receive or
retain, as applicable, such Person\'s Waived Benefits, _provided_ , that in no
event shall this _Section_ _7.03_ be construed to require the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to compel any Person to waive any existing rights under
any contract or agreement that such Person has with the Company, such
Subsidiary or any other Person, and in no event shall the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries be deemed in breach of this _Section_ _7.03_ if any such
Person refuses to waive any such rights or if the equityholders fail to
approve any Waived Benefits.

breach of its obligations under this _Section_ _7.0_ _5_. As used in this
_Section 7.0_ _5_ _(e)_ , "willful and material breach" means a deliberate act
or failure to act, which act or failure to act constitutes in and of itself a

reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the
disclosed Confidential Information; and (iv) disclosure of such Confidential

purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" consists of all
information and data relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries or the
transactions contemplated hereby (other than data or information that is or
becomes available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this
_Section 7.0_ _6_ ).

rights, if any, to pursue any and all claims, actions or rights that such
Seller may now or in future have solely on account of rights of the Seller
under (a) this Agreement or any other documents entered into in connection
herewith or (b) any applicable liability insurance policy covering the
directors, officers and/or similar functionaries of the Seller or any
Subsidiary of the Seller or in respect of any right to indemnification or
advancement of expenses pursuant to any of the Governing Documents of the
Seller or any Subsidiary of the Seller.

8.07 _Financing_.

  



  

(a) Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to
arrange the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing
Commitments (including any flex provisions applicable thereto), including
using commercially reasonable efforts to (A) negotiate definitive agreements
with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the Financing
Commitments, (B) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to
Purchaser in the Financing Commitments that are within its control (or obtain
the waiver of conditions applicable to Purchaser contained in the Financing
Commitments), (C) maintain in full force and effect the Financing Commitments
in accordance with the terms thereof and (D) draw down upon and consummate the
Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments at or prior to the
Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon effectiveness of any Parent

(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (it
being understood that the Seller may withhold its consent to the extent that
the conditions to borrowing under the Parent Credit Facility are less
favorable in any respect when compared to those conditions precedent set forth
in the Financing Commitments as in effect on the date hereof)), Purchaser may
terminate any portion of the commitments under the Financing Commitments on a
dollar-for-dollar basis with the aggregate amount of available and undrawn
commitments under the Parent Credit Facility or (b) subject to prior written
notice to Seller, borrowing under the Parent Credit Facility such amounts that
are escrowed for purposes of consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, Purchaser may terminate any portion of the commitments under
the Financing Commitments on a dollar-for-dollar basis with such amounts that
are escrowed; _provided_ , _that_ , (1) the conditions to the release of such
proceeds from escrow as described in this clause (b) are no less favorable to
Purchaser in any respect when compared to those set forth in the Financing
Commitments as in effect on the date hereof and (2) the aggregate amount of
the Financing following such reduction, together with other financial
resources available to Purchaser (including amounts funded into an escrow
account with release provisions no less favorable in any respect to Purchaser
than the conditions precedent set forth in the Financing Commitments as in
effect on the date hereof), is sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Purchaser shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current
basis and in reasonable detail with respect to all material activity and
developments concerning the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing.

becomes aware, (ii) any termination of the Financing Commitment or (iii) all
or any portion of the Financing becoming unavailable for any reason.

  



  

(c) Purchaser shall not agree to any amendment, supplement, waiver or
other modification of any provision under Financing Commitment without the

modification would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing to less
than the amount required to fund the Required Amounts, (ii) impose new or
additional conditions or expand any of the conditions to the receipt of the
Financing or (iii) materially and adversely affect the ability of Purchaser to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Financing Commitment. For
the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser may modify, amend or supplement the
Financing Commitment to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents, documentation agents or entities in similar roles without modifying
any other terms of the Financing Commitment. Upon any amendment, supplement,
waiver or other modification of the Financing Commitment, Purchaser shall
promptly deliver a copy thereof to the Company.

take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary to arrange to obtain alternative financing in an amount
(together with all other sources of cash that will be available to Purchaser
on the Closing Date) sufficient to fund the Required Amounts, which would not
contain conditions that are materially less beneficial to Purchaser, would not
involve any conditions to funding the Financing of the type that are not
contained in the Financing Commitment and would not reasonably be expected to
prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the Financing or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that Purchaser shall
not be required to pay any fees or expenses materially in excess of those
contemplated by the Financing Commitment as in effect on the date hereof.

  



  

(e) Other than for purposes of _Section 6.0_ _8_ , references herein to
"Financing Commitment" shall include any commitment with respect to any
alternative financing and include and mean such documents as amended,
modified, supplemented or waived in compliance with this _Section 8.07_ , and
references to "Financing" shall include and mean the financing contemplated by

, which shall survive the termination of this Agreement) without any liability
or obligation on the part of any party hereto, (a) other than liabilities and
obligations under the Non-Disclosure Agreement and (b) except, subject to the
limitations set forth in _Section 9.03(c)_ , that no such termination shall
relieve the Seller or the Company of any liability for damages resulting from
any willful breach by such party of this Agreement. For purposes of

times or for the occurrence of different events.

  



  

(b) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that (i) the
agreements contained in _Section 9.03_ are an integral part of this Agreement

of accurately determining actual damages with respect to the foregoing, upon
any such termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(e)_ or
_Section 9.01(_ _f_ _)_ , the right to payment of the Reverse Termination Fee
constitutes a reasonable estimate of the losses that will be suffered by
reason of any such termination of this Agreement and constitutes liquidated
damages (and not a penalty).

assigns of any of the foregoing (each of the foregoing, a " _Purchaser Related
Party,_ " and collectively, the " _Purchaser Related Parties_ ") or the
Financing Source Parties for any losses arising out of or related to this
Agreement (or any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement
or obligation contained herein), the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (or any failure of such transactions to be consummated), the
Financing Commitments, the Financing contemplated therein (or any failure of
such financings to be consummated), or in respect of any oral representations
made or alleged to be made in connection with this Agreement, the Financing
Commitments, the transactions contemplated herein or therein or otherwise;
_provided_ that in no event shall Parent or Purchaser have any monetary
liability or obligations in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in the aggregate in excess of the amount of the Reverse

to receive both a grant of specific performance under _Section_ _13.1_ _8_ and
an award of money damages, including all or any portion of the Reverse
Termination Fee.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the
event the Reverse Termination Fee __ is paid to the Seller, such Reverse
Termination Fee shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Seller
and the Company against the Purchaser Related Parties and the Financing Source
Parties for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions
contemplated hereby to be consummated, and upon payment of the Reverse
Termination Fee none of the Purchaser Related Parties or the Financing Source
Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising

shall be issued or made without the joint approval of the Purchaser and the
Seller, unless (i) required by Law (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
applicable rules and requirements of the Nasdaq stock market or the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission) in which case the other party shall have
the right to review and comment on (which comments the other party shall
consider in good faith) such press release or announcement prior to
publication to the extent reasonably practicable or (ii) any press release or
public statement that is consistent with prior press releases issued or public
statements made in compliance with this _Section 13.01_ ; _provided_ , that
the Seller shall be entitled to communicate with and may disclose the terms

to its direct and indirect equityholders in order that such Persons may
provide information about the subject matter of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated herein to their respective investors and prospective
investors in connection with their ordinary course fundraising and reporting
activities (so long as such recipients of such information agree to or are
bound by contract to keep the terms of this Agreement confidential). For the
avoidance of doubt, each party hereto may make announcements to its respective
employees or other business relations that are not inconsistent in any
material respects with the parties\' prior public disclosures regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

13.04 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or delegated by any party without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto; _provided_ , that Purchaser may (a) transfer or assign,

assignment will relieve Purchaser of any of its obligations hereunder.

13.05 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
prohibited by or invalid under applicable Law, such provision shall be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Agreement.

  



  

13.06 _Construction_. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed
to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual
intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any
Person. The parties hereto hereby agree that time is of the essence with
respect to the performance of each of the parties\' obligations under this
Agreement. The headings of the sections and paragraphs of this Agreement have
been inserted for convenience of reference only and shall in no way restrict
or otherwise modify any of the terms or provisions hereof. The Disclosure
Schedules have been arranged for purposes of convenience in separate sections
corresponding to the sections of _Article IV_ and _Article V_ ; _provided_ ,
that information disclosed on one section of the Disclosure Schedules shall be
deemed to be disclosed on another section of the Disclosure Schedules or be
deemed to be an exception to another representation and warranty in _Article
IV_ or _Article V_ , in each case, if the relevance of such information to
such other section of the Disclosure Schedules is reasonably apparent on its
face. Capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedules and not otherwise
defined therein have the meanings given to them in this Agreement. The
information contained in this Agreement, in the Disclosure Schedules, and
exhibits hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no
information contained herein or therein shall be deemed to be an admission by
any party hereto to any third party of any matter whatsoever (including any
violation of Law or breach of contract).

  



  

13.07 _Amendment and Waiver_. Except as provided herein, any provision of
this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or exhibits hereto may be amended
or waived only in a writing signed by Parent, the Purchaser, the Company and

thereof shall extend to or affect in any way any other provision or prior or
subsequent breach or default.

  



  

13.08 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement and the other agreements,
instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection
herewith (including the Non-Disclosure Agreement) contain the complete
agreement between the parties hereto and supersede any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or between the parties hereto, written or
oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way,
including any letter of intent. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises with respect to this Agreement, the terms and
provisions of the execution version of this Agreement will control and prior
drafts of this Agreement and the documents referenced herein will not be
considered or analyzed for any purpose (including in support of parol evidence
proffered by any Person in connection with this Agreement) and will be deemed
not to provide any evidence as to the meaning of the provisions hereof or the
intent of the parties hereto.

  



  

13.09 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. _Section _ _8.02_ shall be
enforceable by each of the current and former officers, directors or similar
functionaries of the Company and its Subsidiaries and his or her heirs and
Representatives and _Section _ _13.14_ shall be enforceable by KandE LLP.
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, nothing expressed or referred
to in this Agreement will be construed to give any legal or equitable right,
remedy, or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of
this Agreement to any Person other than (i) the parties to this Agreement,
(ii) for purposes of _Section _ _8.02_ , each of the current and former
officers, directors or similar functionaries of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and his or her heirs and Representatives and (iii) for purposes
of _Section _ _13.14_ , KandE LLP. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the
lenders party to the Financing Commitments is a third-party beneficiary of
Sections _13.04_ , _13.07_ , _13.11_ , _13.12_ , _13.13_ , _13.15_ , _13.18_ ,

13.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any signed agreement or
instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts, all of
which shall constitute one and the same instrument. Any such counterpart, to
the extent delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif,
.jpeg or similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an "
_Electronic Delivery_ ") shall be treated in all manner and respects as an
original executed counterpart and shall be considered to have the same binding
legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in
person. At the request of any party hereto, each other party hereto or to any
signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement,
or any amendments hereto or thereto, shall re-execute the original form of
this Agreement, or the applicable signed agreement, instrument or amendment,
and deliver such form to all other parties hereto or thereto. No party hereto
shall raise the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact
that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated
through the use of Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a
contract, and each such party forever waives any such defense, except to the
extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity. Minor variations in the
form of the signature page, including footers from earlier versions of this
Agreement or any such other document, will be disregarded in determining a
party\'s intent or the effectiveness of such signature.

  



  

13.11 _GOVERNING LAW; CHOICE OF LAW_. ALL ISSUES AND QUESTIONS CONCERNING
THE CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE SCHEDULES ATTACHED HERETO AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THE
OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED HEREUNDER SHALL BE INTERPRETED AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE. ANY AND ALL ACTIONS AND CAUSES OF
ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER SOUNDING IN
CONTRACT, TORT OR STATUTE, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF
DELAWARE, INCLUDING ITS STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS (EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY
SET FORTH HEREIN), WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OF LAW OR CONFLICT OF
LAW RULES OR PROVISIONS (WHETHER OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE OR ANY OTHER
JURISDICTION) THAT WOULD RESULT IN THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OR STATUTE OF
LIMITATIONS OF A JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF DELAWARE.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, EACH OF
THE PARTIES HERETO AGREES THAT ALL ACTIONS (AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, IN CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE) AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE PARTY AND EACH OF THEIR
RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE FINANCING COMMITMENT OR THE
PERFORMANCE THEREOF OR THE FINANCINGS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, SHALL BE
EXCLUSIVELY GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAWS
OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

  



  

13.12 _Submission to Jurisdiction_.

  



  

(a) Each of the parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party
or its Affiliates against any other party or its Affiliates shall be brought
and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, _provided_ ,
that if jurisdiction is not then available in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware, then any such legal action or proceeding may be brought in
any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any other Delaware state
court. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of
the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its property, generally
and unconditionally, with regard to any such action or proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Each of the parties agrees not to commence any action, suit or proceeding
relating thereto except in the courts described above in Delaware, other than
actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree
or award rendered by any such court in Delaware as described herein. Each of
the parties further agrees that notice as provided herein shall constitute
sufficient service of process and the parties further waive any argument that
such service is insufficient. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (a) any
claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in
Delaware as described herein for any reason, (b) that it or its property is
exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment
or otherwise) and (c) that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in any such
court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action
or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter
hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

  



  

 

 

 

\- 62 -

   

 



 

 

 

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but
subject to the next sentence, each of the parties hereto agrees that (i) it
will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Source
Parties, in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing Commitments, the
Financing or the definitive agreements executed in connection therewith or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of
New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and, in each case, appellate courts
thereof) and (ii) any such action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-party claim shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York. Each
of the Company and the Seller further agrees that it shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates and its and their direct and indirect stockholders not
to, bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-
party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing Source Party, in
any way relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing
Commitments, the Financing or the definitive agreements executed in connection
therewith or the performance thereof.

  



  

13.13 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING (I) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR
(II) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE
PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED
HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE (INCLUDING, FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT,
ANY SEEKING EQUITABLE RELIEF).

  



  

13.14 _Legal Representation_. Following consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Company and its Subsidiaries\' current and former
legal counsel (including KandE LLP) (each, " _Company Counsel_ ") may serve as
counsel to each and any of the Seller and its Non-Recourse Parties, in
connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
notwithstanding such representation or any continued representation of any
other Person (including the Seller and its direct or indirect equityholders),
and each of the parties hereto (on behalf of itself and each of its Non-
Recourse Parties) consents thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising
therefrom. The decision to represent any of the Seller and its Non-Recourse
Parties shall be solely that of any such Company Counsel. Any attorney-client
privilege, work product protection or expectation of confidentiality
applicable to any communication relating exclusively to the negotiation,
documentation or consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby between
the Company Counsel\'s and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Privileges_ ") shall survive the Closing and shall
remain in full force and effect; _provided_ , that notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement or any Company Document, the Privileges and all
information, data, documents or communications, in any format and by whomever
possessed, covered by or subject to any of the Privileges (collectively, "
_Privileged Materials_ ") shall, from and after the Closing, automatically be
assigned and exclusively belong to, and be controlled by, the Seller. For the
avoidance of doubt, as to any Privileged Materials, the Purchaser and the
Company, together with any of their respective Affiliates, successors or
assigns, agree that no such party may use or rely on any of the Privileged
Materials in any action or claim against or involving any of the parties
hereto or any of their respective Non-Recourse Parties related to the
transactions contemplated hereby after the Closing, and the Seller shall have
the right to assert any of the Privileges against the Company and its
Subsidiaries. The Company further agrees that, on its own behalf and on behalf
of its Subsidiaries, any Company Counsel\'s retention by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall be deemed completed and terminated without any further
action by any Person effective as of the Closing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Parent, the Purchaser or
the Company, on the one hand, and a third party other than Seller, on the
other hand, Parent, the Purchaser or the Company may assert the attorney-
client privilege to prevent the disclosure of the Privileged Materials to such
third party and if requested by Parent, the Purchaser, and Seller shall assert
such privilege; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of Parent, the Purchaser or
the Company may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of
Seller. In the event that Parent, the Purchaser or the Company is legally
required by governmental order or otherwise to access or obtain a copy of all
or a portion of the Privileged Materials, Purchaser shall promptly notify
Seller in writing (including by making specific reference to this _Section 1_
_3_ _.14_ so that Seller can seek (at its expense) a protective order and
Parent and the Purchaser agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to
assist therewith).

13.15 _Non-Recourse Parties_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement or otherwise, the parties to this Agreement agree on their own
behalf and on behalf of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates that no
Non-Recourse Party of a party to this Agreement shall have any liability
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein
except to the extent agreed to in writing by such Non-Recourse Party. The
Seller and the Company each agree that, except with respect to a named party
in this Agreement, (a) neither it nor any of its Affiliates will bring or
support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim
of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract
or in tort or otherwise, against any Purchaser Related Party, in any way
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herby, including
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing
Commitments, the Financing or the definitive agreements executed in connection
therewith or the performance thereof and (b) no Purchaser Related Party shall
have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or
based upon any theory that seeks to impose liability of an entity party
against its owners or Affiliates) to the Seller or the Company or any of its
and their respective Affiliates or their respective directors, officers,
employees, agents, partners, managers or equity holders for any obligations or
liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based
on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, each party (other than the Purchaser or any Affiliate of the Purchaser
that is party to the Financing Commitment in respect of rights, claims, or
causes pursuant to the Financing Commitment) hereby irrevocably waives any
rights or claims against any Financing Source Party in its capacity as a
Financing Source Party in connection with this Agreement, the Financing
Commitment and the Financing or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, agrees not to commence any action or proceeding against any Financing
Source Party in its capacity as the same in connection with this Agreement,
the Financing Commitment or the Financing or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, and agrees to cause any such action or
proceeding asserted against a Financing Source Party to the extent asserted
against a Financing Source Party by the Company, the Seller or any of their
Affiliates in connection with this Agreement, the Financing Commitment or the
Financing or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby to be
dismissed or otherwise terminated. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing waiver, it is acknowledged and agreed that no Financing Source Party
shall have any liability for any claims or damages to any party (other than
the Purchaser or any Affiliate of the Purchaser that is party to the Financing
Commitment in respect of any rights, claims or causes pursuant to the
Financing Commitment) in its capacity as a Financing Source Party in
connection with this Agreement, the Financing Commitment or the Financing or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

13.16 _Deliveries to the Purchaser_. The Purchaser agrees and
acknowledges that all documents or other items delivered in writing (including
by electronic mail) to the Purchaser or its Representatives in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or uploaded and made available
in the online "data room" established by Intralinks for "Project Socrates" on
or before the date that is one (1) Business Day prior to the date hereof shall
be deemed to have been delivered, provided or made available to the Purchaser
or its Representatives for all purposes hereunder.

  



  

13.17 _Conflict between Transaction Documents_. The parties hereto agree
and acknowledge that to the extent any terms and provisions of this Agreement
are in any way inconsistent with or in conflict with any term, condition or
provision of any other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby,
this Agreement shall govern and control.

  



  

13.18 _Specific Performance_.

  



  

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that
money damages or legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such
damages. Therefore, it is accordingly agreed that, subject to _Section
13.18(b)_ , each party shall be entitled to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, provided, that if jurisdiction is not then available in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, then in any state or federal court located
in the State of Delaware, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of any other party, in any court of competent jurisdiction, and
appropriate injunctive relief shall be granted in connection therewith. Any
party seeking an injunction, a decree or order of specific performance shall
not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection therewith
and any such remedy shall be in addition and not in substitution for any other
remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity. Notwithstanding
the foregoing and subject to the rights of the parties to the Financing
Commitments under the terms thereof, none of the Seller or any of its
Affiliates or its and their direct and indirect stockholders shall have any
rights or claims (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) against any
Financing Source Party, solely in their respective capacities as lenders or
arrangers in connection with the Financing.

  



  

(b) No party pursuing an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with this _Section_ _13.18_ will be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection therewith. The remedies
available to the Company and the Seller pursuant to this _Section_ _13.18_
will be in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or
in equity. Subject to _Section 9._ _0_ _3(d)_ , it is acknowledged and agreed
that the Seller shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the
obligation of the Purchaser to cause the Estimated Closing Cash Proceeds to be
funded, but only in the event that each of the following conditions has been
satisfied: (i) all of the conditions set forth in _Section_ _3.01_ and
_Section_ _3.03_ have been fully satisfied or duly waived in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement (other than those conditions that by their terms
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the full satisfaction or
due waiver of those conditions assuming a Closing would occur); (ii) the
Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing; (iii) the
Purchaser is required to complete the Closing in accordance with Article II
and the Purchaser fails to complete the Closing in breach of Article II; and
(iv) the Seller has irrevocably confirmed in writing to the Purchaser that if
specific performance is granted and the Financing is consummated, and the
Purchaser otherwise complies with its obligations hereunder, then the Closing
will occur. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Seller be entitled
to (A) receive both a grant of specific performance and any monetary damages
hereunder and (B) enforce or seek to enforce specifically the Purchaser's
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby if the Financing
has not been funded. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, under no circumstances shall Parent, the Purchaser, any
Financing Source Party or any of their respective Affiliates have any
liability to Seller, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates or any
of their respective direct or indirect equity holders for monetary damages in
excess of the Reverse Termination Fee.

13.19 _Relationship of the Parties_. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed to constitute the parties hereto as joint venturers, alter egos,
partners or participants in an unincorporated business or other separate
entity, nor in any manner create any principal-agent, fiduciary or other
special relationship between the parties hereto. No party shall have any
duties (including fiduciary duties) towards any other party hereto except as
specifically set forth herein.

  



  

13.20 _Guarantee_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in consideration of Seller\'s execution and delivery of this
Agreement and agreement to perform the transactions contemplated hereby, and
as a material inducement to such execution, delivery and performance, Parent
hereby guarantees any payments and other obligations owed by Purchaser to
Seller or the Company pursuant to this Agreement or any other Purchaser
Document (subject to the limitations and conditions, if any, on the
Purchaser's obligations herein). Parent agrees that no waiver or extension, in
whole or in part, of the time for performance by Purchaser of any of its
obligations under this Agreement or any Purchaser Document, and no impairment
of, or exercise or failure to exercise any claim, right or remedy of any kind
or nature in connection with this Agreement or any Purchaser Document shall
affect, impair or discharge, in whole or in part, the liability of Parent
hereunder for the full, prompt and unconditional performance of the
obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement or any Purchaser Document
(subject to the limitations and conditions, if any, on the Purchaser's
obligations herein). The obligations of Parent under this Section 13.20 are
absolute and unconditional, irrespective of any circumstance which may
otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor.
