Purchaser has delivered to the Company true and complete, fully executed copies of (a) executed commitment letter(s) (as the same may be amended in accordance with <u>Section 8.0</u><u>7</u>, the "<u>Financing Commitments</u>"), pursuant to which the lenders party thereto have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to provide or cause to be provided the debt amounts set forth therein (the "<u>Financing</u>") (which may include up to $600,000,000 in bridge financing to be utilized in the event and to the extent the placement of high yield debt securities in a comparable amount (the "<u>High-Yield Financing</u>") is not consummated) and (b) the fee letter referred to in the Financing Commitment (provided that fee amounts, market flex and other terms may be redacted in a customary manner (but none of which redacted provisions adversely affect the availability of, impose additional conditions on, impair the validity of, or prevent or delay the consummation of, the Financing at the Closing)). As of the date of this Agreement, none of the Financing Commitments has been amended or modified and no such amendment or modification is contemplated (except as permitted by <u>Section 8.07</u>), and the respective commitments contained in the Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn or rescinded. As of the date of this Agreement, the Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser and, to the knowledge of Purchaser, the other parties thereto (except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by the applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general principles of equity). There are no conditions precedent related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing other than as set forth in or contemplated by the Financing Commitments. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred that (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) would constitute a breach or default under the Financing Commitments by Purchaser or, to the knowledge of Purchaser, any other party thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions contained in <u>Sections 3.01</u> and <u>3.02</u>, Purchaser does not have any reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition to be satisfied by it and contained in the Financing Commitments. Purchaser has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the terms of the Financing Commitments to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Financing Commitments and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions contained in <u>Sections 3.01</u> and <u>3.02</u>, the aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Financing Commitments will be sufficient for Purchaser to consummate the purchaser referred to in <u>Section 2.01</u> of this Agreement upon the terms contemplated by this Agreement and pay all related fees and expenses (the "<u>Required Amounts</u>"). Purchaser expressly acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not subject to any condition or contingency with respect to any financing or funding by any third party.</p>

In the event that Parent, the Purchaser or the Company is legally required by governmental order or otherwise to access or obtain a copy of all or a portion of the Privileged Materials, Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller in writing (including by making specific reference to this <u>Section 1</u><u>3</u><u>.14</u> so that Seller can seek (at its expense) a protective order and Parent and the Purchaser agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to assist therewith).</p>

Any party seeking an injunction, a decree or order of specific performance shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection therewith and any such remedy shall be in addition and not in substitution for any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the rights of the parties to the Financing Commitments under the terms thereof, none of the Seller or any of its Affiliates or its and their direct and indirect stockholders shall have any rights or claims (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) against any Financing Source Party, solely in their respective capacities as lenders or arrangers in connection with the Financing.</p>
