pay, automobile allowances and rights to company-provided automobiles and
expense reimbursements. (The plans, programs, policies, practices,
arrangements and procedures listed in Schedule 4.7(5)(a) and Schedule

copies of all documentation establishing or relating to the Benefit
Plans (including the documentation provided in respect of the Benefit Plans
of the South American Subsidiaries) or, where such Benefit Plans are oral
commitments, written summaries of the terms thereof, and the most recent
financial statements and actuarial reports related thereto and all reports
and returns in respect thereof filed with any regulatory agency or other
Governmental Authority within three years prior to the date hereof have been
provided to the Purchaser.  
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | The pension plans included in the Benefit Plans are
registered under and are in compliance with all Applicable Laws, and all
reports, returns and filings required to be made thereunder have been made.
Such pension plans have been administered in accordance with their terms and
the provisions of Applicable Law. The booklets, brochures, summaries,
descriptions and manuals prepared for, and circulated to, the employees
concerning each Benefit Plan together with all written communications of a
general nature provided to such employees accurately describe the benefits
provided under each Benefit Plan referred to therein. Each pension plan has
been funded in accordance with the requirements of such plans based on
actuarial assumptions which are appropriate to the employees and the Business.
Based on such assumptions, there is no unfunded liability under any such
pension plan. All contributions or premiums required to be made or paid by
the Corporation or a Subsidiary to the Benefit Plans have been made or paid in
a timely fashion in accordance with the terms of the Benefit Plans and
Applicable Law and all applicable collective bargaining agreements or other
labour union contracts. All employee contributions to the Benefit Plans
required to be made by way of authorized payroll deduction have been properly
withheld and fully paid into the Benefit Plans and the Corporation
or Subsidiary has obtained appropriate consents from employees for such
deductions. No changes have occurred since the date of the most recent
actuarial report provided to the Purchaser in respect of such pension plans
which makes such report misleading in any material respect and, since the
date of such report, neither the Corporation nor any Subsidiary has made or
granted or committed to make or grant any benefit improvements to which
members of the pension plans are or may become entitled which are not
reflected in such actuarial report. None of the Benefit Plans provides post-
retirement benefits to employees or any of their beneficiaries or dependants.

investigation, examination or other proceeding, action or claim (other than
routine claims for payment of benefits) initiated by any Governmental
Authority, employee, beneficiary or dependant covered under any such Benefit
Plan, or other Person, and there exists no state of facts which after notice
or lapse of time or both could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such
investigation, examination or other legal proceeding or to affect the
registration of any Benefit Plan required to be registered. No event has
occurred respecting any registered Benefit Plan which would entitle any
Person (without the consent of the Corporation or a Subsidiary) to cause the
wind-up or termination of such Benefit Plan in whole or in part. No insurance
policy or any other contract or agreement affecting any Benefit Plan requires
or permits a retroactive increase in premiums or payments due thereunder. The
level of insurance reserves in respect of each insured Benefit Plan is
reasonable and sufficient to provide for all incurred but unreported claims. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | There are no current or pending claims by any employee
covered under the Benefit Plans or by any other Person which allege a breach
of fiduciary duties or violation of Applicable Law or which may result in
liability to the Corporation or any Subsidiary and, to the best of the
Corporations knowledge, there is no basis for such a claim. There are no
employees or former employees who are receiving from the Corporation or any
Subsidiary any pension or retirement payments, or who are entitled to receive
any such payments, not covered by a pension plan to which the Corporation or a
Subsidiary is a party.

representations to employees, nor does there exist any undertaking or
commitment, whether legally binding or not, to create any additional Benefit
Plan or to change or modify any existing Benefit Plan. No contractors,
consultants, agents or agency employees are eligible for or entitled to
benefits under any Benefit Plan, and no promise or commitment has been made
to any such Person with respect to coverage under any Benefit Plan. 
---|---|--- 



     | (g) | The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not constitute an event under any Benefit Plan or Contract with
a present or former employee, consultant, contractor, agent, director or
officer, which will or may result in any severance or other payment or in the
acceleration, vesting or increase in benefits with respect to any present or
former employee, consultant, contractor, agent, director or officer.

Purchase, will not constitute or result in a violation or breach of or default

Subsidiary from any federal, provincial, municipal or other Governmental
Authority. Complete and correct copies of all documents relating to the

addition, prior to the Closing, the Corporation shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the agreement of Deloitte and Touche that it will, subject to
its reasonable review of the Form 8-K or any Offering Document, as the case
may be, and the completion of its customary procedures in connection

respect to any audited financial statements of the Corporation and the
Subsidiaries to be included in the Form 8-K or to the inclusion or
incorporation by reference of such opinion in any Offering Document, with

such reorganizations of the business, operations and assets of the Corporation
and the Subsidiaries or such other transactions as the Purchaser may
reasonably request (each a "Pre-Acquisition Reorganization"), and shall co-
operate with the Purchaser and its representatives in order to determine the
nature of any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization that might be undertaken and the
manner in which it might most effectively be undertaken. Neither the

respect; (iii) cannot be completed immediately prior to or on the Closing
Date; or (v) would require the Corporation or a Subsidiary to contravene any

10 Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Upon receipt of such notice, the

has been breached.

any Subsidiary to, undertake any reorganization or enter into any
transactions or series of transactions that would have the effect of
preventing Purchaser or its Affiliates from obtaining the benefit of a full
tax cost "bump" pursuant to paragraphs 88(1)(c) and (d) of the Tax Act in
respect of the non-depreciable capital properties owned by the Corporation and
its Canadian Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement or acquired by such
entities subsequent to the date of this Agreement in accordance with the

approval of, the Purchaser.

(2) Notice by the Vendors. No Damages may be recovered from the Purchaser
pursuant to Section 8.3(a) unless a Notice of Claim is delivered by the
Vendors within 18 months of the Closing Date. Unless a Notice of Claim has
been given within such time period with respect to each
particular representation and warranty, the Purchaser shall be released from
all obligations in respect of that particular representation and warranty and
from the obligation to indemnify the Vendors in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 8.3(a). This Section 8.6(2) shall not be construed to impose any time
limit on the Vendors right to assert a claim to recover Damages under Section
8.3(b), whether or not the basis on which such a claim is asserted could also
entitle the Vendors to make a claim for Damages pursuant to Section 8.3(a).

Section 8.7 Direct Claims

 

With respect to a Direct Claim, the Indemnifier shall have a period of 30 days
from receipt of a Notice of Claim in respect thereof within which to
investigate and respond to the Indemnified Party in writing to such Direct
Claim. The Indemnified Party shall make available to the Indemnifier the
information relied upon by the Indemnified Party to substantiate its right to
be indemnified, together with all other information as may be reasonably
requested by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifier does not so respond
within such period, the Indemnifier shall be deemed to have rejected such
Direct Claim, in which event the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue
such remedies as may be available to it.

Section 8.8 Interest

 

All amounts to be paid by an Indemnifier hereunder shall bear interest at a
rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate, calculated and payable monthly, both
before and after judgement, with interest on overdue interest at the same
rate, from the date that the Indemnified Party disbursed funds, or gave a
Notice of Claim pursuant to Section 8.5, to the date of payment by the
Indemnifier to the Indemnified Party.

 



(60)  Section 8.9 No RestrictionFraud

 

Nothing in this Agreement shall limit any Persons right to seek and obtain
any relief (including equitable relief) to which any Person is entitled or to
seek any remedy on account of any Persons fraudulent, criminal or intentional
misconduct.

Section 8.10 General Limitations

An Indemnifier shall have no liability to an Indemnified Party hereunder:

 



     | (a) | for any liability that arises as a result of any legislation
not in force on, and not announced by a Governmental Authority prior to, the
date hereof which takes effect retrospectively; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | in respect of any matter of thing done or omitted to be done
by or at the direction or with the consent of the Indemnified Party; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | in respect of more than one representation, warranty or
covenant that relates to the same matter or thing; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | to the extent that provision or reserve in respect of the
matter giving rise to such liability is made in the Closing Financial
Statements. 
---|---|--- 
 

Section 8.11 Exclusive Remedy

The rights of indemnity set forth in this Article 8 are the sole and exclusive
remedy of each Party in respect of any misrepresentation or breach of warranty
by the other Party under this Agreement, other than those arising from fraud.
This Article 8 shall remain in full force and effect in all circumstances and
shall not be terminated by any breach (fundamental, negligent or otherwise) by
any Party of its representations, warranties or covenants hereunder or under
any documents delivered pursuant hereto or by any termination or rescission of
this Agreement by any Party.

ARTICLE 9  CLOSING

Section 9.1 Closing

(61)  ARTICLE 10  TERMINATION

 

Section 10.1 Termination Rights

This Agreement may be terminated on or prior to the Closing Date:



     | (a) | by mutual written agreement of the Vendors Representative
and the Purchaser; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | by Notice given by the Purchaser to the Vendors
Representative as permitted in Section 7.1 for failure of a condition to be
satisfied if the Purchaser has not waived such condition at or prior to
Closing; 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | by Notice given by the Vendors Representative to the

---|---|--- 

Section 10.2 Effect of Termination

(1) Each Partys right of termination under this Article is in addition to any
other rights it may have under this Agreement or otherwise, and the exercise
of a right of termination will not be an election of remedies. Nothing in this
Article limits or affects any other rights or causes of action any Party may
have with respect to the representations, warranties, covenants and
indemnities in its favour contained in this Agreement. If a Party waives
compliance with any of the conditions, obligations or covenants contained in
this Agreement, the waiver will be without prejudice to any of its rights of
termination in the event of non-fulfilment, non-observance or non-performance
of any other condition, obligation or covenant in whole or in part.

(2) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1, all obligations
of the Parties under this Agreement will terminate, except that:

 



     | (a) | each Partys obligations under Section 6.4 and Section 6.5
will survive; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | if this Agreement is terminated by a Party because of a
breach of this Agreement by the other Party or because a condition for the
benefit of the terminating Party has not been satisfied because the other
Party has failed to perform any of its obligations or covenants under this
Agreement, the terminating Partys right to pursue all legal remedies will
survive such termination unimpaired.  
---|---|---
