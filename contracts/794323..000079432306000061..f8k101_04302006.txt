Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective

Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Date, shall be converted into the right to receive:

<PAGE>

     (e) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Warrant shall by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub, be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder
thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Date
upon compliance with Section 4.2(c) hereof, from Parent or the Surviving
Company, the consideration such Company Warrant would have received if such
holder would have effected a cashless exercise of such Company Warrant pursuant
to Section 3.02(d) of the applicable Warrant Agreement immediately prior to the
Effective Time (and assuming a Current Market Price of One Share of Common Stock
(as defined in the applicable Warrant Agreement) equal to the Per Share Merger
Consideration), and the shares of Company Common Stock issued upon such cashless
exercise were converted in the Merger pursuant to Section 4.1(b) hereof;
provided, however, that any Company Warrant with an exercise price per share in
excess of the Per Share Merger Consideration shall terminate and cease to be
exercisable as of the Effective Date and no holder of any such Company Warrant
shall be entitled to any payment with respect to such termination (the "Warrant
Consideration").

     Section 4.2. Exchange of Certificates.

     (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Date, Parent
shall mail to each holder of Company Common Stock (other than holders of
Excluded Shares) and Company Warrant (i) a letter of transmittal containing
customary provisions (the "Letter of Transmittal"), which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificate or
certificates representing such Company Common Stock and Company Warrant (the
"Certificates") shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to Parent and
shall otherwise be in such form and contain such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify, including an acknowledgement by Warrantholders that the
Company Warrants will be deemed cancelled upon consummation of the Merger, and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of such Certificate or
Certificates for cancellation to Parent or to such agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, for
each share formerly represented by each such Certificate, Parent shall promptly
deliver to each such Stockholder and Warrantholder (A) by check or by wire
transfer of immediately available funds for amounts in excess of $5,000,000, the
Cash Consideration or the cash portion of the Warrant Consideration payable to
such Stockholder with respect to such shares pursuant to Section 4.1 hereof, and
(B) certificates representing the Share Consideration or the share portion of
the Warrant Consideration issuable to such holder with respect to such shares
pursuant Section 4.1 hereof, and after the Effective Date, if applicable, any
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock to be
issued or paid pursuant to Section 4.3 hereof.

     (b) In the event that any certificates for any shares of Parent Common
Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificates
representing shares of Company Common Stock or Company Warrants surrendered in
exchange therefor are registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that
the certificate or certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed with a
medallion guarantee or be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such exchange shall pay to Parent any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of the issuance of certificates for such shares of Parent
Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Company
that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.

     (c) Until surrendered, Certificates representing shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Warrants shall represent solely the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, and after the Effective Date, if applicable, any dividends or
other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid
pursuant to Section 4.3 hereof, in each case, without any interest thereon with
respect to Parent Common Stock. Neither Parent nor any Party hereto shall be
liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Warrants for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
escheat laws. If any Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock
entitled to be exchanged for Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 4.1 hereof
shall not have been surrendered for such exchange prior to the first anniversary
of the Closing Date, such shares of Company Common Stock shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, be deemed to be cancelled and no Merger
Consideration shall be due to the holder thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither Parent nor any Party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of
Company Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable escheat laws.

     (d) Each of the Surviving Company and Parent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to
this Article IV such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state,
local or foreign tax law. If the Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may
be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Capital
Stock in respect of which the Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may be,
made such deduction and withholding.

     Section 4.3. Dividends and Other Distributions. All shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding
on the Effective Date and whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared
by Parent in respect of the Parent Common Stock, the record date for which is on
or after the Effective Date, that declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions in respect of all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No
dividends or other distributions that are declared or made on Parent Common
Stock will be paid to Persons entitled to receive certificates representing
Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement until such Persons surrender
their Certificates representing Company Common Stock or Company Warrants.
Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the certificates
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock, as the case may be, issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Date and
a payment date on or prior to such time of surrender payable with respect to
such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and not paid and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with
respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Date but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

     Section 4.4. No Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing
less than one share of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates representing Company Common Stock or Company
pursuant to Section 4.1 hereof. Any fractional shares that would otherwise be
issuable pursuant to Section 4.1 hereof shall be rounded up to the nearest whole
number.

                                       12

     Section 4.5. Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and an indemnity agreement in an amount determined by Parent
or Parent agent by such Person at such Person's sole cost and expense against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, Parent
will pay and issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 4.2 hereof in respect of the
shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.

     Section 4.6. Closing of the Company's Transfer Books. At the Effective
Date, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of
shares of Company Common Stock or Company Warrants shall be made thereafter. In
the event that, after the Effective Date, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Company, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Article IV.

     Section 4.7. Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place (i) at the offices of Willkie Farr &
Gallagher LLP, 787 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019, at 9:00 A.M. local

writing (other than those conditions that are not capable of being satisfied
until the Closing, but subject to the waiver in writing or satisfaction of these
conditions) or (ii) at such other time and place as Parent and the Company shall
agree in writing (the "Closing Date").

     Section 4.8. Additional Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Date,
the Surviving Company shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Company its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,

Parent within sixty (60) days through the exercise of its reasonable best

forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part
of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, or their respective officers, directors,
stockholders, or other Persons under their control, except to the extent that
such termination results from the breach by a party hereto of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, and provided that the provisions of Articles XIII and XV hereof shall
remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement.
