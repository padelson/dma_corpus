days after the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Statement have been received

and Sellers proposed adjustments to the Closing Balance Sheet and/or
Closing Statement. If Sellers do not give notice of dispute to Buyers within
such 30-day period in accordance with the foregoing, the Closing Balance
Sheet and Closing Statement as prepared by Buyers shall become final and
binding upon Sellers. If Sellers do give notice of dispute to Buyers within
such 30-day period, Buyers and Sellers shall endeavor in good faith to reach
agreement on all of the disputed items. If the parties are unable to reach an
agreement on the disputed items during a 30-day period (or such longer period
as mutually agreed to by Sellers and Buyers) following Buyers receipt of the
dispute notice, then the disputed items which have not been resolved shall
be 

 

    ##### 

  

   

submitted to the accounting firm of Ernst and Young LLP, Houston, Texas (and if
for any reason it is unwilling or unable to serve, then another
independent accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Sellers and Buyers) for
determination and resolution on the basis of such procedures as such
accounting firm, in its sole judgment, deems applicable and appropriate,
taking into account GAAP and the terms of this Agreement. Sellers and Buyers
shall have the right to make a written submission to such accounting firm
regarding the disputed items. Such accounting firm shall review the disputed
matters and as promptly as practicable deliver to Buyers and to Sellers a
statement setting forth its determination as to the proper treatment of
the matters in dispute, and such determination shall be final and binding
upon Buyers and Sellers without any further right of appeal. All charges of
such accounting firm and other expenses directly incurred in making such
determination shall be borne by the party against whom the majority of items
were determined (based on amounts in dispute). The Closing Net Working
Capital as of the Closing Date as finally determined in accordance with this
Section 2.6(c) are referred to herein as the " _Closing Net Working
Capital_." 

  

(d) Within five (5) days after the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Statement
become final as provided in Section 2.6(c), the parties shall make the
following adjustments: 

   

(i) if the Closing Net Working Capital minus the Target Net Working Capital
(such difference, which may be a positive or negative number, the " _Net
Working Capital Adjustment_ ") is greater than the Estimated Net Working
Capital Adjustment, Buyers shall pay to OFS ES an amount equal to such
difference; or 

   

(ii) if the Net Working Capital Adjustment is less than the Estimated Net
Working Capital Adjustment, Sellers shall pay to Key the amount of such
excess. 

  

(e) Any payment in respect of an adjustment required to be made under Section
2.6(d) will be made by Buyers or Sellers, as applicable, in cash by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by OFS ES or
Key, as applicable, in writing. If any amount is due from Sellers under
Section 2.6(d)(ii), then Sellers shall be jointly and severally responsible
for the payment obligations under Section 2.6(d)(ii). Any payment made in
respect of an adjustment required to be made under Section 2.6(d) shall be
deemed to be, and Buyers and Sellers shall treat such payment as, an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal, state, local and foreign
income Tax purposes. 

   

Section 2.7 Tax Treatment; Allocation of Purchase Price. 

  

(a) The Buyers and Sellers intend that for federal and applicable state income
tax purposes that the acquisition of the Equity Interests be treated as a
purchase of the assets of each Subsidiary as each Subsidiary is an entity
disregarded for federal income tax purposes. 

  

(b) Not later than ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Buyers shall
prepare a schedule allocating the Purchase Price and other amounts paid by
Buyers to Sellers among the assets included in the Purchased Assets,
including the non-solicitation covenant in Section 5.21, in a manner
consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and the applicable Treasury
Regulations (the " _Draft Purchase Price Allocation_ "). Sellers shall have
fifteen (15) days after receipt of the Draft Purchase Price Allocation to
provide Buyers with written notice of any objections to such allocation. If
Sellers do not provide written notice of any objections within such 15-day
period, the Draft Purchase Price Allocation shall become final (the " _Final
Purchase Price Allocation_ "). If Sellers provide written notice of any
objections to the Draft Purchase Price Allocation within such 15-day period,
Sellers and Buyers shall negotiate in good 

 

    ##### 

  

   

faith to agree upon a revised allocation, and any such agreed upon allocation
shall become the Final Purchase Price Allocation. If Sellers and Buyers
cannot agree upon a revised allocation within thirty (30) days following
Sellers written notice of any objections to the Draft Purchase Price
Allocation, then Buyers shall engage the accounting firm of Ernst and Young
LLP, Houston, Texas (and if for any reason it is unwilling or unable to
serve, then another independent accounting firm mutually agreed upon by
Sellers and Buyers) to resolve such dispute. Such accounting firm shall review
the disputed matters and as promptly as practicable deliver to Buyers and
Sellers a statement setting forth its determination as to the proper
treatment of the matters in dispute, and such determination shall constitute
the Final Purchase Price Allocation and shall be final and binding upon Buyers
and Sellers without any further right of appeal. All charges of such
accounting firm and other expenses directly incurred in making such
determination shall be borne by the party against whom the majority of items
were determined (based on amounts in dispute). The Final Purchase
Price Allocation shall be binding on Sellers and Buyers for Tax purposes and
each shall file their Tax Returns, in a manner consistent with such
allocation and not take any contrary position in any Tax Return, audit or
examination. If, subsequent to the Closing, any change in the
consideration within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections
1.1060-1(e)(ii)(B), including the Net Working Capital Adjustment and release
of the Holdback Shares, Sellers and Buyers shall allocate such change among
the assets included in the Purchased Assets in a manner consistent with this
Section 2.7(b), including the dispute resolution process contained herein.
All Key Shares shall be valued in accordance with Section 7.2(i), and any
imputed interest with respect to the Holdback Shares shall be treated as
interest and not part of the Purchase Price. 

   

Section 2.8 Certain Costs, Fees and Expenses. 

  

Buyers and Sellers shall each pay and otherwise be responsible for one-half of
all filing fees required in connection with filing of the Notification and
Report Forms under the HSR Act. Buyers shall pay and otherwise be responsible
for any sales, use, transfer, value added (to the extent not creditable),
stock, documentary and real property transfer Tax or similar Taxes and all
recording and filing fees that may be imposed, assessed against or incurred
by either party to this Agreement as a result of the Transaction; provided
that the parties to this Agreement shall fully cooperate with each other to
minimize the aggregate amounts that would otherwise be payable under
this Section 2.8. 

   

Section 2.9 Receipts After Closing.

EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO THE EXPRESS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SPECIFICALLY
SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT, SELLERS AGREE THAT
BUYERS MAKE NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (A) AS TO KEY OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES

Section 5.8 Construction of Certain Provisions. 

  

It is understood and agreed that the specification of any dollar amount in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion
of any specific item in the Disclosure Schedule is not intended to imply that
such amounts or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included or other
items, are or are not material, and no party hereto shall use the fact of
the setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in
the Disclosure Schedule in any dispute or controversy between the parties as
to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in
the Disclosure Schedule is or is not material for purposes of
this Agreement. 

   

Section 5.9 Assignment of Contracts. 

  

To the extent the assignment of any insurance policy, Contract, Lease, Permit,
commitment or other asset to be assigned by Sellers to Buyers pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement shall require the consent of any other person,
this Agreement shall not constitute a contract to assign the same if an
attempted assignment would constitute a breach thereof or give rise to any
right of acceleration or termination. If any such consent is not obtained
prior to Closing, Sellers shall cooperate with Buyers at their request in
endeavoring to obtain such consent promptly, and if any such consent is
unobtainable, to use its reasonable efforts to secure to Buyers the
benefits thereof in some other manner, including enforcement of any and all
rights of Sellers against the other party thereto arising out of breach or
cancellation thereof by such other party or otherwise (including, to the
extent permissible, through a sub-contracting, sub-licensing, sub-
participation or sub-leasing arrangement, or an arrangement under which
Sellers would enforce such insurance policy, Contract, Lease, Permit,
commitment or other asset for the benefit of Buyers, with Buyers, to the
extent permissible, assuming Sellers executory obligations and any and all
rights of Sellers against the other party thereto); provided that nothing
herein shall relieve Sellers of their respective obligations under Section
5.2. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

Section 5.10 Post-Closing Cooperation. 

  

(a) Records. During the Access Period, Buyers shall maintain all Business
Records of the Subsidiaries in a reasonably accessible location. Buyers shall
notify Sellers prior to disposing of any such Business Records after the
Access Period has expired and, upon request made by either Seller within 60
days after receipt of such notice, Buyers shall deliver such Business Records
to such Seller, at such Sellers expense; provided that Buyers obligations
under this Section 5.10(a) shall expire on the date beginning 60 days after
such Sellers receipt of such notice unless such Seller has requested such
Business Records within such 60-day period. In the absence of bad faith or
willful misconduct, Buyers will not have any liability arising out of or in
connection with its retention and handling of such Business Records. 

  

(b) Access. For a period of three years after the Closing Date, in recognition
of Sellers obligations under this Agreement and the other reasonable needs
of Sellers, after the Closing, Buyers shall, and shall cause the Subsidiaries
to (i) afford the officers, employees and authorized agents and
representatives of Sellers access, during normal business hours, to their
offices, properties and Business Records of the Subsidiaries, (ii) furnish to
the officers, employees and authorized agents and representatives of Sellers
such additional financial and other information regarding the Subsidiaries
and the Business for the period prior to the Closing as Buyers and
the Subsidiaries each has in its possession and as Sellers may from time to
time reasonably request, and (iii) make available, at Sellers expense, the
employees of Buyers whose assistance, testimony or presence is necessary to
assist Sellers in evaluation of and in defending any Tax or other claim or
litigation against Sellers, including assuring the presence of such persons as
witnesses in hearings or trials; provided that Buyers shall be reimbursed for
their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with clauses
(ii) and (iii) above. 

   

Section 5.11 Right to Update. 

  

From and after the date hereof until the earlier of three (3) days prior to
the Closing or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, Sellers shall have the right (but not any obligation) to update or
amend in any respect its disclosure of any matter set forth or permitted to
be set forth in the Disclosure Schedule if such matter arises (or, in the case
of matters for which such Sellers disclosure obligation is limited to the
knowledge of Sellers, is discovered) after the date hereof. No such update or
amendment shall (a) be considered or given effect for purposes of determining
the satisfaction of the conditions of Buyers set forth in Article VI, (b)
affect in any respect Buyers rights of termination and waiver set forth in
Article VIII or (c) affect in any respect Buyers right or claim pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, including pursuant to Article VII
hereof, with respect to such disclosures. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
such updates or amendments (y) would permit Buyers to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d) and (z) Buyers do not do so and the
Closing shall occur, then Buyers shall be deemed to have waived any right or
claim pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, including
pursuant to Article VII hereof, with respect to such disclosures. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

Section 5.12 Tax Matters. 

  

(a) Liability. Except as provided in Section 2.8 and this Section 5.12 and
pursuant to Article VII, Sellers shall indemnify and hold harmless each Buyer
Indemnified Party against all Taxes applicable to the Business and the
Subsidiaries that are attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period to the
extent they exceed any reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve
for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and
Tax income) reflected in the Pro Forma Unaudited Balance Sheet (the " _Seller
Indemnified Tax Liabilities_ "). Buyers shall be liable for and pay, and
pursuant to Article VII shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers against all
Taxes applicable to the Business and the Subsidiaries that are attributable to
all Post-Closing Tax Periods (the " _Buyer Indemnified Tax Liabilities_ ").
For purposes of this Section 5.12, any Overlap Period shall be treated on a
"closing of the books" basis as two partial periods, one ending at the close
of business on the Closing Date and the other beginning on the day after the
Closing Date, except that Taxes imposed on a periodic basis, such as ad
valorem Taxes, shall be allocated on a daily basis. Any franchise or similar
Tax paid or incurred with respect to a Subsidiary shall be allocated to the
period in which the gross receipt, gross margin, earned surplus, assets,
capital or other item comprising the base for such Tax arose, and not to
the privilege or other period of doing business funded by such Tax. Thus, for
the avoidance of doubt, all Texas franchise Tax attributable to the sale of
the Business and for operations on or before the Closing Date shall be borne
exclusively by the Sellers. 

  

(b) Reimbursement. Sellers or Buyers, as the case may be, shall provide
reimbursement for any Tax paid by one party all or a portion of which is the
responsibility of the other party in accordance with the terms of this
Section 5.12. Within a reasonable time prior to the payment of any such Tax,
the party paying such Tax shall give notice to the other party of the Tax
payable and the portion which is the liability of each party, although
failure to do so will not relieve the other party from its liability
hereunder. 

  

(c) Tax Returns for Periods Ending On or Prior to Closing Date. Sellers shall
prepare or cause to be prepared, and Buyers shall file or cause to be filed,
all Tax Returns of the Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date which are due after the Closing Date. Except to the extent
otherwise required by law, such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis
consistent with the past practices of such entities. Sellers shall permit
Buyers to review and comment on each such Tax Return described in the
preceding sentence no less than 20 days prior to filing and shall make such
revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by Buyers. 

  

(d) Tax Returns for Overlap Period Taxes. Buyers shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and shall file or cause to be filed all Overlap Period Tax Returns
of the Subsidiaries. Except to the extent otherwise required by law, all Tax
Returns prepared pursuant to this Section 5.12(d) shall be prepared on a
basis consistent with the past practices of such entities. Buyers shall
permit Sellers to review and comment on each such Tax Return no less than 30
days prior to filing and shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are
reasonably requested by Sellers. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(e) Cooperation. After the Closing Date, and upon reasonable written request
of the other party, Sellers and Buyers will provide each other with such
cooperation and information as such parties may reasonably request in filing
any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, determining a
liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes or participating in
or conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes. Such
cooperation and information shall include providing copies of relevant Tax
Returns or portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules and related
work papers and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by Tax
Authorities, but in no event shall the parties be required to disclose
to each other any information relating to their business operations other
than the operation of the Business prior to the Closing Date. Each party
shall make its employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
explanations of any documents or information provided hereunder.
Any information provided or obtained under this Section 5.12 shall be kept
confidential, except as may otherwise be necessary in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other
Tax Proceeding. 

  

(f) Information. Each party shall provide the other with the requisite
information reasonably requested by the other party to allow the preparation
of any federal, foreign, state and local income Tax Returns for Tax Periods
prior to and including the Closing Date. Such information shall be provided,
in the Tax information reporting format customarily used by Sellers, on or
before 60 days, to the extent reasonably practicable, after the Closing
Date. 

  

(g) Notification. The parties (as appropriate) shall promptly notify each
other in writing upon receipt of notice of any pending or threatened Tax
audits or assessments relating to the Business for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period. 

  

(h) Tax Proceeding. If a Tax Authority commences any audit, examination,
litigation or otherwise makes any claim or proposes any adjustment that
relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than an Overlap Period)
(collectively, a " _Tax Proceeding_ "), then Buyers shall promptly furnish
written notice to Sellers of such Tax Proceeding and, if Buyers are seeking
an indemnity under Article VII, a Claim Notice. Sellers shall have the
shorter of (i) 45 days after receipt of such notice or (ii) 15 days less than
the number of days before a response to the relevant Tax Authority is
required, but in no event shall Sellers have less than 15 days, to
decide whether to undertake, conduct and control (through counsel of its own
choosing and at its own expense) the response to such Tax Proceeding and the
settlement or defense thereof, and Buyers and the Subsidiaries shall
cooperate with Sellers in connection therewith. Sellers shall permit
Buyers and the Subsidiaries to participate in such response, settlement or
defense through counsel chosen by Buyers (but the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be paid by Buyers or their affiliates). To the extent any
settlement adversely affects Buyers or any Subsidiary in a Post-Closing
Tax Period, Sellers shall not pay or settle any such claim without the prior
written consent of Buyers (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). If within the shorter of (x) 45 days after the
receipt of Buyers notice of a Tax Proceeding or (y) 15 days less than
the number of days before a response to the relevant Tax Authority is
required (but in no event less than 15 days), Sellers do not notify Buyers
that Sellers elect (at their cost and expense) to undertake the defense
thereof, or give such notice and thereafter fail to contest such claim
in good faith or to prevent action to foreclose a lien against or attachment
of Buyers property as contemplated above, then Buyers shall have the right
to contest, settle or compromise such Tax Proceeding and Buyers shall not
thereby waive any right to indemnity for such Tax Proceeding under this
Agreement; provided that Buyers shall not, and shall cause the Subsidiaries
not to, pay or settle any such Tax Proceedings without the prior written
consent of Sellers (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). However, Buyers shall not be obligated to file or
assist with the preparation of any amended Tax Return for any Pre Closing Tax
Period or any Overlap Period, and Sellers shall not file an amended Tax
Return for any Subsidiary (other than federal income Tax Returns that include
the operations of the Subsidiaries) without the Buyers prior written consent
which may be withheld in Buyers sole discretion. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(i) Overlap Period Tax Proceeding. If a Tax Authority commences any audit,
examination, litigation, or otherwise makes any claim or proposes any
adjustment that relates to an Overlap Period (collectively, an " _Overlap
Period Tax Proceeding_ "), then Buyers shall promptly furnish written notice
to Sellers of such Overlap Period Tax Proceeding and, if Buyers are
seeking indemnity under Article VII, a Claim Notice. Buyers shall undertake,
conduct and control (through counsel of its own choosing and at its own
expense) the response to such Overlap Period Tax Proceeding and the
settlement or defense thereof. Sellers and their respective affiliates
shall cooperate with Buyers in connection therewith, and Buyers shall permit
Sellers to participate in such response, settlement or defense through
counsel chosen by Sellers (but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be
paid by Sellers). To the extent any settlement adversely effects Sellers in a
Pre-Closing Tax Period, Buyers shall not pay or settle any such claim without
the prior written consent of Sellers (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). If within the shorter of (x) 45 days after
the receipt of Buyers notice of an Overlap Period Tax Proceeding or (y) 15
days less than the number of days before a response to the relevant Tax
Authority is required (but in no event less than 15 days), Buyers fail to
contest such claim in good faith or to prevent action to foreclose a lien
against or attachment of Buyers property as contemplated above, then Sellers
shall have the right to contest, settle or compromise such Overlap Period Tax
Proceeding and Sellers shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity for such
Overlap Period Tax Proceeding under this Agreement; provided, that Sellers
shall not pay or settle any such Overlap Period Tax Proceeding without the
prior written consent of Buyers (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

   

Section 5.13 Employees. 

   

(a) General. 

   

(i) Effective upon the Closing and except as otherwise set forth in Section
5.13(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, Buyers will, or cause Subsidiaries to,
(x) offer or continue to employ all of the Seller Groups salaried and hourly
employees who are actively at work in the Business immediately prior to the
Closing Date and (y) offer or continue to employ any employee who is on
short-term medical leave, any disability leave, or other leave of absence on
the Closing Date, in each case, subject to such terms and conditions of
employment as Buyers shall determine and subject to Buyers hiring practices
and procedures. Sellers will provide Buyers access to all of the Seller
Groups salaried and hourly employees at least 20 days prior to Closing for
purposes of implementing the matters set forth in this Section 5.13. Such
employees of the Seller Group who are employed by Buyers or the
Subsidiaries after the Closing shall be referred to as " _Transferring
Employees_." Employees or independent contractors of the Seller Group who
terminate employment or services with any of the Subsidiaries or Sellers on
or before the Closing Date are referred to as " _Former Employees_." 

   

    ##### 

 

   

(ii) Effective upon the Closing, Key Texas shall, to the maximum extent
permitted by law, assume or the Subsidiaries shall retain the Sellers
Benefit Plans sponsored and maintained by the Seller Group related to the
Business listed in Schedule 2.3(d) and Section 3.10(p) of the Disclosure
Schedule. In addition, except for obligations and liabilities with respect to
WARN, Key Texas shall assume or the Subsidiaries shall retain,
all employment, compensation or benefit obligations and liabilities with
respect to Former Employees and Transferring Employees (collectively, the "
_Employees_ "), without regard to whether such obligations result from claims
incurred or related to events occurring before or after the Closing Date,
other than Sellers liabilities in Schedule 2.4(g). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Key Texas shall not assume any such liabilities with respect to
Former Employees who were solely employees or independent contractors of the
Sellers (including such persons listed in Section 3.10(m) of the Disclosure
Schedule). 

   

(iii) Buyers will have sole responsibility for any obligations or liabilities
to the Transferring Employees under WARN for all the members of the Seller
Groups locations, and Buyers agree to hold Sellers harmless for same.
Buyers indemnification of Sellers in this regard specifically includes any
claim by Transferring Employees for back pay, front pay, benefits, or
compensatory or punitive damages, any claim by any governmental unit
for penalties regarding any issue of prior notification (or any lack thereof)
of any plant closing or mass layoff occurring on or after the Closing Date;
provided that Sellers acknowledge and agree that the Buyers obligation under
this Section 5.13(a)(iii) is made in express reliance on the Sellers
representations and warranties in Section 3.10(a)(x), and the Buyers shall
have no obligation to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties under
this Section 5.13(a)(iii) if such representations and warranties are not true
and correct in all respects. 

   

(b) Transferring Employees. 

   

(i) Nothing contained in this Section 5.13(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall require Buyers (or the Subsidiaries) to continue any Buyer Plan or
Sellers Benefit Plan after the Closing. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall be construed to prevent the termination of employment of any
Transferring Employee or any change in the employee benefits available to any
Transferring Employee or the amendment or termination of any particular Buyer
Plan or Sellers Benefit Plan. 

   

(ii) Subject to Section 5.13(b)(i) above, Buyers will provide Transferring
Employees with benefits under Buyer Plans (including any Sellers Benefit
Plan continued by Subsidiaries or assumed by Key Texas) substantially
comparable to the benefits provided to similarly situated employees of
Buyers, if any, otherwise as determined by Buyers in their sole discretion.
Buyers shall cause each Buyer Plan to count service, as recognized by
the Seller Group under the Sellers Benefit Plans prior to Closing, for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting or benefit determination, to
the same extent service was recognized on behalf of Transferring Employees
under analogous Sellers Benefit Plans, except where such service recognition
causes a duplication of benefits and except with respect to any defined
benefit pension plan of Buyers or any plan subject to Title IV of ERISA.
Buyers will give credit to Transferring Employees for earned but unused
vacation and accrued vacation under Sellers Benefit Plans determined as of
the Closing Date. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(iii) With respect to the Sellers Severance Plan, for any Transferring
Employees participating in the Hourly Severance Plan at Closing, Buyers agree
to continue (or to cause Subsidiaries) to provide any and all severance
benefits set forth in and under the terms of the Hourly Severance Plan or a
similar plan or program of Buyers to such Transferring Employees for a period
of six months following the Closing, and for any Transferring Employees
participating in the Salaried/Office Severance Plan, the Field
Employees Severance/Retention Plan, or the Houston Employees
Severance/Retention Plan at Closing, Buyers agree to provide any and all
severance benefits and any remaining retention benefits set forth in and
under the terms of the Salaried/Office Severance Plan, the Field
Employees Severance/Retention Plan, the Houston Employee Severance/Retention
Plan or a similar plan or program of Buyers to such Transferring Employees
for a period of 12 months following Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if any Transferring Employee is terminated after Closing for failure to
satisfy Buyers hiring practices and procedures, Buyers shall not
be obligated to provide such Transferring Employee with severance benefits or
retention benefits under any Sellers Severance Plan or any similar plan or
program of Buyers. Sellers agree to reimburse Buyers, promptly upon written
request (but in no later than seven (7) business days of such request), for
any amounts paid by Buyers to the Transferred Employees pursuant to Section
4.3 of the Houston Employee Severance/Retention Plan or a similar plan or
program of Buyers. 

   

(iv) In the event that a Transferring Employee makes a voluntary election
pursuant to Section 401(a)(31) of the Code to rollover such Transferring
Employees account balance in the OFS Holdings 401(k) Plan (the " _Sellers 
401(k) Plan_") to a tax-qualified defined contribution plan sponsored by the
Buyers or any of their affiliates, the Buyers agree to cause such tax-
qualified defined contribution plan to accept such rollover to the
extent permitted by law; provided that no Sellers 401(k) Plan loans to any
Transferring Employee may be transferred to a tax-qualified defined
contribution plan sponsored by the Buyers. 

  

(c) COBRA. Sellers shall retain all obligations and liabilities under COBRA or
similar state law with respect to any qualified beneficiaries or qualifying
events prior to Closing and with respect to any MandA qualified beneficiary for
employees (and their respective dependents) who were employees of Sellers and
who were not also employees of any Subsidiary. Sellers shall retain
all obligations and liabilities under WARN with respect to Former
Employees. 

  

(d) Obligations. It is intended by the parties that the responsibilities,
liabilities, and covenants assumed or agreed to by Buyers pursuant to this
Section 5.13 shall also bind any affiliate of Buyers to which all or any
portion of the Business is transferred, and Buyers agree to cause any such
affiliate to observe the provisions and covenants of this Section 5.13. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(e) Transaction Bonus Plan. For a period commencing on the date of this
Agreement and ending one-year after Closing, without the prior written
consent of Key, Sellers agree not to amend or modify the transaction bonus
plan and the individual award agreements identified on Schedule 5.13(e) in a
manner that would increase or decrease, or accelerate or delay the payment
of, the benefits thereunder, except for such amendments or modifications as
may be required to provide for the payment of separate bonuses at Closing
related to Quail Nuclear Specialty Services, LLC, a Texas limited liability
company. 

  

(f) Reporting Requirements. Sellers and Buyers hereby agree to utilize the
"Alternate Procedure" set forth in Revenue Procedure 2004-53, Section 5.01,
2004-2 CB 320, or a corresponding future revenue procedure or other
administrative pronouncement, with regard to the reporting requirements
attributable to wages paid or to be paid to Transferring Employees. 

  

(g) No Third Party Rights. No Employee including any beneficiary or dependent
thereof, or any other person not a party to this Agreement, shall be entitled
to assert any claim hereunder. 

  

(h) Costs. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.13, where this
Section 5.13 requires a party to take any action or perform any task, the
party obligated to take such action or perform such task shall be responsible
for all fees, costs and other expenses incurred for, and related to, such
actions or tasks. 

   

Section 5.14 Repayment of Indebtedness; Release of Liens. 

  

Prior to or simultaneously with the Closing, Sellers shall, and shall cause
the Subsidiaries to, discharge or cause to be discharged, all Closing Date
Indebtedness of OFS ES and the Subsidiaries (including any prepayment
penalties and costs associated therewith), and cause the release of all
Encumbrances securing such Indebtedness. 

   

Section 5.15 Title Insurance and Survey. 

  

With respect to all Real Property and Material Leased Property, if requested
by Buyers, Sellers shall use, and shall cause their Subsidiaries to use,
their commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyers in obtaining (a) title
insurance commitments for each parcel of Real Property and Material Leased
Property and ALTA/ACSM title insurance policies in accordance with the
title insurance commitments, in each case from a nationally recognized title
insurance company, (including any commercially reasonable affidavits such
title insurance company might require); and (b) a survey for each parcel of
Real Property and Material Leased Property conforming to the minimum standard
detail requirements jointly established in 1999 by ALTA and ACSM, including
any Table A items reasonably requested by Buyers. 

   

Section 5.16 Intercompany Arrangements. 

  

(a) Except for the intercompany trade receivables and payables set forth on
Schedule 5.16 (which schedule shall be updated at Closing to reflect changes
thereto that were incurred in the Ordinary Course from the date hereof to the
Closing Date), prior to the Closing, Sellers shall, and shall cause their
respective affiliates to, take such action and make such payments as may
be necessary so that, prior to or concurrently with the Closing, the
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Sellers and their respective affiliates
(excluding the Subsidiaries), on the other hand, shall settle, discharge,
offset, pay or repay in full all intercompany loans, notes, and
advances regardless of their maturity and all intercompany receivables and
payables for the amount due, including any accrued and unpaid interest to but
excluding the date of payment; provided, however, that if each such item is
not paid in full in cash, the method of discharge must be
reasonably satisfactory to Buyers. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) Except as otherwise agreed by Sellers and Buyers, Sellers shall, and shall
cause their respective affiliates to, take such actions as may be necessary
to terminate prior to or concurrently with the Closing all agreements between
the Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Sellers and their respective
affiliates (excluding the Subsidiaries), on the other hand, such that none
of the Subsidiaries has or will have any liabilities or obligations under any
such agreement as of the Closing Date. 

   

Section 5.17 Listing of the Key Shares. 

  

Prior to the Closing, Key shall prepare and submit to the New York Stock
Exchange a subsequent listing application covering all of the Key Shares, and
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain approval for the
listing of such Key Shares. 

   

Section 5.18 Registration of the Key Shares. 

  

(a) Shelf Registration Rights. After the Closing, Key shall no later than 90
days after the Closing Date (with such 90-day period being extended by such
additional number of days attributable to any delay caused by any act or any
failure to act by any of the Holders or their counsel), prepare and file with
the SEC a registration statement on Form S-3 or any successor form,
provided that if Key is not eligible to use Form S-3 or any similar short
form registration statement, then Key shall prepare and file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-1 or any successor form (the " _Shelf
Registration Statement_ "), covering the resale by the Holders, from time
to time, of the Key Shares and use all commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective as soon as
practical thereafter under the Securities Act; provided, however, that Key
shall not be obligated to file such Shelf Registration Statement, or keep
such Shelf Registration Statement effective pursuant to Section 5.18(c)(i),
during any Black-out Period; 

   

(b) Piggyback Registration Rights 

   

(i) _Piggyback Registration_. If after the date that is one (1) year after
the Closing Date, Key shall determine to register the offer and sale for cash
of any of the Key Common Stock for its own account, other than (A) a
registration relating solely to employee benefit plans or securities issued
or issuable to employees, consultants (to the extent the securities owned or
to be owned by such consultants could be registered on Form S-8) or any of
their Family Members (including a registration on Form S-8), (B) a
registration on Form S-4 in connection with a merger, acquisition,
divestiture, reorganization, exchange offer or similar event, or (C) a
registration in which the only Key Common Stock being registered is Key
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of debt securities that are also being
registered, then (subject to Section 5.18(b)(iii)) Key shall promptly give to
the Holders written notice thereof, and in no event shall such notice be
given less than 10 days prior to the filing of the registration statement
(each a " _Piggyback Registration Statement_ ") with respect to such
registration (each a " _Piggyback Registration_ "), and shall, subject to
Section 5.18(b)(ii) and Section 5.18(b)(iii), include in such Piggyback
Registration, all of the Key Shares specified in a written request or
requests, made within 5 days after receipt of such written notice from Key,
by any Holder or Holders. However, Key may, without the consent of the
Holders, withdraw such Piggyback Registration Statement prior to its becoming
effective if Key has elected to abandon the proposal to register the
securities proposed to be registered thereby. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(ii) _Underwriting_. If a Piggyback Registration is for a registered
public offering involving an underwriting, Key shall so advise the Holders in
writing or as a part of the written notice given pursuant to Section
5.18(b)(i). In such event the right of any Holder to registration pursuant to
Section 5.18(b)(i) shall be conditioned upon such Holders participation in
such underwriting and the inclusion of such Holders Key Shares in the
underwriting to the extent provided herein. All Holders proposing to
distribute their securities through such underwriting shall (together with
Key) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the
underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting by Key.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5.18(b)(ii), if
the underwriter or Key determines that marketing factors require a limitation
of the number of  shares to be underwritten, the underwriter may exclude some
or all Key Shares from such registration and underwriting. Key shall so
advise all Holders (except those Holders who failed to timely elect to
distribute their Key Shares through such underwriting or have indicated to
Key their decision not to do so), and the number of Key Shares that may
be included in the registration and underwriting shall be allocated: (A)
first to Key; and (B) then to all selling stockholders, including the
Holders, who have requested to sell in the registration on a pro rata basis
according to the number of shares requested to be included. 

   

No Key Shares excluded from the underwriting by reason of the underwriters
marketing limitation shall be included in such registration. If any Holder
disapproves of the terms of any such underwriting, such Holder may elect to
withdraw therefrom by written notice to Key and the underwriter. The Key
Shares and/or other securities so withdrawn from such underwriting shall also
be withdrawn from such registration; provided, however, that, if by the
withdrawal of such Key Shares a greater number of Key Shares held by other
Holders may be included in such registration (up to the maximum of any
limitation imposed by the underwriters), then Key shall offer to all Holders
who have included Key Shares in the registration the right to include
additional Key Shares pursuant to the terms and limitations set forth herein
in the same proportion used above in determining the underwriter
limitation. 

   

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section
5.18(b), Key shall not be obligated to effect, or take any action to effect,
any registration pursuant to Section 5.18(b) after Key has initiated one (1)
such registration (counting for this purpose only a registration which has
been declared or ordered effective and pursuant to which securities have been
sold). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(c) Registration Procedures. In the case of each registration, qualification,
or compliance effected by Key pursuant to Section 5.18(a) and Section
5.18(b), Key will keep each Holder including securities therein reasonably
advised in writing (which may include e-mail) as to the initiation of each
registration, qualification, and compliance and as to the completion thereof.
In addition, Key hereby agrees as follows with respect to each Registration
Statement: 

   

(i) to prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to
the Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith
(the " _Prospectus_ ") (and all applicable reports required by the Exchange
Act and reports incorporated therein by reference, each on a timely basis) as
may be necessary to keep the Registration Statement current, effective and
free from any material misstatement or omission to state a material fact for
a period ending on the date that is, with respect to each of the Key Shares,
the earlier of (i) the second anniversary of the Closing Date, (ii) the date
on which all of the Key Shares have been sold under the Registration Statement
or (iii) the date on which all of the Key Shares may be immediately sold by
all Holders without registration, and without restriction as to the number of
securities to be sold, pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act (or any
similar provision then in force under applicable securities laws); 

   

(ii) so long as a Holder holds Key Shares, to provide a reasonable number of
copies to and permit single legal counsel designated by OFS ES to review the
Registration Statement and Prospectus and all amendments and supplements
thereto, no fewer than two (2) business days prior to their filing with the
SEC, and not file any Registration Statement or Prospectus amendment or
supplement thereto which a Holder reasonably objects in writing within such
two (2) business day period; 

   

(iii) to furnish to the Holders with respect to the Key Shares registered
under the Registration Statement such reasonable number of copies of the
Prospectus, including any supplements and amendments thereto, promptly
following the effectiveness of such Registration Statement and from time to
time upon request thereafter in order to facilitate the sale of Key Shares
under the Registration Statement; 

   

(iv) to immediately notify each Holder of the issuance by the SEC of any stop
order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the
initiation of any proceedings for such purpose; 

   

(v) to make commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any
order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement at the
earliest possible moment; 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(vi) to, as soon as practicable, notify each Holder of the existence of any
fact which results in the Registration Statement, any amendment or post-
effective amendment thereto, the Prospectus, or any prospectus supplement
(including in each case any document incorporated therein by reference)
containing an untrue statement of a material fact or omitting to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading and shall (except during a Black-out
Period) prepare a supplement or post-effective amendment to such Registration
Statement or the Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference
or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the
purchasers of the Key Shares, the Prospectus will not contain an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading; provided that this clause (vi)
shall in no way limit Keys right to suspend the right of the Holders to
effect sales under the Registration Statement during any Black-out Period as
specified in Section 5.19(d); 

   

(vii) to use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify such
Key Shares under such securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as
any Holder reasonably requests and to do any and all other acts and things
which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable such Holder to
consummate the disposition in all such jurisdictions of the Key Shares owned
by such Holder; provided, however, that Key shall not be required to (A)
qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not
otherwise be required to qualify but for this clause (vii), (B) subject
itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction, or (C) consent to general
service of process in any such jurisdiction; and 

  

(viii) to bear all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of Key, OFS ES and the
Holders in connection with the procedures in paragraphs (i) through (viii) of
this Section 5.18(c) and the registration of the Key Shares pursuant to the
Registration Statement, other than selling brokerage fees, commissions and
taxes incurred by the Holders, if any, and the fees and expenses of
legal counsel and other advisors of OFS ES and the Holders. 

   

Section 5.19 Resales by Holders. 

  

(a) Except for transfers to Permitted Transferees, OFS ES agrees, and will
cause each Permitted Transferee to agree, not to (A) offer for sale, sell,
pledge, or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction or device that
is designed to, or could be expected to, result in the disposition by any
person at any time in the future of) any of the Key Shares, or announce
any intention to do any of the foregoing, or (B) enter into any swap or other
derivatives transaction that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any
of the economic benefits or risks of ownership of the Key Shares, whether any
such transaction described in clause (A) or (B) above is to be settled by
delivery of the Key Shares or other securities, in cash or otherwise (the "
_Lock-Up_ "), for a period commencing at the Closing Date and ending on the
date that is 180 days after the Closing Date (the " _Lock-Up Period_ "). Upon
the expiration of the Lock-Up Period, the Holders may sell or dispose of
their Key Shares only in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
pursuant to (A) a registration statement covering Key Shares as set forth
in Section 5.18, (B) in accordance with Rule 144 (or any similar provision
then in force under applicable securities laws) of the Securities Act, (C) as
permitted under the Securities Act and other applicable federal or state
securities laws or (D) pursuant to an underwritten offering. Following the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, no later than three (3) business days
after the delivery by a Holder to Key or its transfer agent (with notice to
Key) of a legended certificate or instrument representing the Key Shares held
by such Holder (endorsed or with stock powers attached, signatures
guaranteed, and otherwise in form necessary to affect the reissuance and/or
transfer of such Key Shares) and a customary Rule 144 representation letter
confirming acquisition date and affiliate status, Key shall deliver or cause
to be delivered to such Holder a certificate or instrument (as the case may
be) representing such Key Shares that is free from all restrictive legends. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 5.19,
with respect to each Equity Securities Offering conducted after the Closing
Date, the following provisions of this Section 5.19(b) shall apply, if the
underwriters or initial purchasers retained by Key to facilitate such
offering request, in connection with such offering, that the officers or
directors or significant stockholders of Key refrain from selling any
Relevant Security during any period: 

   

(i) Without the prior written consent of Key, during the Market Standoff
Period applicable to such Equity Securities Offering, each Holder will not
(A) offer for sale, sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any
transaction or device that is designed to, or could be expected to, result in
the disposition by any person at any time in the future of) any of the Key
Shares, or announce any intention to do any of the foregoing, or (B) enter
into any swap or other derivatives transaction that transfers to another,
in whole or in part, any of the economic benefits or risks of ownership of
the Key Shares, whether any such transaction described in clause (A) or (B)
above is to be settled by delivery of the Key Shares or other securities, in
cash or otherwise; provided, however, that a transfer to a Permitted
Transferee will not be subject to this Section 5.19(b). 

   

(ii) Furthermore, each Holder hereby authorizes Key during the Market Standoff
Period to cause any transfer agent for the Key Shares to decline to transfer,
and to note stop transfer restrictions on the stock register and other
records relating to, any Key Shares for which such Holder is the record
holder and, in the case of Key Shares for which such Holder is the beneficial
owner but not the record holder, agrees during the Market Standoff Period to
cause the record holder thereof to cause the relevant transfer agent to
decline to transfer, and to note stop transfer restrictions on the stock
register and other records relating to, such Key Shares. 

  

(c) OFS ES agrees, and will cause each Permitted Transferee to agree, that it
will comply with the requirement under the Securities Act of delivering the
most current Prospectus in connection with any sale of Key Shares made under
the Registration Statement. 

  

(d) OFS ES hereby covenants, and will cause each Permitted Transferee to
covenant, that it will not sell any Key Shares pursuant to the Prospectus
during the period commencing at the time at which Key gives such Holder
notice of the happening of any event of the kind described in
Section 5.18(c)(vi) or of the beginning of a Black-out Period until such
Holders receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus
contemplated by Section 5.18(c)(vi) or notice of the end of the Black-out
Period, and, if so directed by Key, such Holder shall deliver to Key (at
Keys expense) all copies (including any and all drafts), other than
permanent file copies, then in such Holders possession, of the Prospectus
covering such Key Shares current at the time of receipt of such notice. 

  

(e) OFS ES shall notify, and shall cause each Permitted Transferee to notify,
Key at least two business days prior to the date on which it intends to
commence effecting any resales of Key Shares under a Registration Statement
and if Key does not, within such two day period, advise such Holder of the
existence of any facts of the type referred to in Section 5.18(c)(vi), then
Key shall be deemed to have represented to such Holder that no such facts then
exist and such Holders may rely on such representation in making such
sales. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(f) OFS ES may furnish, and each Permitted Transferee may furnish, to Key such
information required under Regulation S-K under the Securities Act regarding
it and its proposed plan of distribution as shall be requested by Key in
connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and will
promptly notify Key of any changes in such information. No Holder of Key
Shares will be entitled to have such Key Shares included in the Registration
Statement if such Holder does not furnish such information requested by
Key. 

  

(g) Key and OFS ES hereby agree, and OFS ES shall cause each Permitted
Transferee to agree, from and after the Closing to indemnify one another with
respect to the resale of Key Shares pursuant to the provisions set forth in
_Exhibit C_. 

  

(h) OFS ES will notify, and shall cause each Permitted Transferee to notify,
Key when all of the Key Shares held by such Holder have been sold pursuant to
the Registration Statement. 

  

(i) Key agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all
of the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations adopted by the SEC under each thereof, and to take such further
action as any Holder may reasonably request, all to the extent required to
enable such Holder to sell, without registration, the Key Shares pursuant to
Rule 144 (or any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC),
including furnishing to any Holder, so long as such Holder owns any Key
Shares, forthwith upon request (i) a written statement by Key as to its
compliance with the reporting requirements of Rule 144, the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act and (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly
report of Key and such other reports and documents so filed by Key as may be
reasonably requested in availing any such Holder of any rule or regulation of
the SEC that permits such Holder to sell any Key Shares
without registration. 

   

Section 5.20 Exclusivity. 

  

Buyers have expended significant resources and time in connection with the
review and diligence of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Accordingly, Sellers will not, and will not cause or permit the Subsidiaries
or any affiliate of Sellers or the Subsidiaries or anyone acting at Sellers
or any affiliate of Sellers direction or on any affiliate of Sellers or
any Subsidiarys behalf to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate or
encourage proposals regarding, negotiate with, deliver any information to or
enter into any agreement with any other party with respect to the direct or
indirect transfer of any of the Equity Interests, the Incidental Assets, the
Second Tier Equity Interests or the assets of any Subsidiary (except
for sales of assets by Subsidiaries in the Ordinary Course) (an "
_Alternative Transaction_ ") and (b) notify Buyers in writing of any contact
(irrespective of the form of communication) between Sellers, the
Subsidiaries, or any affiliate of Sellers or the Subsidiaries, or anyone
acting at Sellers or any affiliate of Sellers direction or on any affiliate
of Sellers or any Subsidiarys behalf, and any other person with respect to
any Alternative Transaction, and shall promptly provide Buyers with copies of
any documents received relating to any Alternative Transaction and will keep
Buyers informed regarding the status and details of any such communications
between Sellers and their affiliates (or any person acting at Sellers or
any affiliates direction or on behalf of Sellers or any of Sellers
affiliates) and any such persons regarding any Alternative Transaction. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

Section 5.21 Solicitation of the Employees, Customers and Suppliers. 

  

(a) Sellers covenant and agree that beginning on the Closing Date and
continuing for a period of 18 months thereafter (the " _Non-Solicitation
Period_ "), neither Sellers nor any affiliates of Sellers will anywhere in
the United States (including the Parishes of the State of Louisiana set forth
in Schedule 5.21(a)) (the " _Non-Solicitation Area_ ") (i) solicit or hire any
of the employees of the Subsidiaries who are employed by the Subsidiaries or
were employed by the Subsidiaries within the 12-month period prior to the
Closing, (ii) interfere with the relationship of the Subsidiaries with any
such employees or (iii) solicit or call on any person who is, was or had been
at any time within the 12-month period prior to the Closing, a customer,
client or a supplier of the Subsidiaries or the Business or attempt to
solicit or call on any of the foregoing, in each case for the purpose of
engaging in the Business. Sellers agree that the restrictions contained in
this Section 5.21 are reasonable as to time and geographic scope because of
the nature of the business of the Subsidiaries and Sellers agree, in
particular, that the geographic scope of this restriction is reasonable
because companies engaged in the Business compete throughout the Non-
Solicitation Area. Sellers acknowledge that the Subsidiaries are in direct
competition with all other companies engaged in the Business throughout the
Non-Solicitation Area, and because of the nature of such businesses, Sellers
agree that the covenants contained in this Section 5.21 cannot reasonably be
limited to any smaller geographic area. 

  

(b) Sellers agree that a remedy at law for any breach or attempted breach of
this Section 5.21 will be inadequate and that any breach of this Section 5.21
will result in irreparable harm to Key and the Business. Sellers further
agree that in the event of breach of this Section 5.21 by either Seller or
any affiliate of such Seller, Key will be entitled to obtain injunctive relief
to enforce the terms of this Section 5.21. Whenever possible, each provision
of this Section 5.21 shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective
and valid under applicable law but if any provision of this Section 5.21
shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision
shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Section 5.21. If any provision of this Section 5.21 shall, for any
reason, be judged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or
unenforceable, such judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the
remainder of this Section 5.21 but shall be confined in its operation to the
provision of this Section 5.21 directly involved in the controversy in which
such judgment shall have been rendered. In the event that the provisions of
this Section 5.21 should ever be deemed to exceed the time or geographic
limitations permitted by applicable law, then such provision shall be
reformed to the maximum time or geographic limitations permitted by
applicable law. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

Section 5.22 Key Board. 

  

In connection with the negotiation, consideration and approval of this
Agreement, the Board of Directors of Key (the " _Key Board_ ") has determined
that immediately following the Closing, the Key Board will create one new
directorship with a term expiring at the 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders
of Key and that OFS ES will have the right to designate one nominee to be
appointed by the Key Board to fill such newly created directorship. Such
nominee shall at all times meet the definition of "independent director" as
set forth in the marketplace rules of the New York Stock Exchange and the
nomination of such director shall satisfy Keys corporate governance and
other policies that are related to the nomination and service of
directors, including its Selection Process for New Director Candidates, Code
of Business Conduct for Directors and Ethics, and Affiliate Transaction
Policy. If such nominee resigns, dies or is removed at any time prior to the
2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Key and at that time ArcLight
Energy Partners Fund III, L.P. (" _ArcLight_ ") Beneficially Owns Key Shares
representing at least 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of Key Common
Stock, OFS ES will have the right to designate a nominee to be appointed by
the Key Board to fill such vacancy; provided that such director shall at all
times meet the definition of "independent director" as set forth in the
marketplace rules of the New York Stock Exchange and the nomination of such
director shall satisfy Keys corporate governance and other policies that are
related to the nomination and service of directors, including its Selection
Process for New Director Candidates, Code of Business Conduct for
Directors and Ethics, and Affiliate Transaction Policy and provided that
nothing in this Section 5.22 shall be construed to limit the fiduciary duties
of the Key Board under the Maryland General Corporation Law. Prior to being
appointed to the Key Board, (i) any OFS ES nominee shall enter into a
letter agreement with Key, reasonably satisfactory to Key, whereby such
nominee resigns, subject to the Key Boards discretion to decide not to
accept such resignation, if at any time after the Closing Date ArcLight no
longer Beneficially Owns Key Shares representing at least 5% of the issued
and outstanding shares of Key Common Stock, and (ii) ArcLight shall enter
into a letter agreement with Key whereby, if at any time after the Closing
Date, ArcLight no longer Beneficially Owns Key Shares representing at least
5% of the issued and outstanding shares of Key Common Stock, ArcLight
shall promptly notify Key of such event (but in any event within three (3)
business days after such event). 

   

Section 5.23 Insurance Arrangements. 

  

(a) The members of the Seller Group are the primary named insureds with
respect to all insurance coverage applicable to the Business for periods
prior to Closing. Buyers and Sellers agree that, upon Closing, all insurance
coverage provided in relation to the Business pursuant to any such policies
shall be terminated, provided that the Subsidiaries shall retain the benefit
of the policies of insurance in relation to liabilities for events occurring
prior to Closing but in respect of which no claim has yet arisen at the time
of Closing. Sellers agree to be responsible for, and to pay, any liabilities
arising from final audits under all such policies, and Sellers shall
indemnify Buyers with respect to any such liabilities. 

  

(b) Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Buyers to be
named as additional insured persons under each liability policy of insurance
with coverage applicable to the Business that is in effect as of the Closing
Date, but only with respect to claims arising from events occurring prior to
the Closing Date. Sellers shall cause to be delivered to Buyers evidence of
such additional insured status. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(c) Buyers and Sellers agree that, upon the request of Buyers, any claims made
under the insurance policies applicable to the Business maintained by Sellers
and referred to in Section 5.23(a) in respect of the Business shall be
administered and collected by Sellers (or by a claims handler appointed by
Sellers) on behalf of Buyers. Buyers shall cooperate with Sellers to
enable Sellers to comply with the requirements of the relevant insurer, and
Buyers shall provide such information and assistance as Sellers may
reasonably request in connection with any such claim. Sellers shall pursue
claims on behalf of Buyers or the Subsidiaries for recovery in respect of the
policies attributable to the Business as requested by Buyers. Any monies
received by Sellers as a result of such claims and allocable to the Business
shall be paid over to the Subsidiaries or Buyers, net of all reasonable costs
and expenses of recovery (including all reasonable handling and collection
charges by any claims handler appointed by Sellers). Buyers agree to
reimburse Sellers for any deductibles, payments following reservations of
rights or similar payments relating to the Subsidiaries that are billed to
Sellers as the holder of the policy in connection with the type of claims
described in this paragraph, and Buyers shall indemnify Sellers with respect
to any such amounts. 

   

Section 5.24 Sellers Commitments. 

  

Schedule 5.24 lists Sellers Commitments for the benefit of the Subsidiaries
with respect to the Business as of the date of this Agreement. Among the
Commitments, members of the Seller Group maintain one or more facilities with
financial institutions that provide for issuance of letters of credit or bank
guarantees for benefit of the Subsidiaries (the " _Letters of Credit_
"). Following the Closing, Buyers agree that they will use commercially
reasonable efforts (i) to cause the parties holding the Letters of Credit to
release to Sellers or cancel the Letters of Credit and (ii) to cause the
Commitments listed on Schedule 5.24 (other than Letters of Credit) to be
replaced and cause the beneficiaries of the Commitments to release Sellers
from the obligations thereunder. For purposes of this Section 5.24, "
_Commitment_ " shall mean any Letters of Credit and any financial commitment
or support provided by Sellers to enable one or more Subsidiaries to
issue performance bonds, guarantees, bid bonds, letters of credit, bank
guarantees or similar instruments or to incur indebtedness. Sellers shall
provide such assistance as is reasonably requested by Buyers in connection
with the foregoing. 

   

Section 5.25 Monthly Financial Statements. 

  

The Sellers shall deliver to Buyers, as soon as reasonably practicable, but in
no event later than 30 days after the end of such period, the unaudited
combined balance sheets and statements of income and cash flow of OFS ES and
the Subsidiaries as of and for each month ended after the date of this
Agreement until the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Monthly
Financial Statements_ "). The Monthly Statements shall be prepared on a basis
consistent with the manner in which the Pro Forma Unaudited Balance Sheet was
prepared, and shall be consistent with the books and records of OFS ES and
the Subsidiaries.

ARTICLE VI 
 CLOSING 

    

Section 6.1 Time and Place of Closing. 

  

The closing of the Transaction (the " _Closing_ ") will be held at 10:00 a.m.
local time at the offices of Porter and Hedges, L.L.P., 1000 Main Street, 36th
Floor, Houston, Texas 77002 on the date 5 business days after the later to
occur of the following: (a) the termination of the waiting periods under the
HSR Act, or (b) the fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth
in Section 6.2 and Section 6.3, at such time and place as the parties shall
agree, or on such other date, and at such time and place, as the parties may
agree. Notwithstanding that the events under clauses (a) and (b) of the
immediately preceding sentence have occurred, unless otherwise agreed to by
the Buyers and Sellers in writing, if as of such time, Buyers are not
completed with their Site Assessments and related environmental diligence
pursuant to Section 5.1(d), the Closing shall not occur until such Site
Assessments and related environmental diligence is completed to
the reasonable satisfaction of Buyers, subject to the termination right of
the parties set forth in Article VIII (including Section 8.1(b)). It is

representations and warranties of the parties hereto contained in this
Agreement or any certificate delivered hereunder shall survive the Closing

against whom such indemnification may be sought prior to such time; provided,

Section 7.2 Indemnification. 

  

(a) Indemnification by Sellers. Sellers hereby, jointly and severally, agree
to indemnify and hold Buyers, the Subsidiaries and their respective
affiliates, officers, directors, and employees and their heirs, successors
and assigns, as the case may be, (collectively, " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_
") harmless from any and all Indemnifiable Damages which any such person may
suffer or incur by reason of: 

   

(i) the breach of any of the covenants or agreements made by Sellers in this
Agreement or any certificate delivered by Sellers hereto; 

   

(ii) the breach of any of the representations or warranties made by Sellers in
this Agreement or any certificate delivered by Sellers hereto; 

   

(iii) all Excluded Liabilities; 

   

(iv) all Pre-Closing Service Matters; 

   

(v) obligations or expenses of the Subsidiaries in connection with the
Transaction, including legal and accounting fees and expenses and brokerage
and finders fees due including obligations of any Subsidiary under its
agreements and arrangements with Simmons; 

   

(vi) all obligations of the Subsidiaries in respect of Closing Date
Indebtedness; 

   

(vii) the environmental matters set forth on Schedule 7.2(a)(vii) (the "
_Specified Pre-Signing Environmental Matters_ "); 

   

(viii) any Environmental Condition or SWD Defect identified by Buyers pursuant
to Section 5.1(d), as set forth on Schedule 7.2(a)(viii) (which matters shall
not be duplicative of the Specified Pre-Signing Environmental Matters) (the "
_Specified Pre-Closing Environmental Matters_ "), which schedule shall be
delivered to Sellers by Buyers not less than three (3) business days prior to
Closing; 

   

(ix) the matters set forth on Schedule 7.2(a)(ix); and 

   

(x) all Seller Indemnified Tax Liabilities. 

  

For purposes of determining whether any Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification under this Section 7.2(a) and in calculating the amount of
Indemnifiable Damages, the parties shall ignore (i) any requirement in any
representation or warranty contained herein that an event or fact be
material, have a Material Adverse Effect or otherwise have a material adverse
effect on Sellers or the Business, taken as a whole, and (ii) any other
reference to materiality contained in any such representation or warranty. 

  

(b) Indemnification by Buyers. Buyers hereby, jointly and severally, agree to
indemnify and hold Sellers and their respective affiliates, officers,
directors and employees, and their heirs, successors and assigns as the case
may be (collectively, " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ "), harmless from any
and all Indemnifiable Damages which any such person may suffer or incur by
reason of: 

   

(i) the breach of any of the covenants or agreements made by Buyers in this
Agreement or any certificate delivered by Buyers hereto; 

   

(ii) the breach of any of the representations or warranties made by Buyers in
this Agreement or any certificate delivered by Buyers hereto; 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(iii) all Assumed Liabilities; and 

   

(iv) all Buyer Indemnified Tax Liabilities. 

  

(c) Third-Party Claims. If any claim or demand is asserted against an
indemnified party by a third party with respect to any matter under the
indemnities set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) (other than Seller
Indemnified Tax Liabilities and Buyer Indemnified Tax Liabilities) (a "
_Third Party Claim_ "), the indemnified party shall promptly give written
notice and details thereof (the " _Claim Notice_ "), including copies of all
pleadings and the pertinent documents, to the indemnifying party or parties,
as the case may be (" _Indemnitor_ "). 

   

(i) The Indemnitor shall have the right, exercisable upon written notice given
within 20 days after receipt of the Claim Notice, to conduct and control
(subject to the limitations set forth below), through counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party, the defense, compromise or settlement
of any such Third Party Claim as to which indemnification will be sought by
any indemnified party from any Indemnitor hereunder, and in any such case the
indemnified party shall cooperate in connection therewith and shall furnish
such records, information and testimony and attend such conferences,
discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably
requested by the Indemnitor in connection therewith; provided, that the
indemnified party shall have the right to participate in such defense at its
own expense; provided, further, that the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to
assume control of the defense (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the
indemnified party) and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of one
counsel for all indemnified parties in any one jurisdiction with respect to
any Third Party Claim if (A) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in
connection with any criminal or quasi criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation; (B) the Third Party Claim is against
customers or vendors with which the indemnified party does business if the
defense or manner of defense of such Third Party Claim would reasonably be
expected to be adverse to the future business prospects of the indemnified
party; (C) the Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief
against the indemnified party; (D) the indemnified party has been advised by
counsel that a reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between
the Indemnitor and the indemnified party; or (E) the defense, settlement or
other action or omission with respect to such Third Party Claim could
reasonably be expected to have the effect of increasing the present or future
Tax liability or decreasing any present or future Tax asset of the
indemnified party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnified party shall
have the right to pay, settle or compromise any such Third Party Claim,
provided that in such event the indemnified party shall waive any right to
indemnity therefor hereunder. 

   

(ii) If (A) the Indemnitor does not assume control of the defense of a Third
Party Claim pursuant to clause (i) above within 20 days after receiving
written notice from the indemnified party or (B) the Indemnitor assumes
control of the defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to clause (i) above
and fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such Third
Party Claim within ten days after receiving written notice from
the indemnified party or if the indemnified party reasonably believes the
Indemnitor has failed to take such steps or if the Indemnitor has not
undertaken fully to indemnify the indemnified party in 

 

    ##### 

  

   

respect of all Indemnifiable Damages relating to the matter, then the
indemnified party shall have the right to pay, compromise or defend any Third
Party Claim and to assert the amount of any payment on the Third Party Claim
plus the expense of defense or settlement as an indemnity claim; provided,
however, that the Indemnitor shall not be liable for the costs and expenses
of more than one counsel with respect to any one Third Party Claim for all
indemnified parties in any one jurisdiction; provided, further, that the
indemnified party shall not compromise or settle any such Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The indemnified party shall
also have the right, exercisable in good faith, to take such action as may be
necessary to avoid a default judgment prior to the assumption of the defense
of any Third Party Claim by the Indemnitor and any expenses incurred by so
acting shall be paid by the Indemnitor; provided, that such Third Party Claim
is a proper claim for indemnification hereunder. Notwithstanding anything in
this Section 7.2 to the contrary, without the prior written consent of the
indemnified party, the Indemnitor will not enter into any settlement of
any Third Party Claim which would lead to liability or create any financial
or other obligation on the part of the indemnified party which is not being
paid contemporaneously by the Indemnitor, or which provides for injunctive or
other non-monetary relief applicable to the indemnified party, or does not
include an unconditional release of all indemnified parties. 

  

(d) Direct Claims. With respect to all claims other than Third Party Claims,
the Indemnitor shall promptly pay or reimburse the indemnified party in
respect of any claim or liability for Indemnifiable Damages to which the
foregoing indemnities relate after receipt of written notice from the
indemnified party outlining with reasonable particularity the nature and
amount of the claim(s). All claims for indemnity hereunder must be submitted
as promptly as practicable by the indemnified party to the Indemnitor. In the
event the Indemnitor fails or refuses to make payment for such claims within
a period of 20 days from the date of notice to the Indemnitor,
the indemnified party shall be entitled to exercise all legal remedies
available to it under this Agreement. 

  

(e) Notice of Claims. A failure to give timely notice or to include any
specified information in any notice as provided in Sections 7.2(c) and 7.2(d)
will not affect the rights or obligations of any party hereunder except, and
only to the extent that, as a result of such failure, any party which was
entitled to receive such notice was deprived of its right to recover any
payment under its applicable insurance coverage or was otherwise materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure. 

  

(f) Access and Information. With respect to any Third Party Claim as to which
Indemnitor has taken control pursuant to Section 7.2(c)(i) above, the
indemnified party will give to the Indemnitor and its counsel, accountants
and other representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours and
upon the giving of reasonable prior notice, to its books and records relating
to such claims, and to its employees, accountants, counsel and other
representatives, all without charge to the Indemnitor, except for
reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. If a claim for
indemnification is made hereunder, the indemnified party agrees to maintain
any of its books and records then in its possession which may relate to such
claim for such period of time as may be necessary to resolve such claim. 

 

    #####

    ##### 

  

   

(iii) The liability of either Sellers or Buyers under this Section 7.2 shall
(A) be offset dollar for dollar by any cash recovery actually made (net of
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in obtaining such recovery and, in
the case of insurers, the amount of any retrospective or other current
increase in premium that is directly attributable to the payment of such cash
recovery) by the Buyer Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties, as
the case may be, from any unaffiliated third party (including insurers)
on account of the item of Indemnifiable Damages involved (and no right of
subrogation shall accrue to any such third party), and (B) be offset by any
Tax benefit (net of Taxes, the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
obtaining such benefit and any Tax detriment) inuring to the indemnified
party therefrom and realized in the taxable year in which the Indemnifiable
Damages were incurred. The parties hereto agree to pursue diligently and
in good faith any recovery from any such third party with respect to any item
of Indemnifiable Damages involved unless such party determines that the
pursuit of such recovery would not be likely to result in any substantial net
recovery, but payments for Indemnifiable Damages shall not be postponed
pending any such receipts or recoveries. Any such receipts or recoveries
received by an indemnified party after a payment for Indemnifiable Damages
shall be promptly paid over to the Indemnitor in an amount not to exceed the
amount paid by the Indemnitor to the indemnified party with respect to such
item of Indemnifiable Damages. 

   

(iv) The maximum aggregate obligation of Buyers to indemnify any Seller
Indemnified Parties with respect to any Indemnifiable Damages as to which

(v) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of the
foregoing limitations shall apply in the case of fraud, criminal activity, or

    ##### 

  

   

(h) Other Limitations on Indemnification.

PUNITIVE, REMOTE OR SPECULATIVE DAMAGES, AND IN NO EVENT SHALL BUYERS BE
LIABLE TO THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES FOR PUNITIVE, REMOTE OR SPECULATIVE
DAMAGES; PROVIDED THAT THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL NOT APPLY TO PUNITIVE, REMOTE
OR SPECULATIVE DAMAGES PAYABLE TO A THIRD PARTY PURSUANT TO A THIRD PARTY
CLAIM OR THAT ARISE FROM FRAUD OR INTENTIONAL MISREPRESENTATION. 

   

(ii) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, no claim may
be asserted and no action may be commenced against an Indemnitor for breach
of any covenant or agreement contained herein, unless written notice of such
claim or action is received by the Indemnitor, describing in reasonable
detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such
claim or action. 

  

(i) Manner of Payment. Any indemnification of the Buyer Indemnified Parties or
the Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Article VII shall be effected

applicable Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, as the case
may be, within fifteen (15) days after the determination thereof; provided,
however, indemnification of the Buyer Indemnified Parties may first be

Buyers at a per share value equal to the Ten Day VWAP immediately preceding
the date of such payment. 

   

Section 7.3 Exclusive Remedy. 

  

(a) Exclusivity. Each of the parties hereby acknowledges and agrees that its
sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims (other than
claims arising from fraud, criminal activity or intentional misconduct on the
part of a party hereto in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) relating to the covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in
this Article VII; provided, that any party may exercise any and all remedies
it may have at law or in equity in the event of a breach by the other party
of its payment obligations established pursuant to Section 7.2. In
furtherance of the foregoing and subject to the foregoing proviso, each of the
parties hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law,
any and all rights, claims and causes of action (other than claims or causes
of action arising from fraud, criminal activity or intentional misconduct on
the part of a party hereto in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement) it may have against another party (but not contribution,
indemnity or other rights it may have against third parties), arising under
or based upon (i) any breach of an express or implied representation or
warranty whether or not contained in either Article III or Article IV of this
Agreement, (ii) any federal, state or local statute, law, ordinance, rule
or regulation and (iii) any other rights, claims or causes of action arising
under or based upon common law or otherwise with respect to the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in or
otherwise made in connection with this Agreement. 

   

    ##### 

 

  

(b) Injunctive Relief. Notwithstanding Section 7.3(a), nothing contained in
this Section 7.3 shall prevent any party hereto from seeking and obtaining
injunctive relief against the other partys activities in breach of this
Agreement. 

   

Section 7.4 Adjustment to Purchase Price. 

  

Any payment by Buyers or Sellers under this Article VII shall, to the extent
such payment can be properly so characterized under applicable Tax law, be
treated by the parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. 

   

Section 7.5 Continuing Indemnification of Directors and Others. 

  

(a) Scope. From the Closing Date until the sixth anniversary of the Closing
Date, Buyers agree to cause the Subsidiaries to honor the provisions in their
respective Governing Documents, in the forms delivered to Buyers pursuant to
Section 6.2(h)(i) at the Closing, relating to the exculpation or
indemnification of officers, directors, employees or agents (the " _E
andI Provisions_") who held any such position on or prior to the Closing Date
(collectively, the " _E andI Indemnitees_"), it being the intent of the parties
that the EandI Indemnitees who held any such position on or prior to the
Closing Date shall continue to be entitled to the benefit of the EandI
Provisions with respect to all periods through the Closing Date to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law. 

  

(b) Insurance. Prior to the Closing Date, Buyers shall procure (with Buyers
and Sellers to bear equally the cost thereof), a six-year "tail" prepaid
policy for the benefit of the EandI Indemnitees of at least equivalent coverage
containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous with respect
to matters occurring on or prior to Closing Date than the similar policies of
insurance maintained by the members of the Seller Group on the date hereof.
Sellers shall provide such assistance as is reasonably requested by Buyers in
connection with the foregoing. The provisions of this Section 7.5(b) are
expressly intended to benefit each of the EandI Indemnitees. 

  

(c) No Release. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed
to, or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with
respect to any member of the Seller Group or any of their respective EandI
Indemnitees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided
for in this Section 7.5 is not prior to or in substitution for any such
claims under such policies. 

   

Section 7.6 EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE. 

  

THE INDEMNITIES SET FORTH IN THIS ARTICLE VII ARE INTENDED TO BE ENFORCEABLE
AGAINST THE PARTIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXPRESS TERMS AND SCOPE THEREOF
NOTWITHSTANDING TEXAS EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE OR ANY SIMILAR DIRECTIVE THAT
WOULD PROHIBIT OR OTHERWISE LIMIT INDEMNITIES BECAUSE OF THE SIMPLE OR GROSS
NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, CONCURRENT, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE) OR OTHER FAULT
OR STRICT LIABILITY OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTIES. THE PARTIES HERETO
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE INDEMNITIES SET FORTH HEREIN MAY RESULT IN THE INDEMNITY
OF A PARTY FOR ITS SIMPLE OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, CONCURRENT,
ACTIVE OR PASSIVE) OR OTHER FAULT OR STRICT LIABILITY OF THE INDEMNIFIED
PARTY.

ARTICLE VIII 
 TERMINATION 

    

Section 8.1 Termination. 

   

This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to Closing by: 

   

(a) the mutual written consent of Sellers and Buyers; 

  

(b) either Sellers or Buyers if the Closing has not occurred by the close of
business on September 30, 2010 (the " _Outside Date_ "); provided, however,
that the Outside Date shall at the election of Buyers, be extended to
November 1, 2010, if from the date hereof to the Outside Date, Buyers (i)
have been diligently pursuing the Site Assessments and such Site Assessments
have not been completed by the Outside Date and (ii) continue to diligently
pursue the completion of the Site Assessments during such extension period;
provided further, that the failure to consummate the Transaction on or before
such date did not result solely from the failure by the party
seeking termination of this Agreement to fulfill any undertaking or
commitment on its part provided for herein prior to Closing; 

  

(c) the Sellers, if at any time prior to the Closing Date, (i) there shall be
a breach of any representation or warranty by either Buyer in this Agreement
that would cause a failure of the condition set forth in clause (i) of
Section 6.3(a), or (ii) there shall be a breach by either Buyer of any of its
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement that would cause a
failure of the condition set forth in Section 6.3(a)(ii), in each case,
provided, that such breach is continuing at the time of termination and is
incapable of being cured or has not been cured by the Buyers within the
earlier of (i) the Outside Date or (ii) twenty (20) days after written
notice from the Sellers of such breach; provided, however, the Sellers shall
not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(c) if either Seller is then in material breach of this Agreement; 

  

(d) the Buyers, if at any time prior to the Closing Date, (i) there shall be a
breach of any representation or warranty of either Seller in this Agreement
that would cause a failure of the condition set forth in clause (i) of
Section 6.2(a), or (ii) there shall be a breach by either Seller of any of
its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement that would cause a
failure of the condition set forth in Section 6.2(a)(ii), in each case,
provided, that such breach is continuing at the time of termination and is
incapable of being cured or has not been cured by Sellers within the earlier
of the Outside Date or twenty (20) days after written notice from the Buyers
of such breach; provided, however, the Buyers shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) if either Buyer is
then in material breach of this Agreement; and 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(e) either Sellers or Buyers, if at any time prior to the Closing Date, Buyers
identify a Potentially Material Environmental Condition pursuant to the Phase
I ESAs or the Site Assessments as described in Section 5.1(d); provided,
however, the terminating party shall provide the non-terminating party not
less than ten (10) days prior written notice of its intent to terminate the
Agreement under this clause (e); provided, further, during such 10-day
period, the parties shall endeavor in good faith to reach agreement on
appropriate adjustments to the terms of the Transaction (including
adjustments to the Purchase Price or the Purchased Assets) to enable a
Closing to occur notwithstanding the existence of such Potentially Material
Environmental Condition. Such written notice shall contain a description of
the matter constituting the alleged Potentially Material Environmental
Condition, supporting documents available to Buyers reasonably necessary for
Sellers to verify the existence of the alleged Potentially Material
Environmental Condition, and a proposed Remedial Action to address the
Potentially Material Environmental Condition (including an associated cost
estimate). 

   

Section 8.2 Procedure and Effect of Termination. 

  

In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, written
notice thereof shall forthwith be given by the terminating party to the other
party hereto, and this Agreement shall thereupon terminate and become void
and have no effect, and the Transaction shall be abandoned without further
action by the parties hereto, except that the provisions of this Section 8.2,
Section 5.6, Article IX and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and except that such termination shall not
relieve any party hereto of any liability for (i) fraud, or intentional or
willful misrepresentation, breach or misconduct or (ii) any breach of its
covenants and agreements under this Agreement occurring prior to such
termination. 

   

Section 8.3 Wrongful Termination. 

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if a party
terminates this Agreement other than in accordance with its terms, that party
shall be liable for any Indemnifiable Damages caused thereby.

ADOPTION AGREEMENT 

    

THIS ADOPTION AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is executed by the undersigned
(the " _Transferee_ ") pursuant to the terms of the Purchase and Sale
Agreement dated as of July 23, 2010 (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "), among OFS
Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, OFS Energy Services,
LLC, Key Energy Services, Inc., a Maryland corporation (" _Key_ "), and Key
Energy Services, LLC, a Texas limited liability company. Capitalized terms
used but not defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed to
such terms in the Purchase Agreement. By the execution of this Agreement, the
Transferee represents and warrants, and acknowledges and agrees as follows: 

  

1. The Transferee is acquiring _ _ Key Shares (the " _Transferred Shares_ ") as a Permitted Transferee in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement. The Transferee is acquiring the Transferred Shares for investment for its own account and not with a view to participating directly or indirectly in any resale, distribution or underwriting thereof in violation of the Securities Act, or applicable state securities laws, and the Transferee will not offer or sell the Transferred Shares in violation of the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws. The Transferee understands that the Transferred Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act or under applicable state securities laws, are being transferred in reliance upon federal and state exemptions for transactions not involving any public offering and may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or otherwise transferred or disposed of unless there is an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering such securities and the securities have been qualified or registered under applicable state securities laws or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Acts and such laws is available. The Transferee also understands that certificates representing the Transferred Shares shall bear an appropriate legend regarding the restrictions on transfer and Key shall order any transfer agent it may appoint to stop the transfer thereof absent compliance with such restrictions. 

  

2. The Transferee is an "accredited investor" as such term is defined in Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. The Transferee acknowledges that (i) Key files annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC and that Key has made available to the Transferee copies of such reports, statements and other filings, and any exhibits thereto and (ii) the Transferee has been provided an opportunity to ask questions and receive answers from Key concerning the terms and conditions of the transfer of the Transferred Shares and to obtain any additional information which Key possesses or can acquire without unreasonable effort or expense that is necessary to verify the accuracy of any information furnished with said transfer. The Transferee is experienced in evaluating and investing in securities of companies such as Key and acknowledges that it is able to fend for itself, can bear the economic risk of its investment, and has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the investment in the Key Shares. The Transferee has not received any general solicitation or general advertisement in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

 

   

Exhibit A, Page 1  ##### 

  

  

3. The Transferee has not looked to, or relied in any manner upon, Key or any of its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, or other representatives for advice about tax, financial, or legal consequences of an investment in the Transferred Shares, and none of Key or any of Keys affiliates, directors, officers, employees, or other representatives has made or is making any representations to the Transferee about, or guaranties of, tax, financial, or legal outcomes of an investment in the Transferred Shares. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT ANY COST ESTIMATES, PROJECTIONS OR OTHER PREDICTIONS CONTAINED OR REFERRED TO IN ANY OFFERING MEMORANDA, MANAGEMENT PRESENTATIONS OR OTHER MATERIALS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO THE TRANSFEREE ARE NOT AND SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO BE REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF KEY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES. 

  

4. The Transferee agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of Section 5.19 of the Purchase Agreement and Exhibit C thereto (collectively, the " _Adopted Provisions_ ") and agrees that the Adopted Provisions shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the heirs, legatees, devisees, legal representatives, successors and permitted assigns of the Transferee. 

  

5. The Transferee acknowledges receipt of a true and correct copy of the Adopted Provisions and further acknowledges that it has read Adopted Provisions and understands and agrees to abide by all terms, covenants, conditions, limitations, restrictions and provisions contained in the Adopted Provisions.

Delaware limited liability company (" _OFS Holdings_ "), OFS Energy Services,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _OFS ES_ ", and together with
OFS Holdings, " _Sellers_ "), and Key Energy Services, Inc., a Maryland
corporation (" _Key_ "), and Key Energy Services, LLC, a Texas

_Buyers_ "). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this _Exhibit C_
shall have the meanings given them in the Purchase Agreement. 

  

1. In the event of an offer and sale of Key Shares under the Securities Act, Key shall indemnify and hold harmless each Holder, each person or entity, if any, who controls such Holder within the meaning of the Securities Act, and each officer, director, manager, partner, and employee of such Holder and such controlling person or entity, against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and out-of-pocket expenses (joint or several), including attorneys fees and disbursements and out-of-pocket expenses of investigation, incurred by such party pursuant to any actual or threatened action, suit, proceeding or investigation, or to which any of the foregoing persons or entities may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state laws, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and out-of-pocket expenses arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions or violations (collectively a " _Violation_ "): 

   

A. Any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in such Registration Statement, including any preliminary
prospectus, prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or any
amendments or supplements thereto; or 

   

B. The omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required
to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading; 

  

provided that the indemnification required by this Section 1 of this _Exhibit
C_ shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim,
damage, liability or out-of-pocket expense if such settlement is effected
without the consent of Key, nor shall Key be liable in any such case for any
such loss, claim, damage, liability or out-of-pocket expense to the extent
that it arises out of or is based upon a Violation which occurs in reliance
upon and in conformity with written information furnished to Key by the
indemnified party expressly for use in connection with such registration or
any information provided by a Holder regarding its proposed plan
of distribution; provided, further, that the indemnity agreement contained in
this _Exhibit C_ shall not apply to any underwriter to the extent that any
such loss is based on or arises out of an untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact, or an omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact, contained in or omitted from any preliminary prospectus if the
final prospectus shall correct such untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement, or such omission or alleged omission, and a copy of the final
prospectus has not been sent or given to such person at or prior to the
confirmation of sale to such person if such underwriter was under an
obligation to deliver such final prospectus and failed to do so. Key shall
also indemnify underwriters, selling brokers, dealer managers and similar
securities industry professionals participating in the distribution, their
officers, directors, agents and employees and each person who controls such
persons (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20
of the Exchange Act) to the. same extent as provided above with respect to
the indemnification of the Holders. 

 

   

Exhibit C, Page 1  ##### 

  

  

2. In connection with such Registration Statement in which a Holder is participating, such Holder will furnish to Key in writing such information required under Regulation S-K under the Securities Act regarding such Holder and, if such registration is not an underwritten registration, such information regarding the distribution of such securities, as Key reasonably requests for use in connection with any such registration statement or prospectus. If such registration statement or prospectus or any preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto contains any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any information or affidavit so furnished in writing by the Holder, or if such information or affidavit omits or allegedly omits a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, the Holder, to the extent permitted by law, shall indemnify and hold harmless Key, each of its directors, each of its officers who shall have signed the Registration Statement, each person or entity, if any, who controls Key within the meaning of the Securities Act, any other Holder, any controlling person or entity of any such other Holder and each officer, director, manager, partner, and employee of such other Holder and such controlling person or entity, against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and out-of-pocket expenses (joint and several), including attorneys fees and disbursements and out-of-pocket expenses of investigation, incurred by such party pursuant to any actual or threatened action, suit, proceeding or investigation, or to which any of the foregoing persons or entities may otherwise become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state laws, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and out-of-pocket expenses arise out of or are based upon any Violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such Holder expressly for use in connection with such registration or any information provided by such Holder regarding its proposed plan of distribution; provided that (a) the indemnification required by this Section 2 of this _Exhibit C_ shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or out-of-pocket expense if settlement is effected without the consent of the relevant Holder, (b) in no event shall the amount of any indemnity under this Section 2 of this _Exhibit C_ exceed the gross proceeds from the applicable offering received by such Holder, and (c) that the obligation to indemnify will be individual to the Holder and not joint or joint and several with any other seller or prospective seller of securities. 

  

3. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this _Exhibit C_ of notice of the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding, investigation or threat thereof made in writing for which such indemnified party may make a claim under this _Exhibit C,_ such indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided that an indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and disbursements and out-of-pocket expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such 

 

   

Exhibit C, Page 2  ##### 

  

   

counsel in such proceeding. The failure to deliver written notice to
the indemnifying party within a reasonable time following the commencement of
any such action, if prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall
relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party
under this _Exhibit C_ but shall not relieve the indemnifying party of any
liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than pursuant
to this _Exhibit C_. Any fees and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
indemnified party (including any fees and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with investigating or preparing to defend such action or
proceeding) shall be paid to the indemnified party, as incurred, within 30
days of written notice thereof to the indemnifying party (regardless of
whether it is ultimately determined that an indemnified party is not entitled
to indemnification hereunder). Any such indemnified party shall have the
right to employ separate counsel in any such action, claim or proceeding and
to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and out-of-pocket expenses
of such counsel shall be the out-of-pocket expenses of such indemnified party
unless (i) the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees and out-of-
pocket expenses or (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to promptly
assume the defense of such action, claim or proceeding or (iii) the named
parties to any such action, claim or proceeding (including any impleaded
parties) include both such indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and
such indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel that there may be
one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or in
addition to those available to the indemnifying party and that the assertion
of such defenses would create a conflict of interest such that counsel
employed by the indemnifying party could not faithfully represent the
indemnified party (in which case, if such indemnified party notifies the
indemnifying party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the
expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the
right to assume the defense of such action, claim or proceeding on behalf of
such indemnified party, it being understood, however, that the indemnifying
party shall not, in connection with any one such action, claim or
proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions, claims
or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general
allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses
of more than one separate firm of attorneys (together with appropriate local
counsel) at any time for all such indemnified parties, unless in the
reasonable judgment of such indemnified party a conflict of interest may
exist between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified
parties with respect to such action, claim or proceeding, in which event the
indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of such
additional counsel or counsels). No indemnifying party shall be liable to an
indemnified party for any settlement of any action, proceeding or claim
without the written consent of the indemnifying party. 

  

4. If the indemnification required by this _Exhibit C,_ from the indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or out-of-pocket expenses referred to in this _Exhibit C_: 

   

A. The indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party,
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a
result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or out-of-pocket expenses
in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
indemnifying party and indemnified parties in connection with the actions
which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or out-of-pocket
expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable 

 

   

Exhibit C, Page 3  ##### 

  

   

considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified
parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any
Violation has been committed by, or relates to information supplied by, such
indemnifying party or indemnified parties, and the parties relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
Violation. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and out-of-pocket expenses referred to above
shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 1
and Section 2 of this _Exhibit C_, any legal or other fees or out-of-pocket
expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any
investigation or proceeding. 

   

B. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 4 of this _Exhibit C_ were determined
by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not
take into account the equitable considerations referred to in Section 4(A) of
this _Exhibit C_. No person or entity guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled
to contribution from any person or entity that was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. 

  

5. If indemnification is available under this _Exhibit C,_ the indemnifying parties shall indemnify each indemnified party to the full extent provided in this _Exhibit C_ without regard to the relative fault of such indemnifying party or indemnified party or any other equitable consideration referred to in Section 4 of this _Exhibit C_. 

  

6. The obligations of Key and the Holders under this _Exhibit C_ shall survive the completion of any offering of Key Shares pursuant to a Registration Statement under the Agreement, and otherwise.
