Article&nbsp;VII, Sellers shall indemnify and hold harmless each Buyer Indemnified Party against all
Taxes applicable to the Business and the Subsidiaries that are attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax

deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) reflected in
the Pro Forma Unaudited Balance Sheet (the &#147;<U>Seller Indemnified Tax Liabilities</U>&#148;). Buyers
shall be liable for and pay, and pursuant to Article&nbsp;VII shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers
against all Taxes applicable to the Business and the Subsidiaries that are attributable to all
Post-Closing Tax Periods (the &#147;<U>Buyer Indemnified Tax Liabilities</U>&#148;). For purposes of this
Section&nbsp;5.12, any Overlap Period shall be treated on a &#147;closing of the books&#148; basis as two partial
periods, one ending at the close of business on the Closing Date and the other beginning on the day
after the Closing Date, except that Taxes imposed on a periodic basis, such as ad valorem Taxes,
shall be allocated on a daily basis. Any franchise or similar Tax paid or incurred with respect to
a Subsidiary shall be allocated to the period in which the gross receipt, gross margin, earned
surplus, assets, capital or other item comprising the base for such Tax arose, and not to the
privilege or other period of doing business funded by such Tax. Thus, for the avoidance of doubt,
all Texas franchise Tax attributable to the sale of the Business and for operations on or before

undertake the defense thereof, or give such notice and thereafter fail to contest such claim in
good faith or to prevent action to foreclose a lien against or attachment of Buyers&#146; property as
contemplated above, then Buyers shall have the right to contest, settle or compromise such Tax
Proceeding and Buyers shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity for such Tax Proceeding under
this Agreement; provided that Buyers shall not, and shall cause the Subsidiaries not to, pay or

Sellers (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). However,
Buyers shall not be obligated to file or assist with the preparation of any amended Tax Return for

2010 (the &#147;<U>Purchase Agreement</U>&#148;), among OFS Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company, OFS Energy Services, LLC, Key Energy Services, Inc., a Maryland corporation
(&#147;<U>Key</U>&#148;), and Key Energy Services, LLC, a Texas limited liability company. Capitalized
terms used but not defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed to such terms in the
Purchase Agreement. By the execution of this Agreement, the Transferee represents and warrants,
and acknowledges and agrees as follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">1.&nbsp;The Transferee is acquiring <U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U> Key Shares (the &#147;<U>Transferred Shares</U>&#148;) as a
Permitted Transferee in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement. The Transferee is
acquiring the Transferred Shares for investment for its own account and not with a view to
participating directly or indirectly in any resale, distribution or underwriting thereof in
violation of the Securities Act, or applicable state securities laws, and the Transferee will not
offer or sell the Transferred Shares in violation of the Securities Act or applicable state
securities laws. The Transferee understands that the Transferred Shares have not been registered
under the Securities Act or under applicable state securities laws, are being transferred in
reliance upon federal and state exemptions for transactions not involving any public offering and
may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or otherwise transferred or disposed of unless
there is an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering such securities and
the securities have been qualified or registered under applicable state securities laws or an
exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Acts and such laws is available.
The Transferee also understands that certificates representing the Transferred Shares shall bear an
appropriate legend regarding the restrictions on transfer and Key shall order any transfer agent it
may appoint to stop the transfer thereof absent compliance with such restrictions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">2.&nbsp;The Transferee is an &#147;accredited investor&#148; as such term is defined in Regulation&nbsp;D
promulgated under the Securities Act. The Transferee acknowledges that (i)&nbsp;Key files annual,
quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC and that Key has
made available to the Transferee copies of such reports, statements and other filings, and any
exhibits thereto and (ii)&nbsp;the Transferee has been provided an opportunity to ask questions and
receive answers from Key concerning the terms and conditions of the transfer of the Transferred
Shares and to obtain any additional information which Key possesses or can acquire without
unreasonable effort or expense that is necessary to verify the accuracy of any information
furnished with said transfer. The Transferee is experienced in evaluating and investing in
securities of companies such as Key and acknowledges that it is able to fend for itself, can bear
the economic risk of its investment, and has such knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the investment in the Key
Shares. The Transferee has not received any general solicitation or general advertisement in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

affiliates, directors, officers, employees, or other representatives for advice about tax,
financial,
or legal consequences of an investment in the Transferred Shares, and none of Key or any of
Key&#146;s affiliates, directors, officers, employees, or other representatives has made or is making
any representations to the Transferee about, or guaranties of, tax, financial, or legal outcomes of
