the manner described herein, an amount equal to $185,000,000 (One Hundred
Eighty Five Million Dollars) (the " _Initial Purchase Price_ "), subject to
the NWC Adjustment set forth in this ARTICLE I (as so adjusted, the "
_Purchase Price_ "). The Purchase Price shall be allocated between the U.S.
Acquired Company Equity and the Canada Acquired Company Equity in accordance
with Section 1.4(a).

 

(b) The " _Estimated Closing Payment_ " will be equal to the Initial
Purchase Price (i)(A) increased by the Estimated Net Working Capital Surplus
(if any) or (B) decreased by the Estimated Net Working Capital Deficiency (if
any), (ii) decreased by the Estimated Indebtedness at Closing, (iii) decreased
by the Seller Transaction Expenses and (v) increased by Estimated Cash. The "
_Final Closing Payment_ " will be equal to the Initial Purchase Price (i)(A)
increased by the Net Working Capital Surplus (if any) or (B) decreased by the
Net Working Capital Deficiency (if any), (ii) decreased by the Indebtedness
of the Acquired Companies as of Closing, (iii) decreased by the Seller
Transaction Expenses and (v) increased by any Cash held by the Acquired
Companies as of the Closing, as finally determined in accordance with Section
1.3.

(c) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller
Parent will prepare and deliver to Purchaser a statement (the " _Closing
Statement_ ") setting forth (i) Seller ParentÂ’s good faith estimate of (A) Net
Working Capital, (B)(1) the amount (if any) by which Net Working Capital
is greater than Target Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Net Working_
_Capital Surplus_ ") or (B)(2) the amount (if any) by which Net Working
Capital is less than Target Net Working Capital (" _Estimated Net Working
Capital Deficiency_ "), (C) Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies as of the
Closing (the " _Estimated Indebtedness_ ") and (D) any Cash held by the
Acquired Companies as of the Closing (the " _Estimated Cash_ "), (ii) the
Seller Transaction Expenses and (iii) based upon such estimates and amounts,
Seller ParentÂ’s good faith calculation of the Estimated Closing Payment, which
Estimated Closing Payment shall be paid at the Closing pursuant to Section
1.2(d).

 



4 (d) At the Closing, Purchaser will:

 

(i) pay in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the
Estimated Closing Payment to Seller Parent (or such Seller Parent
Subsidiaries designated by Seller Parent), to an account or accounts to be
specified in a written notice delivered by Seller Parent to Purchaser at least
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing (the " _Seller Accounts_ ");

(ii) pay in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds, on behalf
of the Acquired Companies, an amount (if any) equal to the Estimated
Indebtedness representing Indebtedness for borrowed money set forth in the
Closing Statement, in accordance with, and to the accounts of the holders of
such Indebtedness specified in, the Closing Statement; and

(iii) pay in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds, on
behalf of the Acquired Companies, an amount (if any) equal to the Seller
Transaction Expenses set forth in the Closing Statement, in accordance with,
and to the accounts of the third parties specified in, the Closing Statement.

 

(e) Seller Parent will prepare and deliver to Purchaser on or prior to
September 1, 2017 a statement setting forth Seller ParentÂ’s calculation of
Target Net Working Capital. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller Parent shall
provide Purchaser with reasonable access to the books and records of the
Acquired Companies to verify the amounts in such calculation and shall
consider in good faith any adjustments to the amounts in such calculation
supported by the books and records of the Acquired Companies and delivered in
writing by Purchaser to Seller Parent within 10 Business Days prior to the
Closing (the " _Purchaser Target Adjustments_ "); __provided__ , __however__
, that Seller ParentÂ’s calculation of Target Net Working Capital pursuant to
this Section 1.2(e) shall be used for purposes of Seller ParentÂ’s preparation
of the Closing Statement and the calculation of the Estimated Closing Payment,
whether or not any such Purchaser Target Adjustments suggested by Purchaser
are included.

 

(f) If any Purchaser Target Adjustments are not mutually resolved as
between the parties prior to Seller ParentÂ’s delivery of the Closing
Statement pursuant to Section 1.2(c), then Purchaser may in the Post-Closing
Statement include such unresolved Purchaser Target Adjustments in PurchaserÂ’s
calculation of Target Net Working Capital, and PurchaserÂ’s calculations of
the post-Closing Adjustment may take into account the difference between
Seller ParentÂ’s calculation of the Target Net Working Capital pursuant to
Section 1.2(e) and PurchaserÂ’s calculation after adjusting for such
unresolved Purchaser Target Adjustments. Seller Parent shall have the right to
dispute PurchaserÂ’s calculation of Target Net Working Capital pursuant to this
Section 1.2(f) under the dispute resolution process set forth in Sections
1.3(b) through 1.3(e).

Section 1.3 _Post-Closing Adjustment_. 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Closing, but in any event within
seventy-five (75) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser will prepare and
deliver to Seller Parent a statement (the " _Post-Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth PurchaserÂ’s calculation of (i) Net Working Capital, (ii)(A) the
amount (if any) by which Net Working Capital is greater than

 



5  Target Net Working Capital (the " _Net Working Capital Surplus_ " or (B) the
amount (if any) by which Net Working Capital is less than Target Net Working
Capital (the " _Net Working Capital Deficiency_ ") (such amount in
subsections (ii)(A) or (ii)(B), the " _NWC Adjustment_ "), (iii)(A) the amount
(if any) by which Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies at Closing is greater
than Estimated Indebtedness or (B) the amount (if any) by which Indebtedness
of the Acquired Companies at Closing is less than Estimated Indebtedness (such
amount in subsections (iii)(A) or (iii)(B), the " _Indebtedness Adjustment_
"), (iv)(A) the amount (if any) by which Cash held by the Acquired Companies
at Closing is greater than Estimated Cash or (B) the amount (if any) by which
Cash held by the Acquired Companies at Closing is less than Estimated Cash
(such amount in subsections (iv)(A) or (iv)(B), the " _Cash Adjustment_ ")
and (v) based on such calculations, PurchaserÂ’s calculation of any adjustment
to the Estimated Closing Payment to arrive at the Final Closing Payment
(the " _Post-Closing Adjustment_ ") and the Purchase Price.

(b) Seller Parent may, within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Post-
Closing Statement (the " _Seller Notice Period_ "), deliver a notice to
Purchaser (i) disagreeing with the calculations in the Post-Closing Statement
and setting forth Seller ParentÂ’s calculation of the Net Working Capital, the
NWC Adjustment, the Indebtedness Adjustment, the Cash Adjustment, the Purchase
Price and any Post-Closing Adjustment or (ii) describing the failure of
Purchaser to comply with its obligations under Section 1.3(a) which has
resulted in Seller ParentÂ’s inability to determine its agreement or
disagreement with the Post-Closing Statement (each such notice in (i) or (ii),
a " _Notice of Disagreement_ "). If Seller Parent does not deliver a Notice
of Disagreement within the Seller Notice Period, then Seller Parent will be
deemed to have agreed to the Post-Closing Statement and the computation of the
Purchase Price and Post-Closing Adjustment set forth therein will be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties for all purposes hereunder. If Seller
Parent delivers a Notice of Disagreement within the Seller Notice Period,
Seller Parent shall be deemed to have agreed with all amounts and items
contained or reflected in the Post-Closing Statement to the extent such
amounts or items are not disputed in the Notice of Disagreement and all such
undisputed amounts will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties for
purposes of this Section 1.3. 

(c) If Seller Parent delivers a Notice of Disagreement within the Seller
Notice Period, Purchaser and Seller Parent, during the thirty (30) days
following such delivery, will use their commercially reasonable efforts to
reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine the
final Purchase Price and Post-Closing Adjustment. If the parties so resolve
all disputes, the computation of the Purchase Price and Post-Closing
Adjustment agreed upon by the parties will be final, conclusive and binding on
the parties for purposes of this Section 1.3.

 

(d) If Seller Parent delivers a Notice of Disagreement within the Seller
Notice Period, and Purchaser and Seller Parent are unable to reach an
agreement on the disputed items or amounts within the thirty (30)-day period
described in Section 1.3(c), the parties will engage an independent accountant
to be agreed upon by Purchaser and Seller Parent (the " _Independent
Accountant_ "), to review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for
the purpose of calculating the final Purchase Price and Post-Closing
Adjustment (it being understood that, in making such calculation, the
Independent Accountant will function as an expert and not as an arbitrator).
In making its calculation of the final Purchase Price and Post-Closing
Adjustment, the Independent Accountant (A) will apply the accounting and
related standards contemplated by

 



6  the definitions in this Agreement, including the definitions of "Net Working
Capital," "NWC Adjustment", "Indebtedness Adjustment" and "Cash
Adjustment," (B) will consider only those items or amounts in the Post-
Closing Statement as to which Seller Parent identifies in the Notice of
Disagreement and any amounts that are directly impacted thereby and (C) will
not assign a value to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value for
such item assigned by Purchaser or Seller Parent or less than the smallest
value for such item assigned by Purchaser or Seller Parent. The Independent
Accountant will deliver to Purchaser and Seller Parent, as promptly as
practicable (but in any event within forty-five (45) days after the date of
engagement of the Independent Accountant), a report setting forth its
calculation of the final Purchase Price and Post-Closing Adjustment.
The Independent AccountantÂ’s calculation of the final Purchase Price and
Post-Closing Adjustment will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties
for all purposes hereunder. The fees, costs, and expenses of the Independent
AccountantÂ’s review and report will be allocated to and borne (i) by
Purchaser if the difference between the Final Post-Closing Adjustment and the
calculation of the Post-Closing Adjustment set forth in the Post-Closing
Statement is greater than the difference between the Final Post-Closing
Adjustment and the calculation of the Post-Closing Adjustment set forth in the
Notice of Disagreement, (ii) by Seller Parent if the first such difference is
less than the second such difference and (iii) otherwise equally by Purchaser
and Seller Parent.

(e) The Final Closing Payment determined in accordance with Section
1.3(b), (c) and (d) shall be final, conclusive and binding for purposes of
this Section 1.3. The Post-Closing Adjustment determined in accordance with
Section 1.3(b), (c) and (d) (the " _Final Post-Closing Adjustment_ ") shall
be final, conclusive and binding for purposes of this Section 1.3.

 

(f) If the Final Closing Payment is greater than the Estimated Closing
Payment, Purchaser will promptly, and in no event later than three (3)
Business Days after determination of the Final Closing Payment and the Final
Post-Closing Adjustment in accordance with this Section 1.3, pay to Seller
Parent (or such Seller Parent Subsidiaries designated by Seller Parent) an
amount equal to the Final Post-Closing Adjustment, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Seller Accounts.

 

(g) If the Final Closing Payment is less than the Estimated Closing
Payment, Seller Parent will promptly, and in no event later than three (3)
Business Days after determination of the Final Closing Payment and the Final
Post-Closing Adjustment in accordance with this Section 1.3, pay (or cause to
be paid) to Purchaser an amount equal to the Final Post-Closing Adjustment,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by
Purchaser.

 Section 1.4 _Allocation of Purchase Price; Withholding_.

(a) _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Within sixty (60) days following
the determination of the Final Closing Payment pursuant to Section 1.3, Seller
Parent shall provide to Purchaser a schedule (the " _Allocation Schedule_ ")
allocating the final Purchase Price (plus the Assumed Liabilities, to the
extent properly taken into account under Section 1060 of the Code) among (i)
the assets and properties of the U.S. Acquired Company, (ii) the assets and
properties of the Canada Acquired Company, and (iii) the covenants of Seller
Parent in Section 5.8 and Section 5.9. The Allocation Schedule shall be
prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the 

 



7  Code; __provided__ , that the aggregate amount allocated to and among the
assets and properties of the Canada Acquired Company shall be equal to the sum
of (x) $1,000,000.00 and (y) the aggregate amount of the Assumed Liabilities
which are liabilities of the Canada Acquired Company, to the extent properly
taken into account under Section 1060 of the Code (such amount, the " _Canada
Allocation Amount")_. If Purchaser does not provide notice of disagreement to
Seller Parent within thirty (30) days of receiving the Allocation Schedule,
the Allocation schedule shall be binding as the final Allocation Schedule
(the Allocation Schedule, as finalized pursuant to this Section 1.4(a), the "
_Final Allocation Schedule_ "). If Purchaser provides notice of disagreement
to Seller Parent within such 30-day period, Seller Parent and Purchaser shall
discuss in good faith PurchaserÂ’s disagreement and, if Seller Parent and
Purchaser resolve such disagreements within thirty (30) days (or such longer
period as agreed between the parties) of Purchaser receiving the Allocation
Schedule, the Allocation Schedule shall be revised to reflect such resolution
and as so revised shall be the Final Allocation Schedule. If Seller Parent and
Purchaser are unable to resolve such disagreements within such thirty (30)
days (or such longer period as agreed between the parties), each of Seller
Parent and Purchaser shall be entitled to allocate the final Purchase Price
among the assets described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above in the manner
it determines in its sole discretion, and neither party shall have any
liability to the other with respect to such allocations; __provided__ _,_ _
_however__ , that, each of Seller Parent and Purchaser in all events shall
allocate to and among the assets and properties of the Canada Acquired Company
the Canada Allocation Amount (and only the Canada Allocation Amount). The
parties agree (and agree to cause each of their respective Affiliates)
to utilize the allocation set forth in any Final Allocation Schedule for all
Tax purposes, including the filing of all Tax Returns and in the course of all
Tax-related proceedings, unless otherwise required by applicable Law pursuant
to a Final Determination in connection therewith.

 

(b) _Withholding_. Purchaser will be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as it may be required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any
applicable provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law; __provided__ ,  _
_however__ , in the event Purchaser determines it is, or may be, required to
deduct or withhold any amounts from the amount paid to Seller Group in
exchange for the Purchased Assets, prior to any such deduction or withholding,
Purchaser will consult with Seller Parent in good faith reasonably in advance
regarding such determination and the parties will use commercially reasonable
efforts and will cooperate with each other to avoid or otherwise mitigate any
requirement to withhold or deduct any amounts from the consideration payable
hereunder; __provided__ , __further__ , that in the event the parties are
unable to agree regarding the applicability of any such requirement or the
required actions in respect of avoiding or mitigating any such requirement,
Purchaser will be entitled to deduct and withhold the amount as may be
required by the Code or any applicable provision of state, local or non-U.S.
Tax Law. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld and paid over by
Purchaser to the applicable Taxing Authority, the withheld amounts will be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the party in
respect of which such amounts are withheld.

any third party the source code of any of the Company Offerings (other than
the applicable Open Source Software itself).

 

(i) _No Defects_. The EIS Business employs industry standard methods
for the intake, categorization, tracking and resolution of defects in the EIS

execution and delivery or effectiveness of this Agreement (or any Transaction
Document), the performance of the Seller GroupÂ’s obligations under this
Agreement, consummation by the Seller Group of the Transactions or any
Transaction Document) will, with or without notice or lapse of time, result
in, or give any Person the right or option to: (i) declare or cause a loss of,
Encumbrance on or the forfeiture or termination of, or give rise to a right of
forfeiture or termination of any EIS Owned Intellectual Property (including
any grant, assignment or transfer to any other Person of any license or other
right or interest under, to or in any EIS Owned Intellectual Property); or
(ii) require additional payment obligations by any Acquired Company, or the
consent of any other Person, in order for any Acquired Company to use or
exploit the EIS Owned Intellectual Property to the same extent as any Acquired
Company was permitted before the date hereof.

item of income, or exclude or defer any deduction or other tax benefit, in

Liabilities) in excess of $500,000 except (i) Liabilities disclosed,

Liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business since the Balance
Sheet Date and (iii) Seller Transaction Expenses incurred pursuant to this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, including the Contribution
Agreements.

 

(c) Seller Parent maintains with respect to the EIS Business a system of
internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurances

(d) All trade receivables of the Acquired Companies (including all trade
receivables reflected in the Financial Information and all trade receivables
that have arisen since the Balance Sheet Date (except such trade receivables
as have been collected)), have arisen from bona fide transactions in the
ordinary course of business consistent with the past practices of the
Acquired Companies. Such trade receivables represent valid and enforceable
claims in accordance with the contractual terms pursuant to which they were
invoiced. All accounts payable of the Acquired Companies arose in the

the Acquired Companies in the ordinary course of business consistent with past

include all tangible and intangible property and assets necessary for,
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries to continue, in all material respects, the
conduct of the EIS Business as of the Closing in substantially the same
manner as conducted immediately prior to Closing. For the avoidance of doubt,
the foregoing representation and warranty is not a representation or warranty
regarding infringement of third-party Intellectual Property Rights and any
such representation and warranty is set forth exclusively in Section 2.9(e)
above. Upon the consummation of the Contribution, none of the Seller Group or
their Affiliates holds any assets that are primarily used in the EIS Business

described in Section 4.2 that if taken after the date hereof and prior to the
Closing without the prior written consent of Purchaser would violate such

by insurance, materially affecting the EIS Business;

under the Securities Act and as such term is defined in the National
Instrument 45-106 under the Securities Act (British Columbia)). Purchaser
represents and warrants that it is acquiring the EIS Business pursuant to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement for PurchaserÂ’s own account and for
investment purposes only and not with a view towards, and Purchaser has no
present intention, agreement or arrangement regarding, the distribution,
transfer, assignment, resale or subdivision of the EIS Business. With respect

of any member of Seller Group or any of its respective employees, agents or
representatives in connection with the this Agreement, any other Transaction
Documents or the Transactions, notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the Purchaser and Seller Parent agree to use their reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary to fulfill all conditions applicable to such party pursuant to this
Agreement and to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable (and in any event prior to the Termination Date), the
Transactions, including (i) obtaining all necessary actions or non-actions,
waivers, Consents, qualifications and approvals from Governmental Entities and
making all necessary registrations, filings and notifications and taking all
reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval, clearance, non-
action letter, waiver or exemption from any Governmental Entity (including
under the HSR Act and any other applicable Antitrust Law); (ii) obtaining all
necessary consents, qualifications, approvals, waivers or exemptions from
non-governmental third parties; (iii) defending any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement
or the consummation of the Transactions, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity
vacated or reversed; and (iv) executing and delivering any
additional documents or instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions
and to carry out this Agreement. Purchaser agrees not to take any action that
would reasonably be expected to delay the obtaining of, or result in not

Governmental Entity necessary to be obtained by the Termination Date.

 



31 (b) Without limiting the foregoing, the Purchaser and Seller Parent
will use their reasonable best efforts to make an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
Transactions as promptly as practicable (but in any event no later than ten
(10) Business Days after this Agreement is executed) and any other required
submissions under any Antitrust Law, in each case with respect to the
Transactions, to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the
HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Law, and to take all other actions
necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable. Any applicable filing fee
under the HSR Act and any other filing made pursuant to any other applicable
Antitrust Law will be borne by Purchaser.

 

(c) The Purchaser and Seller Parent will cooperate with each other in
connection with the making of all filings contemplated by this Section 4.3,
including furnishing to the others such information and assistance as a party
may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any filing or
submission that is necessary or allowable under applicable competition or
other Law or requested by any competition authorities. The Purchaser and
Seller Parent will use their respective reasonable best efforts to furnish to
each other all information required for any application or other filing to be
made pursuant to any Law (including all information required to be included in
Seller ParentÂ’s disclosure documents) in connection with the Transactions. To
the extent permitted by applicable Law or any relevant Governmental Entity,
and subject to all applicable privileges, including the attorney-client
privilege, each party hereto will (i) give the other parties hereto prompt
notice upon obtaining knowledge of the making or commencement of any request,
inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding by or before any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions, (ii) keep the other
parties hereto informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or legal proceeding and (iii) promptly inform the other
parties hereto of any material communication to or from the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, any foreign competition authority
or any other Governmental Entity regarding the Transactions. The parties
hereto will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith
the views of one another, in connection with, and provide to the other parties
in advance, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals to be made or submitted by or on behalf of
any party hereto, including reasonable access to any materials submitted in
connection with any proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or any other
applicable Federal, state or foreign competition, merger control, antitrust
or similar Law, including any proceeding under 16 C.F.R. Â§ 803.20.

 

(d) Any party may, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other parties
under this Section 4.3 as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the
information contained therein will be given only to the outside legal counsel
of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers or directors of the recipient, unless express written
permission is obtained in advance from the source of such materials. In
addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any
Law, each party hereto will permit authorized Representatives of the other
parties to be present at each meeting or telephone conference of which such
party will have advance notice (other than telephone conversations to the
extent they relate solely to administrative matters) with representatives of
any Governmental Entity relating to any request,

 



32  inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding and to have access to and
be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or
submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or proceeding.

(e) Without limiting any other obligations of Purchaser hereunder,
Purchaser will respond to and seek to resolve as promptly as reasonably
practicable any objections asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to
the Transactions, and will defend any action, suit, dispute, litigation,
proceeding, hearing, arbitration or claim by or before any Governmental
Entity, whether judicial or administrative, whether brought by private parties
or Governmental Entities or officials, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions. Purchaser will use reasonable best efforts
to take any and all action necessary to ensure that no Governmental Entity
enters any order, decision, judgment, decree, ruling, injunction (preliminary
or permanent), or establishes any Law, rule, regulation or other action
preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the
consummation of the Transactions, or to ensure that no Governmental Entity
with the authority to clear, authorize or otherwise approve the consummation
of the Transactions, fails to do so by the Termination Date. In the event that
any action is threatened or instituted challenging the Transactions as
violative of any Law, Purchaser will take any and all action necessary to
avoid or resolve such action. In the event that any permanent or preliminary
injunction or other order is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be
entered in any proceeding that would make consummation of the Transactions in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would restrain,
enjoin or otherwise prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Transactions, Purchaser will take promptly any and all steps necessary to
vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order so as to permit such
consummation prior to the Termination Date. The required actions by Purchaser
hereunder will include, without limitation, the proposal, negotiation and
acceptance by Purchaser prior to the Termination Date of (i) any and all
divestitures of the businesses or assets of it or its Subsidiaries or its
controlled Affiliates or the Purchased Assets, (ii) any agreement to hold any
assets of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries or its controlled Affiliates or the
Purchased Assets separate, (iii) any agreement to license any portion of the
business of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries or its controlled Affiliate or of
the EIS Business, (iv) any limitation to or modification of any of the
businesses, services or operations of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries or its
controlled Affiliates or, following the Closing, of the EIS Business, and (v)
any other action (including any action that limits the freedom of action,
ownership or control with respect to, or ability to retain or hold, any of
the businesses, assets, product lines, properties or services of Purchaser or
its Subsidiaries or its controlled Affiliates or the Purchased Assets), in
each case as may be required by any applicable Governmental Entity in order
to obtain approval for the Transactions.

(f) Purchaser agrees not to extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or
enter into any agreement with any Governmental Entity to delay, or otherwise
not to consummate as soon as practicable, any of the Transactions except with
the prior written consent of Seller Parent, which consent may be withheld in
the sole discretion of Seller Parent.

Section 4.4 _Third-Party Notices and Consents_. Seller Parent will use
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to the applicable third party
(including parties to any Material Contracts) or obtain prior to the Closing,
all notices, Consents, waivers, filings and approvals required in connection
with the Transactions (i) under the contracts set forth in Section 2.4(a)(iii)

 



33  of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and (ii) otherwise at PurchaserÂ’s
reasonable request after consultation with Seller Parent. Without limiting the
obligations of Seller Parent hereunder, (i) Purchaser will reasonably
cooperate with Seller Parent in obtaining such third-party Consents to the
extent such cooperation is reasonably requested by Seller Parent, and (ii)
neither party will be under any obligation to, and neither party shall,
without the other partyÂ’s consent (not to be unreasonably withheld),
compromise any right, asset or benefit or expend any amount or incur any
Liability (other than a _de minimis_ amount or Liability) in seeking such
Consents, waivers or approvals or making such notices or filings.

 

Section 4.5 _Exclusivity_. From and after the date hereof until the
earlier of the Closing or termination of this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE
IX, Seller Parent will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries to not, and will
cause its and their respective Representatives to not, (i) solicit, initiate,
or seek any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer concerning the
sale or other conveyance of the EIS Business or the Purchased Assets to a
third party (other than as permitted in accordance with Section 4.2), whether
by way of merger, purchase of share capital or capital stock, purchase of
substantially all of the assets of the EIS Business or otherwise (an "
_Acquisition Proposal_ "); (ii) knowingly hold or participate in any
negotiations or discussions or enter into any agreements with any Person
concerning an Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) knowingly deliver or make
available to any Person any non-public information with respect to, or
take any other action regarding, any inquiry, expression of interest,
proposal or offer that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal. Seller Parent will
cease, and will cause its Subsidiaries to cease, and will cause its and their
respective Representatives to cease, and cause to be terminated any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted
prior to or on the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

 

Section 4.6 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) During the period commencing on the date hereof and continuing until
the earlier of the termination of this Agreement and the Closing, promptly
following receipt of a written request by Purchaser therefor, Seller Parent
will, at PurchaserÂ’s expense, afford Purchaser and its Representatives
reasonable access during business hours, and only in such a manner as to not
interfere with the normal operations of any member of Seller Group, to (i)
Seller ParentÂ’s and its SubsidiariesÂ’ books and records, Contracts, documents,
personnel, premises and properties (solely to the extent exclusively relating
to the EIS Business) and (ii) EIS Employees who have material responsibility
for the conduct of the EIS Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything
contained in this Agreement or any other agreement between Purchaser and any
member of Seller Group executed on or prior to the date hereof, no member of
Seller Group will have any obligation to make available to Purchaser or its
Representatives, or provide Purchaser or its Representatives with, (A) any
consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return filed by any member of Seller
Group or predecessors, or any reasonably related material, or any other
information related to Taxes that does not relate exclusively to the Purchased
Assets, (B) any information if making such information available would be
reasonably likely to (1) jeopardize any attorney-client privilege, or (2)
contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement (including
any confidentiality agreement to which any member of Seller Group is a party)
or (C) any materials or information that Seller Parent determines, in its sole
discretion, may be competitively sensitive, except to the extent that the
parties agree to follow procedures and enter into arrangements that are
mutually acceptable to

 



34  both parties and provided that the parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to enter into such arrangements. Prior to Closing, none of Purchaser,
its Affiliates or their respective Representatives will contact or
communicate, directly or indirectly, with any customer or supplier of the EIS
Business for the purpose of discussing the EIS Business without notifying
Seller Parent and permitting Seller Parent to participate (solely for the
portions relating to the EIS Business) in any and all meetings, conversations
and other communications (including receiving copies of written
communications) between Purchaser, its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives and such customer or supplier.

(b) Each of the parties will hold, and will cause its Representatives to
hold, in confidence all documents and information furnished to it by or on
behalf of another party to this Agreement in connection with the Transactions
pursuant to the terms of the NDA and Section 5.1.

 

(c) During the period commencing on the date hereof and continuing until
the earlier of the termination of this Agreement and the Closing, Seller
Parent shall provide Purchaser and its Representatives with copies of any
material correspondence to or received from any Governmental Entity relating
to the Horizon CID or any similar inquiry by a Governmental Entity, promptly
following receipt thereof.

 

Section 4.7 _Notification_. Except as prohibited by Law, each party
will give prompt notice to the other parties of (i) the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would
be likely to cause any representation or warranty of such party contained
herein to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect on the Closing Date
such that the condition set forth in Section 6.1(a) or Section 6.2(a) would
not be satisfied, and (ii) any material failure of such party to comply with
or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by such party hereunder such that the condition set forth in Section
6.1(a) or Section 6.2(a) would not be satisfied; __provided__ , that no
information provided pursuant to this Section 4.7 will affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty contained herein or the conditions to
the obligations of the parties hereunder.

 

Section 4.8 _Resignations_. Seller Parent will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each director and officer of the U.S. Acquired
Company and the Canada Acquired Company to tender his or her resignation
effective as of the Closing, as requested by Purchaser.

 

Section 4.9 _Existing Credit Facility Cooperation_. Prior to the
Closing Date, Seller Parent shall provide to Purchaser reasonable cooperation
(including on a reasonably timely basis) as requested by Purchaser to
facilitate the granting or pledging of collateral under PurchaserÂ’s existing
credit facilities; __provided__ , __however__ , that, no obligation of any
Acquired Company under any agreement, certificate, document or instrument
shall be effective until the Closing, none of the Acquired Companies or their
respective Representatives or Affiliates shall be required to pay any
commitment or other fee or incur any other liability in connection with any
additional borrowing which Purchaser proposes to incur prior to the Closing,
and in no event will such cooperation require Seller Group or the Acquired
Companies or any of their Representatives or Affiliates to prepare or deliver
audited financial statements or financial statements prepared in accordance
with GAAP for any period.

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

 Section 5.1 _Confidentiality_. The parties understand and agree that
the existence of this Agreement and the terms of this Agreement are subject to
the terms and conditions of that certain confidentiality agreement entered
into between Purchaser and Seller Parent, dated January 23, 2017 (the " _NDA_
") and the parties hereby agree to be bound by, and to cause their Affiliates
and Representatives to be bound by, the NDA up to and until the Closing.
Purchaser and Seller Parent further agree that the terms of the NDA shall be
terminated as of Closing and shall be of no further force or effect
thereafter. As of the Closing, Seller Parent and Purchaser will enter into a
mutual confidentiality agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). If this Agreement is, for any reason,
terminated prior to the Closing, the NDA, and PurchaserÂ’s obligations
thereunder, will nonetheless survive and continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms with respect to any confidential information
disclosed to Purchaser prior to the termination of this Agreement.

 

Section 5.2 _Public Announcements_. Neither Seller Parent nor
Purchaser or any of their Affiliates or Representatives will issue any press
release or otherwise make any public statements with respect to the
Transactions without the prior written consent of the other party (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or
statement may be required by applicable Law, including the rules or
regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or any U.S.
or non-U.S. securities exchange, in which case Seller Parent and Purchaser
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other party
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance and will consider in good faith the advice of such other party with
respect thereto. Seller Parent further acknowledges and agrees that Purchaser
may disclose the terms and existence of this Agreement (i) to comply with the
Purchaser or its AffiliateÂ’s SEC disclosure obligations or (ii) in any public
announcement or other public communication that is consistent with information
disclosed in any other public announcement or other public communication
that was previously made or issued in compliance with the terms of this
Section 5.2.

 

Section 5.3 _Employees_.

 

(a) Purchaser will, for the period of twelve (12) months following the
Closing Date, provide each EIS Employee who continues employment with
Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser (including the U.S. Acquired Company),
following the Closing Date (each a " _Continuing Employee_ "), with (i) a base
salary or base wage rate (as applicable), (ii) a target cash bonus
opportunity, (iii) severance benefits and (iv) employee benefits which are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those made available to such
Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing.

(b) After the Closing, (i) EIS Employees will no longer be eligible to
receive coverage or benefits under any Seller Employee Plan and each EIS
Employee will cease participation in each Seller Employee Plan on the Closing
Date, except as otherwise set forth in such Seller Employee Plan with respect
to employees whose service with Seller Group or the Acquired Companies has
terminated and (ii) any EIS Employee or other employee of the Seller Group or
the Acquired Companies who is not a Continuing Employee will cease
participation in 

 



36  the Acquired Company Employee Plans on the Closing Date, except as otherwise
set forth in such Acquired Company Employee Plan with respect to employees
whose service with Seller Group or the Acquired Companies has terminated.

(c) Effective as of the Closing Date, each Continuing Employee will be
eligible to receive coverage and benefits under the employee benefit plans,
programs and policies (including, without limitation, severance, vacation,
retirement, welfare and fringe benefit plans, programs or policies but
excluding equity compensation plans, programs and policies) of Purchaser and
its Affiliates in which similarly situated employees of the Purchaser or its
Affiliates are eligible to participate (the " _Purchaser Plans_ "). Effective
as of the Closing Date, Purchaser will use commercially reasonable efforts
and will cause its applicable Purchaser Designees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to (A) recognize the prior service with the Seller Group,
including predecessor employers, of each Continuing Employee for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting and determination of level of benefits
(but not for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension
plan or to the extent that such recognition would result in duplication
of benefits), and (B) to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, waive any
pre-existing condition exclusion, actively-at-work requirement or waiting
period under any applicable Purchaser Plan, except to the extent such pre-
existing condition exclusion, actively-at-work requirement or waiting period
would have applied to such individual under the applicable Acquired Company
Employee Plan or Seller Employee Plan, as the case may be, as of the time
immediately prior to the Closing. To the extent permitted by applicable Law,
the Purchaser will and will cause its applicable Purchaser Designees to credit
each Continuing Employee with the amount of accrued but unused vacation time,
sick time and other time-off benefits (together the " _Time-Off Benefits_") as
such Continuing Employee had with the Seller and its Subsidiaries, including
predecessor employers, as of the Closing Date and will provide such Continuing
Employees with the same rights, benefits and entitlements in respect to such
Time-Off Benefits as they were entitled to from the Seller Group as of the
Closing; __provided__ , that the Seller will provide to Purchaser as of the
Closing Date a schedule indicating for each Continuing Employee the type and
amount of Time-Off Benefits for each Continuing Employee.

(d) As of the Closing, Purchaser shall allow each Continuing Employee who
is based primarily in the United States to participate in a defined
contribution plan and trust intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the
Code (the " _Purchaser 401(k) Plan_ "), subject to any eligibility
requirements of such Purchaser 401(k) Plan. Effective as of the Closing,
subject to the consent of the applicable fiduciaries of the Purchaser 401(k)
Plan, Purchaser shall allow the Continuing Employees to effect a "direct
rollover" (as described in Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of their account
balances (including participant loans) under the McKesson Corporation Profit-
Sharing Investment Plan to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan in the form of cash and
participant loan notes.

(e) Following the Closing, Seller Group will retain (i) all Liabilities
under each Seller Employee Plan, other than the Assumed Retention Bonuses and
the Severance Obligations, and (ii) all other Liabilities with respect to any
current or former employee or service provider who is not an employee of the
U.S. Acquired Company as of the Closing, and Purchaser will assume (i) the
retention bonuses (in each case, up to the amounts per individual (whether
accrued or unaccrued as of the Closing) set forth next to such individualÂ’s
name on Section 5.3(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (together with any
additional retention bonuses

 



37  that are awarded to Continuing Employees pursuant to Section 4.2) (the "
_Assumed Retention Bonuses_ ")), (ii) the Severance Obligations, (iii) all
other Liabilities under each Acquired Company Employee Plan and (iv) with
respect to employees of the U.S. Acquired Company as of the Closing and
service providers to the EIS Business as of the Closing, all other
Liabilities, in each case only with respect to Liability or claims for
benefits that arise on or after the Closing Date.

(f) Nothing in this Section 5.3 shall (i) be construed as requiring the
continued employment or engagement of any EIS Employee or other service
provider after the Closing Date, (ii) create any third-party rights under this
Agreement for any Continuing Employee or any other current or former employee
of the EIS Business or (iii) an amendment to any Seller Employee Plan,
Acquired Company Employee Plan or Purchaser Plan.

 

Section 5.4 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Straddle Period_. For purposes of determining a partyÂ’s
indemnification obligations under Section 8.2 for Taxes that are payable with
respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to
the portion of the Taxable Period ending on the Closing Date will be:

 

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) based upon or related to
income or receipts; or (B) imposed in connection with any sale or other
transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible)
(other than as provided under Section 5.4(c)), deemed equal to the amount
which would be payable (after giving effect to amounts which may be deducted
from or offset against such Taxes) if the Taxable Period ended at the close of
the Closing Date, it being understood that, except as required by applicable
Law, all determinations necessary to effect the allocation described in this
Section 5.4(a)(i) shall be made in a manner consistent with the prior practice
of Seller Parent and its relevant Subsidiaries; and

 

(ii) otherwise deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period (after giving effect to amounts which may be deducted from or
offset against such Taxes) (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an
arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period),
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number
of days in the entire Straddle Period.

 

(iii) Any credit or refund resulting from an overpayment of Taxes for a
Straddle Period will be prorated based upon the method employed in this
Section 5.4(a) taking into account the type of Tax to which the refund
relates.

 

(iv) In the case of any Tax based upon or measured by capital (including
net worth or long-term debt) or intangibles, any amount thereof required to
be allocated under this Section 5.4(a) will be computed by reference to the
level of such items immediately following the Closing, taking into account any
changes in the level of such items occurring as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement but not taking into account any changes to the
level of such items occurring as a result of actions taken after the Closing
that are outside the ordinary course of business and that are not expressly
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



38 (b) _Property Taxes_. Each party will timely and duly cause to be
filed all Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all real
property, personal property and similar ad valorem Taxes levied with respect
to the assets of the Acquired Companies and the Contributed Assets ("
_Property Taxes_ ") for any Straddle Period that are required by Law to be
filed by such party for any Straddle Period, and will pay to the relevant
Taxing Authority all Property Taxes required to be paid by such party (subject
to any reimbursement provided for herein). The parties hereto will cooperate
with one another and exchange any information or documents that may be
reasonably necessary in order to (i) ascertain the amount of Property Taxes
that will be the liability of one party under this Agreement but that will be
required to be paid by the other party to a Taxing Authority and (ii) cause
the party that is liable for the allocable share of Property Taxes under this
Agreement either to make an advance payment to the other party of the amounts
required to be paid by the other party (to the extent possible and no later
than five (5) days prior to payment by the other party to the Taxing
Authority) or, if advance payment is not possible, to promptly (and in no
event later than ten (10) days after paid to the Taxing Authority) reimburse
the other party of the amounts actually paid by the other party to the Taxing
Authority.

 

(c) _Transfer Taxes_. Seller Parent and Purchaser shall each be liable
for and pay when due one-half of any Transfer Taxes required by applicable
Law to be paid with respect to the transfer of the U.S. Acquired Company
Equity and the Canada Acquired Company Equity pursuant to this Agreement.
The parties hereto will use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any
Transfer Taxes to be paid pursuant to this Agreement. The party required by
applicable Law to file a Tax Return with respect to such Transfer Taxes will
do so within the time period prescribed by applicable Law, and the other
party will cooperate in all respects to the extent required in connection with
such filing.

 

(d) _Tax Refunds and Tax Benefits_. Any refund of Taxes imposed in
respect of the assets or income of the Acquired Companies, the Contributed
Assets or the income, gains, profits, business, property, sales, purchases or
operations of the EIS Business for any period ending on or before the Closing
Date or the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, and
any interest paid or credited in respect thereof (a " _Refund_ "), will be the
property of Seller Group (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Acquired
Companies). In the event that any Refund is received by the Purchaser, or any
Affiliate thereof, including by way of credit, offset or allowance against
Taxes otherwise payable, an amount equal to the Refund (less any out-of-
pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the Purchaser or such
Affiliate, as the case may be, in connection with obtaining the Refund) will
be paid to Seller Parent (or such Seller Parent Subsidiaries designated by
Seller Parent) within fifteen (15) days after actual receipt or actual
reduction in Taxes paid. Any refund or credit in respect of Taxes imposed in
respect of the assets or income of the Acquired Companies or the Contributed
Assets received by Seller Group or any Affiliate thereof that is not a Refund
will be the property of Purchaser, and Seller Parent shall pay to Purchaser
the amount of such refund or the amount of such credit (less any out-of-
pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred by any member of the Seller
Group or any such Affiliate, as the case may be, in connection with obtaining
such refund or credit) to Purchaser within fifteen (15) days upon such receipt
from the applicable Taxing Authority or

 



39  reduction in Taxes otherwise payable. In the event that any refund of Taxes
for which a payment has been made pursuant to this Section 5.4(d) is
subsequently reduced or disallowed, the party entitled to such refund will
indemnify and hold harmless payor for any Tax liability, including interest,
assessed against such payor by reason of the reduction or disallowance. The
Purchaser will, if Seller Parent so requests and at Seller ParentÂ’s expense
and direction, cause the relevant entity to file for and obtain any Refund to
which Seller Group is entitled under this Section 5.4(d). The principles set
forth in Section 5.4(a) will apply in determining the extent to which any
Refund is attributable to the portion of a Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date.

 

(e) _Preparation of Pre-Closing Tax Returns_. Seller Parent will
prepare and file all Tax Returns relating to the assets or income of the
Acquired Companies or the Contributed Assets for Taxable Periods ending on or
before the Closing Date (or, to the extent Seller Parent has prepared but has
been unable to file such Tax Returns because the Closing Date has passed,
Purchaser will file, or cause to be filed, any and all such Tax Returns as
have been prepared by Seller Parent in accordance with this Section 5.4(e))
and Seller Parent will pay, or cause to be paid, any amount due in respect of
each such Tax Return.

 

(f) _Preparation of Post-Closing Tax Returns_. The Purchaser will
prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) all Tax Returns that
relate to the assets or income of the Acquired Companies or the Contributed
Assets for Straddle Periods. The Tax Returns for any Straddle Period will be
prepared on a basis consistent with those prepared for prior Taxable Periods
unless a different treatment of any item is required by Law. With respect to
any Straddle Period Tax Return required to be filed with respect to the
Acquired Companies after the Closing Date and as to which Taxes are allocable
to Seller Parent under Section 8.2 hereof, the Purchaser will provide Seller
Parent and its authorized representative with a copy of such completed
Straddle Period Tax Return in draft form, together with a statement (with
which the Purchaser will make available supporting schedules and information)
certifying the amount of Tax shown on such Tax Return that is allocable to
Seller Parent pursuant to Section 8.2, at least thirty (30) days prior to the
due date (including any extension thereof) for the filing of such Tax Return,
and will accept any reasonable comments made by Seller Parent with respect to
any issue or item which could give rise to a claim for indemnification under
Section 8.2. Seller Parent and the Purchaser agree to consult and to attempt
in good faith to resolve any issues arising as a result of the review of such
Tax Return and statement by Seller Parent or its authorized Representative.

 

(g) _No Post-Closing Adjustments_. Following the Closing, neither the
Purchaser nor any Affiliate of the Purchaser will amend, refile or otherwise
modify, or cause or permit any Affiliate to amend, refile or otherwise modify,
any Tax election or Tax Return relating to the assets or income of the
Acquired Companies or the Contributed Assets with respect to any Taxable
Period (or portion of any Taxable Period), ending on or before the Closing
Date without the prior written consent of Seller Parent, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law.

 

(h) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All tax sharing agreements and
arrangements between any members of Seller Group, on the one hand, and any
Acquired Company, on the other hand, will be terminated as of the Closing and
thereafter the Acquired Companies will not be bound thereby or have any
liability thereunder.

 



40 (i) _Cooperation in Tax Matters_. The parties hereto agree to furnish
or cause to be furnished to one another, upon request, as promptly as
practicable, such information and assistance relating to the Acquired
Companies and the Contributed Assets as is reasonably necessary for the filing
of all Tax Returns, the preparation for any audit by any Taxing Authority,
and the prosecution or defense of any claim or proceeding relating to any Tax
Return. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 5.4(i) will not be construed
to grant Purchaser any right to review any Tax Return relating to Taxes of
Seller Parent or the applicable Seller Parent Subsidiary, except to the extent
Seller Parent may be required to provide Purchaser with a right to review,
upon request, copies of Tax Returns solely relating to the Acquired Companies
and the Contributed Assets in order to comply with the foregoing sentence of
this Section 5.4(i). In the event any Taxing Authority informs Seller Parent
or Purchaser of any notice of proposed audit, claim, assessment or other
dispute concerning an amount of Taxes related to the assets or income of the
Acquired Companies or the Contributed Assets with respect to which the other
party may be responsible pursuant to this Agreement, the party so informed
will promptly notify the other party of such matter; __provided__ , that,
failure to promptly notify will not reduce the other partyÂ’s indemnity
obligation hereunder, except to the extent such partyÂ’s ability to
defend against such matter is actually prejudiced thereby; __provided__ ,
__further__ , that resolution of such audit, claim, assessment or other
dispute will be governed by Section 8.3.

 

(j) _Effect on Indemnity Rights of the Parties_. Nothing in this
Section will be deemed to limit or otherwise affect the rights of the parties
hereto under ARTICLE VIII.

 

(k) _Successors_. For purposes of this Section 5.4(f), (g), (h) and
(i), all references to the Purchaser and its Affiliates include successors.

 

(l) _Survival_. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, the covenants and agreements of the parties hereto contained in
this Section 5.4 will survive the Closing and will remain in full force until
ninety (90) days after the expiration of the applicable statutes of
limitations for the Taxes in question (taking into account any extensions or
waivers thereof).

Section 5.5 _Further Actions_. At Closing or from time to time after
the Closing, at the other partyÂ’s request, Seller Parent and Purchaser __
will, and will cause their respective Subsidiaries to, execute and deliver to
the other party such other instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance,
novation, assignment and confirmation, provide such materials and information
and take such other actions as the requesting party may reasonably deem
necessary in order to effectively transfer, convey and assign to Purchaser
and the Acquired Companies (as applicable) and to confirm PurchaserÂ’s and the
Acquired CompaniesÂ’ (as applicable) title to, all of the Purchased Assets,
free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances), in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and, to the fullest extent
permitted by law or contract, to put Purchaser and the Acquired Companies (as
applicable) in actual possession and operating control of the Purchased
Assets, and to cause the parties to fulfill their respective obligations under
this Agreement and the Transaction Documents.

 

Section 5.6 _Parent Seller Trademarks; Company Name_.

 



41 (a) Purchaser is not obtaining pursuant to this Agreement or
any Transaction Document any rights with respect to any Seller-Retained
Trademarks, except for the limited license during the Phase-Out Period as
expressly set forth in Section 5.6(b). Following the Phase-Out Period,
Purchaser will not use or display, and will ensure that its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies) do not use or display, any Seller-Retained
Trademark as (or as part of) a corporate name or trade name. Purchaser will,
as soon as is practicable but in any event no later than six (6) months
following the Closing Date (such six (6) month period, the " _Phase-Out
Period_"), (i) remove or obliterate all Seller-Retained Trademarks from all
Company Offerings (and any other products and services of Purchaser and its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies)) and all associated signage,
websites, advertisements, marketing brochures, purchase orders, invoices,
sales orders, labels, letterhead, business cards, employee and customer
communications, packaging, shipping documents and other materials; and (ii)
cease to use, manufacture, market, sell, license, distribute, or otherwise
provide or make available any of the foregoing items bearing any Seller-
Retained Trademark.

 

(b) During the Phase-Out Period, subject to the other terms and conditions
of this Section 5.6, Purchaser and its Affiliates will have (and, effective
as of the Closing Date, Seller Parent hereby grants to Purchaser and its
Affiliates) a royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, and non-
exclusive license to use in the United States and Canada those Seller-Retained
Trademarks that the EIS Business used immediately prior to the Closing Date
(the " _Licensed Seller-Retained Trademarks_ ") solely in connection with
those Company Offerings for which (and in the same manner that) the EIS
Business used such Seller-Retained Trademarks immediately prior to the Closing
Date (the " _Licensed Company Offerings_ "). Such use must comply with Seller
ParentÂ’s applicable trademark usage guidelines, and the Licensed Company
Offerings in connection with which the EIS Business uses the Licensed Seller-
Retained Trademarks must be of such quality as will, in Seller ParentÂ’s
reasonable judgment, protect the goodwill, image and reputation adhering to
the Licensed Seller-Retained Trademarks (and Purchaser will, and will cause
its Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate with Seller Parent to enable Seller
Parent to monitor and ensure compliance with such standards). Purchaser will
not (and will ensure that its Affiliates, including the Acquired Companies, do
not) (i) register or attempt to register any Seller-Retained Trademark; (ii)
challenge the validity, or any member of Seller GroupÂ’ use, of any Seller-
Retained Trademark; (iii) modify any Seller-Retained Trademark or combine any
Seller-Retained Trademark with any other Trademark; or (iv) use or display
any Seller-Retained Trademark except as expressly permitted under this Section
5.6. All use of the Seller-Retained Trademarks by the EIS Business prior to
Closing and all associated goodwill will inure to the sole benefit of Seller
Parent.

Section 5.7 _Records and Documents_.

 

(a) At the Closing, Seller Parent will deliver all books and records of the
Acquired Companies that are in Seller ParentÂ’s possession to Purchaser and,
promptly after Closing, Seller Parent will deliver to Purchaser (at no cost to
Purchaser, except as expressly contemplated under the Transition Service
Agreement) any other books and records that are in Seller ParentÂ’s possession
to the extent related to the EIS Business; __provided__ , that (i) Seller
Parent will be permitted to redact from such books and records any information
not related to the EIS Business; and (ii) Seller Parent may retain copies of
any such books and records that relate to Seller GroupÂ’s retained businesses
or to the extent necessary to comply with applicable Law or any member of
Seller GroupÂ’s document retention policies in effect as of the date hereof,
or to the extent necessary for performance by Seller Group under any
Transaction Document.

 



42 (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, each party
will retain all of the books and records (including personnel files) relating
to the EIS Business relating to periods prior to the Closing. Each party will,
and will cause its Subsidiaries (as applicable) to, at the other partyÂ’s
expense, provide the other party and its Representatives with reasonable
access to and the right to make copies of such books and records solely to the
extent relating to the periods prior to the Closing; __provided__ , that
Seller Parent will be permitted to redact from such books and records any
information not related to the EIS Business. The party accessing such books
and records shall be solely responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by
it pursuant to this Section 5.7(b). If either party shall desire to dispose
of any of such books and records prior to the expiration of such six-year
period, such party shall, prior to such disposition, give the other party a
reasonable opportunity, at such other partyÂ’s expense, to segregate and
remove such books and records as such other party may select; __provided__ ,
that Seller Parent will be permitted to redact from such books and records any
information not related to the EIS Business.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither party nor any
of their respective Subsidiaries will have any obligation to make available
to the other party or such other partyÂ’s Representatives, (i) any
consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return filed by a party or its
predecessor, or any related material, or any other information related to
Taxes that does not exclusively relate to the Purchased Assets or (ii) any
information if making such information available would (1) jeopardize any
attorney-client privilege or (2) contravene any applicable Law or fiduciary
duty.

 

Section 5.8 _Non-Competition_. Until the date that is twelve (12)
months after the Closing Date, Seller Parent will not, and will cause its
Subsidiaries not to, without the prior written consent of Purchaser (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (a) engage
in any material respect in a Restricted Activity, or (b) Control any Person
engaged in any material respect in a Restricted Activity; __provided__ , that
the foregoing will not prohibit or otherwise restrict:

 

(i) any member of Seller Group or its Affiliates and their respective
successors from otherwise:

 

(A) engaging in any business or activities related to: (1) laboratory
solutions and analytics, including lab information systems (" _LIS_ ") and
LIS and lab equipment interfaces or "middleware"; (2) electronic medical
record and/or revenue cycle software systems outside of the acute care
hospital setting (e.g., iKnowMed or Athena Health electronic medical record
systems), and hospital pharmacy revenue cycle software systems and related
software (e.g., Macro Helix NDC Architect); or (3) software or service that
provides: (w) interoperability or data exchange between an electronic medical
record system in the acute care setting and specialty ambulatory/outpatient
practices; (x) integration or data exchange to provide value-added services,
including electronic prior authorization, prior authorization predictive
analytics, eprescribing and RelayHealth PharmacyÂ’s RxBenefit Clarity; (y)
specialty clinical decision support; or (z) specialty population health
management support;

 



43 (B) engaging in any business or activities, or providing any service
or offering, which any member of Seller Group or their Affiliates is
currently engaged or providing (other than the EIS Business or with respect to
the Company Offerings);

 

(C) acquiring the assets of, or a controlling interest in, another Person
engaged in a Restricted Activity (a " _Target Business_ ") as part of an
acquisition, joint venture, merger or other business combination, if (x) the
revenue derived by the Target Business from the Restricted Activity in the
fiscal year preceding such acquisition constituted less than twenty-five
percent (25)% of the total net revenues of the Target Business for the most
recent financial period prior to the acquisition or (y) within twelve (12)
months from such acquisition, Seller Parent causes the Target Business to
divest or cease the portion of its operations that is engaged in the
Restricted Activity;

 

(D) owning a venture capital fund or other investment fund, in each case,
in which neither Seller Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries owns a majority of
the ownership interests in the debt or equity holdings of such fund or has the
right to appoint or elect a majority of the board of directors or equivalent
body of such holding;

 

(E) fulfilling any obligation of any member of Seller Group or their
Affiliates under this Agreement or any Transaction Document; or

(F) owning as a passive investment five percent (5%) or less of the equity
of any entity engaged in a Restricted Activity that is traded on any
nationally-recognized stock exchange.

Section 5.9 _Non-Solicit_. Without obtaining PurchaserÂ’s prior written
consent, for a period of eighteen (18) months following the date hereof,
Seller Parent will not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, solicit any
Continuing Employee to leave the employ of Purchaser or its Affiliates or
violate the terms of their contracts, or any employment arrangements, with
Purchaser or its Affiliates, or hire any Continuing Employee set forth in
Section 5.9 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. Nothing herein shall preclude
Seller Parent from (a) engaging in general solicitations of employment by
means of (i) general advertisements or (ii) through a professional recruiter
who does not target the Continuing Employees; or (b) hiring a Continuing
Employee (other than a Continuing Employee listed on Section 5.9 of the
Disclosure Schedule) (i) who responds to a public advertisement or job
listing on mckesson.com, or (ii) who applies for a posted position without any
solicitation by Seller Group; or (c) hiring anyone (i) whose employment with
Purchaser has been voluntarily terminated by such Continuing Employee
at least six (6) months prior to commencement of employment discussions
between Seller Parent or its Affiliates and such person or (ii) whose
employment with Purchaser has been terminated by Purchaser.

 

Section 5.10 _Bulk Sale_. Purchaser hereby waives (and, if applicable,
will cause and Purchaser Designee to waive) compliance by Seller Group with
any applicable bulk sale or bulk transfer Laws of any jurisdiction in
connection with the sale of the Purchased Assets to Purchaser (and, if
applicable, any Purchaser Designee).

 



44 Section 5.11 _Litigation and Similar Claims_. From and after the
Closing, each of Seller Group and Purchaser will reasonably cooperate in
defending and pursuing, as appropriate, litigation and similar claims relating
to the EIS Business or any of the Acquired Companies or any of the parties
hereto, reasonably make available relevant employees and preserve and make
reasonably available, to the extent legally and contractually permissible, all
records reasonably necessary for such matters;  _ _provided__ , that this
Section 5.11 shall not apply with respect to any disputes among any party
hereto or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, or any other party hereto or
its Affiliates, on the other hand;  _ _provided__ , __further__ , that any
reasonable out-of-pocket costs in connection with such cooperation shall be
reimbursed by the requesting party. 

Section 5.12 _Cooperation with Post-Closing Preparation of
Financial Statements_. Seller Parent agrees to reasonably cooperate as
requested by Purchaser in connection with PurchaserÂ’s preparation of
historical financial statements of the EIS Business as may be required to be
filed with the SEC or other Governmental Entity following the Closing. Such
cooperation shall consist solely of providing, as promptly as reasonably
practicable (after taking into account Seller Parent resources as they may
exist from time to time (" _Seller Parent Resources_ ")), such financial and
operating data regarding the EIS Business, the Acquired Companies and the
Purchased Assets relating to periods prior to Closing as is requested by
Purchaser to the extent that the same is reasonably ascertainable by Seller
Parent from its books and records or from the books and records of Change
Healthcare to which Seller Parent is permitted access for such purpose and to
assist Purchaser in preparing (after taking into account Seller Parent
Resources) such financial and operating data regarding the EIS Business, the
Acquired Companies and the Purchased Assets relating to periods prior to
Closing as may be required to prepare such historical financial
statements, and to provide reasonable and customary management representation
letters and reasonably assist Purchaser in PurchaserÂ’s efforts to obtain
auditor consents, and providing access to personnel of Seller Parent, in each
case as reasonably requested by Purchaser. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that the preparation of such financial statements
within the time period required by the SEC, any third-Person or other
Governmental Entity is the responsibility of Purchaser, and neither Seller
Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall have any liability arising out of any
failure by the Purchaser, the Acquired Companies, Seller Group or
their respective Affiliates to timely satisfy requirements of the SEC, any
third-Person or other Governmental Entity with respect to the preparation of
historical financial statements or any other financial information of the EIS
Business, the Acquired Companies or the Purchased Assets and any actual or
anticipated failure to timely satisfy such requirements shall not be deemed to
constitute a breach of this Agreement by Seller Group or any of its
Affiliates. Purchaser shall bear all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred
by Seller Group or their respective Affiliates in connection with this Section
5.12 or otherwise in connection with the preparation and audit of historical
financial statements after the date of this Agreement, including costs of
staff augmentation or professional fees. Purchaser further expressly agrees
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document, any actual or anticipated failure to prepare such
financial statements or other financial information shall not be a condition
to the obligation of Purchaser to consummate the Closing under Section
6.1(a)(i) or otherwise, provide a basis for a delay of the Closing from that
otherwise provided in this Agreement or be deemed a Material Adverse Effect.
Purchaser further acknowledges that, following the Closing, neither Seller
Parent nor its Affiliates will be required

 



45  to provide or prepare financial, operating data or other information
regarding the EIS Business, the Acquired Companies and the Purchased Assets,
to the extent such information is transferred to Purchaser as part of the
books and records of the Acquired Companies or is derivable therefrom.

(vi) the matter referred to in Section 8.2(a)(vi) of the Seller Disclosure

this Section 8.2(a)(vi), that such Losses are comprised of amounts paid or
payable to any Governmental Entity or any private relator involving any

Taxes imposed on any member of the Seller Group or any Affiliate thereof

(D) any Taxes imposed on an Acquired Company, or for which an Acquired

(ix) the matters referred to in Section 8.2(a)(ix) of the Seller Disclosure

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller ParentÂ’s
obligation to indemnify Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i)
(relating to breaches or inaccuracies of representations or warranties) for
Losses that both (x) are attributable to breaches of the representations
included in Section 2.10 and (y) relate to Taxes attributable to any Taxable
Period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date shall be limited
to any such Losses resulting from, arising out of or relating to breaches or
inaccuracies of the representations made in (i) Section 2.10(d) or (ii)
Section 2.10(e).

 

(b) _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Subject to Section 8.1 and the
other provisions of this ARTICLE VIII, from and after the Closing Date,
Purchaser will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller Group and their
respective officers, directors and employees (collectively, the " _Seller
Indemnitees_ "), from and against and in respect of any and all Losses
incurred by any Seller Indemnitee resulting from, arising out of or relating
to (regardless of whether or not such Indemnifiable Losses relate to any
Third-Party Claim):

 

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of Purchaser
contained in ARTICLE III of this Agreement (it being understood and agreed
that for purposes of determining whether a breach or inaccuracy of such
representation or warranty has occurred and the amount of Losses to which any
indemnification applies, each representation and warranty shall be read
without regard and without giving effect to any "materiality," "Material
Adverse Effect" or similar qualifiers or words of similar import contained in

(ii) any breach by Purchaser of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement;

 

(iii) any Assumed Liabilities (except to the extent Seller Parent is

(iv) except to the extent described in Section 8.2(a), Taxes imposed on an

(c) _Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement (A) no Purchaser Indemnitee will be entitled to indemnification for
any Losses arising from a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section
8.2(a)(i) above until the aggregate amount of all Losses under all claims of
all Purchaser Indemnitees for all such breaches or inaccuracies exceeds
$1,850,000 (One Million Eight Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars) (the "
_Deductible_ "), at which time only the portion of such Losses in excess of
the Deductible will be subject to indemnification hereunder (subject to
clauses (B) and (C) below); (B) there will be no obligation to indemnify under
Section 8.2(a)(i) for any item or related set of items where the Losses
relating thereto are less than $185,000 (One Hundred Eighty Five Thousand
Dollars (the " _De Minimis Amount_ ") (it being understood that such items
will not be aggregated for purposes of the immediately preceding clause (A));
and (C) Seller ParentÂ’s aggregate Liability for indemnification pursuant to
subsection Section 8.2(a)(i) above will not exceed $18,500,000 (Eighteen
Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) (the " _Cap_ "); __provided__ ,  _
_however__ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Cap, the

indemnification based on fraud, any breach or inaccuracy of a Fundamental
Representation or any breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty of
Seller Parent contained in Section 2.10 ( _Taxes_ ) or Section 2.14
(Sufficiency). Each indemnification payment to a Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant
to Section 8.2(a)(i) that is subject to the Cap set forth in this Section
8.2(c) will reduce such Cap on a dollar-for-dollar basis and all equal and
higher Caps set forth in this Section 8.2(c) by the aggregate amount of such
payment. Except in the case of fraud and indemnification in respect of
Sections 8.2(a)(iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (viii), Seller GroupÂ’s aggregate
Liability under this Agreement will in no event exceed the Purchase Price.

(d) Seller Parent agrees and acknowledges that PurchaserÂ’s right
to indemnification under this ARTICLE VIII for any breach or inaccuracy of
any representation or warranty of Seller Parent set forth in ARTICLE II
related to compliance with Law or breach of Contract (except, for the
avoidance of doubt, any representation or warranty regarding the occurrence
or existence of any Action) shall not be limited or impacted by the
disclosures regarding the Horizon CID set forth in the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, and, solely for purposes of an indemnity claim under this ARTICLE
VIII, such disclosure shall be disregarded for purposes of determining whether
a breach or inaccuracy of such representation or warranty has occurred.

 

Section 8.3 _Notice of Claim; Defense_. Subject in all respects to
Section 8.3(e) for Covered DOJ Actions:

 



52 (a) If (i) any third party or Governmental Entity institutes, threatens or
asserts any Action or other claim that may give rise to Losses for which a
party (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") may be liable for indemnification under
this ARTICLE VIII (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") or (ii) any Person entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") may in good
faith have a claim to be indemnified by an Indemnifying Party that does not
involve a Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ "), then the Indemnified
Party will promptly send to the Indemnifying Party a written notice specifying
(to the extent known) the nature of such claim and the amount of all related
Losses (a " _Claim Notice_ ");  _ _provided__ , __however__ , that any
failure to give such Claim Notice or to provide any such facts or amounts will
not affect the rights of the Indemnified Party except to the extent that such
failure actually prejudices the Indemnifying Party and, to the extent
prejudiced, the obligation of the Indemnifying Party shall be reduced to the
extent of any actual monetary prejudice resulting from the Indemnified PartyÂ’s
delay or failure to give any such notice.

 

(b) In the event of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may elect
to retain counsel of its choice, reasonably acceptable to the relevant
Indemnified Parties, to represent such Indemnified Parties in connection with
such Action and will pay the fees, charges and disbursements of such counsel;
__provided__ , that, if the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense
of such Third Party Claim, it shall (x) notify Purchaser in writing as
promptly as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than twenty (20)
days after receipt of the Third-Party Claim Notice) of its intent to do so,
and (y) acknowledge in writing that it is obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Party with respect to such Third-Party Claim hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto agree that Seller Parent
shall assume and control the defense of the Horizon CID without any further
action by Seller Parent. If the Indemnifying Party fails to take reasonable
steps necessary to defend diligently the Third-Party Claim after notifying
Purchaser (on behalf of the applicable Indemnified Party) of its assumption
of the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may assume
such defense, and the reasonable fees of its attorneys will be covered by the
indemnity provided for in this ARTICLE VIII upon determination of
the Indemnifying PartiesÂ’ indemnity obligations. Should the Indemnifying
Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified
Parties may participate, at their own expense and through legal counsel of
their choice, in any such Action, __provided__ , that (i) subject to the
preceding sentence, the Indemnifying Party may elect to continue to control
the defense of the Indemnified Parties in connection with such Action and (ii)
the Indemnified Parties and their counsel will reasonably cooperate with the
Indemnifying PartyÂ’s counsel in connection with such Action. The Indemnifying
Party will have the right to settle, compromise or discharge a Third-Party
Claim either (A) with the prior written consent of the applicable Indemnified
Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) or (B) without any Indemnified PartyÂ’s consent if such settlement,
compromise or discharge provides for no relief other than the payment of
monetary damages (including monetary fines or penalties) and such monetary
damages are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party, requires no admission of
Liability by any Indemnified Party (with no right of indemnification or other
contribution from the Indemnified Part or its Affiliates) and contains a full
release of the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates from any Liabilities
arising out of the Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i)
the Indemnifying Party elects not to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory
to the relevant Indemnified Parties and assume control of such defense of a
Third-Party Claims within twenty (20) days of receiving a Claims Notice with 

 



53  respect to such Third-Party Claim, (ii) the Indemnified Party determines
(after obtaining advice of counsel) that an actual or apparent conflict of
interest exists between the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party
that precludes effective joint representation with respect to such Third-Party
Claim, (iii) such Third-Party Claim involves a bona fide claim for injunctive
relief against the Indemnified Party with respect to such Action or claim,
(iv) such Third-Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any
criminal proceeding, Action, indictment, investigation or allegation or (v)
Purchaser (on behalf of the applicable Indemnified Party) reasonably believes
such Third-Party Claim, if adversely determined, would impair in any material
respect the business or operations of the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates, then the Indemnified Party may upon twenty (20) days written
notice to the Indemnifying Party retain counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnifying Party in connection with such Third-Party Claim and assume
control of the defense of the Indemnified Parties in connection with such
Third-Party Claim, and the fees, charges and disbursements of such counsel
selected by the Indemnified Parties will be payable by the Indemnifying Party;
__provided__ , the Indemnifying Parties may continue to participate, at their
own expense and through legal counsel of their choice, in any such Action.
Whether the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party controls the defense
of any Third-Party Claim, the parties hereto will cooperate in the defense
thereof in accordance with Section 8.3(c) and, in the case of any Covered DOJ
Action, in accordance with Section 8.3(e). Under no circumstances will the
Indemnifying Party have any Liability in connection with any settlement of any
Third-Party Claim that is entered into without its prior written consent
(which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(c) From and after the delivery of a Claim Notice involving a Third Party
Claim, at the written request of the Indemnifying Party, each Indemnified
Party will grant the Indemnifying Party and its Representatives reasonable
access during business hours, and only in such a manner as to not
unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the relevant Indemnified
Party, to the books and records, Contracts, documents, personnel, premises and
properties of the Indemnified Party to the extent reasonably related to the
Claim Notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything contained in this
Agreement (but subject to Section 8.3(e)), no Indemnified Party will have any
obligation to make available to the Indemnifying Party any information if
making such information available would be reasonably likely to (i)
jeopardize any attorney-client privilege (it being understood that the
Indemnified Party will cooperate in any reasonable efforts and requests for
waivers (including entry into a joint defense agreement or other arrangement,
in a form reasonably satisfactory to the parties, if either party determines
that such joint defense agreement or other arrangement is reasonably necessary
to make available such information hereunder) or (ii) contravene any
applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement (including any
confidentiality agreement to which the Indemnified Party is a party) (it being
understood that the Indemnified Party will cooperate in any reasonable
efforts and requests for waivers that would enable otherwise required
disclosure to the Indemnifying Party to occur without contravening such Law,
duty or agreement). The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to reimbursement
by the Indemnifying Party for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred
in connection with any cooperation requested by the Indemnifying Party under
this Section 8.3(c).

 

(d) In the event of a Direct Claim, the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party will proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of
such dispute, and if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute will be
resolved by litigation in a court of competent

 



54  jurisdiction pursuant to Section 10.6. In the event of a dispute between an
Indemnified Party and an Indemnifying Party relating to a Direct Claim, if the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party reach an agreement to resolve
such dispute, a memorandum setting forth such agreement will be prepared and
signed by all applicable parties. In the event a dispute between an
Indemnified Party and an Indemnifying Party relating to a Direct Claim
results in litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to Section
10.6, the final and non-appealable judgment with respect to such dispute will
be final, binding and conclusive upon the parties thereto.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with
respect to: (A) the Horizon CID and (B) all investigations, litigation,
appeals, or other legal proceedings arising out of or related to the facts and
circumstances giving rise to the Horizon CID (each, clauses (A) and (B), a "
_Covered DOJ Action_ ") regardless of whether such investigations,
litigation, appeals, or other legal proceedings arise (or a party becomes
subject to such investigations, litigation, appeals, or other legal
proceedings) prior to or after the Closing: 

(i) (A) the Indemnifying Party shall have control over and the right to
direct the defense, appeals, or settlement, including the right to retain
counsel of its choice and to assert and prosecute any applicable
counterclaims, and (B) the Indemnifying Party will pay the fees, charges and
disbursements of such counsel; __provided__ , that if the Indemnifying Party
fails to actively defend such Covered DOJ Action, then the Indemnified Parties
shall have the option to retain counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnifying Party in connection with such Covered DOJ Action and
assume control of the defense of the Indemnified Parties in connection with
such Covered DOJ Action. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any
such Covered DOJ Action in accordance with this Section 8.3(e), the
Indemnified Parties may participate, at their own expense and through legal
counsel of their choice, in any such Covered DOJ Action, __provided__ , that
subject to the preceding sentence, the Indemnifying Party may elect to
continue to control the defense of the Indemnified Parties in connection with
such Action and the Indemnified Parties and their counsel will reasonably
cooperate with the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s counsel in connection with such
Action.

 

(ii) Without limitation to any other term of this Agreement, the
Indemnified Party and its Affiliates shall cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party in all reasonable respects in connection with any Covered DOJ Action,
including promptly providing the Indemnifying Party with copies of all files
or documents in its or any of its AffiliatesÂ’ possession relating to any
Covered DOJ Action (to the extent not previously provided to the Indemnifying
Party), making reasonably available to the Indemnifying Party the servers of
the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates as necessary to facilitate access to
such files or documents, and making reasonably available to the Indemnifying
Party and its employees, counsel, experts, and representatives employees of
the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates with knowledge of the matters
at issue, at no cost to the Indemnifying Party (other than for reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses of the Indemnified Party).

 

(iii) The Indemnified Party will not admit any liability, file any papers
or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
agreement, compromise or discharge with respect to any Covered DOJ Action
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (except as set
forth in the last sentence of this Section 8.3(e)(iii)). The Indemnifying
Party will have the right to control (subject to the first proviso of Section
8.3(e)(i)),

 



55  settle, compromise or discharge a Covered DOJ Action with DOJ or any private
relator without any Indemnified PartyÂ’s consent, unless such a DOJ resolution
includes an admission of liability, any required contribution or
indemnification by the Indemnified Party or any commitment for equitable
relief or conditions with any federal agency. The parties agree that for any
settlement, compromise or discharge of a Covered DOJ Action subject
to Section 8.2(a)(vi), such payment will be paid in full by Seller Parent or
a member of the Seller Group (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, by the
Acquired Companies or Purchaser). If a Covered DOJ Action involves a
commitment for equitable relief or conditions with a federal agency other
than DOJ or otherwise cannot be settled by the Indemnifying Party without
consent of the Indemnified Party as set forth above in this Section
8.3(e)(iii), the Indemnifying Party will have the right to control (subject
to the first proviso of Section 8.3(e)(i)), settle, compromise or discharge
the matter with the prior written consent of the applicable Indemnified Party,
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, provided that the
Indemnified Party may take into consideration the impact on the business of
the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates. If a Covered DOJ Action is resolved
with DOJ such that no further obligation or contribution is required or owed
by the Indemnifying Party to any private relator or federal agency, and the
only matter that remains is negotiation or resolution of prospective equitable
conditions with a federal agency other than DOJ, then the Indemnified Party
may control, settle and compromise (at the Indemnified PartyÂ’s own expense)
such matter with such other federal agency, provided that such equitable
conditions do not involve or burden the current business operations of the
Indemnifying Party.

 

(iv) The parties each shall keep the other informed of the status of any
Covered DOJ Action and notify one another promptly following the assertion of
any claims or filings of any court documents in connection with any Covered
DOJ Action. The parties each shall notify the other promptly following its or
any of its AffiliatesÂ’ receipt of any and all subpoenas, orders and material
requests relating to any Covered DOJ Action.

(v) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Indemnified Party
agrees that the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s counsel may maintain copies of all
information, materials and documents that may be needed in connection with any
Covered DOJ Action.

 

(vi) The parties hereto agree to enter into a joint defense agreement in a
form reasonably satisfactory to the parties prior to Closing.

(vii) In the event of a conflict between this Section 8.3(e) and any other
provision of this Agreement, this Section 8.3(e) shall control.

 

Section 8.4 _Indemnification for Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, the following will apply to indemnification claims with
respect to Taxes:

(a) _Payment of Indemnified Taxes_. Payment by the Indemnifying Party
of any amount due under Section 8.2 will be made within ten (10) days
following written notice by the Indemnified Party that payment of such amounts
to the appropriate Taxing Authority is due, or, in the case of Taxes paid by
any member of Seller Group thereof prior to the Closing, but that are the
responsibility of Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.2 hereof, within ten (10)
days following written notice that such Taxes have been paid; __provided__ ,
that the Tax Indemnitee will comply with its obligation to promptly notify the
Tax Indemnitor under Section 8.4(b); __provided__ , __further__ , 

 



56  that a Tax Indemnitor will not be required to make any payment earlier than
two (2) days before the same is due to the appropriate Taxing Authority.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if Seller Parent receives an
assessment or other notice of Taxes due with respect to the assets or income
of the Acquired Companies or the Contributed Assets for which Purchaser is
responsible pursuant to Section 8.2, then the Purchaser will pay such Taxes,
or if any member of Seller Group (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Acquired Companies after the Closing Date) pays such Taxes, then the Purchaser
will pay to Seller Parent (or such Seller Parent Subsidiaries as designated
by Seller Parent) the amount of such Taxes for which Purchaser is responsible
within five (5) days following such payment. In the case of a Tax that is
contested in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.4(b), payment of the
Tax to the appropriate Taxing Authority will be considered to be due no
earlier than the date of a Final Determination with respect to such Tax.

 

(b) _Contests_. The Tax Indemnitee will notify the Tax Indemnitor in
writing promptly, and in any event within thirty (30) days, of becoming aware
of the commencement after the Closing Date of any audit or administrative or
judicial proceeding, or of any demand or claim on the Tax Indemnitee or any of
its Affiliates by any Taxing Authority, which could give rise to a claim for
indemnification under Section 8.2 (a " _Tax Indemnification Event_ ");
__provided__ , that failure to promptly so notify the Tax Indemnitor will not
reduce the Tax IndemnitorÂ’s indemnity obligation hereunder, except to the
extent the Tax IndemnitorÂ’s ability to defend against such Tax Indemnification
Event is actually prejudiced thereby. Such notice will contain factual
information (to the extent known to the Tax Indemnitee or its Affiliates)
with respect to the Tax Indemnification Event in reasonable detail and will
include copies of any notice or other written communication received from any
Taxing Authority in respect thereof.

 

(c) Subject to Section 8.4(e), the Tax Indemnitor may elect to direct,
through counsel of its own choosing and at its own expense, any audit, claim
for refund and administrative or judicial proceeding involving any Taxes for
which indemnity could be sought from the Tax Indemnitor under Section 8.2 (any
such audit, claim for refund or proceeding is referred to herein as a "
_Contest_ "). If the Tax Indemnitor elects to direct a Contest, it will
promptly notify the Tax Indemnitee of its intent to do so and in any event
within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice of the Tax Indemnification
Event relating to such Contest and, if requested by the Tax Indemnitee, the
Tax Indemnitor will furnish to the Tax Indemnitee in due course, as a
condition to further pursuing such Contest, an opinion of the Tax
IndemnitorÂ’s independent tax counsel to the effect that the Tax Indemnitor
has a reasonable basis to pursue such Contest. In the case of any Contest, the
Tax Indemnitee and each of its Affiliates, as the case may be, will cooperate
with the Tax Indemnitor in good faith in order to contest effectively any
such Contest. The Tax Indemnitor will, on demand, reimburse all "out of
pocket" costs and expenses which the Tax Indemnitee or its Affiliate may incur
in connection with such Contest (but not in connection with exercising the
right of attendance described below), including reasonable attorneysÂ’ and
accountantsÂ’ fees and disbursements. The Tax Indemnitee or its duly appointed
representatives will be allowed to attend all meetings between the Tax
Indemnitor and the Taxing Authority in question and will be provided with
copies of all material correspondence and documents relating to such Contest.
If the Tax Indemnitor fails to notify the Tax Indemnitee of its election as
herein provided, the Tax Indemnitee and each of its Affiliates, as applicable,
may (but shall not be required to) pay, compromise or contest such asserted
Tax liability and will be reimbursed by the Tax Indemnitor for all "out
of pocket" costs and expenses, including

 



57  reasonable attorneysÂ’ and accountantsÂ’ fees and disbursements incurred
pursuant to this sentence to the extent attributable to a Tax liability
indemnifiable by the Tax Indemnitor hereunder. If the Tax Indemnitor notifies
the Tax Indemnitee of its election as herein provided, neither the Tax
Indemnitee nor any of its Affiliates may settle or compromise any asserted Tax
liability without the written consent of the Tax Indemnitor; __provided__ ,
__however__ , that consent to settlement or compromise will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. If the Tax Indemnitor chooses to direct the
Contest, the Tax Indemnitee will promptly empower and will cause each of its
Affiliates, as applicable, promptly to empower (by power of attorney and such
other documentation as may be necessary and appropriate) such representatives
of the Tax Indemnitor as it may designate to represent the Tax Indemnitee and
any relevant Affiliate in the Contest insofar as the Contest involves an
asserted Tax liability for which the Tax Indemnitor could be liable under
Section 8.2.

 

(d) Subject to making any payment or deposit as may be required by Law as a
precondition to pursuing any judicial determination, the Tax Indemnitor may
cause a Contest to be prosecuted to a determination in a court of initial
jurisdiction, but the Tax Indemnitor may not cause such Contest to be
prosecuted to a determination in an appellate court.

 

(e) Nothing contained herein will permit the Tax Indemnitor to control any
such Contest, if the Tax Indemnitee and each of its Affiliates, as
applicable, will waive the payment by the Tax Indemnitor of any amount that
might otherwise be payable by the Tax Indemnitor hereunder by way of indemnity
in respect to such Contest. Upon any such waiver, the Tax Indemnitee will
repay to the Tax Indemnitor any payments made by the Tax Indemnitor to any
Taxing Authority in such Contest (together with interest, from the date the
payment to the Taxing Authority was made by the Tax Indemnitor to the date of
repayment by the Tax Indemnitee, at the statutory rate which will be
applicable from time to time with respect to deficiencies for the Taxes in
question).

 

Section 8.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, except as expressly provided otherwise and
except in the case of fraud, this ARTICLE VIII will be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Indemnitees from and after the Closing Date for any claims
arising under this Agreement, including claims of breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty; __provided__ , __however__ , that the foregoing
will not be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to seek specific
performance or injunctive relief. 

Section 8.6 _Limitation on  Set-Off_. Neither Purchaser nor Seller
Parent will have any right to set off any unresolved indemnification claim
pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII against, and there will not otherwise be any
right to set off in the event of the non-performance of any obligation to
make, (a) any payment due pursuant to this Agreement, or (b) any payment due
under any other Transaction Document. 

Section 8.7 _Effect of Insurance, Taxes and Other Recoveries_.

 

(a) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under
this ARTICLE VIII will be reduced by (i) any amounts that are actually
recovered (net of reasonable out-of-pocket costs of collection) by the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates from any third party with respect
to such Losses and (ii) any insurance proceeds (net of

 



58  reasonable out-of-pocket costs of collection, any deductible or self-insured
retention amount and any prospective and retrospective premium adjustments)
or other cash receipts or source of reimbursement that are actually received
by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates with respect to such Losses.
If any amount to be reduced under this Section 8.7 from any payment required
under this ARTICLE VIII is determined after the date on which the Indemnifying
Party is required pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII to pay such indemnification
claim, the Indemnified Party will promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party
any amount that the Indemnifying Party would not have had to pay pursuant to
this ARTICLE VIII had such determination been made at the time of such
indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party. If, as a result of any
indemnified event relating to a Loss, the Indemnified Party realizes an actual
reduction in cash Taxes paid, or receives an actual cash refund of Taxes paid,
in each case with respect to the year in which such indemnified event occurs,
the Indemnified Party shall (within ten (10) days after such reduction or
refund) pay to the Indemnifying Party the amount of such reduction or refund.
For purposes of the preceding sentence, it shall be assumed that any deduction
or losses attributable to the indemnified event are the last deductions or
losses taken on the Indemnified PartyÂ’s Tax Return for the year in which the
indemnified event occurs. For the avoidance of doubt, the amount of any
indemnification payment payable by the Indemnifying Party shall be determined
without regard to any reduction in, or refund of, Taxes realized by the
Indemnified Party.

 

Section 8.8 _No Double Recovery_. Notwithstanding the fact that any
Person may have the right to assert claims for indemnification under or in
respect of more than one provision of this Agreement related to any fact,
event, condition or circumstance, no Person will be entitled to recover the
same amount of any Losses suffered by such Person more than once under this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents (i.e., no "double recovery") in
respect of such fact, event, condition or circumstance, and, with respect to
any fact, event, condition or circumstance for which a specific line item
liability has been included as a Current Liability and taken into account in
the calculation of the Net Working Capital, an Indemnifying Party will not be
liable for the amount by which the Purchase Price is reduced as a result of
such inclusion, when compared against the calculation of the Purchase Price
where Net Working Capital is calculated without such liability included as a
Current Liability.

 

Section 8.9 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Seller Parent and
Purchaser agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this ARTICLE
VIII as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all applicable Tax purposes,
including for U.S. federal income Tax and for state Tax purposes.

 

ARTICLE IX

cured by the Termination Date, or, if capable of being cured by the
Termination Date, has not been cured prior to the earlier of (x) thirty (30)
days after delivery of written notice of such breach and (y) the Termination

of Section 4.3(b), the last sentence of Section 4.4, the provisions of

and (ii) nothing herein will relieve any party hereto from Liability from the
foregoing provisions or in connection with fraud or any willful (in the sense
that such action was taken intentionally with the knowledge that such action
would constitute or would reasonably be likely to constitute a violation of
this Agreement) breach of this Agreement prior to termination of this
Agreement.

MISCELLANEOUS

 

Section 10.1 _Entire Agreement; Assignment; Successors_. This Agreement
(including the Annexes and Exhibits hereto), the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
the NDA and the other Transaction Documents constitute the entire agreement
among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof
and supersede all other prior and contemporaneous agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement may not be assigned by
operation of Law or otherwise; __provided__ ,  _ _however__ , that Purchaser
may assign any or all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to
any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Purchaser (each, a "
_Purchaser Designee_ "); __provided__ ,  _ _further__ , that any such
assignment will not relieve Purchaser of its obligations under this Agreement
and any such Purchaser Designee executes a joinder to this Agreement. Any
purported assignment of this Agreement in contravention of this Section 10.1
will be null and void and of no force or effect. Subject to the preceding
sentences of this Section 10.1, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to
the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. In the event of any conflict or
inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any other
Transaction Document, the terms of this Agreement will govern.

 

Section 10.2 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
will nevertheless remain in full force and effect, so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto will negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible, in a mutually acceptable manner, in order that the
Transactions will be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

amended, modified or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct
or otherwise, except by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an
amendment hereto, signed by an authorized representative of each of the
parties.

Section 10.11 _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties hereby
acknowledges and agrees that irreparable injury would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or otherwise are breached, and that any breach of this
Agreement could not adequately be compensated in all cases by monetary damages
alone. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that, prior to a valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1, the parties will be
entitled, without posting a bond or similar indemnity, to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any

this Agreement by any other party.

 

Section 10.13 _Waivers_. No failure or delay of a party in exercising
any right or remedy hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any
single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of
conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the parties hereunder are

otherwise have hereunder. Any agreement on the part of any party to any such
waiver will be valid only if set forth in a written instrument executed and

agree that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any
applicable Law or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such
agreement or document.

Section 10.15 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY
CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR
(B) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE

COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF

executed on its behalf as of the day and year first above written.
