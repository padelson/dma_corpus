ARTICLE  II

 

CONSIDERATION;  EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

 



 

2.1. _Effect  on Company  Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any  action on the part of the holder of any shares of
common stock, par value $1.00  per share, of the Company (the " _Company
Common Stock_ "):

 



 

(a) All  shares of Company  Common Stock that are (i) owned directly by the
Company as treasury stock,  (ii)  owned directly by Parent or (iii) owned
directly by Merger Sub


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  2  -  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

or  any entity of which Merger Sub is a direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary  (other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), shares in
trust accounts,  managed accounts and the like for the benefit of customers
or shares held in  satisfaction of a debt previously contracted) shall be
cancelled and retired  and  no common shares, no par value per share, of
Parent (" _Parent Common  Shares_ "), cash or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange  therefor. All shares of Company Common Stock that are
owned by any wholly owned  Subsidiary of the Company or by any wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent (other  than any Subsidiary of Parent described in
_Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ above),  other than shares in trust accounts, managed
accounts and the like for the  benefit of customers or shares held in
satisfaction of a debt previously  contracted, shall remain outstanding, and
no Parent Common Shares, cash or  other  consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

 



 

(b) Except  as otherwise  provided in _Section 2.1(a)_ , and subject to
_Section 2.2_ , each share  of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time  shall be cancelled and converted into the right
to receive (i) 0.4142 Parent  Common Shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), and
(ii) an amount in cash equal to  $10.50. For the purposes of this Agreement,
the " _Merger Consideration_ " means the right to receive the consideration
described in clauses (i)  and (ii)  of the preceding sentence pursuant to
the Merger with respect to each share  of  Company Common Stock (together
with any cash in lieu of fractional shares as  specified in _Section 2.2_
below).

 



 

2.2. _No  Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement,  neither certificates nor scrip for fractional Parent Common
Shares shall be  issued in the Merger. Each holder of Company Common Stock
who  otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a Parent Common
Share shall  receive in lieu thereof cash (without interest) in an amount
determined by  multiplying the fractional share interest to which such holder
would otherwise  be entitled (after taking into account all shares of Company
Common Stock owned  by such holder at the Effective Time to be converted into
Parent Common Shares)  by the average of the daily volume weighted average
prices of Parent Common  Shares based on information reported by the Toronto
Stock Exchange as reported  in _The Toronto Stock Exchange Daily Record_
(with each such trading  day's applicable price converted into United States
dollars using the spot  exchange rate reported with respect to such day by
_The Wall Street Journal _ (or such other publication as may be mutually
agreed to by Parent  and the  Company) (such conversion rate, the "
_Conversion Rate_ ")), for the five  trading days immediately preceding the
Closing Date. No such holder  shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights
or any other rights in respect  of  any fractional share.

 

 

2.3. _Merger  Sub  Capital Stock; Issuance of Surviving Company Common
Stock_. (a) Each share of  common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger
Sub outstanding immediately  prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and become one fully paid  and nonassessable share of redeemable
preferred stock of the Surviving  Company.

 

 

(b) In  exchange for, and  in consideration of, (i) Parent causing its
wholly owned subsidiary, Cardinal  Intermediate Co. (" _IntermediateCo_ "),
which as of the date hereof owns  100% of the outstanding capital stock of
Merger Sub and is a wholly-owned  subsidiary of Cardinal Top Co. (" _TopCo_
"), to deliver the Merger  Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1_ , and (ii)
the payment of $10.00 by  IntermediateCo to the Surviving Company, the
Surviving Company will issue to  IntermediateCo at the Effective Time 1,000
(or such other number as  is

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  3  -  

 

 

 

 

 


 

agreed  by the Surviving Company and IntermediateCo) fully paid and
nonassessable shares  of common stock of the Surviving Company.

 

 

2.4. _Treatment  of Options and Other Stock Based Awards_. (a) At the
Effective Time, each  outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock (a " _Company  Option_ ") issued pursuant to any Company Stock
Incentive Plan shall be fully  vested and shall be assumed by Parent and
shall be honored by Parent in  accordance with its terms (as modified as
provided herein) following its  conversion in the Merger into options to
purchase Parent Common Shares  (" _Parent Options_ "). From and after the
Effective Time, each Company  Option shall be deemed to constitute an option
to acquire, on the same terms  and  conditions as were applicable under such
Company Option, a number of Parent  Common Shares equal to the product of (I)
the number of shares of Company Common  Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant
to such Company Option and (II) 0.5522  (the " _Stock Option Exchange Ratio_
"), rounded down, if necessary, to the  nearest whole share, at a price per
share equal to (y) the exercise price per  share of the shares of Company
Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant  to  such Company Option,
divided by (z) the Stock Option Exchange Ratio, rounded  up  to the nearest
cent; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of any  Company Option to
which Section 421 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as  amended (the "
_Code_ ") applies by reason of its qualification under Section  422 of the
Code (" _incentive stock options_ "), the option price, the number  of shares
purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions  of 
exercise of such option shall be determined in accordance with the method
set  forth above unless use of such method will not preserve the status of
such  options as incentive stock options, in which case the manner of
determination  shall be adjusted in a manner that both complies with Section
424(a) of the  Code  and results in the smallest modification in the
economic values that otherwise  would be achieved by the holder pursuant to
the method set forth  above. In all events, the foregoing substitution of all
Company  Options with Parent Options shall comply with the requirements of
Section 409A  of the Code.

 



 

(b) The  Company and  Parent shall take all corporate action necessary for
the conversion of the  Company Options, and Parent shall take all corporate
action necessary to reserve  for issuance a sufficient number of Parent
Common Shares for delivery upon  exercise of the Parent Options issued in
substitution for such Company Options  in accordance with this _Section 2.4_.
As soon as practicable after the  Effective Time (but in no event later than
five Business Days after the  Effective Time), Parent shall file a
registration statement on Form F-3 or  Form  F-8, as the case may be (or any
successor or other appropriate forms), with  respect to the Parent Common
Shares subject to such Parent Options and shall  use  its reasonable best
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration  statement or
registration statements (and maintain the current status of the  prospectus
or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Parent Options  remain
outstanding.

 



 

(c) The  Company shall  take such action as shall be required to (i)
terminate the Dividend Reinvestment  and Stock Purchase Plan (the " _DRIP and
Purchase Plan_ ") as provided in  _Section 7.15_ ; and (ii) ensure that all
Company Common Stock held in the  Company tax-qualified defined contribution
plan is treated in the same manner  as  all other shares of Company Common
Stock under Article II of this  Agreement.

 



 

(d) Following  the  Effective Time, Parent shall maintain, solely for
purposes of the Parent Options  provided for above, the 1989 Stock Option
Plan for Non-Employee Directors,  the  1997 Employee Stock Option Plan, the
1998 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee  Directors,


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  4  -  

 

 

 

 

 


 

and  the 2004 Employee Stock Option Plan (collectively, the " _Company
Stock  Incentive Plans_ "). Any other plan, program or arrangement 
providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the 
capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof (including the DRIP 
and  Purchase Plan) shall terminate as of the Effective Time, and the Company
shall  ensure that following the Effective Time no holder of a Company Option
or any  other equity-based right shall have any right to acquire equity
securities  of  the Company or the Surviving Company.

 



 

(e) As  soon as  practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Company  to deliver to the holders of Company Options
appropriate notices setting forth  such holders' rights pursuant to the
respective Company Stock Incentive Plans  and stating that such Company Stock
Incentive Plans, the Company Options and  the  underlying stock option
agreements have been assumed by Parent and converted  into stock incentive
plans covering, and options to purchase, Parent Common  Shares, shall
continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject  to  the
adjustments required by this _Section 2.4_ after giving effect to the  Merger
and the terms of the Company Stock Incentive Plans).

 



 

2.5. _Reservation  of  Right to Revise Structure_. Parent may at any time
change the method of  effecting the business combination contemplated by this
Agreement if and to  the  extent that it deems such a change to be
desirable; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such change shall (A) alter or
change the amount  or kind  of the consideration to be issued to holders of
Company Common Stock as merger  consideration, (B) adversely affect the
anticipated tax consequences of the  Merger to the holders of Company Common
Stock as a result of receiving the  consideration payable in respect of
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant  to  the Merger, or (C) impede or
delay consummation of the Merger other than in  an  immaterial respect. In
the event Parent elects to make such a change, the  parties agree to execute
appropriate documents to reflect the  change.

 



 

2.6. _Withholding_.  Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold  from  any payment otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as are  required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to such payment under all  applicable Tax laws. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted or withheld,  such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having  been  paid to the recipient of the
payment in respect of which such deduction and  withholding was made.

 

 

2.7. _Certain  Adjustments_. The Exchange Ratio and the Stock Option Exchange
Ratio shall be  subject to appropriate adjustments from time to time after
the date of this  Agreement in the event that, subsequent to the date of this
Agreement but prior  to the Effective Time, the outstanding Parent Common
Shares shall have been  increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a
different number or kind  of shares or securities through any reorganization,
recapitalization,  reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse
stock split, or other  like changes in Parent's capitalization.

 



 

ARTICLE  III

 

EXCHANGE  OF CERTIFICATES FOR MERGER CONSIDERATION

 



 

3.1. _Parent  to Make  Merger Consideration Available_. At or promptly after
the Effective Time,  Parent or one of its Subsidiaries shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited,  with an exchange agent selected by Parent
(subject to the consent, not to be  unreasonably

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  5  -  

 

 

 

 

 


 

withheld,  of the Company) **(** the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit 
of the holders of certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time 
evidenced shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ "), for 
exchange in accordance with this _Article III_ , (i) evidence of Parent 
Common Shares in book-entry form issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(b) _
(and/or certificates representing such Parent Common Shares, at Parent's 
election), (ii) cash sufficient to make the cash payments payable pursuant 
to  _Section 2.1(b)_ , and (iii) cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of 
fractional Parent Common Shares pursuant to _Section 2.2_.

 

 

3.2. _Exchange  of Certificates_. (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective  Time and in any event not later than the fifth Business Day
following the  Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder
of record of a  Certificate immediately prior to the Effective Time whose
shares of Company  Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration  pursuant to _Section 2.1_ a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall  specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the  Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange  Agent) and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates  in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
Upon proper surrender of a  Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with  a  letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with  the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant  to such instructions, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to  receive in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration in respect of the shares  of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate and such  Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be  paid or accrued for the
benefit of holders of the Certificates on the Merger  Consideration payable
upon the surrender of the Certificates.

 

 

(b) No  dividends or other  distributions with respect to Parent Common
Shares with a record date after  the  Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate  with  respect to Parent Common
Shares that such holder would be entitled to receive  upon surrender of such
Certificate and no Merger Consideration shall be paid  to  any such holder
until such holder shall surrender such Certificate in accordance  with this
_Article III_. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance  with this
_Article III_ , such holder thereof entitled to receive Parent  Common Shares
shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other  distributions,
without any interest thereon, with a record date after the  Effective Time
and which theretofore had become payable with respect to whole  Parent Common
Shares issuable to such holder in respect of such  Certificate.

 



 

(c) If  the payment of the  Merger Consideration is to be made to a person
other than the registered holder  of the Certificate surrendered in exchange
therefor, it shall be a condition  of  payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or  accompanied by an appropriate
instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper  form for transfer, and that
the person requesting such payment shall pay to  the  Exchange Agent in
advance any applicable stock transfer or other Taxes or shall  establish to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes  have been
paid or are not payable.

 



 

(d) At  and after the  Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of  the  Company of the shares of Company Common Stock
that were issued and outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective  Time, Certificates


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  6  -  

 

 

 

 

 


 

representing  such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent,
they shall be  cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as
provided in this  _Article III_.

 



 

(e) Any  portion of the  property deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant
to _Section 3.1_ that  remains unclaimed by the shareholders of the Company
for six (6) months after  the Effective Time shall be paid, at the request of
Parent, to or as directed  by  Parent. Any shareholders of the Company who
have not theretofore  complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look
only to Parent for  payment of the Merger Consideration and unpaid dividends
and distributions  on  the Parent Common Shares deliverable in respect of
each share of Company Common  Stock held by such shareholder at the Effective
Time as determined pursuant  to  this Agreement, in each case, without any
interest  thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein,  none of Parent, the Company, the Exchange Agent or any other person
shall be  liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for
any amount  properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned  property, escheat or similar Laws.

 



 

(f) In  the event any  Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an  affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost,  stolen or destroyed and, if required
by Parent, the posting by such person  of a  bond in such amount as Parent
or one of its Subsidiaries may determine is  reasonably necessary as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against  it  with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange  for  such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable  in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

        

ARTICLE  IV

    
--- 
    

 

        

REPRESENTATIONS  AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

    
--- 
    

 

 

Except  (i) as disclosed in, and reasonably apparent from, any of the Company
Reports  filed with the SEC on or after January 1, 2007 but prior to the date
of this  Agreement (excluding any disclosures set forth in any risk factor
section and  in  any section relating to forward-looking statements to the
extent they are  cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature); or
(ii) as disclosed  in  the like-numbered section of the disclosure schedule
delivered by the Company  to  Parent contemporaneously with the execution of
this Agreement (the " _Company  Disclosure Schedule_ ", it being agreed that,
except as otherwise provided in  the Company Disclosure Schedule, disclosure
of any item in any section of the  Company Disclosure Schedule shall also be
deemed disclosure with respect to  any  other section of this Agreement to
which the relevance of such item is  reasonably apparent), the Company
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger  Sub as follows:

 

 

4.1. _Corporate  Organization_. (a) The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly  existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of New  Jersey. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority 
to own, lease or operate all of its properties, rights and assets and to
carry  on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or
qualified  to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business  conducted by it or the character or location of the properties,
rights and  assets owned, leased or operated by it makes such licensing or
qualification  necessary, except where the failure to have such power or
authority or to be  so  licensed or qualified would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually  or  in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect (as defined below) on the  Company. As used in this Agreement, the
term " _Material Adverse  Effect_ " means, with respect to the Company,
Parent

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  7  -  

 

 

 

 

 


 

or  the Surviving Company, as the case may be, any fact, circumstance,
event,  change, effect or occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate
with all  other facts, circumstances, events, changes, effects, or
occurrences, (x) has  a  material adverse effect on the business, results of
operations or financial  condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole or (y) that  prevents or materially impairs such party's ability
to consummate the Merger on  a timely basis; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
determining whether a  Material Adverse Effect has occurred pursuant to
clause (x) above, there shall  be excluded any effect to the extent resulting
from (i) changes after the date  of this Agreement in laws, rules or
regulations of general applicability or  published interpretations thereof by
courts or governmental authorities or  in  U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (" _U.S. GAAP_ ") (or in the  case of Parent or any
other party to this Agreement (or their respective  assignees) that is a
Canadian entity, Canadian generally accepted accounting  principles ("
_Canadian GAAP_ ")) or regulatory accounting requirements, in  any such case
applicable to banks or their holding companies generally, (ii)  the 
announcement of this Agreement or any action of any party to this Agreement 
or  any of its Subsidiaries required to be taken by it under this Agreement 
(including any actions taken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as 
required by _Section 7.16_ ), (iii) changes or events after the date of this 
Agreement in general economic, business or financial conditions affecting
banks  or their holding companies generally, including changes in prevailing
interest  rates and currency exchange rates, _provided_ , that the effect of
such  changes described in this clause (iii) (including changes in interest
rates)  shall not be excluded to the extent of the disproportionate impact,
if any,  they  have on such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole
(relative to other  banks or their holding companies), and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that a  decrease in the trading or market prices of a party's
capital stock shall not be  considered, by itself, to constitute a Material
Adverse Effect, and (iv) the  engagement by the United States or Canada in
hostilities, whether or not  pursuant to the declaration of a national
emergency or war, or the occurrence  of  any military or terrorist attack
upon or within the United States or  Canada. The Company is a bank holding
company duly registered under  the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as
amended (" _BHC Act_ "). The  certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the

imposition of a condition or restriction  of the type referred to in _Section
8.2(c)_.

in  nature); or (ii) as disclosed in the like-numbered section of the
disclosure  schedule delivered by Parent to the Company contemporaneously
with the execution  of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ ",
it being agreed  that, except as otherwise provided in the Parent Disclosure

jurisdiction in which the nature of the business  conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties, rights and  assets owned, leased or
operated by it makes such licensing or qualification  necessary, except where
the failure to have such power or authority or to be  so  licensed or
qualified would not reasonably be expected to have, individually  or  in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. The charter of  Parent is the

the issued and outstanding Parent Common  Shares have been duly authorized
and validly issued and are fully paid,  nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights, with no personal liability  attaching to the ownership thereof. As of
the date of this Agreement, except  as  otherwise set forth in this Section

enter into any such subscription, option,  warrant, call, convertible
securities, stock-based performance units or other  similar right, agreement,

issued pursuant to the  Merger have been duly authorized and, at the
Effective Time, all such shares  will be validly issued, fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights,  with no personal liability
attaching to the ownership thereof.

in light of the circumstances under which

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  30  -  

 

 

 

 

 


 

they  were made, not misleading. There are no outstanding comments from or

and shall not directly or  indirectly withdraw, amend or modify in any manner
adverse to Parent such  recommendation (a " _Change in Company
Recommendation_ "), except as and to  the extent expressly permitted by
_Section 7.3(b)_. Notwithstanding any  Change in Company Recommendation, this
Agreement shall be submitted to the  shareholders of the Company at the
Company Shareholders Meeting for the purpose  of approving this Agreement and
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to  relieve the Company of such
obligation. In addition to the foregoing,  the Company shall not submit to
the vote of its shareholders any Acquisition  Proposal other than the Merger.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  the  foregoing, prior to the date of the Company
Shareholders Meeting, the Company  and its board of directors shall be
permitted to effect a Change in Company  Recommendation if and only to the
extent that:

 

 

(i) it  has  complied in all material respects with _Section 7.4_ ,

 

 

(ii) its  board of  directors, based on the advice of its outside counsel,
determines in good faith  that failure to take such action is reasonably
likely to result in a violation  of its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, and

 

 

(iii) if  the  Company's board of directors intends to effect a Change in
Company  Recommendation in relation to an Acquisition Proposal, (A) the
Company's board  of directors has concluded in good faith that such
Acquisition Proposal  constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to
all of the adjustments  which may be offered by Parent pursuant to clause (C)
below, (B) the Company  has  notified Parent, at least five (5) Business
Days in advance, of its intention  to  effect a Change in Company


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  41  -  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Recommendation  (the " _Notice Period_ "), specifying the material terms and
conditions of  any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the
party making such  Superior Proposal) and furnishing to Parent a copy of the
relevant proposed  transaction agreements with the party making such Superior
Proposal and other  material documents and (C) during the Notice Period, and
in any event, prior  to  effecting such a Change in Company Recommendation,
the Company has negotiated,  and has caused its financial and legal advisors
to negotiate, with Parent in  good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments  in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal  ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal.

 



 

7.4. _Acquisition  Proposals_. (a) Except to the extent expressly permitted
by _Section  7.17_ , from the date hereof until the Effective Time or, if
earlier, the date  on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
_Article IX_ , the  Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
its and its  Subsidiaries' respective officers, directors, employees, agents
and  representatives (including any investment bankers, attorneys or
accountants  retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) (" _Representatives_
") not to,  directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, encourage or
knowingly facilitate  (including by way of providing confidential
information) the submission of  any  inquiries, proposals or offers (whether
firm or hypothetical) or any other  efforts or attempts that constitute or
may reasonably be expected to lead to,  any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) have
any discussions with or provide any  confidential information or data to any
person relating to an Acquisition  Proposal, or engage in any negotiations
concerning an Acquisition Proposal,  (iii) approve or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) approve or  recommend, or propose publicly to
approve or recommend, or execute or enter  into, any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding,  merger agreement, asset
or share purchase or share exchange agreement, option  agreement or other
similar agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that it is understood and agreed that any  Change in Company
Recommendation permitted under _Section 7.3(b)_ shall in  and of itself not
be deemed to be a breach or violation of this _Section  7.4(a)_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section  7.4(a)_ , in the
event that the Company receives an unsolicited _bona fide _ Acquisition
Proposal and the Company's board of directors concludes in good  faith that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to  result in a
Superior Proposal, the Company may, and may permit its Subsidiaries  and its
and their Representatives to, prior to (but not after) the date of  the 
Company Shareholders Meeting, take any action described in clause (ii) above 
to  the extent that the Company's board of directors concludes in good faith
(after  receiving the advice of its outside counsel) that failure to take
such actions  would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties  under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior
to providing  (or causing to be provided) any confidential information or
data permitted  to be  provided pursuant to this sentence, the Company shall
have entered into a  written confidentiality agreement with such third party
on terms no less  favorable to the Company than the Company Confidentiality
Agreement and the  Company shall promptly provide to Parent an executed copy
of such  confidentiality agreement; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Company  shall promptly provide Parent with any non-public information
concerning the  Company or its Subsidiaries provided to such person which was
not previously  provided or made available to Parent (or its
Representatives).

 



 

(b) For  purposes of this  Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any
inquiry, proposal or offer  from any person (other than Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries)  relating


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  42  -  

 

 

 

 

 


 

to  any direct or indirect (i) acquisition, purchase or sale of a business,
deposits  or assets that constitute 20% or more of the consolidated business,
revenues,  net income, assets (including stock of the Company's Subsidiaries)
or deposits  of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) merger,
reorganization, share  exchange, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation,  dissolution or similar transaction involving
the Company or any of its  Significant Subsidiaries, or (iii) purchase or
sale of, or tender or exchange  offer (including a self-tender offer) for,
securities of the Company or any  of  its Significant Subsidiaries that, if
consummated, would result in any person  (or the shareholders of such person)
beneficially owning securities representing  20% or more of the equity or
total voting power of the Company, any of its  Significant Subsidiaries or
the surviving parent entity in such  transaction.

 



 

(c) For  purposes  of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a _bona
fide_ written  Acquisition Proposal to acquire, directly or indirectly, a
majority of the  total  voting power of the Company (or a majority of the
total voting power of the  resulting or surviving entity of such transaction
or the ultimate parent of  such  resulting or surviving entity), which the
board of directors of the Company  concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and  receiving the advice of its
outside counsel, taking into account timing and  all  legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person  making the
proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement  provisions and
conditions to consummation), (i) is more favorable to the  shareholders of
the Company from a financial point of view than the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) is reasonably capable of being
completed  on the terms proposed.

 



 

(d) The  Company  will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions  or  negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any persons other  than Parent with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal and will use its reasonable  best efforts to enforce, and not waive
or amend any provision of, any  confidentiality, standstill or similar
agreement relating to an Acquisition  Proposal, including by requiring the
other parties thereto to promptly return  or  destroy any confidential
information previously furnished by or on behalf of  the  Company
thereunder. The Company will promptly (and in all events  within 48 hours)
following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry  which could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal advise  Parent of
the material terms thereof (including the identity of the person  making such
Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Parent reasonably apprised  of  any
related developments, discussions and negotiations and the status and terms 
thereof (including providing Parent with a copy of all material
documentation  and correspondence relating thereto) on a current basis.
Without limiting the  foregoing, the Company shall notify Parent orally and
in writing within 48  hours  after it enters into discussions or
negotiations with another person regarding  an Acquisition Proposal, executes
and delivers a confidentiality agreement  with  another person in connection
with an Acquisition Proposal, or provides  non-public information or data to
another person in connection with an  Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(e) Nothing  contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its
board of directors  from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a)(2)-(3)
promulgated under the  Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ , that such  Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect
that any action pursuant  to  such Rules would otherwise have under this
Agreement.

7.5. _Reasonable  Best Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement,  each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their
respective  Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (i) to take,
or cause to  be  taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply
promptly with all  legal requirements which may be imposed on such party or
its Subsidiaries with  respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions
set forth in _Article  VIII_ hereof, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement  and (ii) to obtain (and to cooperate with the
other party to obtain) any  consent, authorization, order or approval of, or
any exemption by, any  Governmental Entity and any other third party which is
required to be obtained  by the Company or Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection  with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no party shall
be required to take any  action pursuant to the foregoing sentence if the
taking of such action or the  obtaining of such consents, authorizations,
orders, approvals or exemptions  is  reasonably likely to result in a
condition or restriction having an effect  of  the type referred to in
_Section 8.2(c)_.

 

 

(b) Subject  to  the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the
proviso in _Section  7.5(a)_ ), each of Parent and the Company agrees to use
reasonable best  efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to
do, or cause to  be  done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make  effective, as soon as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, the  transactions contemplated hereby, including using reasonable
best efforts to  (i)  modify or amend any contracts, plans or arrangements
to which Parent or the  Company is a party (to the extent permitted by the
terms thereof) if necessary  in order to satisfy the conditions to closing
set forth in _Article VIII _ hereof, (ii) lift or rescind any injunction or
restraining order or  other  order adversely affecting the ability of the
parties to consummate the  transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) defend
any litigation or other  proceeding seeking to enjoin, prevent or delay the
consummation of the  transactions contemplated hereby or seeking material
damages.

 



 

7.6. _Affiliates_.  The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause each director,  executive officer and other person who is an
"affiliate" (for purposes of Rule  145 under the Securities Act) of the
Company to deliver to Parent, as soon  as  practicable after the date of
this Agreement, and in any event prior to the  date  of the Company
Shareholders Meeting, a written agreement substantially in the  form attached
as _Exhibit A_ hereto.

 

 

7.7. _Employees;  Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

 

(a) As  of the  Effective Time, the Company Employees who are employees of
the Company or a  Subsidiary of the Company at the Effective Time shall,
unless and until such  Company Employees become eligible to participate in
the employee benefit plans  sponsored or maintained by TD Banknorth Inc.
(excluding equity-based plans  and  defined benefit pension plans) (the "
_TD Banknorth Plans_ ") in which  similarly situated employees of TD
Banknorth Inc. participate, to the same  extent as similarly situated
employees of TD Banknorth Inc. so participate  (it  being understood that
inclusion of Company Employees in such employee benefit  plans may occur at
different times with respect to different plans), continue  to  participate
in the Plans (excluding the Company Stock Incentive Plans (other  than with
respect to Parent Options), the DRIP and Purchase Plan and the  Employee
Stock Ownership Plan feature of the Company's 401(k) Plan);  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) nothing contained herein shall require  Parent or any of


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  44  -  

 

 

 

 

 


 

its  Subsidiaries to make any grants to any Company Employee under any
equity-based  plans, it being understood that any such grants are completely
discretionary,  (ii) nothing contained herein shall require Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries  to  permit a Company Employee who is receiving severance
as a result of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or together
with any other action)  pursuant to any employment, severance, change-in-
control, consulting or other  compensation agreements, plans and arrangements
with the Company or any of  its  Subsidiaries to participate in any
severance or change-in-control agreement  or  plan offered by Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, (iii) nothing contained  herein shall require a Company
Employee's participation in Parent's or any of  its Subsidiaries' defined
benefit pension plan and (iv) until December 31, 2008,  the employee benefit
plans made available to the Company Employees shall be  no  less favorable
in the aggregate than the employee benefit plans (excluding  equity-based
plans, defined benefit pension plans and severance policies and  practices)
provided to the Company Employees on the date of this  Agreement. From and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the  Company and its
Subsidiaries, and any successors thereto, to honor, without  modification,
all employment, retention, severance and change-in-control  contracts,
agreements and arrangements, as amended through the date hereof,  listed in
Section 4.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Employment 
Agreements_ "). As of the Effective Time, employees of the Company and its 
Subsidiaries who are not otherwise parties to the Employment Agreements 
(excluding any Employment Agreements that do not provide for severance or 
similar termination pay) shall be covered by and eligible to participate in 
that  certain severance plan attached to this Agreement in Section 7.7(a)-1
of the  Parent Disclosure Schedule (the " _Severance Plan_ "), which (x)
shall take  into account all service with the Company or any Subsidiary (or
any of their  respective predecessors) as provided for therein and (y) shall
be caused by  Parent to be maintained for at least two years following the
Closing  Date. In addition, effective as of the Effective Time, with
respect  to Eligible Employees (as such term is defined in the Severance
Plan) who are  employed by the Company or a Subsidiary (" _Company Eligible
Employees_ "):  (A) the schedule of Severance Benefits (as such term is
defined in the Severance  Plan) that shall be provided to such employees who
become Displaced Employees  (as such term is defined in the Severance Plan)
shall be as set forth in Section  7.7(a)-2 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule
and (B) the chief financial officer  of the Company shall be consulted by the
Plan Administrator (as such term is  defined in the Severance Plan), and
shall participate in an advisory capacity,  with respect to all decisions of
the Plan Administrator regarding any Company  Eligible Employee or Displaced
Employee, as applicable.

 



 

(b) With  respect  to each TD Banknorth Plan, for purposes of determining
eligibility to  participate, vesting, entitlement to benefits (including
determination of the  amount of any benefit that is affected by seniority)
and vacation entitlement  (but not for accrual of benefits under any defined
benefit pension plan or  post-retirement welfare benefit plan of Parent),
service with the Company or  any  Subsidiary (or of their respective
predecessors) shall be treated as service  with Parent to the extent
recognized by the Company prior to the date of this  Agreement under
comparable Plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that such  service shall not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result  in a duplication
of benefits. Such service also shall apply for  purposes of satisfying any
waiting periods, evidence of insurability  requirements, or the application
of any pre-existing condition limitations  with  respect to any TD Banknorth
Plan. Each TD Banknorth Plan shall waive  pre-existing condition limitations
to the same extent waived under the  applicable Plan. The Company Employees
shall be given credit for amounts paid  under a corresponding benefit plan of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries  during the


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  45  -  

 

 

 

 

 


 

same  period for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-
pocket  maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the
terms  and  conditions of the TD Banknorth Plan during the applicable plan 
year.

 



 

(c) With  respect  to the Company's 2008 calendar year, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Company to  provide that each Company Employee will participate
during such year in either  (i) the TD Banknorth Plans providing an annual
cash bonus payable in respect  of  such year or (ii) the Plans that are
annual cash incentive  plans; provided, however, that in all events, Parent
shall cause the  Surviving Company to pay bonuses thereunder in respect of
such 2008 calendar  year to the Company Employees as follows: (i) for Company
Employees who are  parties to an Employment Agreement that contains a target
annual bonus amount  (the "Target Bonus"), they shall receive payment of an
amount equal to at least  the pro rata portion of such Target Bonus in
respect of the period from January  1, 2008 through the Closing Date and (ii)
for Company Employees who are not  parties to Employment Agreements
containing a target annual bonus amount, they  shall receive payment of an
amount equal to at least the pro rata portion of  the  actual annual bonus
received by each such Company Employee payable in respect  of  calendar year
2007 in respect of the period from January 1, 2008 through the  Closing Date;
which payment Parent shall cause to be made no later than the  date  that
annual bonuses are otherwise payable pursuant to the Plans and/or  Employment
Agreements in respect of calendar year 2008. In addition, with  respect to
the Company's 2007 calendar year, Parent shall make grants to Company 
Employees of equity-based awards on Parent Common Shares equal in the
aggregate  to up to $30 million in value of equity-based awards granted with
respect to  Company Common Stock to Company Employees, based on a Black-
Scholes or  equivalent equity compensation calculation methodology (the "
_Equity Pool  Amount_ "); provided, however, that the amount of the Equity
Pool Amount shall  be reduced by the value (as determined consistent with the
calculation of the  Equity Pool Amount) of the aggregate amount of equity-
based awards granted  on  Company Common Stock to Company Employees employed
by CBIS in calendar year  2007, if CBIS is sold prior to Parent making such
grants. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, in the event that there occurs a sale
of CBIS (x) prior to the  payment of any annual bonus payment in respect of
the 2007 calendar year under  any Plan, any Company Employees employed by
CBIS who were eligible to receive  such a bonus shall nevertheless receive
such bonus payments on the date that  such bonuses are otherwise payable to
Company Employees; and/or (y) prior to  the  Closing Date, any Company
Employees employed by CBIS who would have been  eligible to receive an annual
bonus payment in respect of the 2008 calendar  year  under any Plan shall
nevertheless receive a bonus payment calculated and payable  in the same
manner described above for Company Employees employed with the  Company or
its Subsidiaries, prorated for the period from January 1, 2008  through the
date of closing of the sale of CBIS.

 



 

(d) The  Company  and Parent agree that the Company Retirement Plan for
Outside Directors, as  the  same is set forth in Section 7.7(d) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, is  and  shall be the sole plan providing for
retirement benefits to nonemployee members  of the board of directors of the
Company.

 



 

(e) The  Company  and Parent acknowledge and agree that all provisions
contained in this  _Section 7.7_ and _Section 2.4_ with respect to employees,
officers,  directors, consultants and independent contractors are included
for the sole  benefit of the Company and


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  46  -  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

Parent  and shall not create any right (i) in any other person, including
Plans or  any  beneficiary thereof or (ii) to continued employment with
Parent or any of its  Affiliates.

 

 

7.8. _Indemnification;  Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_. Subject to the
limitations set forth in  Section 7.8(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule:

 

 

(a) From  and  after the Effective Time, in the event of any claim, action,
suit, proceeding  or  investigation, whether civil, criminal or
administrative, in which any person  who as of the date of this Agreement is,
or who becomes prior to the Effective  Time, a director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the  " _Indemnified Parties_ ") is, or is
threatened to be, made a party based in  whole or in part on, or arising in
whole or in part out of, or pertaining to  (i)  the fact that he or she is
or was a director or officer of the Company, any  of  its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective predecessors or was prior to the  Effective Time
serving at the request of any such party as a director, officer,  employee,
trustee or partner of another corporation, partnership, trust, joint 
venture, employee benefit plan or other entity or (ii) this Agreement, or
any  of  the transactions contemplated hereby and all actions taken by an
Indemnified  Party in connection herewith, in each case in his or her
capacity as a director  or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether in any case  asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause  the  Surviving Company to indemnify and hold harmless,
to the fullest extent  permitted by applicable Law, each such Indemnified
Party against any losses,  claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any claim, suit,  proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Party upon receipt of an  undertaking required by the NJBCA from
such Indemnified Party to repay such  advanced expenses if it is determined
by a final and non­appealable judgment  of a court of competent jurisdiction
that such Indemnified Party was not  entitled to indemnification hereunder),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in  settlement in connection with any such
actual or threatened claim, action,  suit,  proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or  investigative. Any Indemnified
Party wishing to claim indemnification  under this _Section 7.8_ , upon
learning of any such claim, action, suit,  proceeding or investigation, shall
promptly notify Parent in writing thereof,  _provided_ , that the failure to
so notify shall not affect the obligations  of Parent under this _Section
7.8_ except (and only) to the extent such  failure to notify materially
prejudices Parent.

 



 

(b) Parent  and  Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement  of expenses for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time,  whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective Time, existing  as of the date of this Agreement in
favor of the current directors or officers  of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates  of incorporation
or by-laws or other organization documents or in any valid  and  binding
agreement to which the Company or any such Subsidiary is a party shall 
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect and Parent
shall  cause the Surviving Company to honor such obligations.

 



 

(c) For  a period  of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the persons  serving as officers and directors of the Company
immediately prior to the  Effective Time (and, to the extent reasonably
practicable, persons serving  as  officers and directors of the Company as
of the date of this Agreement who  cease  to serve in such capacity prior to
the Effective Time) to be covered by the  directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy or policies


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  47  -  

 

 

 

 

 


 

maintained  by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries ( _provided_ , that Parent's
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy or policies provide at
least the same  coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which
are, in the  aggregate, not materially less advantageous to such directors
and officers  of  the Company than the terms and conditions of the existing
directors' and  officers' liability insurance policy of the Company) with
respect to claims  arising from facts or events that existed or occurred at
or prior to the  Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
will  Parent be required to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess
of 250%  of  the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such
insurance (the " _Insurance Amount_ "), and if Parent is unable to maintain
or obtain the  insurance called for by this _Section 7.8(c)_ for an amount
per year equal  to or less than the Insurance Amount, Parent shall use its
reasonable best  efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as may be
available for the  Insurance Amount. The provisions of this _Section 7.8(c)_
shall be deemed  to have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been
obtained by Parent or  by  the Company with Parent's consent, which policies
provide the persons covered by  the Company's directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy immediately  prior to the Effective Time with
coverage for a period of not less than six  (6)  years after the Effective
Time with respect to claims arising from facts or  events that occurred at or
prior to the Effective Time. If such  prepaid policies have been obtained by
the Company prior to the Effective Time  with Parent's consent, Parent shall
maintain such policies in full force and  effect and continue to honor all
obligations thereunder.

 



 

(d) In  the event  Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns  (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the  continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger  or  (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any  person, then, and in either such case, to the
extent not otherwise occurring  by  operation of Law, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and  assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Company, as the case may be, shall assume  the  obligations set forth in
this _Section 7.8_. The agreements and covenants  contained herein shall not
be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to  which any Indemnified Party
is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract  or  otherwise.

 



 

(e) The  provisions of this _Section 7.8_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and  shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs
and  representatives, and shall survive consummation of the Merger.

 



 

7.9. _Advice  of  Changes_. Parent and the Company shall promptly advise the
other of any  change or event which, individually or in the aggregate with
other such changes  or events, has or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect  on it or which it believes would or would be
reasonably likely to cause or  constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties or  covenants contained herein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any  noncompliance with the foregoing shall not constitute
the failure to be  satisfied of a condition set forth in _Article VIII_ or
give rise to any  right of termination under _Article IX_ unless the
underlying breach shall  independently constitute such a failure or give rise
to such a  right.

 

 

7.10. _Financial  Statements and Other Current Information_. As soon as
reasonably practicable  after they become available, but in no event more
than 30 days after the end  of  each calendar month ending after the date of
this Agreement, the Company shall  furnish to Parent (a) consolidated and
consolidating financial statements  (including balance sheets, statements of

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  48  -  

 

 

 

 

 


 

operations  and shareholders' equity) of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries as of and  for such month then ended, (b) internal management
financial control reports  showing actual financial performance against plan
and previous period, (c)  monthly lending/asset quality and risk profile
reports, (d) all internal or  external audit reports and all internal
compliance reviews and (e) any reports  provided to senior management or the
board of directors of the Company or any  committee thereof relating to the
financial performance and risk management  of  the Company. The Company will
furnish to Parent the Company's  quarterly analysis of allowances for loans
and lease losses and a quarterly  summary of all Loan reviews as soon as they
become available. In addition,  the  Company shall furnish Parent, unless
prohibited by applicable Law, with a copy  of each report filed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with a  Governmental Entity promptly
following the filing thereof. As soon as  reasonably practicable after it
becomes available, but in no event more than  30  days after the end of each
calendar month ending after the date of this  Agreement, Parent shall furnish
to the Company the presentation with respect  to  monthly financial results
of Parent customarily provided by the Chief Financial  Officer of the Company
to the Senior Executive Team of Parent. All  information furnished by the
Company to Parent, or by Parent to the Company,  pursuant to this _Section
7.10_ shall be held in confidence to the same  extent of Parent's and the
Company's respective obligations under _Section  7.2(c)_.

 

 

7.11. _Stock  Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the  Parent Common Shares to be issued in the Merger and to be
reserved for issuance  upon exercise of the Parent Options issued in
substitution for Company Options  pursuant to _Section 2.4_ to be approved
for listing on the Toronto Stock  Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange,
subject to official notice of  issuance, as promptly as practicable, and in
any event prior to the Effective  Time.

 

 

7.12. _Takeover  Laws_. The parties hereto and their respective boards of
directors shall (i)  use reasonable best efforts to ensure that no state
takeover Law or similar  Law  is or becomes applicable to this Agreement,
the Merger or any of the other  transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (ii) if any state takeover  Law  or similar Law becomes applicable to
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the  other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, use reasonable best efforts  to ensure that the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this  Agreement may be consummated as

agree that  irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this

unenforceable in any  jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be

rendering invalid, illegal or  unenforceable the remaining terms and
provisions of this Agreement or affecting  the validity, legality or
enforceability of any of the terms or provisions  of  this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction, and if any provision of this Agreement  is determined to
be so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be  interpreted to be
only so broad as is enforceable, in all cases so long as  neither the
economic nor legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby  is
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party or its  shareholders.
Upon any such determination, the parties shall  negotiate in good faith in an
effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable  substitute provision to effect
the original intent of the parties.

 

 

10.12. _Publicity_.  Parent and the Company shall consult with each other
before issuing any press  release with respect to this Agreement, the Merger
or the other transactions  contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such
press release or make any  such  public

statement  without the prior consent of the other party, which shall not be
unreasonably  withheld; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without
the prior  consent of the other party (but after prior consultation, to the
extent  practicable in the circumstances) issue such press release or make
such public  statement as may be required by Law or the rules and regulations
of the New  York  Stock Exchange, or in the case of Parent, the Toronto
Stock  Exchange. Without limiting the reach of the preceding sentence, 
Parent and the Company shall cooperate to develop all public announcement 
materials and make appropriate management available at presentations related 
to  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as reasonably requested
by  the  other party. In addition, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall 
consult with Parent regarding communications with customers, stockholders, 
prospective investors and employees related to the transactions contemplated 
hereby.

 

 

10.13. _Assignment;  Third  Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests  or obligations of any party hereunder shall be
assigned by any of the parties  hereto (whether by operation of law or
otherwise) without the prior written  consent of the other party, except that
each of Parent and Merger Sub may assign  all or any of its rights and
obligations hereunder to any wholly-owned  subsidiary of Parent or Merger
Sub; _provided_ , that no such assignment  shall change the amount or nature
of the Merger Consideration, relieve the  assigning party of its obligations
hereunder if such assignee does not perform  such obligations or materially
impede or delay consummation of the  Merger. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be  binding upon, inure to the benefit of and
be enforceable by the parties and  their respective successors and permitted
assigns. Except as  otherwise specifically provided in _Section 7.8_ hereof,
this Agreement  (including the documents and instruments referred to herein)
is not intended  to  confer upon any person other than the parties hereto
any rights or remedies  hereunder.

 

 

10.14. _Construction_.  This Agreement and any documents or instruments
delivered pursuant hereto or  in  connection herewith shall be construed
without regard to the identity of the  person who drafted the various
provisions of the same. Each and every  provision of this Agreement and such
other documents and instruments shall  be  construed as though all of the
parties participated equally in the drafting  of  the same. Consequently,
the parties acknowledge and agree that any  rule of construction that a
document is to be construed against the drafting  party shall not be
applicable either to this Agreement or such other documents  and instruments.

The  Toronto-Dominion Bank

 

Toronto-Dominion  Tower

 

66  Wellington Street West

 

Toronto,  Ontario M5K IA2, Canada

 

 

Ladies  and Gentlemen:

 

 

I  have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be
an "affiliate" of Commerce Bancorp, Inc., a New Jersey corporation (the "
_Company_ "), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs 
(c) and (d) of Rule 145 (" _Rule 145_ ") of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended 
(including the rules and regulations thereunder, the " _Act_ "). I have been 
further advised that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of
Merger,  dated October 2, 2007 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by and between
the  Company, The Toronto-Dominion Bank, a Canadian chartered bank ("
_Parent_ ")  and Cardinal Merger Co., a New Jersey corporation (" _Merger
Sub_ "), Merger  Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_
"), and each  share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the
Company (" _Company  Common Stock_ ") shall be converted into the right to
receive common shares,  no par value per share, of Parent (" _Parent Common
Shares_ "), and cash as  provided in the Merger Agreement. I further
understand that I may  receive Parent Common Shares as a result of the
exercise of Company Options  or  other similar rights. All capitalized terms
used in this letter but  not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed
thereto in the Merger  Agreement.

 

 

I  hereby represent, warrant and covenant to Parent that with respect to in
the  event I receive any Parent Common Shares as a result of the Merger:

 

 

1. The  Parent Common Shares to be received by me as a result of the Merger or any  securities which may be paid as a dividend or otherwise distributed thereon  or  with respect thereto or issued or delivered in exchange or substitution  therefor, or any Company Option, right or other interest (all such shares and  securities being referred to herein as " _Restricted Securities_ ") will be  taken for my own account, and not for others, directly or indirectly, in whole  or in part, and I will not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of  Restricted Securities in violation of the Act.

 



 

2. I  have carefully read this letter and discussed its requirements and other  applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose  of  Restricted Securities to the extent I believed necessary with my counsel or  counsel for the Company.

 



 

3. I  have been advised that the issuance of Parent Common Shares to me pursuant  to  the Merger will be registered with the SEC under the Act. However, I  have also been advised that, since at the time the Merger will be submitted  for  a vote of the shareholders of the Company I may be deemed to have been an  affiliate of the Company and the distribution by me of Restricted Securities  has  not been registered under the Act, I may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose  of Restricted Securities issued to me as a result of the Merger unless (i)  such

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

sale,  transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act, (ii)
such  sale,  transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the
volume and other  limitations of Rule 145, or (iii) in the opinion of counsel
in form  and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, such sale, transfer
or other  disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act.

 



 

4. I  understand that Parent is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer  or  other disposition of Restricted Securities by me or on my behalf under the  Act  or to take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an  exemption from such registration available.

 



 

5. I  also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to Parent's  transfer agent with respect to Restricted Securities and that there will be  placed on the certificates for Restricted Securities issued to me, or securities  issued in substitution therefor, a legend stating in substance:

 



 

**" The  shares represented by this certificate (a) were issued in a
transaction to  which  Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, applies and (b) may  not  be sold, transferred or otherwise
disposed of except or unless (1) covered  by an  effective registration
statement under such Act, (2) in conformity with the  volume and other
limitations of Rule 145 under such Act, or (3) in accordance  with a legal
opinion in form and substance reasonably acceptable to The  Toronto-Dominion
Bank that such sale or transfer is otherwise exempt from the  registration
requirements of such Act."**

 

 

6.   I understand and agree that, unless the transfer by me of my Restricted  Securities has been registered under the Act or is a sale made in conformity  with the provisions of Rule 145, Parent reserves the right, in its sole  discretion, to put the following legend on the certificates issued to my  transferee:

 

 

**" The  shares represented by this certificate have not been registered
under the  Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who
received such shares  in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under
the Securities Act of  1933  applies. The shares have been acquired by the
holder not with a view to, or  for  resale in connection with, any
distribution thereof within the meaning of the  Securities Act of 1933 and
may not be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise  transferred except in
accordance with an exemption from the registration  requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933."**

 

 

7. I  understand and agree that the legends set forth in paragraphs (5) and (6) above  shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend,  and/or the issuance of a letter to Parent's transfer agent removing such stop  transfer instructions, and the above restrictions on sale will cease to apply  (A) upon my request, if one year (or such other period as may be required by  Rule 145(d)(2) under the Act or any successor thereto) shall have  elapsed


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

from  the Closing Date and the other conditions of such Rule are fulfilled to
the  reasonable satisfaction of Parent; (B) upon my request, if two years (or
such  other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(3) under the Act or any
successor  thereto) shall have elapsed from the Effective Date and the other
conditions  of  such Rule are fulfilled to the reasonable satisfaction of
Parent; or (C) I  have  delivered to Parent (i) a copy of a letter from the
staff of the SEC, an opinion  of counsel in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, or other  evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent
to the effect that such legend and/or  stop transfer instructions are not
required for purposes of the Act or (ii)  evidence or representations
reasonably satisfactory to Parent that the  securities represented by such
certificates are being or have been transferred  in a transaction made in
conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 or pursuant  to an effective
registration under the Act.

 



 

8. By  executing this letter, without limiting or abrogating the agreements that I  have  made as set forth above, I am not admitting that I am an "affiliate" of the  Company as described in the first paragraph of this letter or waiving any rights  I may have to object to any claim that I am such an "affiliate" on or after the  date of this letter.

 



 

9. I  understand and agree that the foregoing provisions also apply to (i) my  spouse,

 

(ii)  any relative of mine or my spouse occupying my home, (iii) any trust or
estate  in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10%
beneficial interest  or of which any of us serves as trustee, executor or in
any similar capacity,  and (iv) any corporate or other organization in which
I, my spouse or any such  relative owns at least 10% of any class of equity
securities or of the equity  interest (the " _Affiliated Persons_ "). I will
cause the Affiliated Persons  to comply with the terms of this Letter
Agreement as if a party  hereto.

 

 

10. This  Letter Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect if the  Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.

 

 

11. This  Letter Agreement shall be governed by the Laws of the State of New  York.
